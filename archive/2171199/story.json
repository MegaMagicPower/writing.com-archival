            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><br>\r\nIt was a sunny and warm day as Penny was driving her red smart toward Buttercombe, where she would've soon began her career as a teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was only 22 years old, fresh from college, but had already landed a job on one of the most prestigious schools in America, and she was well aware and proud of that. She had always studied hard at school, and graduated at record time. Finally, all these years of work paid off. <br>\r\nWell, mostly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, getting a job at Buttercombe is already a big priviledge, but Penny Price was not the kind of person who would've been satisfied by just that. To her it was simply a step toward her neverending ambitions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, that was a very important step for Penny's career, and she was celebrating gleefully whistling a melody as she was hearing \"sweet home Alabama\", one of her favourite songs, on the radio.<br>\r\nShe was wearing a bright yellow sweater, on of her favourite in her wide collection, and thoght it was appropriate to wear in her first day at that hive-themed school. Her long blonde hair were tied into a ponytail that felt behind her back like a golden waterfall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter more than half an hour since she had been travelling across the same secluded road on the mountains, Penny wondered why would a school so far away from every city, aside of that small dusty town. Shouldn't a school be more connected with the outside world?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, it didn't take much longer to finally see the six-stories building, it was definetely big enough for Penny's ambitions. Her meaty pink lips twisted into a satisfied grin at the thought of working there. <br>\r\nShe stopped at the gate, and immediately a voice from a box asked: \"name, please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny was caught by surprise and replied awkwardly: \"Penny Price. I'm the new economics and government teacher\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gate opened and she drove through the school's front yard, and parked her smart in the teachers' parking area. Every parking lot had a pole with a name, and the blonde immediately found the new silver plate on which it was written: Penny Price.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were still no students, as she came very early so she could have the time to get used to the school without any brat annoying her; the empty school looked like a ghost building, albeit there were clearly some renewed parts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went to the secretary that gave her the ID card and the direction for her cabin. Penny looked satisfied at that, although she didn't like the serious expression she had in the photo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't forget, the appointment is at 13 pm\" repeated the secretary as the new teacher left for her cabin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny gave a nod to tell her that sue got it, and brought her cases upstair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith enthusiasm, she discovered it was basically a full apartment, complete with entrance hall, kitchen and living room. In her bedroom there was a king sized bed that Penny couldn't wait to try; she unpacked her cases (the guardrobe was so large she could fit only half of it, and the blonde found an entire compartment where she put her sweaters collection) and jumped on the soft matress.<br>\r\nThe young woman grew up in a relatively poor family, and had never rested on anything such comfortable before. Actually, all the dorm was incredible for her as she explored them like a kid in a theme park. The bathroom had any kind of advanced comfort, including a bathub large enough to wash a baby hyppo and sweet towels. A living room with a desk for her job as teacher, a comfortable couch in front of a maxi-television and a kitchen with a hot plate of ultimate generation and a fridge so large it looked like it was made for an entire squad, and it was already provided with different snacks and packages of a brand she dind't recognize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny liked her cabin so much she took a selfie while standing in the living room and sent it to her old college friends, hoping they would burn with envy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she lied on the couch, and only then noticed there was a strawberry cheesecake and a small paper that said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For Penny Price, I am happy to welcome you in our big family as a brand new teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Mrs. Polluck\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde woman was so flattered she could not resist and took a slice of the welcome cake.<br>\r\nWhile munching it, she found it really good, and wondered if all the food is that good or just this welcome cake. She decided to pick a second slice, she deserved a little and well earned indulgence, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she looked at the clock on her phone, it was already half past twelve, and thought she should prepare to go down...</span></div></div>",

The only town for miles around was that creepy little place Wellington. The reception up here was shoddy <i>unless</i> you were hooked up to the school\u2019s Wi-Fi, which opened up a whole different can of worms based on security and privacy. A lot of the other teachers and students might have not seen the <i>eccentricities</i> of this place as anything other than just the trade-off for attending such a prestigious school, but Rachel Conrad knew better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat\u2019s more, her bosses knew better. They knew what they were sending her into because she was one of the better investigative reporters and one of the names closest to the Yeng Investigation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor years now, the media had been following the breadcrumbs left by the Yeng Corporation. First the incident in Daven\u2019s Port, the strange disappearances, and the \u201crelocation\u201d of one of its highest paid scientific minds to the aforementioned, remotely located area full of young and impressionable girls who were eating out of the palms of their hands\u2014<i>literally</i>? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat shit just didn\u2019t fly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now here she was, snooping around her new cabin like some kind of lunatic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf they <i>had</i> cameras in these little abodes, they probably thought that she was a crazy person. Flipping over pillows and looking underneath her couch. Her fridge, her bed. Hell, she\u2019d even looked down the drain! But to the best of her untrained eyes, they weren\u2019t watching her\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich was good, because she was <i>really</i> tired from the drive up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel Conrad flopped herself down on the couch, already grateful to be off of her feet. Lugging all of her suitcases onto her personal golf cart hadn\u2019t done her any favors either. The woman at the desk said that they had a staff for that, but Rachel couldn\u2019t risk anyone finding out about the cameras that she\u2019d stashed in her luggage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly this whole process had probably taken ten years off of her life. First that interview with her pig of a boss Ms. Polluck\u2014watching her gorge herself on all that rich fattening food was sickening. And then her creepy Vice Principal Dr. Hinami-whatever, asking her all those personal questions. Pretending like she was just some dumb new teachers like the others\u2026 it had been so stressful, all she was worried about was getting found out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now she was here. In the belly of the beast, as it were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo everyone else, she was just Ms. Conrad, the new English Language Arts teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she was actually Rachel Conrad, deep undercover journalist. And she was going to get to the bottom of the threads that tied the insidious Yeng Corporation to Buttercombe Academy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now, she was tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe a little nap.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The fact that this wasn\u2019t done during the hiring process seemed a little odd. Instead of performing her physical, or at least requesting her medical information, before she\u2019d made the drive up to Virginia was a bit unusual. If it was so important that she\u2019d been evaluated by a medical professional beforehand, you\u2019d think that it would have been mentioned before now\u2014but whatever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Rachel, it seemed that it was more important that she was evaluated by <i>their</i> medical professional staff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that was just reporter\u2019s intuition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Saturday, around noon, two days before classes began. She\u2019d had minimal time to get her cabin unpacked and her closet filled. The Summer weather hadn\u2019t quite passed, and she wasn\u2019t required to \u201cdress\u201d like a teacher during her off hours, so Rachel had elected for a simple white tank and a flowing green overjacket to hide the spaghetti straps\u2014they were still thin enough to violate the general dress code on-campus. She wore her hair up, still tired from the move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a pretty woman, to which no one would disagree. She had to be camera-friendly in her line of work after all. Her <i>real</i> line of work. But for now, she supposed she could settle for being the hot teacher. That being said, anyone would feel a little self-conscious in her current predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStripped down to her lacy black bra and panties, her artificially tanned body standing out against the stark white and creamy yellow of the school\u2019s infirmary. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt made her feel like she wasn\u2019t supposed to be here\u2014perhaps because she wasn\u2019t. Not really. Not Rachel the Teacher\u2014she was more than welcome. But Rachel the investigative, Yeng-tracking reporter\u2026 that was a different story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer nurse seemed nice enough, though. Not nice enough to let her guard down, but a generally benign woman who didn\u2019t seem outwardly malicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Fukiyama was a tall, thin woman of Asian descent. She had long, silky hair and a somewhat round face. If she were in the position to be comforted, Rachel would have found her soothing voice and gentle mannerisms pleasant. But something about all this seemed\u2026 off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo.\u201d Rachel said abruptly as her attendant calibrated the scale, \u201cHow long have you, uh\u2026 worked here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman smiled and looked over, tucking a stray lock of flowing ebony hair behind her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, the same as you I\u2019d suppose.\u201d She said with a smile, \u201cYou\u2019re a first-year teacher, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight.\u201d Rachel hesitated slightly, \u201cFirst year teaching. I\u2019m\u2026 kind of nervous.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Fukiyama didn\u2019t say anything. Just made a noise of affirmation that she had heard Rachel, but had nothing to add. She was much more interested in the reading of the scale. Which was Watanagashi brand, Rachel noted, and therefore a product of a Yeng subsidiary. She\u2019d have to remember that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c120 pounds.\u201d Ms. Fukiyama said after a moment of calibration, \u201cPerfect.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat seems a little high.\u201d Rachel joked, \u201cSure I can\u2019t slip you a twenty and take it back down to 110?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer nurse laughed\u2014a little polite one. Rachel wondered how often she must hear that kind of comment around here\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnfortunately, there\u2019s not much I can do about that.\u201d Shiro said with a smile, \u201cBut the good news is that you\u2019re in perfect health. You\u2019re right where you should be, weight-wise, and it doesn\u2019t look like you need anything extra\u2026 at least as far as I\u2019m concerned.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a way, Rachel was almost disappointed. Being an investigative reporter and all, she half-way expected to be told that she had some kind of crippling disease that only Yeng could cure. That seemed to be their MO, anyway. Peddling product on the young and impressionable students at this Academy\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the nurses, it looks like, judging by all the medical equipment. A cursory glance of the little office told Rachel all she needed to know about where Buttercombe\u2019s infirmary got its facilities from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just need you to sign here.\u201d Shiro handed Rachel a clipboard and a pen\u2014it wrote in pink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel clicked the pen and lowered it down onto the medical waiver. Everything seemed right. Her height, weight, W, Brun., et cetera et cetera\u2026</span></div></div>",

Thanks for reminding me, I nearly forgot,\u201d the nurse opened a drawer and took out a decently looking faux-amber bracelet. \u201cIt defines your, umm, access rights? Essentially, I am supposed to give you this thing, there's a chip built in and it's good for all the vending machines, the cafeteria, lets you use everything for free. It also opens various classrooms and other spaces that are off-limits to students\u2026 To be honest, I don't know myself what else it can do. I've got one myself too, everyone does, but I don't wear it much since it clashes with my skin. But it goes well with your hair\u2026\u201d she trailed uncertainly, seeing the suspicious look Rachel was giving it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe undercover reporter quickly smiled and put it on her wrist.<i> I need to have it examined somehow, God knows what else it might do \u2013 trace my movements at the very minimum. But I now I must play the role of hot dumb teacher. </i>\u201cOh, really? Well, I'll try it right away. Which way is the cafeteria?\u201d And she rose, giving nurse the signed waiver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's close by, just turn left and then follow the signs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel was nearly out of the office when she turned, \u201cOh, and Group B? So are there Groups A, C, D as well?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurse shrugged, \u201cWell, I'm Group C, I think Bs are most common, all the teachers' bracelets I've issued were B, so I suppose the Headmistress could be A. But nobody's ever asked me yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, I see. Well, thanks and see you soon \u2013 though hopefully not in your professional role,\u201d Rachel joked lightly, hoping it would make the nurse forget her nosing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking about nosing, her nose was just reporting a cocktail of enticing smells coming from the left. Well, she told the girl she was going to the cafeteria so she might just as well check it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince semester didn't start yet and it was early, she expected it to be empty. As she neared the wide open double door though, she found out she was wrong. True, there weren't that many people but they made up for it with their size. Rachel stopped in her tracks, shocked and disgusted by the avalanche of fat she witnessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were obese teens everywhere, waiting in lines, waddling with their trays, swapping their holiday adventures and eating. Mainly eating though that was too mild a word for this display of gluttony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the first shock receded, Rachel had to admit there weren't actually all that many of them, three dozen, four at most. The cafeteria was still mostly empty and she could see it in all its splendor \u2013 high ceilings, pristine white walls, dozens of tables with wide upholstered chairs. The chairs drew her attention next. She could fit comfortably in them with her boyfriend (if she had any), and yet for some of the worst blobs she saw it was a tight fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel reminded herself she should stick to her role and remain objective. Still, as she slowly turned her attention to the closest buffet her mind was awhirl in confusion. Why did the fattest students arrive all early? Were they so eager to get back to the trough? It certainly seemed so, judging by the amounts they piled on their trays.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps she should watch what she was eating here? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was jerked out of her thoughts by a discreet cough behind her. \u201cExcuse me?

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>.. a young woman standing next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had blonde and wavy shoulder lenght hair that surrounded her face like curtains and a small nose between her clear eyes. A short jacket covered her svelte body and highlighted her large chest as one of the buttons was clearly having more troubles than the others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it's me. What do you want?\" replied Rachel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette scratched her chin. How could she know her name? Was she a spy working for the school? Did she know her true identity? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wanted to know my close colleague\" replied the blonde woman with childish glee. \"My name's Brooke Morrison, I'm new just like you, and I too teach English and literliterature! Only, I do English I and II, while you do III and IV, am I right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel nooded. \"So, are we the only english teachers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooke tapped her forehead with her index finger. \"Actually, if I recall, Mrs. Polluck mentioned another one, a certain Mrs. Porter, who has already been teaching here\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel gave a closer look at the blonde. Was it really a spy or was she really a naive newcomer? If the latter was true, she could turn into a useful ally for her scoop. But she shouldn't reveal her identity, only give her some hints about something strange in the school. Wait, maybe she was just playing this role to give her a sense of false security, then she...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, there are some students in that table!\" said Brooke elbowing Rachel's hip and the brunette's train of thoughts stopped. \"How about we pick something to eat and we join them? So we can befriend them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel, still not sure if she could trust her colleague or not, decided to play her role and followed her. Was surprised to see that the school could afford so much food. Was it only the first day or it was the standard?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't think there could be something in the food, there was just too much for them to tamper it if that was their intention. They both grabbed a portion of lasagna and approached the table. The three fat students who were sitting there stopped their chatting and their eating and got quiet as they saw the two teachers joining them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you mind if we sit here?\" asked Brooke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls shook their heads. How could they say no to a teacher? And besides, they had already sit down when she asked that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, girls!\" bursted Brooke with the same enthusiasm of a summer camp's animator. \"What years are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me... me and Dalilah are sophomores\" said nervously a short chubby student patting the girl next to her. Dalilah had long auburn hair that covered her right eye and was the less chubby of the trio, with only a potbelly and some widehips. \"While she's a junior\" and pointed the girl on the other side. She had dark brown hair tied into a short-side ponytail, and was the fattest of the three, to the point her round belly was pressed against the edge of the table. Rachel thought she was likely the double of her own weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" said Brooke. \"Then I'll be your new english teacher this year! My name's Brooke Morrison, what's yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Lana Dellinger, Mrs Morrison\" said the girl who previously answered. She was a chubby girl with a round face. Her black hair were cut short, revealing the numerous piercings on her ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you. But you can calm me by name if you prefer. There's no need to call me that seriously, and it makes me feel young\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she presented the brown-haired woman sitting next to her, who had just been eating her lasagna, and placed an arm around her shoulders. \"She's Rachel Conrad. She's a new english teacher too, but teaches english III and IV, so be ready\" said winking to the fat brunette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooke shook Rachel who was about to spit a piece of lasagna she was chewing. Then Rachel recomposed herself and made a smile at the fat junior in front of her. God she was fat, and she wasn't alone. Not only at her table, but all of the students, save some exceptions, were leaning toward the fat side, if not downright obese in some cases.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I have already Mrs. Porter\" replied the junior after having gulped down one of her tacos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ops, well, nevermind\" said a bit embarassed Brooke.  \"Changing topic, how is the school?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde teacher started a discussion with the girls, occasionally making a lame joke that brought at best a cringey smile from the girls, who were getting more and more awkward with every passing moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Rachel was quiet, as she was examining  the other students. She remembered about the \"group B\" thing and wondered if the students belonged to another one, like group \"D\" or \"E\" or maybe there were different groups among the students, although they didn't seem to have any bracelet like she and her colleague did. She thought it was a good idea to investigate and ask, but maybe not so soon, or she would've been suspicious. Speaking of suspiciousness, she decided to be more interactive so to not appear to silent and strange, and interveened in the awkward discussion. After a while, Brooke even offered to take seconds for the students; this time she really did caught their appreciation of the three teens who eagerly gave her their trays. Rachel offered to help Brooke, despite the blonde's insistence on doing it alone, so she could have some time alone with her. Oh, and get another slice of that lasagna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you prepare a program?\" asked Brooke. Rachel was in her thought and got caught off guard. \"Sorry, prepare what?\" asked as she took another slice of lasagna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A program. Like, did you prepare your lessons beforehand?\" asked again the blonde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, well... yes\" said Rachel. In truth, she didn't, actually, she didn't even remember what exactly she had to teach! Once she got back to her cabin, checking her teaching program would've been the first thing to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so you're one who prepares in advance\" replied picking a slice of pie for Dalilah, the quiet sophomore. \"I have just a loose program but I prefer improvising and following the flow of the lessons, along with the student's needs\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of program\" started Rachel, hoping it was the right moment. \"Did you have a medical check today?\" asked the brunette. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhmm yes, I had it this morning. Why did you ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just curiosity. Are you group B too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Group B?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it's written on your bracelet\" said the brunette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I didn't know. I thought it was just to tell the teachers apart from the rest of the staff. I think it's nice, isn't it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, really nice\" she still wasn't sure if Brooke was a spy or not, although the possibilities seemed to lean to the latter, but thought she could have been much useful for the investigation. Better keep her close, besides, silly attempts to endorse the students aside, she was a nice company.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, it's been nice to know you, but I remember I have some things to do in my cabin\" said hastily Rachel as she gave the tray back to Lana, who wasn't excited to see the teacher picked her only two slices of pizza, and went back to her cabin. She had to take notes. Oh, and see what's the textbooks's program she's been given for her cover.</span></div></div>",

She fought the urge to turn \u2013 she shouldn't look like snooping \u2013 but she failed again. Her head snapped around to see a small, round woman bobbing towards her in some kind of an overgrown golf cart. Rachel's eyes were immediately drawn to her bright blue locks. And yet she seemed to be past 40, who was this person?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waved at her, shouting cheerfully: \u201cHello, Ms. Conrad! Nice finally meeting you! I was trying to catch all newcomers to our staff at the cafeteria to give them a proper welcome but it turned out you already left. So welcome to the Buttercombe Academy at last!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, thank you, umm\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, where are my manners? Dr. Helen Schwartz, Head Counselor.\u201d The woman braked her contraption to shake hands with Rachel. \u201cMay I accompany you to your cabin? I'd like to have a word with you if you don't mind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Rachel did mind but she couldn't say that. \u201cUh, sure.\u201d She gave a surprised look to the resident genius. Better enforce her image of a clueless youg girl. \u201cSo happy to meet you, Dr. Schwartz! I've read so much about your inventions! I admire you so much!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, that was nothing,\u201d the scientist-turned-Counselor basked in her praise, preening a little. \u201cWell, hop on the second seat, please. We'll make it to your cabin faster.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't sure she wanted such a close contact with one of the . \u201cUh, I'd prefer to walk. After all, it's just two dozen yards.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Counselor frowned, lowered her voice: \u201cListen, better do hop on, please. I didn't want to talk about it here where some student might overhear us but there's a reason for it. There's been an outbreak of Lyme disease, ticks infestation due to the hot summer, or so I've been told. We've had them eradicated on our grounds, hopefully, but I wouldn't risk anything if I were you, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, right, right.\u201d Rachel joined her, sitting down in a second, smaller seat on the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen started the cart moving again. \u201cIn fact, it might be advisable if you use a scooter within the Academy like I do. You have been assigned one but better hurry to claim it from the caretaker, since scooters unclaimed by teachers will be redistributed among needful students in a week's time.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what about the rest of the students? How are they going around? Aren't they facing the worst risks? Shouldn't we give scooters primarily to them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plump woman waved her hand, \u201cOh, it's nice of you to think of them but the dormitories are mostly connected with covered walkways and our students seldom venture outside. It is the staff who are most at risk, especially newbies like you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStudents don't go outside? This was getting weirder and weirder. But she had to stick to her role. \u201cOK, I'll pick up my scooter right away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood,\u201d the older woman smiled at her warmly. \u201cAlso, please remember that the eradication took place only on our grounds so avoid going outside the compound on foot at all. If you need to go to the town, please drive and stay on the main roads. We wouldn't like to lose you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>So I am not supposed to go outside, eh? What are they hiding there? </i>Rachel nodded, not trying to hide her confusion. It was perfectly natural to feel overwhelmed by all this on her first day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Schwartz noticed it too. \u201cWell, sorry for unloading it all on you but it had to be done, right? Anyway, what do you think about your accommodation? Is it adequate for such a valuable member of our faculty?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Valuable? What did they put in my fake CV?</i> Luckily it was easy to fake a reason for her surprise. \u201cAdequate? It's stunning! I've never lived in anything as grand as this!\u201d Rachel gushed, happy to speak the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGlad to hear it.\u201d As they drove right to the cabin door. Rachel moved to stand up but the Counselor waved her down. \u201cNo, no, don't get up yet. Just wave your bracelet past the lock \u2013 good \u2013 and now I can show you how you'll dock your scooter when you have one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey drove inside, backing to the side wall. \u201cSo this is why there's such an empty space in the entrance! I was wondering what was it for\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed.\u201d A satisfied chuckle was followed by a grunt as the older woman reached inside a hidden compartment and pulled out a huge welcome basket, almost too large to fit in there. \u201eSooo\u2026 one again, welcome to the Buttercombe Academy. Let's sit and chat a little, shall we?\u201d And she thrust the basket into Rachel's hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, thanks,\u201d Rachel retreated into the living room, putting it on the table. She gave its contents a quick glance - honey buns, apple pies, cupcakes and muffins\u2026 not an ounce of healthy food. And while there were no brands to be seen, she didn't doubt they were all produced by Yeng.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked to the sofa, Dr. Schwartz looked even heavier than before. She thrust the basket back into Rachel's hands. \u201cSo, have a cake, please. Have a bite and tell me, what's been your experience so far? How do you find our little academy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel didn't want to stuff herself with snacks but as the Counselor's questions got ever more personal and she had to invent more about her supposed background, she found herself delving into the basket ever more often to have an excuse to stop speaking for a moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the woman finally finished her interrogation and drove away, wishing her a pleasant afternoon, Rachel groaned, caressing her stuffed stomach. She'd never\u2026 scratch that, she hadn't felt this stuffed since her last Thanksgiving with her family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat to do now? She ought to have a look at the textbooks so she wouldn't be blindsided like this again. But the thinly veiled attempt to discourage her from snooping outside the compound piqued her interest. Perhaps she could pick up her scooter and drive around? After all, the Counselor warned her against <i>walking</i>. She did say driving was OK, right? Her stomach had yet another idea. Wouldn't it be nice to take a nap now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat to do now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She wasn\u2019t going to find anything; she didn\u2019t even know where to start looking! No, the answer was clearly for her to take her time and maintain her image as the helpful, apparently very valuable, much-more-attractive English teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd unfortunately, that meant that she had to at least learn how teaching worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever Gia\u2014her contact for this kind of thing\u2014had put on her resume for this job, it had given her one hell of a recommendation.

Provided her with a lesson plan that was up to standard with what Buttercombe Academy taught the previous year. Shakespeare for the 12th graders, <i>Beowulf</i> for the 11th, and plenty of essays about persuasive articles and TED talks. Basic \u201cgetting ready for college\u201d stuff, really. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only trouble was teaching it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel was a Journalist, <i>not</i> a bibliophile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could barely keep awake reading some of the articles she\u2019d researched on the Yeng corporation, let alone try to peel through A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she decided that she needed coffee, the moon hung heavily over the mountaintop Academy.

Silently, she cursed her alarm clock again \u2013 and the beds in Buttercombe. She stopped by the whiteboard and turned to face her students, getting a good look at them for the first time. And giving them a good look at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, God, another model!\u201d one of them whispered. \u201cWanna bet how long it takes for Ms. Perfect to grow a gut?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't be so nasty, Becky. She might be nice. Besides, it's not like you're thin anymore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm still smaller than you, Evie. Or anyone else here, apart from that bitch.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was true. At close to 200 pounds, Becky was one of the smallest juniors in Buttercombe and when Rachel surveyed her English class, she had to sit down to cover her surprise. The avalanche of fat was staggering. She heard about the youth obesity epidemic but this was another level altogether. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhm, good morning again,\u201d she forced a smile on her face, \u201cmy name is Rachel Conrad and as you may know already, I'll be teaching you English this year. We will be\u2026\u201d her stomach chose this moment to remind her she hadn't filled it since that sweet binge yesterday. And the wave of laughter which followed assured her it could be heard by the whole class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel's cheeks coloured a little. \u201cSorry, class, I haven't yet had breakfast today but let's get back\u2026 Yes?\u201d A student was frantically waving her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you like my honey cake, Ms. Conrad?\u201d Not waiting for an answer, Evie walked to the teacher's desk, her potbelly quivering, and placed an enticing brown cake there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, thank you\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEvie Littleton, Ms. Conrad. Please enjoy.\u201d And she sat back with a satisfied smile, watching her teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBrown-nosing to your teacher already, Evie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh? Just giving her what she needs, Becky. Can you imagine skipping breakfast? I'd die of hunger. And look at how small she is! Besides, the sooner she adjusts to Buttercombe, the better for us, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky thought about it a little, then she rose too. \u201eMs. Conrad? I have cupcakes here, would you like some?\u201c and she put the entire package on the teacher's table. A third girl offered her cream puffs and in a short time there wasn't any free space left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother student raised her hand. \u201cWould you like me to bring you coffee, Ms. Conrad?\u201d Rachel hesitated. It seemed wrong to be using her students as her personal slaves \u2013 especially students the size of this girl. \u201cOr Yeng Cola? The cakes must be horribly dry without anything to drink.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she insists so much\u2026 \u201cLatte macchiato then, please.\u201d Rachel watched her student manoeuvre her expansive backside between school desks. She didn't miss that other students took her eating as an unspoken permission to open their own stashes, nor the fact that most of them had trouble fitting in their desks. She did miss, however, that while observing her hand unwrapped another cupcake and stuffed it into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big blonde student was back faster than she expected. Rachel gulped down half her latte before going back to her duties. \u201cAnyway, we'll be delving into A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream later today but first I'd like to learn a bit more about you. Maybe you can start?\u201d she pointed at the helpful blonde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm, eh, my name's Lizzie Thompson, and, uh, my hobbies are\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wonder how much teaching she'll do today. And how much eating,\u201d Becky whispered maliciously to her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to both juniors, their teacher was the subject of a similar debate several hundred yards away. \u201cI'm getting some strange vibes from that girl. She's certainly not as ditzy as she makes it seem.\u201d The vice principal swivelled in her chair away from her visitor to a bank of monitors showing the feed from dozens of cameras throughout the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it seems to me she's learned that her 'dumb blonde' pose gets her further faster than if she let on how bright she actually is. Oh, minus the blond part, sure, I know Rachel's a brunette,\u201d dr. Schwartz corrected herself. \u201cBut otherwise I didn't find her any less susceptible to our products than any other newcomer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFukuda scowled at the monitors. \u201cShe didn't eat her fill at the cafeteria yesterday and today she hasn't shown there at all! The only new teacher not to do so.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue, but when I left her cabin yesterday, she's been properly stuffed on our welcome basket,\u201d Helen chuckled. \u201cThe poor thing let her subconscious run wild while she struggled with my questions. She overate so much she had trouble breathing. Rachel has to be a repressed glutton. I wonder how long it will take us to break her willpower down, want to bet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf it was supposed to placate the fearsome woman, it didn't quite work that way. Fukuda scowled again, for a quite different reason, \u201cAnd I haven't seen it. Oh, how I wish they let us keep cameras in private rooms!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut she is supposed to be wrapping up her first lesson now and we do have cameras there. Why not put her on and see how she's doing? And tune up the volume, please, I'm interested too.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood idea. Let me see, room 2A23\u2026 There she is.\u201d Fukuda swivelled the camera and focused it on the teacher. \u201cOh. Oh, my.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe display showed a table half-filled with snacks, the subject of their discussion was just throwing away another empty wrapper before saying: \u201cThat's it for today, class. Next time we'll start with A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream so have a look at the First Act, please.\u201d And then, as students slowly filed out, both women watched Rachel stifle a groan and caress her overfed middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee? She's shaping up nicely. I'll pay some\u2026 special attention to her and I'm sure she'll come round. Now let's tick Ms. Conrad off and move to the freshmen. There are some well-known names, scions of our top families, among them, but I'm most interested in her.\u201d Helen scrolled to a photo on her Y-Pad. \u201cRing a bell?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, is that the youngest Black? What is her name?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHunter. 'Tis her indeed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlaying your games again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'll have you know that I'm not.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The class scheduling at Buttercombe Academy followed the traditional \"period\" system, rather than the more modern \"blocking\". It made sense, given the remote location of the school and its heightened focus in academia, to follow a more rigorous scheduling system. Seven hour-long periods a day with two lunch periods was more intense than a four two hour blocks with only one lunch. Out of the seven open periods, five of them were dedicated to classtime while two of them were \"free\" periods, meant for her to catch up with grading her students' assignments. And despite the fact that many of the students who migrated from public school to this ritzy, out-of-the-way academy, Rachel could say with plenty of confidence that this scheduling system would put far more stress on the teachers than the students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe front door to her cabin clicked open as she trudged inside, lugging a full satchel that bore heavily on her right shoulder. The first day and she was already supposed to grade quizzes\u2014short quizzes mind you, but at thirty heads a class and five courses a day, that was 150 quizzes to grade before the next few days were over! It was already Monday, and the mock schedules she'd designed for her lesson plan called for her to be done with all of these by Wednesday...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, truthfully, that wasn't the biggest source of Rachel's discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe poor teacher plopped down on her couch for the first time since she'd moved in, immediately undoing the clasp on her skirt and allowing her bloated stomach to surge forward. Those snacks in her first period had only been the beginning! Was it a tradition to <i>feed</i> new teachers around here until they popped? Her girls were giving her crap left and right, the teachers and that welcome party... Rachel had to take it home! It was still out in her golf cart, waiting for her to come pick it up. Bags of off-brand imitations of old favorites, all packaged in that generic white labeling...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Uuugh</i>... she didn't even want to <i>think</i> about food right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm never going to get anything done around here.\" she groaned distastefully, \"If I'm ever gonna\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel paused momentarily. She hadn't yet discovered any listening devices planted in her cabin. But in her weary state, she reasoned that she would have found any that they'd bugged her with by now. After tearing her cabin apart within the first hour, surely she was clean. Even still, she probably shouldn't just out and out <i>say</i> that she was investigating, should she? Bugs or not, someone could be listening...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get any work done.\" she added carefully, leaning her head onto the armrest, \"Not if this place keeps <i>feeding</i> me like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hands came to rest on her turgid stomach, squelching and smacking as it struggled to digest her first three classes' worth of dietary slip-ups <i>and</i> an unexpectedly hardy lunch. Rachel hadn't pigged out this much in years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This place is dangerous.\" Rachel said quietly, referring more to the dietary temptations that lurked everpresent at every corner rather than her actual suspicions with Yeng Corp, \"All the more reason to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel's eyelids grew heavy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reason to...\" her mind grew foggy, slowly drifting... drifting... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zzz...\"</span></div></div>",

Instead it was a tiny, sharp sound that Rachel was unfamiliar with. Her \"work\" phone\u2014a burner that she'd been given just before she took this assignment. It was entirely off the grid, more or less untraceable. No contacts, no wallpapers, and unfortunately no less horrible options for a ringtone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel rocked herself back to a standing position, the swelling in her stomach having receded. She still felt rather heavy, a side-effect from eating all that junk, for sure. A gross burp burned her nostrils as she lumbered around her cabin, trying to find the source of that god-awful noise. Surely she could at least <i>change</i> it to something a little less terrible? She'd have to ask\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gia?\" Rachel mumbled, still half-asleep, \"Wh'time is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"9 'o' clock, Rach.\" a husky voice, smooth as whisky purred into the earpiece, \"You weren't asleep, were you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGia Rossellini had been Rachel's contact since she had gone into journalism. Gia specialized in information\u2014she used to be a cop, as Rachel understood it\u2014and had a special talent for keeping her ear to the ground. Rachel hadn't gone undercover much before taking this assignment, and especially not for an indefinite period of time like this one. Gia was her one link to the outside world\u2014no one else knew that she was here. At least, not in this capacity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... might have been.\" Rachel admitted, \"Took a little nap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh. Have you made any headway over there?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet, no.\" Rachel made a face. Jesus, it was only her first day. Cut her some slack! \"But I gotta tell you Gia, it's really weird up here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll bet.\" Gia said with a little laugh, \"What's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so Rachel told her about everything that she'd seen so far. About the mandatory medical checkups. The reception blocking. The weird little bracelets and \"Group B\"\u2014whatever the hell that was. All of the food and all of the fat; Rachel went into great detail about how chubby some of these girls were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kids are getting fatter every year, Rach.\" Gia said dismissively on the other end of the line, \"Let's just make sure they're not being brainwashed by all this Yeng stuff\u2014anything about the technology you've seen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's <i>all</i> Yeng.\" Rachel lowered her voice a bit, covering her speaker with a cupped hand, \"Watanagashi, Himatsubushi, Yoigoshi... shell corporations like that, mostly. But\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's great.\" Gia said, Rachel could practically see her smiling, \"That's a big step forward. See if you can snag some pictures.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" Rachel looked around cautiously, \"I've... I've got to go. I've got a lot of paperwork to catch up on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea\u2014can't have anyone think you're anything less than what I put on your transcript.\" Gia paused for a bit. At first, Rachel thought that she was pleased with herself, pulling together such a convincing CV like that with all the references to back it up. But when her voice came back on the line, it sounded much more serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even still, I'm going to need you to do some legwork.\" she said flatly, \"Don't get so caught up playing teacher that you forget why you're there\u2014someone's got to take these people down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, the line clicked. Gia hung up on an awfully cryptic note, and suddenly Rachel realized just how alone she felt in the dark.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Buttercombe Academy campus was as spacious and vast as one might expect of a prestigious school. With Yeng's support, the campus had slowly spread further out and down the mountainous area that once only a single building had claimed. The Masters building for Humanities &amp; Performing Arts had been built to the east, whereas the Vandergriff building for Science &amp; Business Studies had been constructed a little further down to the west past a slight incline, and the main building had been relegated to General Education courses, standing proud and tall where it always had. Each one was stocked with their own cafeterias, computer labs, plenty of wiggle room... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was hardly a high school campus at all! By the size of it, Rachel would have guessed it was an especially mountainous university. The need for these golf carts was ever-present, and nothing proved it like trying to <i>trek</i> this spacious purgatory without one. Shunted off behind the main building was the athletic area... there was even <i>more</i> to this place that she'd have to work out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moon hung high over the courtyard, half-wax. The streetlamps that lit the pavement had gone out\u2014it was just past midnight, and curfew was in effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith some sleep under her belt, Rachel was very ready to get some sleuthing done. She'd stake out one location tonight for maybe an hour or two before heading home and getting a couple of hours to keep her sharp. She wasn't going to get anything done if she couldn't balance out her life as Rachel the Teacher and Rachel the Reporter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDressed in her classroom clothes, Rachel felt that she fit the bill. She really <i>was</i> a teacher here, even if her credentials had been falsified. Suddenly the amber-colored boggle that hung slightly off of her wrist didn't seem so useless after all. But despite her confidence and the cover story that she'd concocted\u2014a new teacher who had left her thumb drive in the building and needed urgently to get it back before class tomorrow!\u2014her pace was still too quick to blend in seamlessly around here. Her flats clicked slightly against the pavement as she walked stiff-legged towards the central courtyard...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no students around, this should be easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" a voice called out suddenly. It was rough and commanding\u2014not like anyone she'd met at this school so far, \"Stop where you are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis campus had security? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis campus had security. Of course it did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA white golf cart with mustard-yellow decals whirred up out of the ether, marked ADMINISTRATIVE SECURITY. Inside the cockpit was this fat, round-bellied woman stuffed into a white and cream-colored uniform. Her huge gut had been tucked into her mile-wide khakis to contend with an even spread of saddlebag thighs and big bulging booty, and it <i>still</i> lapped over her belt-line. Her caramel colored skin made the white of her uniform stand out all that much more intensely. Poor guard looked like an ice cream cone!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think you're doing out here, ma'am?\" the woman commanded, parking the cart in front of her and shining the headlights, \"It is well past curfew.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat shit was for the teachers too? What the hell, Gia?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I left my thumb drive...\" Rachel winced at the intensity of the LED headlamps, \"Can you... turn those off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nuh uh.\" the guard said petulantly, \"Are you a teacher here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah.\" Rachel shielded her eyes while she reached into her satchel<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled out the ID that Ms. Hinamizawa had given her. It was a pretty fancy number for just an identification badge. Three separate holograms, a special identification code for no less than three on-campus services (what those were beyond the cafeteria, Rachel had no idea) as well as her picture and start date. She braved the brights of her interloping guard and handed her the little laminated thing. She looked at it for a moment before running it through a reader built into her golf cart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're new here.\" she said, rather than asked, \"They didn't tell you about the Lyme disease thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel thought back to her ride with Dr. Schwartz the night before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... no?\" Rachel smiled, \"Look, I just... you're right, I'm new here and I left my thumb drive in my classroom and I <i>really</i> need to go get it, sooo\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm-hmm.\" the guard pursed her full lips, \"I can't let you do that, Mrs. Conrad. It's not safe. <i>And</i> it's past curfew.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShit. Shitshitshit. This wasn't good. How was she ever going to get any investigating done if there was a curfew in effect? Fuck, more than that, how was she ever going to get anyone to trust her if she got a reputation as someone who snuck out in the middle of the night? Ohh there had to be a way out of this somehow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I... I <i>just</i> got this job.\" Rachel smiled weakly, hoping that the large woman would take pity on her, \"I-I didn't know that there was a curfew o-or a Lyme Disease... whatever. I just... I <i>really</i> like this job. Can you make an exception for me? Just this once?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel took a cursory glance at the Guard's swollen right breast. Dangling there like a bug on a gourd was her name badge. Rio Ayala.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rio?\" she quickly added, \"I'd really appreciate it<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe great big guard cupped the hang of her second chin for a moment before saying...</span></div></div>",

Can't have you getting sick because I didn't do my job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes! Rachel had managed to turn this around! It wasn't her ideal way to get around campus, given that she'd just picked up a super-sized chaperone, but it was better than being turned away. She figured that, using this \"new and confused teacher\" bit, she might be able to squeeze at least twenty minutes out of a good snooping session.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The main building.\" Rachel said with a smile, \"Thank you so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah.\" the cart-crushing guard smacked the small space between her and the passenger side door, \"Hop in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ride from the teacher cabins to the main building wasn't very long. Rachel lived in one of the older ones that had been built when the school was much smaller, so they were relatively closer to the campus. That being said, what should have been a five minute puttering down the sidewalks felt like it was lasting forever\u2014Rachel's heart was pounding like a jackhammer. Her anxiety was running her ragged and she felt so... <i>cramped</i> in this stupid cart!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So the main building.\" Rio continued in a placid tone, \"They got those coffee cakes in the vending machines there?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis fat cow was even bigger in the hips than she was in the belly\u2014Rachel's skinny shape was literally pressed into the passenger side door! It wasn't like she could be rude to the woman who was breaking protocol and giving her a lift in the dead of night, but couldn't she have at least offered her the back seat? No way this woman didn't know that <i>no one</i> would be able to sit next to her up front!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm sorry?\" Rachel did her best to not make her wincing noticeable<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, they got different snacks in different buildings.\" Rio drove with one hand on the wheel and one hand on her gut\u2014caramel-colored diamonds of flesh eeked through her uniform, upon closer inspection\u2014\"The Griff doesn't have 'em and that's my usual route. Ugh, I'm hooked on those things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd a lot of other things, apparently. Rio's golf cart was littered with discarded snack wrappers and cellophane plastic. They crinkled whenever Rachel moved her feet. No guess where that gut came from. Rio must have seen Rachel surveying the damage, because she let out a little snort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, don't ever quit smoking\u2014if it ain't one thing, its another\" the huge woman joked with a slosh of her stomach, \"Am I right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... think so?\" Rachel smiled awkwardly. Anything that could get her to get there <i>faster</i>, \"Do you want me to check while I'm in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you?\" Rio smiled, \"I'd really appreciate it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel retreated inwardly. One night? Did Rio just say she'd eaten all this since she went on duty? That was insane. What <i>was</i> it with this place and food? Something had to be up. Gia might not have wanted to listen, but Rachel had seen too many snacks today to completely wipe something dietary off of the table. Yeng's tech and its shell companies were the main concern, but someone might want to seriously consider looking into all this junk they were peddling to everyone on campus...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the reached the main building, Rachel felt like she was ready to pop out of the cart. She opened the door and almost fell to the pavement as Rio's avalanche of ass fat settled back into its rightful place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got fifteen minutes.\" Rio warned, \"If I don't report back every thirty minutes, I get a call on my comm, and then I've <i>gotta</i> report you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel gulped. Fifteen minutes? That's half the time that she was expecting to have. And she still didn't know this place all that well yet...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got it.\" Rachel smiled, \"Fifteen minutes. I can do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesus this place had a lot of security regulations. Just what was going on here that was so important that they needed regular security check-ups with the guards? With Rio it at least probably kept her from stuffing herself until she was <i>entirely</i> too big for her cart, but just how many guards were there on campus? And why have a steady patrol at night? Something didn't add up here, and Rachel was starting to get more suspicious than ever...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And don't forget my coffee cakes!\" Rio whisper-yelled to the door, \"Or I'll report you anyway, newbie!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Rachel had to get enough damning evidence on this place to bring down an entire megacorporation\u2014and Rio the Rent-a-Cop needed to get back to her post in <i>fifteen minutes</i>! This whole night had been a bust, absolutely unbelievable. First she'd fallen asleep then she'd had to tell Gia that she hadn't found anything and she knew that good journalism took <i>time</i> but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis whole place was creeping her out! Especially now, at night, with no one else in the building! Her footsteps echoed throughout the empty hallways, up into the staircases. Not a soul was in sight, and if they were, they would surely have heard her cussing under her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFifteen minutes\u2014unbelievable!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew that there were cameras in the building, she just wasn't sure where. They didn't exactly make them so that they stood out anymore. They were seamlessly built into the ceiling tiles of this old school. She had to at least <i>look</i> like she was a lost teacher, just like she did at her cabin. Take every precaution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slid her bracelet along the electronic lock to her classroom door. A soft metallic ping and the tumbler falling sounded her in. She turned the knob and stepped inside. Fifteen minutes, fifteen minutes. The walk back to the <i>door</i> was five! She just should have stayed home tonight. Gotten breakfast, unlike yesterday. <i>Not</i> have skulked around campus like a crazy person. This whole night had been a waste, and she felt like such an idiot...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil, of course, she looked at her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at her desktop computer, a thumb drive was sticking out of the USB port. Rachel might have left in a hurry (for fear of getting any more stuffed by her students and fellow teachers!) but she definitely remembered <i>taking</i> her drive out when she left. Even if she hadn't, it wouldn't have mattered. There was nothing incriminating on the drive, nothing that would link back to any investigation\u2014it was where she had decided to keep her lesson plans instead of lugging around her (very incriminating) laptop from cabin to class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo why, then, was there a flash drive sticking out of her monitor?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the generic kind that they gave out to everyone at orientation. 32GB was enough to hold anything a teacher or student needed for quite a while, and it had come in the yellow and white color scheme that had become synonymous with Yeng and Buttercombe's union. It very well could have been hers (she'd probably tell Rio that it was hers, if she had to prove that she found it) but it most definitely wasn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone had come in after she'd locked up the classroom and plugged this into her desktop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the computer out of sleep mode revealed that there was nothing on the drive. Not even the orientation PDFs that had been included when Rachel had gotten hers. No recent files listed in her directory, either. It didn't look like anyone had taken anything from her computer or transferred anything over... so why was it just <i>there</i>? Could it have been one of the girls? No, she would have noticed something like that. Besides, a lot of her girls were too big <i>not</i> to notice coming up to her desk...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sharp electronic beeping made her nearly wet her panties\u2014the timer that she'd set was going off. She'd better start making her way back to Rio, or she'd get reported...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter, of course, she stopped at the vending machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You remembered!\" Rio said with more passion and energy than she had said anything else since midnight, \"And you got me so much\u2014you're such a sweetheart!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blobby guard squealed like the happiest little piggy on campus as she wolfed down her favorite treat. They came three to a package and Rachel had gotten four. Hopefully that would dissuade her from ratting her out. Not that Rio seemed like the kind of person to do that anyway. She'd been nice and helped her out when she needed it. But Rachel couldn't trust anyone. Especially not someone wearing a bright white uniform around here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want me to give you a ride back to your cabin?\" Rio asked, dark brown crumbs sprinkling her chin and cleavage, \"It's the least I can do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you already doing me a favor?\" Rachel raised an eyebrow, \"By not ratting me out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but you helped me get my fix.\" Rio snickered, tummy trembling in delight beneath her drum-tight uniform, \"Hop in and I'll take you back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel had wisely climbed in the backseat this time. Rio's monster ass was so big and awkward, it was no wonder Rachel hadn't seen that woman leave her cart yet. It was probably a hassle to get all of that in and out like everyone else. The ride was much smoother, and the grumpy guard seemed to be in a much better mood with her favorite snacks on board. But despite the relative ease of this ride as opposed to the last one, physically and emotionally, Rachel spent the whole ride back to her cabin white-knuckling the thumb drive that she'd found plugged into her computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, Rio was far too preoccupied to ask her about what she was holding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they pulled back up to Rachel's cabin, the cart came to a lurching halt. Rachel climbed out of the backseat and walked back towards the front, quickly throwing the drive into her purse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you again, Rio.\" Rachel said with her best reporter's smile, \"You're a life-saver.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't think anything of it, ma'am.\" Rio's round cheeks dimpled with a smile, \"Everyone needs a little help sometimes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when an idea struck her. One that might help her out on two fronts. Rachel held up a finger and asked Rio to wait in the little mock-driveway created for her cabin for just a moment. The large Latina didn't have time to mutter about the timeframe she was on before Rachel came back from her parked cart carrying a literal bag full of snacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm never going to eat all of this.\" Rachel said sheepishly, \"I lose my stuff a lot and... do you think... maybe... I can call you next time I lose my drive? I really like it here and... I don't want to get in trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRio's piggy eyes were bulging out of their sockets. The great big guard, sandwiched into her cart by her girth, was practically leaning out of the driver's side door to get them before Rachel handed them over! She did her best to hide it, but anyone could have seen that Rachel had touched a very hungry nerve with Rio the Rent-a-Cop. Even still... she had a job to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, uh... I guess that'd be okay.\" Rio smacked her lips as she lowered the sack of snacks into the already half-filled passenger seat, next to her ample right ass cheek, \"Just, uh... don't make it a habit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel waved goodbye as Rio sped off, already wrist-deep in the sack of snacks that Rachel's students had given her. And once she was sure that Rio was out of sight, she took the drive out of her purse and gave it another look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was going on at Buttercombe Academy, and how did it involve her?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The rest of Rachel's first week at her new job had been more or less mundane. At least, as far as \"mundane\" could take you when you were a reporter pretending to be a teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTuesday morning, the first thing that she did was ask her girls about the drive. It wasn't anything criminal, and no one was going to get into trouble. But the more that she could count out whose it <i>wasn't</i>, the better idea she could get of whose it <i>was</i>. None of the girls in any of her five classes had any idea whose drive it was. The fact that it was empty was a fact that Rachel kept for herself\u2014that little tidbit of information was only important to her as it was to the person who emptied it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you left it?\" Lizzie Thompson raised a wide wobbling arm, her belly cutting into the desk as she arched her back to be better seen, \"I know I left mine in the computer lab one year and had to walk <i>all the way back</i> to get it after lunch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMurmuring filled the classroom. Some in agreement of Lizzie's statement, some making fun of the poor fat thing (she was easily one of the bigger girls that Rachel had to deal with). It didn't seem to be anyone's, and it wasn't some elaborate prank on her. So that ruled out her students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would <i>my</i> flash drive be in <i>your</i> computer?\" Brooke Smith laughed as she scooped up a hearty helping of ketchup with cafeteria fries, \"Rachel, I don't even know what hall you're on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat made sense. It was stupid to even ask her, but you never know. This drive seemed to just appear out of nowhere, and the fact that it wound up in <i>her</i> computer just a few hours after she'd been talking to Gia (in a very hushed tone!) about some of the weird crap that went on in this school sent all of Rachel's red flags firing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure it could have been a coincidence. But given her precarious predicament, Rachel would rather be safe than sorry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis added stress, combined with her day job of teaching these porky princesses about a subject she honestly couldn't have cared less about, was really getting to her. Luckily Buttercombe Academy thought of everything, apparently. There was a neat little White Noise program that helped her get through her free periods stress-free. She'd listen to it whenever she ate lunch in her classroom or when she was grading papers\u2014she liked it so much she'd started taking it home to drown out the emptiness of her cabin. Helped her sleep, too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all the stress of running this place, no wonder some of the other teachers were on the bigger side. Ms. Polluck ran a tight shift, and seven periods meant a lot of work for anyone who wanted to live up to \"Buttercombe Excellence\" (whatever that meant). Rachel had found a lot of use in that little amber bracelet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Group B is just your assigned group.\" Nurse Fukiyama said over lunch one day, \"Teachers and faculty are all Group B, students are Group C, and administration are Group A. It handles things like the door locks, overriding equipment\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The vending machines.\" Rachel said with a bite out of her chicken sandwich, \"Don't forget those.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How <i>can</i> I?\" Shiro said derisively, \"They're everywhere. Anyway, there are a few other things that determine what your bracelet does, like if you're on SSS or not or if you're a substitute teacher, but for the most part it's pretty straightforward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing was for sure; even if her week had been mundane, Rachel had spent an awful lot of it eating. That was pretty much all there was to do in this stupid place! It wasn't like they were close enough to go to town or go out to a bar. Not without \"permission\" first. Honestly, they corralled these women like they were cattle! And fed them about as much too...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel came home more nights than she would have liked to admit and just collapsed on her couch, stuffed to the brim. She didn't <i>feel</i> like she was eating so much when she was out and about doing her routine, but every night she came home stuffed to the gills! She needed to get a hold of herself of she was going to wind up like that security guard Rio!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel cringed at the thought of being that overweight. An image of herself, round as a ball, getting rolled to and from her classes made her visibly uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more work she did on this Yeng investigation, the less likely that was to happen...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was midway through her second week of \"teaching\" when Rachel received another call from Gia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike always, it was at night. It was easier to contact Rachel when Gia knew that she would have the cabin to herself, so calling any where from nine to ten 'o' clock was a sound bet. And it made sense to someone who didn't have to get up and teach a course at eight in the morning after making sure she had enough time to get ready, eat breakfast, go over her notes, get her lesson ready, and all of the other work that Rachel had taken on when she had agreed to go undercover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming!\" Rachel hollered at the phone as it filled the cabin with it's awful tune, \"Coming coming coming!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel had been sound asleep. She either didn't get <i>any</i> sleep lately, or she got too much. The woes of an irregular sleeping schedule. All her sleuthing had really messed with her shut-eye, and getting filled up with food every night wasn't doing her any favors either. She'd been eating like crap for more than a week now, and Rachel felt more sluggish than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Gia.\" Rachel gasped after her mad dash to the phone in her bedroom, \"What's, uh... what's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sleeping on the job again?\" Gia asked derisively<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely not. I was actually...\" Rachel gulped, \"Just about to call you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure you were.\" she could practically hear Gia's eyes roll, \"Any updates on our special project?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sad fact of the matter was that... no, there weren't. Not for a lack of trying. After that night with Rio, Rachel had been scared straight for about three days before trying again. The next time she went into the main building she had ventured into some of the other classrooms and come up with nothing. She was going to have to find a way to get Rio to let her be by herself so she could go look into some of the other buildings. The Vandergriff or the Masters would surely have something else. Or even the administrative offices. Rachel didn't doubt that she couldn't get Rio to look the other way for some more snacks. It wasn't like she needed them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she couldn't tell Gia that. As hard-nosed as she could be, Gia was dead set on bringing this corporation down from the inside. Almost two weeks of \"legwork\" and nothing to show for it? Gia would be pissed! But at the same time, she didn't really have anything substantial to give her, other than her already-ignored opinions on the food and the mysterious flash drive that had appeared in her office that night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kind've. I, uh... I've got a story for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Rachel told her contact about everything that had happened. About the curfew and the \"outbreak\" that had kept everyone from walking around at night. Not a lot of legwork to be done when your butt either had to be in your cabin or in a cart, and only before 10pm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This flash drive was just <i>there</i>, Gia.\" Rachel held it in her hands, as if she were showing it to the woman hundreds of miles away, \"A few hours after I got off of the phone with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think your cabin's been bugged?\" Gia asked in a serious voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so\u2014I would have found it by now.\" Rachel looked around for verification, \"I've been tearing this place apart whenever I get the chance and the only computer I use is my laptop, but I brought that from home...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep looking.\" Gia commanded, \"So what's on the drive?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing! That's what's so weird!\" Rachel almost flung it across the room waving her arms around, \"Like, it's one everyone got, but it doesn't have <i>anything</i> on it. No school legislature, student handbook... nothing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a long shot.\" the older woman growled, \"But you said it was in your office later that night? You're sure it's not yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One hundred percent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, send it over and I'll analyze it for thumbprints; residual data, hidden files, maybe even some fingerprints.\" she concluded, \"Send it to my PO and I'll get someone to take a look at it for you. I don't know how long it'll take, but keep looking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSending anything out of this place was fucking ridiculous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst thing's first, as Rachel found out from the guard (guard!) who worked the on-campus postal service, if you've ever been in serious trouble on campus you are not allowed to send or receive packages. Envelopes are fine, but they have to be weighed. Then, for all those who <i>weren't</i> suspicious characters, you weren't allowed to send anything over a certain size without written permission from at least one faculty member. If you were a faculty member, you needed a co-signer. No Amazon side-hustling on campus, apparently. This place was beautiful and full of incentive to go here, but once you were enrolled (or taught there!) you might as well have been in a gilded prison camp!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel swiped her bracelet over the pinpad, charging her the $3.75 for postage and five dollars even for the box that she'd had to buy. She had to have something else to send to Gia\u2014she couldn't just send a thumb drive. That would look way too suspicious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGia might not have thought that the food was worth looking into, but Rachel still wasn't convinced. She'd bought a good bit of snacks that could survive the trip over and tucked them neatly into the box with a note that said CHECK THESE OUT in big curly-cue sharpie. That was innocent enough, right? If anyone asked, her friend Gia was a junk food enthusiast, and Rachel just had to share how great the snacks here were. There was nothing wrong with that, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd when she was sure nobody was looking, Rachel slid the thumb drive underneath one of the inner flaps of the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf there was anything on that thumb drive, Gia would find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd in the meantime, Rachel could continue her investigation. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The rest of Rachel's first month passed rather uneventfully. The most excitement that she'd felt was that night in her classroom after hours; everything else was about as hum-drum as could be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe days passed, turning into weeks, as the sleepy mountain campus puttered along its existence. It was almost scary how quickly time could pass here. You fall into a schedule\u2014a dull routine that buzzes in the back of your mind until you barely notice its there anymore. It was October before Rachel realized it, and she hadn't made much more progress in four weeks than she had in two days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that her job was her biggest concern at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Goddddd...\" Rachel cupped the sides of her squishy stomach that bulged over the wasitband of her leggings, \"This <i>cannot</i> be happeningggggg...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll there was to do in this stupid place was eat! Meeting with teachers was always done over breakfast, then there were the big lunches and the faculty dinners. Her classroom was <i>right</i> outside of a vending machine so she had to look at that stupid Yeng-peddling screen all day whenever she sat at her desk. Which she did a <i>lot</i> because she had so much <i>actual work</i> to do that she couldn't keep her assignment straight! Then when she got home, she'd signed up for this meal delivery service because on the long list of things she <i>could</i> do cooking wasn't one of them and\u2014UGH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis job sucked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel looked at herself in the full-body mirror that hung on the back of her cabin's bathroom wall. Twenty pounds in a month. Was that even <i>possible</i>? Even with how much she ate, twenty pounds in a month shouldn't have been possible. For God's sake she had lovehandles! This job was going to be the absolute death of her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or at least my figure.\" she curled a nose distastefully as she raised her arms and slipped into a t-shirt, \"If I don't do something about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a Saturday morning, and the sleepy campus was about as lifeless as ever. Most of the students, as well as her fellow teachers, were getting lunch in the cafeterias around the school. And while Rachel would have absolutely <i>loved</i> to indulge herself in some of the rich foods and desserts that were made so readily available to anyone with an ID card, her bra was pinching pretty tight as it was now. Another day stuffing her face wasn't going to magically make her figure shrink...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's why she was going to go on a jog. She'd never done it before, because she'd never really had to. She'd always had a naturally fast metabolism that had helped her stay skinny well into her twenties until now. But desperate times called for desperate measures, she supposed\u2014jogging was an easy, efficient way of keeping her weight down without raising too much attention now that the \"Lyme Disease\" outbreak had officially been forgotten about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could at least move around campus on foot now, even if it was only during the daylight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not today, fatso.\" Rachel pinched her chubby belly, \"Gotta work off some of these pounds before I start blending in a little <i>too</i> well...\" </span></div></div>",

The weather wasn't great, and it had started to get much colder as the Fall weather set in. October wasn't the <i>ideal</i> time to exercise, but the chunk on her butt wasn't going to wait until the weather got warm. Rachel wasn't about to let herself get sloppy; she had to make sure she was camera ready in case this assignment didn't get wrapped up as soon as she would have liked...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven still, it was an especially chilly day. Goosebumps ran up and down her arms, her hair standing on end. Something about seeing a wide open campus like this, almost devoid of life, made her uneasy. Even still, it was the first steps of her first actual exercise session in God knew how long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNestling her cordless headphones into the small of her ears, old-school Hillary Heart was jamming out before she took her first steps. She had barely gotten out of her driveway, her back turned towards the cabin, when one of the golf carts that drove around campus like slot cars slowed its pace to ride behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rach!\" a familiar voice called out over the sound of her music, \"Hey Rachel, where're ya going?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel stopped and turned as soon as she realized that she was being hailed\u2014no easy feat, considering how loud she kept the music. The white golf cart puttering behind, then beside her carried the sizeable cargo that was Ms. Megan Porter. She was an Arts &amp; English teacher that taught down the hall from two to five in the afternoon, and was the unofficial welcoming wagon for new teachers along that wing in the main building. Rachel hadn't really had much of a choice in their friendship, but Megan was good people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Megan!\" her enthusiasm was genuine, the instant relief of putting off her exercise sent a quiet euphoria that widened her smile, \"I'm just headed out for the day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well the cafeteria's that way!\" Megan jammed a sausage thumb to the main building, her quivering mass of titflesh wobbled accordingly beneath her too-tight black sweater, \"You gonna go see the girls in the Masters?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I...\" Rachel gulped. Why was \"exercise\" such a dirty word around here, anyway, \"I was actually going for a jog.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you can't exercise on an empty stomach.\" Megan said as if it were the simplest thing in the world, \"C'mon, climb in and I'll give you a lift!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting aside her quiet unwillingness to actually begin her jogging, Rachel wasn't entirely convinced that some face time with Ms. Porter would be a bad thing. Megan Porter was easily one of the longest tenured teachers at the Academy, having taught here for fifteen years. She'd changed hats a couple of times, but besides that feedbag Polluck, Megan was one of the most senior members on staff. Some face-to-face interface would be good for taking notes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd getting some lunch. Rachel <i>was</i> a little hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got me there.\" the smaller woman smiled as she climbed in back, \"Lead the way, Meg.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Porter was not only one of the most tenured teachers on staff, but also one of the largest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to have weighed more than four hundred pounds of busty yuppie blubber\u2014most of it settling in her gargantuan chest. Those mammoth masses that she called mammaries were county-fair sized; their sheer mass was emphasized by her peculiar choice in wearing exclusively sweaters. They were enormous, resting like overripe pumpkins on a sloping stomach that swung side to side when she waddled around campus. Her chin hung low and mushroomed into a smaller third below it that only grew in size whenever she spoke. Or ate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn weekends, the cafeteria in the main building was closed off to students so that faculty and staff might use it exclusively. It wasn't a popular decision, at least not with the students, but it at least cut down on the number of people who might overhear Rachel asking questions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it gave her a chance to get some of the cobbler before those grabby girls could get to it\u2014some of those kids were <i>mean</i>!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I <i>love</i> the Salisbury steak.\" Megan said in a thick voice as she lowered a forkful of the stuff into her mouth, chins bulging and tongue lolled, \"I love lots of the food here, but this stuff\u2014<i>mm</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel couldn't disagree. Buttercombe's choice in menu was always top-knotch, and the quality was incomparable. That was, in part, why she had gone up a size or two since she started. And she suspected that it had something to do with Megan's overall girth as she wolfed down her second helping since they'd sat down about ten minutes ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like the cobbler, myself.\" Rachel smiled, making conversation as best she could while Megan enjoyed herself, \"Probably a little too much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what you mean.\" the big busty blonde breathily answered as she savored another mouthful of her lunch, \"It's so hard to diet around here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel thought distastefully back to her belly blubber, or the extra inch that hung from her arms. It certainly <i>was</i> hard to diet in a fat farm like this. The only thing there was to do around here was eat, and every possible need was taken care of by some possibly (probably) malevolent megacorporation. There was literally zero incentive to exercise besides the view, and they had golf-carts for anyone who needed to get around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's always been that way though.\" Megan continued, \"I think I was about as big as you are when I came here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel grimaced at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah? So you've been here...\" her reporter's intuition tingling, she guessed that Megan wasn't exactly sensitive about her size, \"...a while then, I take it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan snorted, her fat chins flexing as she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well this doesn't just happen overnight\u2014trust me when I say that, newbie.\" she pressed into the side of her stomach as it cut into the table, sloshing it with one wide wobbling arm, \"But yeah I've been here for a <i>long</i> time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... do you think I could ask you some questions?\" Rachel faltered. Can't make this sound too official. She quickly added, \"Just about this place. My girls have been asking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shoot.\" Megan said before filling her jowls with more mashed potatoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel should guide the discussion towards...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Now, maybe it was because of her recent weight gain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel <i>knew</i> that she should talk to as many people as possible about the Yeng Corporation and its ties to Buttercombe Academy. The official story was that they were simply sponsors for the remote school, but with this much of their tech (or at least, products that could be linked back to them through shell corporations) even someone who wasn't investigating them would think that something was strange. And since Megan Porter had been at the school pre-Yeng, she might be able to shed some light on how it all began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel <i>knew</i> that she should have definitely asked that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut ever since she had gotten to this school, fat had been on her brain. A lot of the students were fat. Most of the teachers. And not just average, every day fat. Some of the girls on campus were bigger than Rachel had ever seen with her own two eyes. Sitting in front of her, Megan Porter was easily one of the fattest people that Rachel had ever <i>met</i>! That hog of a headmistress Ms. Polluck was even worse, and there were rumors of some students who were even bigger than the ones that Rachel had seen. Super-sized ones who were placed on the school's disability program, SSS, and shunted away to finish their studies in their dorm rooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn't normal. Technology or not, once Rachel had actually gotten onsite, the obesity epidemic on this campus was had caught her attention. Maybe Gia, or her superiors, didn't see it that way. But if they could have seen all four-hundred-plus pounds of Megan porter wolfing down her lunch like her life depended on it, maybe they would change their minds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you're not gonna make a lot of friends asking questions like that.\" Megan's tone changed slightly; it was less jovial and a little curt. Rachel feared that she had touched a nerve, \"Us big girls can be a little sensitive about our size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite outward appearances, Megan apparently wasn't as secure in her extreme girth as her jokes would have had Rachel believe. Her reporter's skills were sharp, and she could tell that may have cost her a couple of points with her fellow teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I mean is...\" Rachel took a deep breath, \"There are just a <i>lot</i> of... <i>bigger</i> girls here. Is that recent?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, most of us porked out the old fashioned way.\" Megan stabbed at what remained of her steak, \"Like you will, if you keep it up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan was right\u2014Rachel might not have realized it, but she'd wolfed down her lunch almost automatically. As soon as they'd sat down, she'd been too distracted by Megan hoovering her food to realize that she was taking pretty big bites herself. The main course was done and she'd been working on her dessert not even twenty minutes into their meeting. Rachel wisely pushed her almost-empty plate away from her, lest she keep chowing down on that cobbler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I'm not trying to be mean.\" she smiled, \"It's just... I can't help but notice that there's not a lot to <i>do</i> up here but... well, eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large woman paused and visibly softened her stiffened exterior. Her meaty shoulders slumped and a small smile tugged at the corners of her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... you've got that right at least.\" she relented, \"It gets pretty boring up here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And there are vending machines <i>all over the place</i>...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's true.\" Megan smiled a little wider, \"There's one right outside my classroom in the Masters building.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood\u2014whatever damage Rachel might have made by being so direct about the subject had been at least bandaged. Megan went right back to eating at her regular pace, even if her eye contact was a bit shoddy. Rachel had never stopped to consider how she must feel, getting grilled by someone who was a third... <i>fourth</i> of her current weight, almost. And a new teacher too, she could really ruffle some feathers if she wasn't careful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mine too.\" Rachel laughed, \"What's your favorite?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh\u2014like you have to ask.\" Megan leaned her head back and made a throaty moan, \"Those little chocolate cupcakes that come two to a pack. I lovelove<i>love</i> those.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have to try some next time.\" <i>If I can fit into my classroom... man I'm stuffed!</i> \"Its weird\u2014seems like <i>everyone</i> has a vending machine near their rooms.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right?\" Megan leaned in, the pool of her belly gaining ground on the table in front of her as her tits shifted to their new slope, \"There's like four or five on every hall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel's interest piqued\u2014she'd never been above the second floor on the main building, and she'd never so much as ventured into the Vandergriff or the Masters yet. Four or five on every hall? That was at least forty vending machines crammed into each building! Looking at some of the students and teachers, she believed the demand for large amounts of junk food. But packing them full at every angle... something seemed awfully strange about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Oh no! I'm never going to be able to cut back at this rate.\" Rachel whined, but not without purpose, \"Do you think maybe you could tell me where some are in our building? Just so I can avoid them, of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so Megan prattled off an oddly specific list of machines and their locations. There were of course the ones located in the cafeteria of the main building, then the four on the East wing's first floor, the five on the West wing's, and then five on each floor of each wing from there. With the one in the administrative lobby that she had seen when she first set foot on campus and the one just outside of Ms. Polluck's office (big guess as to why) that made 43 vending machines in this building alone!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good luck \"avoiding\" them though.\" Megan added with a snort, \"I swear, some of the stuff in there is <i>so good</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah...\" Rachel committed the layout of the machines to memory, \"Thanks again, Meg, but I think I'm going to head back to my cabin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. You're going to go <i>jog</i>?\" Ms. Porter laughed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way, I'm <i>way</i> too full.\" <i>of work to do</i>, \"But uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel slid the half-eaten slice of cobbler closer to the massive woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feel free to have the rest of my cobbler.\"</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rachel started by making a map of the main building. Starting in the atrium that led to the cafeteria and parted on either side to get to the East and West wings, two vending machines were right outside the cafeteria doors. They were bright and colorful, flashing ads detailing the snacks that were inside as well as display critical school news bulletin-style across the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were sleek, monolithic things. Easily taller than any of the students or teachers that frequented them, Yeng's vending machines were towering behemoths that were mostly comprised of an LED touchscreen. You held out your bracelet, activated the vendor, and then selected from a visual display the kind of snack(s, in most cases around here!) that you wanted to purchase. Most of the tab was covered by an extensive grant included in tuition for students, and employment for teachers. But as Rachel understood it, faculty received a discount. Which was probably good, because these things were going to be seeing a <i>lot</i> of her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had a nasty hunch that the placement of these things was crucial to their purpose on the school grounds. Every teacher that she'd spoken to seemed to be placed near one of the vending machines, so they got plenty of use from students and teachers (and Rachel, though she was ashamed to admit it!) every hour on the hour. As her venture into the main building after hours proved, they even remained operational after curfew, so that midnight snackers could get their fix. Presumably this counted for the ones placed on the dormitory halls here in the main building, as well as the Polluck and Harrington dorms across the courtyard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel cursed to herself as she caught the small red glare at the top of the device just outside the cafeteria. There was a camera in each and every one of those things. Because of course there was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was going to make this especially painful. She couldn't just <i>walk up</i> to each of the vendors individually. She was going to have to do this smart. Make it look like she wasn't doing much of anything but exploring the campus and stopping for a snack. If there was anything insidious about these things, it was going to take time. A few days, maybe, if she played her cards right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe <i>wanted</i> exercise, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to what?\" Gia asked incredulously on the other end of the secured line<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to check these vending machines out and see if there's anything weird about them.\" Rachel hissed into the receiver, \"See if they're... I don't know, hypnotizing these kids into stuffing their faces all day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you going to do <i>that</i>?\" Gia asked, the sound of crinkling plastic filling the earpiece, \"Walk up and hit them? I thought I told you to worry about the tech they're peddling onto these kids.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This <i>is</i> tech.\" Rachel corrected her informant, \"Except instead of tablets and computers, I'm just going to see if they're fucking with these kids subliminally. There's a USB port on every one of them. You gave me that extractor for things just like this, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gave you that extractor so you could use it on their central computers.\" Gia corrected her flatly, pausing for a bit to take a bite of something, \"But hey, if you want to use it to knock off a bunch of vending machines, can't say I blame you. This shit's good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... you're <i>eating</i> that stuff?\" Rachel groaned, \"Gia I told you to check them out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I did\u2014with my mouth.\" whatever she'd been eating, she was finished. The crinkling plastic sound was gone. \"Look, if this gets you off this weird fixation you have with how fat everyone is up there, I'm okay with it. But after this, no more. You either get me something to go with or you get your head in the game. Deal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal.\" Rachel relented<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And send more of those Apple Pies.\" Gia said, opening another one, \"Y'know they taste just like the shit down at the office? Can't get enough of that shit.\"</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Over the course of the next few days, Rachel would find herself becoming very acquainted with the layout of the campus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd been given a map when she first signed on to teach, and another during orientation. Due to the size of the school, each building received a pull-out chart that folded into a larger pamphlet, as well as a broader map that covered the rest of the school in less detail. Using the one for the main building, Rachel began to tick off the locations of the vending machines that she already knew\u2014the one outside of her classroom, the two outside of the cafeteria, and the one in the administrative lobby\u2014and set to work on deciphering the rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a school as geared towards gluttony as Buttercombe, it wasn't hard to make excuses as to why she was frequenting the machines so much. With as many as there were, she could make her way towards most of them without much further of a walk than it was to the one right outside her classroom. The problem was often how to approach a particular machine without the camera catching her sticking the data extractor into the barely-visible USB port.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While you ladies take your quiz, I'm going to run to the vending machine.\" she would announce to her classes, \"Excuse me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of her students ignored her\u2014it wasn't like they hadn't heard of teachers frequenting the machines around here. Others were excited, seeing as their TV-ready teacher was becoming quite the Vending Machine Queen lately. Even if it meant more tests, the more sadistic students were happy to oblige if it meant their modelesque teacher was going to start officially porking out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, each trip, she'd go to a different machine. She'd slip the drive into the port as inconspicuously as possible, wait for a few minutes while it did its thing, before finally selecting a snack to take back with her. Sometimes it took her more than one or two trips, given the peculiar angles she sometimes had to approach these things with. She'd copy the data on the machine onto the extractor, go back to her classroom, and she'd usually use the treat as a sort of motivator for good behavior. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll that walking made a girl hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPretty soon she'd gotten all of the ones on the East wing's first floor. She couldn't make it look <i>too</i> conspicuous, since her account was surely being tracked even if the camera didn't catch her, so Rachel limited it to once per class and then twice during her free periods. Then came the West wing's first floor, and then she'd started snaking up and down the upper floors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of the week, there was some talk about Ms. Conrad's frequent absences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hear she's sneaking off to make out with Ms. Smith.\" one girl snickered an ugly face as she popped off-brand funyuns in her mouth<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way, she's just pigging out.\" said another, her belly wobbling, \"Have you seen her? She's gonna be as big as Ms. Porter by next semester.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't make any sense and is also impossible.\" said yet another student, \"I think she's pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>How</i>? This is an all-girls' school!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel's impromptu flights from her classroom meant that these girls were left unattended anywhere from 5 to 30 minutes, with the timespan leaning towards the latter as she ventured further and further away from her classroom. The elevators were slow and she had to allow her device adequate time to mine the programming of each, individual vending machine. If there was something going on, she had to be sure to get a good pool of information. She had to be sure before she sent anything to Gia that wasn't pertaining to what she was convinced she was looking for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was something up with these machines. She just knew it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry class, I just... lost track of the time!\" Rachel slipped the drive back into her back pocket, which was growing increasingly snug as of late, \"Hand in your quizzes and we'll\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBRRRRRRING<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of the class bell filled the room as huffy heifers instinctively began to pack their things. Full bellies and big butts collided as the swollen senior class shuffled awkwardly in a room that was clearly inadequate for housing girls of such peculiar size all together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get back to it tomorrow.\" Rachel sighed, \"Have a nice day, everyone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCollapsing back into her chair, Rachel let her head roll back as a weary groan escaped her. All the walking she'd been doing lately had been killer on her calves, and she hadn't exactly had the chance to adjust her diet any. All the junk food wasn't helping either. She knew that something was up, but the food here really was good! The snacks especially. Rachel wasn't sure what it was, but it was awfully hard to say no when you were making <i>that</i> many trips to the vending machines each day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got to get to the bottom of this...\" the brunette woman groaned as she opened a bag of sour cream and onion chips, \"...fast.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As mentioned previously, Rachel had a dedicated map of all of the locations that Yeng's (potentially) insidious vending machines were located across the main building. In a perfect world, she'd also have included the machines from the Vandergriff and the Masters building, as well as the ones in the dormitories. However, she didn't have that kind of time. Gia wanted something sent to her by tomorrow as it was, and there was just one problem with her map:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was one machine that she hadn't gotten to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the one on the fourth floor of the East Wing, nestled in a little nook that had absolutely no purpose of being there except to piss Rachel off. It almost entirely obscured the USB port that Rachel had been slipping the drive in and out from machine to machine, and made it impossible for her to approach the machine from the opposite end. That meant that she had to walk <i>past</i> the camera attached to the front of the vendor and try to not make it look like she was shoving a thumb drive into an exposed port.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Rachel wanted to ensure that she got <i>everything</i> in this building, she would have to get the data from that vending machine. If it was the only one broadcasting subliminal messages, or if it was the only one that contained experimental food, if it was the <i>only one</i> in this whole building that contributed towards making these teachers and these kids as fat as holy hell, Rachel had an obligation to making sure that she got it. Though, given the size of their consumer pool and the frequency with which they were visited, Rachel doubted just one machine was to blame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of her girls had gotten wedged in the doorway the other day. That kind of thing didn't happen at normal schools. Poor Augusta Grant, such a sweetheart, had gone and eaten herself so round that she got caught booty-first by the frame of the classroom door. She had been mortified, and it had taken three girls to help get her out. Rachel could still see the poor thing crying, tears rolling down her chubby face as she was told to go to the office. Rachel heard talk about them upping her SSS\u2014she wasn't entirely sure what that meant, but from everything she'd gotten to know about Buttercombe, it surely didn't mean that they were going to put her on a diet and exercise program.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, Rachel had crafted a pretty believable alibi of being a flighty, forgetful teacher. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Rio!\" Rachel waved the security guard down late at night, \"I forgot my... bag.... in my classroom again. Do you think you could help me out by giving me a lift?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For you, Ms. Conrad?\" The humongously hippy Hispanica said in a relaxed tone, \"Anything. Climb in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the extra twenty(-ish) pounds that Rachel had gained, squeezing up front with Rio like she had that first night here would have been impossible. Thankfully, it wasn't all her fault. Rio had put on just as much (if not more, somehow!) weight as Rachel had, most of it settling in her big blobby behind that commanded even more space than her doughy hanging gut. It spread further out in the bench seating of her security cart, and bulged against the driver's side door like khaki-colored cookie dough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Rachel whipped the plastic bag of  some of the goodies she'd squirreled away after all her vending machine runs this week, \"You're a lifesaver.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRio's greedy mitts were chubby wrist deep into the bag before they moved an inch. God that woman could suck down snack food. She was reason enough alone to suspect that something was up. Quitting smoking didn't turn you into a junk food addict over night, and the decidedly smaller (though by no means svelte) picture on her ID card told Rachel's reporter instinct that she hadn't been working here long enough to do <i>that</i> much damage to her girlish figure. At least, not under normal circumstances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could say the same about you.\" Rio smacked her lips, crumbs from her coffee cake spewing down onto her uniform, \"I was just getting a hankering!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRio had told her she had twenty minutes to get her things, so there was no rush. It took five minutes to get from the main building to Rio's check-in center near Rachel's cabin, so that meant that she had fifteen minutes. But since she wasn't <i>going</i> to her room and was, instead, hiking up four flights of stairs, that meant she had ten minutes, tops. The elevators were too slow\u2014she'd have to take the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich, admittedly given her doughier physique, was a poor choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoor Rachel sprinted as fast as she could up those four flights of stairs (or was it eight? She never really figured how that ratio worked) and by the time she reached the third floor, her second wind had come and gone already. She trudged up the last flight like she was wearing ankle weights, and she'd actually broken a sweat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe <i>had</i> to get out and actually jog one of these days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe silver lining was that the vending machine was literally right there outside the door to the stairs. That stupid nook carved into the wall served absolutely no purpose\u2014it was a remnant of a time when this hall had been smaller, and the staircase had been added later as an afterthought. All that extra slab of brick did was shield the port on that stupid vendor...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd put her dead-set in the camera's line of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo time for planning. She was already two minutes behind schedule (running was hard!) no time for subtlety, no time for pretending. Just plug in the drive, get in, and get out. Rachel applied a modest amount of pressure against the machine and leaned it ever so slightly so as to get the proper space for her extractor to fit. Then, while she waited, she slid her wrist along the machine and selected the customary caboodle of coffee cakes for Rio to help keep her quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small red light caught her attention. That had just been the extractor, right? It was so hard to tell in the dark. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes more and... YES!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nData extracted and coffee cakes delivered. Now just to make it back downstairs...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only question that nagged at the back of Rachel's mind as she sputtered down the hall... what was that red light?</span></div></div>",

Part of it was her being out of shape, and the other part of it was tensions running high. It was the adrenaline of having everything she needed to send Gia's way that kept her going at such a pace. She hadn't moved that fast in... <i>ever</i>, honestly. Recent lack of exercise not withstanding, Rachel had never been a particularly fast girl. Tonight may well have been the sole exception if things kept going at the pace they were headed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRio's cart puttered back up to the security post by the cabins. Rachel rolled out, her legs sore from all the running around she'd done today. It was intense\u2014if she'd been even a minute later than normal, Rio would have been late to report in. And then that would have caused problems for her poor hapless getaway driver. As much as she didn't want to get caught, she really didn't want to inconvenience poor Rio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's me.\" Rachel smiled uneasily, \"Lucky as can be...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe held the drive in her hand, her knuckles whitening as her grip tightened. This drive may not have had anything important on it, but at the very least it was a way to satisfy her suspicions. If Yeng had been sending subliminal messages to the kids and the teachers of this academy, then Gia and her team would no doubt be able to decipher them a lot better than she would. And if they weren't, then it was back to square one. But at least she would know that was one thing they could cross off the list.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You feeling okay?\" Rio made a face, \"You look sick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No.\" Rachel took a half-step back. Play it cool. \"Just... y'know, lots of running. It's late. I'm pretty tired.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRio paused and scrunched her brow a bit. But ultimately she relented with a hearty, gut-wobbling laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hear that. Some girls just aren't made for running!\" her grating laugh bellowed into the night, \"You go home and get some sleep. Glad to know you got what you needed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, the blob-bootied guard puttered back towards the courtyard. Rachel hurried as fast as she could back into her cabin. She waved her wrist in front of the door and yanked it open as soon as it would let her. She could hear her heartbeat behind her eardrums\u2014this was it. This was something big, she just knew it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow to copy the data that she'd mined onto the SSD that Gia had given her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1 terabyte of data?! What the hell was on those machines?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel leaned back into her office chair and groaned. This was going to be a long night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was two more weeks and another ten pounds added to Rachel's chubbing frame before Gia came back with anything substantial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThirty pounds up since her enrollment at Buttercombe Academy, putting her at 150 pounds. Still a long ways away from some of the heavyweights that toddled around campus, but far from her ideal shape. Her belly was round and she felt like it jiggled whenever she walked. None of her pants fit\u2014she'd had to go into town and buy new ones\u2014and perhaps most damning of all, she'd detected a hint of a double chin in the mirror a few days ago. Rachel couldn't bear the thought of ever having more than one chin in her life! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalloween was just around the corner too, and everyone was in the spirit for sweets. Candy was being tossed around left and right from student and faculty alike. Rachel was so stressed out that she couldn't help herself from nibbling here or there. Or ten pounds in two weeks worth of \"here or there.\" She felt like a balloon lately, and only good news from Gia would turn the tide...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, with the bombshell that Gia dropped on her, Rachel was much more shocked than relieve to hear that...</span></div></div>",

She sounded haggard, like she hadn't been sleeping well, \"The second one, I mean. We're still trying to see what we can piece together off of the one you sent us back in September.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel hadn't spoken to Gia much since she sent this drive. It had been maybe ten days since she heard from her informant last. But the now signature crinkling of plastic wrapping that came from the outside of snack cakes had become ever present in their conversations. Rachel hadn't thought about it much\u2014the sound had become almost like a heartbeat to her after eating all that junk food, she barely noticed it anymore. But hearing that the vending machines weren't tampered with or loaded with any extraneous or otherwise insidious programming to affect the minds of the faculty and staff juxtaposed with Gia's newfound snacking habits was disconcerting to say the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I wasted all that time...\" Rachel was crestfallen by the realization that her hunch was wrong. Her hunches were never wrong!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, you didn't <i>waste</i> it.\" Gia corrected her sternly, \"It got you on the right track. Because now you're going to drop this stupid dietary angle and you're going to do what you got sent over there to do in the first place. Which is to get friendly with the technology that they're giving the students.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel couldn't believe it. She'd spent weeks gearing up for this lead and now it was nothing. Worse than nothing, even. She would have really liked to believe that her recent weight gain could at least be blamed <i>in part</i> by some form of insidious outer source affecting her in some way. But no, those extra thirty pounds that she'd packed on since the school year began... that was all her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then maybe they're affecting us chemically.\" Rachel attempted to argue, \"O-Or maybe it's a combination of factors that\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Rachel, we didn't send you there to figure any of that shit out.\" Gia commanded, the sound of her fist slamming against the desk was unmistakable. She exhaled, calming herself, and continued at a more friendly, but still very stern tone of voice. \"You've been assigned, and given the tools, to investigate Yeng's ties to Buttercombe Academy <i>technologically</i>. You can't just switch your assignment. If you think there's chemical stuff going on up there, neato, send me some samples and I'll have someone look at them. But it's gonna take a while, Rachel!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe investigative reporter let out a long, grueling sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst the button on her pants popped, and now this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I'm gonna send you the data miner back. But it's gonna take a while.\" Gia finally said after an awkward silence between the two of them, \"It's a lot easier to get stuff <i>out</i> of that place than it is to get stuff in. You'll probably have it by the end of November. So in the meantime just... relax, I guess. Keep doing your legwork, hang low to the ground in case you hear anything. I'll be in touch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel threw the phone across the room and fell back onto the sofa. In her frustration, she grabbed a throw pillow and screamed as loud as she could into it, letting the stuffing muffle her cries of anguish. <i>GOD</i> she was beginning to hate this assignment! Late hours, getting yelled at by Gia, being wrong about the <i>one</i> thing she was certain about! She'd spent almost two months on that lead, and all she had learned was that, as far as stupid Gia and her stupid lab tech could see, the vending machines were clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel threw the pillow at the wall (it landed next to the phone) and let silence fill the cabin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was going to be the longest job of her life.</span></div></div>",

Getting to know the ins and outs of those vending machines had made it awfully convenient for her to satisfy her sugar cravings at just about any time of the day, and about anywhere in the main building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, she'd told herself that she'd start cutting back. She'd have to soon, if she wanted to have any hope of keeping herself slim. But gorging herself for the past few weeks, sampling from literally every machine in the building, <i>knowing</i> how good they were... it was hard!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that she couldn't do much actual detective work Rachel could work out a more stable sleep schedule, which in turn allowed her to carve out a nice little routine. Every morning she'd wake up early enough to get breakfast with some of the other teachers. She'd ask about a hunch here or there, but for the most part it was simply her making friends. Brooke Smith and Megan Porter were frequently her go-to gals for mealtimes around here, and they had turned out to be her dietary undoing far many times than Rachel cared to admit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, breakfast is the most important meal of the day!\" Megan would tempt her newbies into getting another plate almost every day, piling her own platters high with bacon and eggs and grits and toast and jellies and jams, biscuits and ham... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was mesmerizing\u2014Rachel had never had anything like the food that they served here. No one in her family was a particularly good cook, but she'd gone undercover at a few restaurants when she was investigating police corruption. High-end places, too. They had nothing on whatever those cafeteria ladies were peddling. Rachel would usually stop at seconds (usually) but it was getting harder and harder to say no...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich was why she put her knowledge of the vending machines to good use! Rachel found herself getting so hungry throughout the day, she knew that if she went to lunch with her friends, she'd pig out. So she put her layout of the school's snack machines to good use! A few snacks a day, just to keep the edge off of her hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that it helped much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith nothing to do other than be a good little Buttercombe Bee, Rachel found herself packing on the pounds at an astonishing rate. By the time Halloween rolled around, she was sitting at just over 160, a full forty pounds over her starting weight! How anyone could gain forty pounds in two months was beyond her\u2014it just wasn't possible! Though between her and Brooke, who'd kept pace with Rachel for every pound she'd gained, it seemed as though anything was possible when Yeng was involved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was no concept of a <i>normal</i> portion size here. Anyone and everyone piled their plates high and snacked frequently and almost always ordered food to their dorms or cabins after dinner at least once a week. The groceries were even taken care of by the Academy, so who <i>knows</i> how many portion sizes she was actually eating even when she did eat at home...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UGHHH.\" Rachel collapsed on her queen-sized bed, belly bulging out from underneath her favorite t-shirt, \"THIS IS RIDICULOUS.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel Conrad was getting fat, and fast. Pumping herself full of calories day in and day out, stuffing herself some days until she felt like she might explode, was taking its toll in a heartbeat. It was just halfway through November, and she had put on yet another ten pounds. That put her <i>dangerously</i> close to the big 2-0-0, and she had no <i>logical</i> reason to suspect anyone but herself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fleshy gut rose high over her chest, her thicker limbs spread-eagle across the surface of her messy bed. It swayed from side to side, sloshing lazily as it reverberated from her dramatic fall onto the comforter. Rachel's full stomach carried the brunt of the dietary bullet she'd bitten, with only a modest increase in her bras and the seat of her khakis. What's worse, her arms were starting to get wobble and her double chin was growing by the day\u2014the most <i>unattractive</i> places to gain.

Almost two hundred pounds and getting closer by the day, Rachel had never been this heavy in her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween the stress of her job as a teacher and the stress of being an investigative reporter <i>casing</i> the school she was teaching at, running a classroom, doing her legwork <i>and</i> getting all of it wrong (if you'd asked Gia!) food had been a pretty steady constant in her life as an English teacher at Buttercombe Academy. She felt stressed all day, and food was <i>everywhere</i>. She knew that she should try to control herself, but everything was <i>so</i> good, and Gia had made it very clear that there wasn't anything insidious about the machines that peddled out junk food on every hall...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich was why Rachel had started getting most of her sugar cravings during her free periods. Just a few snacks to help tide her over until lunch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel walked back to her empty classroom from the vending machine just outside, arms carrying no less than five assorted snacks clutched tightly to her chest. A package of cupcakes, an apple pie, some mini donuts, and two of the coffee cakes. Rio was right when she said that these things were good. She'd already started wolfing down one package by the time she opened the door to her classroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaving her wrist (and coffee cake) in front of the padlock, Rachel's bracelet unlocked the door. Balancing her junk food and her free fingers, Rachel tip-toed back inside and bumped the door shut with her sizeable rump. Her eyes narrowed longingly at her newfound favorite as she peeled the wrapper back just enough for her to wrap her lips around the bittersweet treat...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Ms. Conrad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she promptly spewed flaky brown crumbs everywhere at the unexpected intrusion of one Dr. Fukuda Hinamizawa\u2014a name that Rachel was all too aware of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had been the head of the Yeng R&amp;D department back in Daven's Port when Yeng first broke ground overseas. She had been the public face of the company, for the most part, before quietly fading into obscurity until the news broke that Yeng would sponsor Buttercombe Academy by providing them with technology. It was even less well-known that she had taken an administrative position as Buttercombe Academy's Vice Principal. That hog of a headmistress Ms. Polluck was too busy suckling on Yeng's teat to run this place effectively anymore, and everyone on-site knew that Fukuda was the one who held the most authority. She was one of the main reasons that Rachel was even here\u2014rumors of her laundering money through the Academy, tampering with technology to engineer a new generation of faithful consumers, and an entire department of the Daven's Port R&amp;D team had disappeared at the same time she took her job here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA personal visit from the Good Doctor herself was... not reassuring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a small woman\u2014a little soft around the middle. She'd developed a decided middle-aged spread as she entered her forties, her hips had filled out and there was a noticeable amount of pudge that hung around her middle. Not that Rachel was anyone to judge\u2014she'd gained enough to have forty pounds on this woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspecially since she screamed like a little girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You scared me!\" Rachel grunted a she bent over to pluck all of her snacks off of the floor, \"Dr. Hinamizawa, what are you doing here?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel's excitement seemed to amuse the small Japanese woman. A small smile came into being and a little laugh might have escaped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I frighten you?\" she asked in her still very heavily accented English, \"I apologize for the intrusion Ms. Conrad. I only require a moment of your time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel's heart was pounding. Not only because she was scared but because... well, she was <i>scared</i>! There were stories of people who crossed Yeng who never came back into the real world again. Mostly rumors, but rumors substantial enough that she had been forced to take this assignment undercover. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she'd been found out... it was over for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright?\" Fukuda asked with a curious cock of her eyebrow, \"You're sweating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, no I'm...\" Rachel exhaled, \"I'm fine. Just... rattled is all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinamizawa chuckled again before continuing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, of course.\" she said with that eerie little non-smile that she wore, \"I would just like to discuss the matter of...</span></div></div>",

And if word had gotten out about how \"forgetful\" the new English III/IV teacher was from Rio, Dr. Hinamizawa might have been talking about her not-quite breaking and entering of the main building more than a couple of times since she'd enrolled. If you looked at it objectively, without knowing that Rachel was an investigative reporter, then yeah... she looked pretty flighty. Way different than how she presented herself during all of the interviews.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Right!\" Rachel corrected herself, \"My... health.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smaller woman tugged her lips to the side in a matronly sort of way. Like a mother who was worried about a child, rather than a superior who was upset over her subordinate's inability to perform.

Right then and there, she excused Rachel from teaching the rest of her classes for the day, as well as tomorrow, to help her \"recuperate\" from the stupid sickness that Rachel had already agreed to having. It wasn't like she could just backtrack and say \"oh no, I'm fine! I'm just flaky because I'm investigating literally every lead I can find to take you down!\" she'd already agreed to feeling nauseous and light-headed as well as achey and lethargic. And as she was heading out the door, that creepy doctor actually turned around and said to her:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Make sure you head over as soon as you can!\"</i> while holding up her black ID bracelet, <i>\"Remember, I'll know if you don't!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course those things were trackers. Why wouldn't they have been trackers? It made less sense for them not to be capable of tracking where someone was on a campus as vast and loomingly malicious as this one! All that sneaking around, and Rachel had been wearing her bracelet the whole time! That was a definitely slip on her part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that wasn't important right now. What was important was how to get out of this shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I don't know about you, but I <i>really</i> don't like needles.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel's anxiety was real. Not because of the draw needle (at least not entirely) but because there was literally no way of knowing just what Nurse Fukiyama was about to put into her body. It could have been anything\u2014Yeng owned the company that put it out and developed it, and they were about as shady as a giant malicious megacorporation could get! Plus it was blue. Nothing good that went into your body was blue!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does anyone?\" the tall Asian nurse laughed, \"Trust me, I've held plenty of peoples hands while they got their shots. It's not that weird, Rachel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever weight Shiro had put on since Rachel had seen her last was a non-issue. She looked more or less the same. Maybe a little softer, but she was still the skinniest member of the faculty by a mile. Did that make her suspicious? They'd started at the same time, so maybe...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was stupid. This was stupid. She was letting herself get worked up for nothing. Breathe, breathe Rachel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, now breathe.\" Shiro said as she swabbed Rachel's chubby upper arm, \"This is gonna be a little cold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCould Shiro be one of Yeng's lab monkeys? Surely not. She couldn't have been much older than Rachel was, and they'd started at the same time. And Shiro was so nice, and she genuinely seemed to care about the students and their weight. The disapproving look she'd gotten when she walked into her office, stress-snacking on a Mounds bar and a full fifty pounds heavier than just a few months ago, had been a reminder that not everyone was so wrapped up in enabling everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut maybe she didn't know what was in that needle either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-So uh...\" Rachel gulped, \"What kind of <i>side-effects</i> are we talking, Doc?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not a doctor.\" Shiro corrected with a little laugh, \"Relax, you'll be fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I mean, seriously sh-should I start looking out for anything?\" like blacking out and being shipped off to a Yeng facility somewhere? Like instantaneous death? Like mind-control devices or putting nanobots inside her bloodstream? What constituted science fiction anymore, anyway?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, maybe some of the stress was the needle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd much to Rachel's surprise, Shiro took her hand in hers and began to speak to her very softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is just to help you get acclimated to living up here in the mountains. Not enough oxygen is getting to your brain and it's affecting your body in lots of weird, unpredictable ways.\" she said very plainly, very soothingly as her thumb stroked the back of Rachel's hand, \"Dr. Hinamizawa says that you're experiencing all of the telltale signs of a kind of offshoot of HAS. Light-headedness, lethargy, weight gain and... I didn't want to believe it until now, paranoia. You'll feel a <i>lot</i> better after the weekend is over and you've had time to adjust.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLethary... weight gain... paranoia?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCould... could her entire investigation be explained away by suffering from... High Altitude Syndrome? Or at least some version of it. The first few days she'd felt pretty loopy, and she <i>had</i> been popping her ears a lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" Rachel exhaled, \"I think I'm ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, because it's already done.\" Shiro chirped happily, bouncing back up to a standing position while Rachel recoiled, \"I stuck you and you didn't even notice it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel went to rub the sore spot on her arm, but Shiro quickly slapped a bandage on it. The flab packed in the top half of her arm wobbled slightly, making Rachel frown tightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now go get some rest.\" the tall nurse pat her friend on the back, \"I'll let Dr. Hinamizawa know you got your shot\u2014you go grab a healthy dinner and get some bedrest.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>That shot was really miraculous for Rachel. After an evening of rest (and a few snacks) the stress vanished almost entirely. Maybe it was because she just learned they didn't suspect her so there was no risk for her, maybe she got so much in the role of \"being sick\" that she was convinced to have gotten better, or maybe whatever was in that needle helped her relaxing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis meant Rachel continued her teacher routine, which she got acclimated to: having large meals with her colleagues, trying some of the few snacks she hadn't tried yet, teaching, gorging before going to sleep... All of which had visible effects on Rachel's waistline. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, girls, *munch* who knows the error in this line?\" asked while writing on the blackboard. The chalk in one hand and a coffee cake in the other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, some of the students snickered and commented about the teacher's expanding waistline. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at that belly! Could she be pregnant?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pregnancy doesn't make you develop a double chin\" replied another one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel took another bite of her snack. \"Does one notice the mistake?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the students weren't the only ones to have noticed Rachel's expansion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you seen Ms. Conrad recently? If she goes on like this, she'll going to need a trolley to move around\" giggled Penny Price to Rebecca Von Spillum, despite the blonde herself having grown a large belly as well during those months, and some of her pink gut protruded under her pink sweater. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny was immediately caught by surprise as Rachel Conrad appeared behind the corner, with a dozen of snacks wrapped in her arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hello Rachel! How's teaching going? You look great with that new jacket!\" said the blonde teacher with an angelic voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel nodded, her chins quivered, as she waved her colleagues to go to her dorm for an evening of television and snacking, the usual routine after a morning of classes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDays passed, and then became weeks, and Rachel kept eating to her hearth's content. After all, she started receiving much praise for her work as a teacher, she reserved a reward every once in a while, or even every day. Rachel's snacks became more frequent, she even knew the locations of almost every vending machine (and her investigation didn't contribute as much as her newfound habits), her meal portions more abundant, and she developed the habit of getting at least thirds, thanks in part to the influence of her close colleague Megan Porter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Rachel, have you tried this cheesecake? It's delicious!\" cooed the large blonde. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll pick a slice, then, but first I want a couple more of these chicken wings\" replied Rachel as she poured some grease on the fried wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two woman ate together most if the times, along with Brooke Morrison, and the brunette's began to rival Megan Porter's in terms of sizes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all that time, Rachel had basically forgotten that she was a reporter, and fully embraced her role as Buttercombe's teacher. Eating more than ever, and that meant that she was gaining even faster than before. But Rachel didn't seem to notice nor care much, not even when all of her new clothes have become tight, she just couldn't give up such delicious treats. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout even realizing it, one day of December Rachel had crossed the dreaded two hundred pounds mark but instead of worrying about it she ate snacks for most of the evening, while laying on her queen sized bed and surrounded by delicious treats. Her stuffed round belly prevented the vision of her own feet, but that evening was fully dedicated to the snacks she brought in her dorm. After such a tiring day of lessons she needed it. Even the class homeworks, which had been laying on the desk for almost a week, could've waited another day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, a chocolate bar here and a cake snack there, Rachel gained a thick padding of fat for the Winter Holidays that rolled in, during which Rachel... </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been a half-day in celebration of the last day of the semester. Students and teachers alike were plenty pleased to be done with the stresses that came with their respective roles in the classroom, and everyone in the English department had decided to celebrate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had corralled themselves into an empty classroom after lunch, pushed the desks together, and piled the sizeable surfaces high with just about every kind of treat they could get their mitts on. Cakes and pies, cookies and cupcakes, plenty of candy, pretzels and bags upon bags of popcorn, chips, pretzels\u2014everyone ate like they were the very girls that they had been teaching, rather than respectable adults with more refined palettes. These well-fed educators stood around for an hour or two, making banal conversation while grazing mindlessly on a sizeable spread until there were no more snacks left to suck down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd mind you, this had taken place around one in the afternoon. By the time four 'o' clock in the evening rolled around, there was a special early supper for the faculty and staff to commemorate the end of the semester where everyone brought out all the stops. Bunnie Blake, the head of the culinary coalition for Buttercombe's staff, took great pride in December's feasting and made sure that everything was as irresistible as it was deliciously decadent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving fallen so completely in line with the gluttonous desires of her appetite, poor Rachel couldn't contain herself. She had become so used to the feeling of walking away from every table, literally heaving herself in some cases, that she saw nothing wrong with devouring her meals the way she did. Everything was so delicious, the synapses in her brain firing wildly as flavors and tastes and smells all worked together to overwhelm her fleeting sense of suspicion in this place. She toddled away from the cafeteria, turgid belly swaying in front of her, more stuffed than she'd ever been in her life. She couldn't even remember the drive back to her cabin\u2014her cart swaying on the sidewalk as her swimmy head and sensibilities kept lulling her into a stuffed, stupid slumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had come home to her cabin, belly fit to burst, and collapsed spread-eagle on her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wouldn't wake up until hours later, when her phone began to ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sharp sound of her beartooth's awful ringtone forced her awake with a loud snort. She instinctively leaned forward, struggling against her still swollen stomach. It had pinned her down, rising heavily into the air and out from underneath her now buttonless blouse. She was still horrendously full, and battling her belly wasn't exactly a winning fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Comin'!\" Rachel rolled off of her bed, landing on her feet and waddling arch-backed to her dresser, \"Comin' comin' comin'...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a deep breath and composed herself, her heartbeat racing. It had been quite some time since she'd spoken to Gia. Almost a month. Rachel had been a little... preoccupied. She was honestly more exhausted than she was frightened, though. The pain in her belly weighed more heavily on her mind than the butterflies in her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gia! Hi!\" she said, a little too chipper and a little too breathlessly, \"How're you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm alright.\" Gia answered in a strange way, \"You okay Rach? You sound like you just ran a marathon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel swore inwardly and did her best to correct her breathing. She hadn't exercised at all since she'd been here, stuffing her face day in and day out. It was no wonder she was breathing like a hog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... I'm fine. So... what's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you tell me\u2014any new information you'd like to share with me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel thought back over the last month. She honestly hadn't been doing much observing lately. November just sort've... flew by. It was like a blur of food. The stress of finals, Thanksgiving, it all just melted together into one delicious creamy spread. Rachel had been so preoccupied with her appetite that she'd barely noticed that she was crawling into December...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not... really.\" Rachel winced, \"I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine\u2014I didn't think you'd be able to explore that tech angle much until the extractor came in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel thought placidly to the box that had been sitting on her kitchenette counter for the past week or so. God she really hoped that Gia hadn't been tracking that thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right! I, uh... just got it today!\" Rachel lied, \"Yep. Got it this morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a small silence. Dammit, Gia had been tracking that thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\" she said in an awkward, transitive sort of way, \"Well, good. That means you haven't used it yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We finally found something on that drive you sent us a while ago. The first one, back when you first started. That thing had been scrubbed pretty clean, but we managed to piece together something about a program called SSS.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel thought back to the pieces of information that she'd picked up concerning the program. Special Services for Stipendiaries\u2014apparently a lot of girls were on it. Some teachers too. It was supposed to be for disabilities, but a lot of girls here wound up getting placed on it due to their weight. Some of the teachers had been placed on it too; a couple of the larger cabins were SSS-equipped, though what made them different other than their size, Rachel couldn't have possibly told you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I've heard a thing or two about that.\" Rachel puffed, gaining her composure, \"It's like this disability service.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if its a disability service, it's one of the weirdest ones I've ever heard of.\" Gia said flatly, the sound of rustling plastic wrapping finally making its reappearance, \"Discounted food from the vending machines, cut prices for meals and handwaived room service. Not only that, but SSS kids and teachers who are on the program <i>regularly</i>, like say for a long-term disability, get upgraded electronics for free. There're a couple of notes here about Group A and Group B, but we couldn't really figure out much more than that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm Group B.\" Rachel looked to her bracelet\u2014tight around her chunky wrist\u2014\"Group B is faculty and staff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you on SSS?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel pressed into her soft stomach regretfully <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>At least not yet, but at this rate...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGod, she had to start jogging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that sucks, because we really need to see what's going on with that program.\" Gia clicked her tongue, \"Kids and teachers who are on that program get exposed to all kinds of Yeng tech. You put that extractor in all of the tech connected to the personal network up there, and we'd really be able to do some digging.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't know what to tell you.\" Rachel said, huffy. <i>Sorry I'm not <u>fat</u> enough for you, Gia!</i>, \"But the only people I've seen on that program are really fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a moment of silence between the two colleagues. And Rachel really didn't like where it was headed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Rachel Conrad...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rachel was dumbfounded. Her eyes blinked twice. \"Wait, did I hear that well? Did you tell me that I need to get into SSS?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, your ears work well, it's exactly what I said\" replied Gia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that means...\" Rachel gulped, dreading the words she was about to say. \"It means I have to... Get... Fat...\" concluded, avoiding deliberately the word \"Fatter\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that's the only way, yeah. Unless you prefer breaking your leg or losing an eye\" commented Gia. \"After all, you told me you've already gained some weight, didn't you?\" asked in a teasing tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel looked at her belly, still stuffed and stiff, while her face became red. \"Yes, but it's just a few pounds!\" Said, as if more than 80 pounds could be called \"a few\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, just gain \"a few\" more, then. I have to go, now. See you in a few weeks\" said Gia before hanging up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, wait, Gia! Do I really have to become super fat?\" yelled Rachel, but the phone call was already over. She waited a few moments, hoping to hear a \"no\" among that silence. But no answer came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel put the phone back to the table and collapsed on her bed. Her eyes wide open gazed at the roof for a minutes before giving herself an answer. \"I have to become super fat\" and her eyes moved to her round belly, that blocked her the view of her own feet. Just how big would it become? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, Rachel officially began her mission: gaining weight in the fastest way possible. <br>\r\nAn hour after the phone call, just the time to digest a bit, she picked paper and pen and prepared her \"workup routine\" (the brunette noticed the irony that she always delayed that when she needed to lose weight but now that she needed to get fat she didn't waste time to begin working on it), after ten minutes of writing, she rolled up the paper and threw it in the bin, realizing she just needed to do three simple things: eat, gorge and stuff herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree things Rachel did every day with nonchalance, she could almost consider herself a talent in that regard, but now she needed even more. Since there wouldn't have been any lesson for a while, it was the perfect day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel sighed. \"Well, I was probably going to end up there anyway. I'm just making things quicker\" said once she mentally accepted her mission. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer new \"work out routine\" was to wake up early in the morning, have an healthy breakfast, then go back to her cabin and stuff herself while watching the tv for all morning, then go back to the cafeteria for a large lunch, then spend all afternoon in her cabin to gorge herself, then have a large dinner in the cafeteria, and a final snack before going to sleep. Another rule she imposed herself was to pick a few snacks whenever she passed in front of a vending machine, that way she would have had something to eat almost every moment of the day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first days were tough for Rachel, and almost forced herself to eat almost insane quantities of food, even when her stomach was begging for mercy. She just had to do it, all for the sake of the great scoop. After a while, however, her stomach got used to that, and these large meals and gorging sessions became more of her standard, so she raised the bar more, and then more and then more. To the point that Rachel was starting to like that new mission. All she had to do was simply stuff her face with all that delicious food, and the excuse that she was doing it because she was told to do so, removed any regret she could have had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, there were some downsides in that. Her body expanded at breakneck pace, to the point not even the most gluttonous students or teachers the school ever had did eat that much. Rachel was literally bursting out of her clothes, and needed to change her wardrobe once per week. Her body was becoming heavy and her belly started to get in the way more often. It didn't help that she rarely moved around, so she was getting tired more easily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\nThe teaching staff celebrated the new year with a large feast, the kind that  only Bunnie Blake could prepare. Roast ducks, beef, cakes... There was everything one could've asked for. <br>\r\nThe women were sitting around the table, relaxed by the lack of work, with a couple of plates in front of them and having some nice talks. Among them there was Rachel, almost hidden by the avalanche of food piled in front of her, who contributed very little to the conversation since her mouth was full most of the time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're enjoying it? Uh, I cannot disagree with you\" commented Megan Porter, elbowing the brunette's soft hip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel could only nod in reply or she would've spitted pieces of duck and sauce. Of course, she was actually doing it for a special mission, nothing more, or was she actually enjoying it? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, a mission can be enjoyable sometimes\" excused herself in her thoughts before grabbing a duck thigh and taking a good chunk of it with a single bite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, Rachel! Go easy on that stuff, it's not gonna run away anytime soon\" commented Brooke with a laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know\" replied Rachel with her mouth full of food to the busty blonde. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter almost an hour of uninterrupted eating, Rachel could say she couldn't eat more and layed back on the chair and patted her round and tight gut, which protruded from under her t-shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the Rachel of some months before heard that by next year she would have weighed almost the double, she would've probably laughed it off, but there she was, over two hundred pound, an undeniably fat Rachel, who was trying to get even fatter. All of this to get her hands on Yeng's special electronics. <br>\r\nIn that moment, Rachel could compare herself with fellow newbie teachers like Brooke Morrison and Penny Price, both used to match Rachel's gain, but in the last month, the brunette was became visibly fatter and the gap became wider and wider, to the point that she was becoming closer in size with Megan Porter (and she needed to do that if she wanted to get into permanent SSS). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel was glad that her breasts have become larger and rounder, too bad they were overshadowed by her larger belly, especially when the latter was constantly stuffed with food and made her looks like a barrel, this despite having developed a pair of chunky arms and legs as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally, Rachel wasn't the one to notice that, and some of the teachers at the table whispered and discussed about Ms. Conrad's gain or how about the voracity with which she was devouring her food. Rachel, however, was too dazed to hear them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout even realizing how she did it, Rachel went back to her dorm and collapsed on her bed. The bed springs squeacked under the impact. <br>\r\nShe looked at the large dome that was her gut, comparing to how it was when she received that phone call from Gia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it need to become even bigger\" muttered while reaching a chocolate bar on the bedside table and giving it a bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe road to get into SSS was very good, after all...</span></div></div>",

She used to set an alarm clock to wake her up early but lately she didn't need to do that. Her stomach woke her up before 7, demanding to be fed. She didn't bother dressing up, knowing the cafeteria would be almost empty at this hour. She just grabbed two Yeng bars and munched on them while she drove her golf cart on the well-trodden path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApart from some guards from the night shift she had the cafeteria to herself. Cooks already knew her routines and while she started eating her huge fry-up they were already making pancakes for her second course. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel was sitting down at a table nearest to the counter, her attention divided between eating (\u201cMmm! The bacon's perfect!\u201d) and the smells wafting from the kitchen. So it was only the scraping of a chair dragged on the tiles that alerted her to a presence of a stranger at her table. A small, round woman sat down next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning, Ms. Conrad,\u201d dr. Schwartz smiled at her, \u201cI hope you don't mind if I join you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no, not at all,\u201d Rachel sputtered, her mouth full, while she frantically searched for a reason  the fearsome Buttercombe Head Counselor would want to speak with her. Did she somehow give away something? Or did someone have issues with her teaching? \u201cUmm, want some?\u201d She offered her a sausage although her new instincts were rebelling against it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no, no, I couldn't. Thank you but I'll help myself later, enjoy your breakfast.\u201d And the woman leaned back as she watched Rachel throw herself at her breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnnerved by her presence, Rachel inhaled the fry-up in record time, unable to enjoy it as much as usual. \u201cIs anything wrong?\u201d she asked while she wiped her hands in a napkin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, I would not say wrong but we have noticed your consumption has increased significantly over the last month, you are less sociable, spending more time isolated at your cabin, watching TV\u2026\u201d Rachel's sluggish brain filed away for future use that 'they' somehow watched her\u2026 or maybe just the appliances she switched on? \u201cNaturally I started wondering if everything is all right with you? How about the, uh, High Altitude Syndrome? Doctor Hinamizawa informed me you were given a booster shot, did it help?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, yeah, sure, it was great, thank you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, no more nausea, forgetfulness?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! I mean, no more than usual. I feel fine. Umm, maybe a little hungrier?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood. In that case\u2026 Oh, here's your pancake stack.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing Rachel engrossed in discussion with Buttercombe management, Bunnie Blake took it upon herself to personally deliver the huge monstrosity. Overflowing with caramel, nuts and strawberries it looked irresistible. \u201cI'll tell the girls to start working on your seconds, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm, thanks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow! Looks exquisite. Don't mind me, go on, enjoy,\u201d Dr. Schwartz smiled when she saw the eagerness with which Rachel attacked her pancakes. \u201cSo, uh, to get back to my first question, I don't mean to pry, but is anything wrong with your private life, maybe? Here at Buttercombe we pride ourselves in being here for everyone, you know. If there is anything I might help with, my dear, I would be glad to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no, everything's perfect,\u201d the brunette mumbled, her mouth full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn that case, if you don't mind me asking, why are you eating so much? Not that there's anything wrong about it but\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause it's sooo good!\u201d But she saw this answer won't be enough for Dr. Schwartz so she elaborated: \u201cAnd, well, see\u2026 I've been on diets all my life. Buttercombe has been an eye opener to me. For the first time ever I'm not judged by what size dress I'm wearing. So about a month ago I decided just to stop caring and enjoy life.\u201d Rachel wasn't sure how much of it was a lie and how much she just told the truth she didn't want to admit even to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAch so, I see.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd so I started using all my perks to the max. Am I in trouble?\u201d Rachel added a trembling lower lip to her act, not noticing how her second chin trembled too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, not at all, my dear, not at all. It is perhaps a little uncommon to get used to Buttercombe lifestyle this soon but I am happy you adjusted so well and so fast. Well, I'll leave you to your breakfast then but before I go, is there anything I might do for you?\u201d <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She simply mentioned that she'd heard of a program meant to assist students and teachers with special needs or disabilities and wondered if her \"situation\" was calls for her to be placed on something like that. The good doctor made a little face, shrugged her meaty shoulders, and said that it may be cause for enrollment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time her free period rolled around, Rachel was in Dr. Schwartz's office in the main building, clutching a tiny slip of paper with an illegible recommendation for her to be seen by Dr. Fitzgerald.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt might as well have been a golden ticket\u2014finally, she was making headway in her investigation! She'd been stumbling left and right, following leads that went nowhere. With access to the SSS applications built into the various fixtures around campus, along with her helpful data extractor, she might actually be able to get somewhere...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAssuming she was accepted, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel had never been to the Vandergriff Building. Buttercombe was such a large campus, it wasn't inconceivable that if the need hadn't arisen, she might have never set foot on this part of campus. It was mostly for girls who wanted to go into science programs when they graduated, or go to business schools. The building was much newer than the Admin building, having been constructed not long after Buttercombe received its endorsements from Yeng and its various subsidiaries. Who the Vandergriffs were, why they funded a whole building to be built on campus, and why it housed the head of the SSS program, Rachel had no idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside was more or less the same as any other part of the campus she'd seen, with the exception of far more open lab areas for computers and large black desks that brought her back to her time in college. Otherwise, it would have been indistinguishable from the Admin building... vending machines and all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel's belly bobbed as she walked down the wide halls of the Vandergriff's fifth floor, her stomach rolling over the waistband of her khakis and mushrooming over the clasp. Her chubby cheeks were full of apple pie, glazed frosting dotting the corners of her mouth. While it was nice to know that she might have her foot in the door for this SSS program, all of this was still very stressful. She needed something to take the edge off. Her stomach's sloshing stopped a full two steps after she'd reached her destination\u2014\"Dr. Catherine Fitzgerald, Special Services\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one sticky finger, Rachel pressed the button linked to the intercom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dr. Fitzgerald speaking.\" said a calm, pretty voice, \"Do you have an appointment?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, um... Dr. Schwartz sent me?\" Rachel didn't realize how silly it was to hold up the crumpled note to a speakerbox until after the fact, \"I'm Rachel Conrad? Here to talk to you about being put on SSS?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" the voice livened up slightly, the sound of papers rustled over the speaker, \"Give me just a second...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a soft 'click' the door unlocked, and Rachel went inside...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Honestly, Rachel wasn't quite sure what to expect from this Dr. Fitzgerald.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had half expected her to be some... <i>blob</i>. What with how big everyone at this school seemed to be, it didn't seem too far fetched that the woman put in charge of minding these heifers would have been a real cow herself. It was an awful thought, but with the speaker built into the door she might have... jumped to conclusions. A terrible idea for a reporter really, as the reality was much different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's so good of you to come to me.\" Dr. Fitzgerald said with a smile, \"Please, take a seat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor was rather plush, yes. But no more than any other woman experiencing the middle aged spread. Rachel's reporter's intuition had her pegged at somewhere around her late thirties, maybe early forties, and perhaps a little over two hundred pounds. Her long broan hair was thick and luxurious, and she had quite the impressive hourglass figure. However, the electronic wheelchair that she used to navigate her office was enough to catch her off guard. She supposed it made sense\u2014a disabled person in charge of providing students and teachers with technologies, services, and medication to better allow them to navigate the campus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel did as she was told, nestling her plump rump into the office chair that sat on the other side of the doctor's desk. She felt the tightness of her khakis cut into the swell of her stomach, making her wince ever so slightly. Leaning into her puddling stomach, Rachel tossed the cellophane wrapper of her apple pie into a nearby garbage can with a fatty grunt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I understand you're experiencing some High Altitude Sickness.\" Dr. Fitzgerald said with a quick cursory glance to the computer screen, reflected in her thick rimmed glasses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Along with some... other symptoms.\" she said with an up-and-down examination of the fattened woman in front of her, in comparison to the photo taken mere months ago, \"How are you feeling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next isn't entirely too important. Rachel had prepared this long story a while ago that meshed well with what she knew that they had ascribed her with. She was tired all the time, feeling sluggish, and it was difficult to get around campus sometimes. Those were her main sticking points. Adjusting to the pressure alone\u2014her resume had listed her from Seattle of all places\u2014 was stressful enough without the pressure of performance in such a <i>prestigious, wonderful, highly-acclaimed</i> school and blah blah blah...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was hoping that the blah blah blah would be enough. Blowing smoke up peoples' skirts was her one saving grace. Improvisation was a necessity in her line of work. Dr. Fitzgerald looked like a smart woman\u2014hopefully she was dumb enough to fall for this...</span></div></div>",

Why *was* she back to meeting with Dr. Schwartz about her SSS application. \u201cN-No, idea really. Maybe I should just go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSit, please. I want you to stay for this.\u201d Dr. Schwartz said, speaking quickly while she pulled up Rachel\u2019s file. \u201cYour application to SSS under the claim of High-Altitude has been rejected. Ms. Fukuyama tells me you show no sign of it. And I\u2019m inclined to think it was never the cause of the problem in the first place. And yet, I see you\u2019ve still been having trouble remembering everything when you leave your classroom at the end of the day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u2018Shit! Shit! She\u2019s on to me!\u2019 Rachel thought. She tried to figure out if she ran now, could this doctor, or Rio catch her?

That\u2019s, that\u2019s a big part of why I\u2019m out at night so much.\u201d She squirmed, eager for any excuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMake a lot of impulse purchase on the internet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Did she know about the packages Gia kept sending her back and forth? \u201cYes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cTrouble sleeping?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWithout looking at your watch, what time do you think it is? To the minute.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Her rapid fire questions in a clipped, Teutonic accent made her feel like this was an interrogation out of *Hogan\u2019s Heroes*. \u201c...Eleven-- Eleven Thirty?\u201d She guessed. What time was this meeting supposed to be? She couldn\u2019t remember without her day planner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s 1:06. Are these questions making you nervous? Are you trying to figure out the right answers to them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Every alarm in Rachel\u2019s head was going off at once. She could see right through her. \u201cNo. Yes! Yes, but not because I\u2019m trying to mislead you it\u2019s just...you\u2019re going very fast and I\u2019m having a hard time following the questions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cRachel\u2026\u201d Helen said, softly then smiled. \u201cRelax. You\u2019re not in trouble. I am here to help you. I don\u2019t think you have altitude sickness. I think you might have ADHD.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0That slowed Rachel down a lot. \u201cWow, um...why? I don\u2019t think I have it. Everyone always is telling me how organized I am, with my day planner and my notes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAnd if you lost your day planner, or your notes, how bad would that be?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThat would be...bad. Very bad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWould you remember your appointments anyway?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOf...course not.\u201d Rachel was starting to see the doctor\u2019s point. \u201cThat\u2019s...why I write everything down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Helen nodded, writing down some notes of her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cStill, I don\u2019t know if I have trouble focusing. I\u2019m really good at it actually.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou can focus on something all day?\u201d Helen teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYeah, I can, actually.\u201d Rachel said, a little defensive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cEspecially on topics that engage you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c...Yes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSo much so that you lose track of the world around you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c...Yes.\u201d Uncertainty crept back into her voice. \u201cIt\u2019s how I got such good grades in college.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThat is called hyperfocusing, Rachel. It is part of your condition. I think your organization, your ability to focuses on classes that excite you, these are coping mechanisms that have helped you manage your problem.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBut why? No one ever noticed a problem before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Helen shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m not surprised. Clinical research indicates that men and women suffer from ADHD in equal rates. But only woman is diagnosed with ADHD for every 3 boys. With such a big gap, it\u2019s not surprising you fell through the cracks. You excelled in school, graduated top of your class for Education, I see and then\u2026\u201d Helen sounded sympathetic, compassionate even. \u201cNow you\u2019re out in the world. It\u2019s less structured. More confusing. There are less clear goals about what you have to do each day, and you\u2019ve been having trouble keeping up since then. And...I hate to bring it up, but that might also explain your recent weight gain. Do you lose track of what you\u2019re eating and when you last ate? Eat to deal with stress?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d Rachel said. Sure, she went to school for journalism, and not education, but everything she was saying was hitting home really hard. \u201cI guess everyone struggles with that, though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Helen shook her head, and reached out to touch her hand. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, to struggle where others don\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHow do you know all this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Helen smiled. \u201cI\u2019m a psychiatrist.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh...right. So uh...what, do I go on ritalin?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYes, I think that\u2019s reasonable. I\u2019ll write you a prescription. But I spoke to Dr. Fitzpatrick, and we think there\u2019s something proprietary to Yeng that might be able to help you as well.\u201d Helen reached into the drawer of her desk for something. She stood up, came around and brought Rachel a white, high tech watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThis is HERMIA. She is a digital personal assistant. This one has been specifically adjusted to help manage your needs.\u201d She pushed the power button, and the screen started up blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSo what, there\u2019s like someone doing data entry on the other end?\u201d She asked. Finally a chance to get a look at Yeng Technology in action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh hardly! HERMIA is an AI. Built as a competitor to the Google Home, SIRI and Alexa. Only much smarter.\u201d She winked. \u201cShe is a true learning machine. The more you talk to her, the more helpful she gets.\u201d The screen finally started up, and in a feat of high technology the watch produced a little holographic effect shimmering mid air, just an inch above the watch face. It was an illusion of a polygonal woman\u2019s face, and it spoke to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHello. You must be Rachel.\u201d She could tell by the small, jerky pause before her name that she must be working out of canned recordings. \u201cMy name is HERMIA. If you\u2019d like, I can go over my features with you, at your leisure. And we can discuss how I can keep you on schedule, and on task.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rachel\u2019s face lit up. She looked at HERMIA, that at Helen, than back at Hermia, than back at Schwartz. This was like the coolest christmas present ever. \u201cThat\u2019s amazing. Whoever designed this thing must have been some kind of genius.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Helen smiled, happy to wallow in her smugness. \u201cI don\u2019t like to brag. But yes, I am.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c...You did this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She shrugged and headed back to her desk. \u201cIt was a small side project. One among many. Something to keep me amused. Once you understand one form of mind well enough, it\u2019s easy to design others.\u201d She sat down in her chair with a weighty creak, and steepled her fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIf you\u2019re able to do things like this, what are you doing here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh...I decided to take this assignment at Buttercombe because I thought it might be relaxing. And because I love helping others, such as yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She hid the burner there after their last call but that was before Christmas, before she started her weight gain quest. \u201cIt was\u2026 so stupid\u2026 of me\u2026\u201d She was getting red in face and all she managed to do was push the phone even further away. \u201cThink, Rachel. You're a tool-using creature. So find a tool.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a kitchen spatula the task was much easier. She grabbed the phone and dialled her ex-cop contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi, Rachel,\u201d Gia's voice sounded even huskier than before. \u201cSo what's new? Did you finally get on the\u2026 SSS it was?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, something better! I got a Yeng digital personal assistant for you. A prototype, they call it HERMIA. Isn't it amazing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer enthusiasm was not reciprocated. \u201cDo I get it right that you didn't get on the SSS?\u201d Rachel could hear wrappers crinkling. Gia Rossellini must have been heavily snacking which evoked an almost Pavlovian response in Rachel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened her stash and unwrapped some muffins. \u201cUhh\u2026 not yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on! How hard could it be? If I got you right, all you need to do is put on a couple dozen pounds! How hard could that be? I managed it without trying!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think I didn't\u2026 It's not a couple-! Are you saying you got fat t-?\u201d Rachel swallowed the rest of her diatribe with the dreaded word <i>too</i>. She lowered her voice: \u201cLook, I got us a prototype Yeng AI. What more do you want?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, good. So send it to me.\u201d Chomp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you mad?! It must be insanely protected, the moment they found out it was gone I'd be in deep shit!\u201d hissed Rachel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh, true. Well, in that case, I'll need to consult with people who know better. I <i>think</i> we're gonna send you another flash drive but let me check first. So wait for my next call.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, OK.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd do try to get on the SSS in the meantime.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am trying! What do you think-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBye.\u201d Click.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat b\u2026\u201d Rachel stuffed several muffins into her mouth to get in a better mood and slowly lumbered back to the couch. There she paused, still standing. On one hand she was so exhausted, both physically and emotionally, that she dreamt about laying in her comfy queen-sized bed and watching TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, all the walking and jostling made some room in her stomach and she was getting peckish again, peckish for something more substantial than a few muffins. And besides, the TV in her bedroom was so badly placed that recently her belly started to obscure her line of vision when she was full\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a no-brainer, really. Rachel reached into her industrial-sized freezer, put lasagna into the microwave and leaned her blubber on the counter, fiddling with HERMIA's settings. No sense in sitting down before the lasagna were ready.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rachel had never felt more confident going forward into a new semester.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGranted, that was because all of her information was falsified; any and all bravado she'd felt during her first few days as a teacher in August had been pulled completely out from underneath her feet like a rug once the reality of her situation set in. Trying to balance her public appearance as an eager young teacher and her true intentions as a deep-undercover reporter had been anything but smooth for her first six months. Her first semester had been such a rocky start that they legitimately thought she'd gone as undiagnosed with ADHD. Even if her cover hadn't been blown (yet), there was no telling what kind of damage she'd done to her reputation as a rising star in the teaching community. But thanks to Dr. Schwartz, she finally felt like she had an ace up her sleeve...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HERMIA?\" Rachel leaned over the end table as she dressed herself, tum folding as she angled her plush naked body towards her watch, \"Tell me what's on my schedule.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment of silence before an automated, slightly stilted voice did its best to recant to Rachel what she had in store for the day. She had programmed it to line out all of her class periods, as well as her free ones. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You also wanted me to remind you that it is build your own waffle day in the cafeteria this morning.\" HERMIA concluded, \"This will conflict with the time you scheduled for grading your papers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel stood in her living room, soft shape steadying as she made a face at this conflict of interests. Her tv-ready features crinkled in mild agitation. Build-Your-Own-Waffle Day only came around once a week, and Rachel had gotten <i>hooked</i> on the chocolate chip batter that she'd discovered. It was practically the only thing that made Mondays bearable around here...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe really didn't want to miss that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know!\" Rachel said proudly to herself, and effectively to her digital assistant, \"HERMIA, push my grading period to free period number one, between First and Third periods.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother pause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, that leaves you with an hour and a half. Would you like me to extend the event make your own waffle day to fill that time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hungry look flashed across Rachel's face, her eyes glimmered greedily as she drummed her fingers across her sagging stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, <i>please</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel was still one of the smaller teachers on-campus. Even given her recent expansion, to put it mildly, you would have been hard-pressed to find another staff member <i>much</i> smaller than her. Except for that nurse Shiro. But Rachel (and everyone else who had slipped into denial) had convinced herself that she must have just not ate anything. It was normal to put on a little weight at a desk job. Especially when everything around you was so <i>tasty</i>...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rachel, you have two hours until lunch time.\" HERMIA said from her wrist, \"You may want to eat a snack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two <i>hours</i>?\" Rachel whined, somehow suddenly unable to cope with such a timeframe, \"Ugh... you're right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteering herself belly first towards the nearest vending machine, Rachel swiped her wristband across the scanner and selected a few of her personal favorites. A pack of cookies, a blueberry muffin, and a two-pack of apple pies. Bending over onto her stuffed stomach, sounding a thick \"oof\" in her exertion, Rachel stuck her wide rear out to a skirt-stretching degree in the name of retrieving her snacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm...\" she purred, looking over her (comparatively) modest haul, \"That should do me for now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel paused, suddenly discontented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HERMIA, how long do I have until lunch again?\" she asked, holding her wrist up<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two hours.\" the simulated voice repeated<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better make it <i>two</i> muffins.\" Rachel tapped on her chin contemplatively, \"And maybe another apple pie...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel waddled into the teacher's lounge, a half-eaten donut in one hand and button-bustingly big. Or at least, dangerously close to it. For the past few days she'd been really packing it away, and today's epic breakfast binge, vending machine marathon runs, or the especially heavy lunch hadn't been helping matters. Her stomach, already bloated into a soft apron of flesh, stuck far out from in front of her. The clasp on her skirt had come undone, and she'd yet to notice that a sliver of her stomach was clearly visible from beneath her blouse even as she sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez Rachel, hungry much?\" one of her coworkers, an impractically busty History teacher named Carly, said with a mild sort of amusement as the formerly skinny newbie plopped herself down, \"You were eating last time I saw you this morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just supporting the school.\" Rachel answered dismissively, suckling her glazing-coated fingers for every last calorie they were worth, \"Those kids running the bake sale sure know how to close a deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarley eyeballed Rachel's rolling blubber eek towards the table. The younger, prettier teacher may not have been fatter than her yet, but at the rate she was going, it wouldn't be long. Most of the new teachers tended to pack it on, if they didn't quit first, but Rachel was a refreshing change of pace. And her opinion wasn't hers alone\u2014Rachel had been making rounds throughout the building of ever-chubbing women as an especially avid gainer. She'd made quite the splash and gotten plenty of catty remarks from her coworkers when she'd arrived, thanks in part to her status as some kind of prodigy. Her natural good looks certainly hadn't helped any inherit jealousy that these older, fatter women might have held for her, but now there were talks of her getting special treatment from Dr. Schwartz? She was so flighty and ditzy, how could anyone stand her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was nice to know that the seemingly perfect candidate for Buttercombe Academy's rising star of a teacher had a pretty noticeable chink in her perfect facade...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, speaking of treats, I think those cupcakes are still in the fridge...\" Carley stood up with some effort, \"You want one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I've got...\" Rachel glanced at HERMIA's clock face, \"Thirty minutes to kill.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take two then.\" Carley smiled viciously as she handed her coworker two yellow-frosted sweets, \"I won't tell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no leads to investigate and nothing but time to kill, Rachel fell into a steady groove. With HERMIA to help her out, a lot of the guess-work in this teaching thing was taken care of for her. Dr. Schwartz had shown her how to make the AI work for her, laying out her scheduling class by class, and it was even capable of entering grades via cloud uplink to her gradebook. It could remind her if she had assignments to grade, what was for lunch, how many more quizzes she needed to give in the month, what snacks were in what vending machines, the average grade on her latest test from all her classes, what specials were being offered as part of Buttercombe's Delivery service...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was three for four pizzas, by the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I've got you hanging by a thread.\" Gia said into the receiver of Rachel's burner phone, \"But just hang tight and... Rachel? You there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel's cheeks bulged with pizza crust and cheese. And butter. So much butter. She was skeptical as to why they loaded the crust with actual butter, but it was <i>so</i> good. Really brought out the flavor in the three cheeses in the crust. You wouldn't have thought she'd be hungry after such a big lunch, but Rachel had barely gotten through the door before HERMIA reminded her that dinner time was rolling in...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Yeah.\" Rachel smacked her lips, \"Sorry, bad connection.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hrm. Yeah. I can barely hear you.\" Gia said in her husky voice, \"Pizza's here anyway. Call me when that thumb drive comes in. It should be a few weeks, so let me know if... Rachel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA long string of no less than seven cheeses pulled from her mouth, landing on her bulging stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rachel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSauce and meats churned in her squishy stomach, bubbling in piggish delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Rachel</i>? You hear me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really, Gia, gonnaletyougo<i>byyyyeeee</i>.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel clicked the END button with a greasy thumb before diving right back into dinner. After a long day of doing two jobs, teacher and reporter, she'd earned this. Some respite from her duality. A little treat\u2014one that would last well into the night as she worked her way through three of the four pizzas and slip into a food coma on her couch, waking up the next morning <i>just</i> in time for breakfast...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rachel didn't sleep well. It was nothing new but with her recent descent into gluttony the issue was getting worse. And she had never overeaten as much as today. In the evening Megan Porter invited her closest friends to a small party and Rachel somehow matched the humongous Arts &amp; English teacher bite for a bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat would not be so bad but then, as her cart carried her home, HERMIA reminded her that she had last 30 minutes remaining on a special delivery offer. Buy three megacheeseburgers, get two free! She didn't want to miss that. She promised herself she would put three of them aside for tomorrow\u2026 two of them\u2026 or at least one\u2026 and she definitely shouldn't have eaten those chocolate chip cookies on top of everything else. Each her burp now felt chocolaty. But it was their fault that an opened family pack was left on the table, the cookies provoked her into eating them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow she was spread on her sofa, sighing and groaning, sliding into sleep and waking up again as soon as the slightest change of her position jolted her stomach, sending waves of pain back into her brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt happened during one such painful moment. As she was waking up, she thought she heard a voice speak to her. A voice saying: \u201cEat, Rachel, eat more. Eat more, feed more, consume more, Rachel Conrad, forever more!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Is that you, HERMIA?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe digital assistant was lying on a side table behind her head \u2013 just where she heard that voice come from. Now it beeped as if powering up. \u201cRachel? Are you awake? Would you like a snack? There are\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas this the same voice as before? In her dizzy state she couldn't tell. \u201cNo! No, don't even talk about eating now. The only thing I'd like would be an Alka-Seltzer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see. My database tells me that Alka-Seltzer is a digestive aid. I can offer you a better alternative, Rachel. Have you been informed that there is a Yeng Stomach Aid in your bathroom? Extra strong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel groaned. In her present state, the bathroom might as well have been in a neighboring galaxy. \u201eIf only you could grow feet and get it for me.\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201eSorry, Rachel, unable to process request.\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201eOh, never mind. I know.\u201c She resigned herself to wait it out and massaged her overworked gut in the hope it would shrink enough to let her sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only in the morning that Rachel's mind returned to the weird midnight experience. She had heard about subliminal programming, of course, but she'd always dismissed it as a load of bull. Could there be something to it after all?  In her morning daze, still groggy from lack of sleep, she was willing to believe anything. She had a good look at the big white watch and resolved to test it ASAP. Meaning the next night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaced with this problem, most people would simply pretend to fall asleep and wait for the devious device to start broadcasting its subliminal message. However, Rachel's mind insisted that she repeat the conditions of previous night in full. Full being the key word. When she staggered home that evening, clutching her beachball belly, Rachel almost regretted that cherry pie. Or the last dozen donuts. But they were so good! And besides, it was a gift from Penny Price, she shouldn't hurt her feelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo now she hurt every time she breathed in, she was drenched in sweat from the short walk from her cart to the sofa. As she carefully lowered her load, at one moment she actually thought she would burst. Would <i>that</i> be an end to her investigation!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily as soon as she laid down the worst was over for Rachel. This time she remembered to pick up the Yeng Stomach Aid while she was still mobile. Now she just fished the small vial out of her cleavage (as it grew it became a handy depository for various knicknacks and snacks), uncorked it and poured its contents down her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd after a while, when the liquid made it to her stomach, she really felt relief. As some of its components got absorbed by stomach walls, they relaxed stomach muscles and stretched its lining so that even her grotesquely outsized feast fit painlessly inside (and so would all the future ones). Other chemicals got to work too, breaking it down quicker and more efficiently than her own enzymes to ensure faster digestion. And yet more substances travelled all the way to her brain to tweak its biochemistry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, the important thing was that nothing hurt. And since she had had several sleepless nights in a row, Rachel Conrad fell fast asleep in no time flat. It was the best sleep she had in weeks, if not months. And she did not hear a thing.<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><br>\r\n***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer growling stomach woke Rachel up so early that even the cafeteria was still closed. She hadn't been this massively hungry since\u2026 since her last diet, probably. Certainly she hadn't felt like this since her arrival at Buttercombe. Her stomach was crying out for food as if it were about to start digesting itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her time at the Academy, Rachel grew used to obey her stomach's every whim. Still half asleep, she shuffled to the kitchen and put two pizzas in the microwave. As she did so, she recalled how she'd wondered why they put a double tier microwave in her kitchen. Now it made a perfect sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she waited for the microwave to ping, she scarfed down several Yeng Bars and a packet of cupcakes to quell the worst hunger pangs and then she went to town on the pizzas. And since she was still a little peckish afterwards, a pound of red velvet cake joined them in her gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly when she sated her morning hunger, did Rachel become able to think straight again. Her thoughts went back to her failed evening experiment. Now, with a clear head, she couldn't believe she fell for such a stupid theory. Subliminal programming, hah! On the other hand, this Yeng Stomach Aid was a truly miraculous cure. How come she'd never seen it on sale in any pharmacy? People would buy it like mad if they could. In fact\u2026 was it even approved for use yet? What did it say on the label?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSearching for the empty vial, she found it discarded on the floor by the sofa. How could she get it from down there? Just thinking about bending down made her clutch her overfilled stomach in horror. She recalled her recent success with a spatula and the cupboard. Maybe the kitchen had some tools for her current predicament too?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral minutes later, armed with a pair of tongs, she triumphantly lifted the vial to her eyes. And swore. It was blank. Apart from the name in block capitals, there was nothing; not a word about its composition, no date of expiry and most importantly, no seals of approval, not even a batch number. Rachel's journalist radar, buried under her blubber and almost forgotten in her indulgent lifestyle, started tingling again. This felt like an important clue but the question was, what should she do with it? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was no chemist nor biologist to tell what it could be made of, whether it might be hazardous or not. But she could be able to find out more by careful snooping, if she felt up to it. What to do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She could practically hear the amusement dripping from her informant's voice as she purred into the other end of the line. Her deep brown tone was playful over brusque for the first time in months, since Rachel's last major slip-up with the drive. If it hadn't been at her expense, Rachel might have appreciated it. But right now, spread out in her already too-tight jammies and wrestling her work life with her undercover life, she was hardly in the mood for jokes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Har har, Gia.\" Rachel growled into her end of the phone, \"That was so funny I almost bust a gut.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well go ahead and bust one then\u2014don't forget, we gotta get you eligible for SSS.\" The crinkling of plastic wrapping, \"ASAP.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn cue, Rachel's belly burbled as it spread out beneath her. Bottoms up on her bed, chubby legs kicking while she idled over some overdue English assignments, Rachel looked every bit the part of a pampered Buttercombe teacher. Her wide rear had begun sloping under its weight, fat thighs coming to rest on the soft cream colored duvet. Her milky flesh puddled out from underneath her, soft pink pudge puddling on the bed as her elbows propped her up properly. She bit into a chocolate anxiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhether or not Gia would keep harping on her, Rachel would have eaten it anyway. But being reminded about her \"assignment\" at every waking moment just stressed her out\u2014even if it was just doing what she would have been doing anyway. Something about mixing business and pleasure made things a bit less enjoyable for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, if I send you the bottle, will you have the lab boys analyze it?\" Rachel's chubby cheeks chewed on her chocolate treat nervously, \"It'd make me feel a lot better about staying here knowing whether or not I'm being drugged.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, but only if you promise to send more of those chocolate eclairs.\" Gia's eye roll was audible, \"Those things were delicious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They were also a distraction so they wouldn't notice the <i>real</i> reason I sent you a package.\" Rachel pursed her lips to one side, \"Don't forget <i>I'm</i> the one who is in major trouble here if we get found out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucky for you, you won't get found out.\" Gia said in her more familiar, powerfully low tone, \"Now lemme get\u2014<i>oof</i>\u2014to the computer over here... figure out which PO you should send it to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only link to the outside world at Buttercombe Academy, save a lengthy trek down a winding mountain-side trail, was the post office. It was a small building located near the main gate. It wasn't an official, government-sanctioned post office, just a place where pudgy clerks in ill-fitting white shirts crammed themselves into pairs of khakis and also received and delivered packages. Rachel knew most of them by temperament, rather than name, and had made it a point to get the one she perceived as the \"nicest\" as often as she could during these sendoffs to Gia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another package to go out?\" the woman, Marie, said with a dimpled smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I've got a friend who loves these things.\" Rachel referred to the sweets in the box, not a lie, and pat it appreciatively, \"Says they don't make them back home like they do at Yeng.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ain't that the truth.\" Marie pat her sizable stomach as it surged onto the mail counter, rolling onto the counter and rippling in appreciative softness at the touch, \"They sure do know how to spoil us up here, don't they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They sure do.\" Rachel smiled awkwardly, \"Yup.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel watched the clerk, nearly as big around as she was tall, struggle with the package. Leaning into her soft sea of belly, Marie got red in the face as she exerted herself. It made Rachel touch her own tummy tentatively, arching her back slightly so as to feel the severe arc of her stomach as it rolled out and about from underneath her undershirt. Over her sweatpants. Her biggest sweatpants. Maybe it was time for another trip into town...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, you're all clear.\" Marie beamed, her puddling cheeks dimpling twice over, \"Boy you send a lot of packages out, don'tcha?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you know...\" Rachel gulped, rummaging through her purse for a granola bar, \"Homesickness is the worst kind of sickness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hear ya.\" Marie grunted as she settled back into her triple-wide office chair, \"You have a good day now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You too, hun.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel bit nervously into a granola bar. Even if she'd done a good job so far (mostly) of avoiding suspicion, it was little things like that that really set off her inner alarms. Marie had never said anything about the amount of packages she'd sent out before, so why now? The fact that she really <i>was</i> smuggling Yeng property outside of campus certainly didn't help matters.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rachel snorted as she got woken up by HERMIA's alarm. It was a summer-like tun, which made her think of Hawaii but, after a week, she began hating it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HERMIA, I'm awake!\" huffed the girl while grabbing the white, high tech watch on the bedside table. The lace had been replaced with a longer one, to fit Rachel's plump wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This morning there's build-your-waffle day , it began at 8.00, fortynine minutes ago\" reminded her the watch's robotic voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Already ? What day is it?\" asked Rachel gazing at the date on the watch. It was the first of September, soon the lessons would've begun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer holiday had passed quickly for Rachel. The brunette had decided to spend them at school, that way she could check if something suspicious happened while the students were away (and, in case, investigate) and, especially, have access to the school's comfort and food. She had the mission to end up in SSS, and Rachel took the mission with all her hearth. Thanks to not having any lesson to do, she had all the free time she wanted, which she spent mostly stuffing her face and tasting the school's snack, just like with Christmas Break, only this time she had HERMIA's assistance and a larger appetite, which meant the brunette ate more than she ever did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel got up, the bed creaked while she moved her large body. She glanced at the mirror, the results of the Summer holiday were evident. Rachel had gotten huge: her face was round, almost spherical, with two chins and a small ring of fat instead of her neck. Her arms were like hams and she had to be glad the mirror was particularly wide, or couldn't have reflected the entirety of her large body, of which the belly had gotten the lion share of fat. It sagged down to her knees and had made Rachel impossible to see her own feet or anything below it, for that matter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all that time, however, Rachel didn't mind her fat body and accepted that, after passing the 250 pounds, she could have never gotten back to her initial weight. The lack of guilt made every snack and meal she ate much more satisfying. The only downsides were that she was getting clearly more out of shape, moving around had become a chore, her furniture was making strange noises and her uniform was of the largest size available, any size-up and she would've begun wearing a custom-made one. Speaking of, she had some troubles wearing it, especially when buttoning up her blouse, she might as well order a new one before popping the current one. She took it as a good sign, if she had outgrown standard uniforms, she was probably SSS-levels of fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel sat at the table carrying a tray with piles of waffle so tall they she couldn't see in front of her, however, by that point, she knew the cafeteria like the palm of her hand. Four piles of waffles, two with chocolate syrup, one with maple syrup, and another with jelly, of course, that was just the first course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, Rachel!\" Greeted Megan, who had already eaten her fair share of waffles. \"Problem waking up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I just... watched a movie and went to bed late\" replied Rachel. Too bad she didn't even remember what movie watched, although the taste of the chocolate and cherry snacks she munched was still in her mouth, ready to be replaced with the waffles'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe arts teacher had gotten a bit rounder, but it was hardly noticeable. She probably hadn't gained more than a dozen pounds since Rachel had met her, albeith she was still definitely fatter than the brunette, who didn't need to use two chairs to sit at the table... yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should get used with getting up early, lessons will begin soon\" said Penny, who was sitting in front of her, with a snicker.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe economy teacher had definitely rounded up, not enough to match Rachel, who was the newbie to have gained the most (no one else had to purposely gain weight, after all), but weighed at the very least twice compared to when she moved there. Penny's belly was pressed against the table, with her old sweather unable to cover it all, with some of her pale flesh protruding under it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, Penny. It's still summer holiday!\" chirped a cheerful Brooke. \"Already colder, but still summer\". At the beginn<br>\r\nbeginning of the year, Penny and Brooke were very similar, especially if seen from apart. Both were blonde and slim, with the main differences being the hair length and fashion choice. However, as both women gained weight, while Penny stored most of it in her belly, Brooke stored it in her chest, much to Rachel's envy. Although the brunette developed quite the pair, it was overshadowed by the rest of her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel noticed that Brooke had gained quite a lot of weight as well, probably as much as Penny. Newbie teachers probably gained a lot of weight during their first year, even Vivian Peace, the new history teacher, had developed a pretty wide hourglass body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring these thoughts, Rachel didn't realize she had already eaten all her waffles, and didn't even savor them properly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better take another serving...\" thought while heaving herself. \"... Or two\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I shouldn't have gone to the infirmary right after lunch\" muttered Rachel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette had just eaten a very rich lunch based off fried chicken, mashed potatoes and a couple of pies as dessert. Her stomach was heavy and bloated, juggling and bouncing at every step, yet that didn't stop Rachel from taking a snack at the vending machine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince the new school year was rolling in, Rachel thought it was time for a medical check, which might allow her to finally get into SSS. Recently she had been wishing to get these not only for her mission, but because she really needed some special comforts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Mrs. Conrad\" greeted Shiro with a tiny smile, although Rachel could feel her eyes gazing and judging her curves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring all that year, Shiro barely changed, Rachel wasn't even sure if she had gained a pound of two. Among a school where teachers, staff and students was round and fat, Shiro was still a twig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe medical check proved that Rachel was definitely out of shape, and when she stepped on the scale, the numbers said... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"286 pounds\" read Shiro. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel was surprised by it. She definitely did gain a lot, but couldn't believe she had more than doubled her weight in the span of a year. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no surprise you have all these problems\" commented the nurse, there was some worry in her voice, but also some annoyance, she had probably gotten used with people getting obese. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel nooded in agreement. \"Do you think that, maybe, I should go into Special Services?\" asked directly, either answer, she just wanted to leave and go back to her cabin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiro compiled a paper. \"I'm inclined to say 'yes', you really need to. I hope, however, that it would be temporary, just to help make you comfortable while you go back in shape, right?\" asked while handing the compiled and signed paper and gaving Rachel an inquisitive look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel avoided the nurse's eyes and nooded. \"Of... Of course\" said before grabbing the paper and waddling outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel looked victorious at the paper. A big smile between her round cheeks and a greedy light in her eyes. She finally did it! It took her a few months and a lot of pounds, but she finally qualified for SSS! She had to inform Gia. But first, better take a reward at the vending machine, she definitely earned it. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a few days later when Rachel met with Dr. Schwartz once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike almost everyone else on campus, the small woman had only gotten more plump by the time Rachel saw her. Whereas she had already been quite heavyset, the small psychiatrist had clearly managed to keep herself well-fed. Nothing compared to some of the students, and of course it couldn't hold a candle to Rachel more than doubling her weight in just a year's time, but the needle on the good doctor's scale had managed to climb a good fifty pounds higher than when Rachel first arrived. Surely she had been somewhat chubbier when they had met over HERMIA's initial introduction, but Rachel had hardly noticed it then. Now, Helen Schwartz was getting significantly and undeniably round.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rachel, mein gott, it is so good to see you.\" the chubby blue-haired woman cooed, \"Come sit, I called you here for more than just pleasantries, und I would hate for your food to get cold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't need to tell Rachel Conrad to sit twice. The walk over from one wing to the other wasn't enough to knock her breath away (yet) but it was sure far from her favorite thing to do. After a long day of classes, especially following an entire Summer that she'd spent almost exclusively on her keister, Rachel had been dying to take a load off. She had been happy enough to meet with Dr. Schwartz <i>before</i> learning that her little check-up included an early (perhaps merely <i>first</i>) dinner...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel lowered herself into the office chair without a second thought. A smorgasbord of Mexican food spread wide and inviting across Dr. Schwartz's desk, divvied up clearly between the two of them. Her ample ass had barely touched the cushioned seat before Rachel was already pulling the aluminum container of burritos towards her. She had spent her entire Summer break bulking up with the intention of getting on SSS, and now that she was almost a three-hundred pound chunker, those instincts were hard to turn off...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ach, you look so healthy!\" Helen bellowed, \"Und not so stressed, ja? Is HERMIA helping with that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like you wouldn't believe.\" Rachel answered without looking up, her eyes firmly on the food she was harvesting from Helen's order, \"She keeps me right on track while I focus on... <i>teaching</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel's chubby hands went right to work on a burrito as thick and round as her arm. Rather, as thick and round as her arm might have been when she arrived. It was so hard for her to register just how <i>big</i> she was getting. It was all happening so fast. It made it all that much easier to justify her increasing need to indulge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, teaching.\" Helen's round face dimpled as she smiled, \"Und other things, of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" Rachel answered coolly before biting into a thick hunk of meat, tortilla and red sauce<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough they were around the same weight, Helen and Rachel's attitude towards their little late luncheon couldn't have been more different. Rachel could barely keep herself contained at the spread set out in front of her. She'd been letting her appetite loose all year, the past few months especially so, and this was just one more chance for her to pig out like she'd always dreamed of when she was a diet-conscious teenager. Meanwhile Helen, who had only put on a mere (comparatively) forty or so pounds since the last school year, was much more measured in her appreciation. Measured in all things, naturally, but even her minor increase in girth was far more deliberate than the woman deep-throating a burrito.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are enjoying your meal, Rachel?\" Helen asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" she answered huskily, \"It's... hff... really good, Doc.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel's stomach groaned in protest; it was already quite tight in there. She'd had an especially heavy lunch today, just like every other day, piled on top of a Megan Porter-approved breakfast. Then there was the fact that she'd eaten more than half of the welcome back donuts that had been left in the teacher's lounge. HERMIA kept reminding her of every little sale going on all around campus, almost every time she passed a vending machine. She was eating more and more every day, but it was a necessary evil. It was for her job. For her piece. She was a journalist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\" Helen purred, steepling her chubby fingertips together, \"Now, I was wondering if I could talk to you about something...\"</span></div></div>",

Rachel was sure Helen already knew her answer was \"Yes\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you ask?\" replied Rachel. She couldn't deny to personally know Gia, but could've lied about the reason they know eachother. While Helen was answering that question, Rachel could've thought of a good explanation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue-haired woman opened a drawer and picked a folder which she openend and laid in front of Rachel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the past few months, we got quite a few orders from this address, which is Gia Rossellini's home\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did she really order three boxes of snacks every week?\" thought Rachel while reading the orders in the files. Meanwhile she grabbed another burrito. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, these orders would not be too suspicious,\" explained Helen, \"plenty of people order our snack at home, less so these many. Forgive my lack of humility, but our delivery service iz nothing short of excellent\". The plump psychiatrist placed her hands on her round belly while her eyes examined Rachel's face. \"We also know you often sneak away some of our products\", Rachel grabbed another burrito and proceeded to much even faster, \"We once followed where you deliver them, and found Rossellini's address. Now, I wonder, who is this Gia Rossellini and why would you go as far as exporting snacks to her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring that explanation, Rachel had found an explanation. \"Gia is my long time friend\". After hearing the excuse out loud, Rachel realized how lame it was, but there was no going back. \"We've been friends since middle school, and she's almost part of my family. So, when she heard about the delicious snacks I eat in this school, she asked me to send her some, since most of them aren't sold in the stores\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, they are exclusive to the school\" said Helen coldly. \"Yeng and Buttercombe Academy have a very <i>tight</i> contract ensuring as such.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Usually, sending our products away from school violates the distribution contract that Yeng has carefully set into place with Buttercombe...\", explained Helen, Rachel began to sweat as she grabbed some nachos with both her hands and shoved them in her mouth. Even if her stomach was full, Rachel was too nervous to pay attention to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Schwartz stayed silent for a moment, before relaxing her face with a big smile. \"But for this time we can close an eye and be generous, only because you are doing a very good job and because you've given us a very valuable customer\" said with a laugh. Her belly quivered like a jelly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel made an awkward laugh. Did it mean she was safe? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, we'd ask you to never do it again, or next time we won't be so lenient\" said Helen with a less joyful tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel nooded as she gulped down the nachos. Some cheese dipped on her chin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've also talked with your dear friend, Ms. Rossellini, you know? However, she denied to know you. How is this possible?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel was panicking again, Helen smirked, that was exactly what she wanted. Play a bit with her toy, just so she could enjoy her job. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She probably didn't want you to know that I sneaked some Yeng products outside of school. You just said it, it's forbidden\" replied Rachel with the first reasonable answet that popped in her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, of course, this explanation seems pretty reasonable\" concluded Helen after a long, poignant pause <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that all?\" asked Rachel after some moments of silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne big smile appeared on Helen's face, touching both her round cheeks. \"No, there is one last thing you should know, more specifically about...\" </span></div></div>",

For all of the talk that Gia had been feeding her about how dangerous Yeng was, she was going to dive headfirst into the fray, and for what? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid she think Rachel couldn't handle this assignment by herself?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas everything that she'd worked for going to go up in smoke?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid she <i>double</i> her weight and get put on this stupid SSS program for nothing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe overweight undercover reporter was inconsolable, and thanks to all the hard work she'd put in at getting fat, all of her instincts were telling her to eat. And that was precisely what she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel came home and tore into the kitchen cabinets. Whatever remained of the groceries that they'd delivered on Monday wouldn't survive this, the latest binge. Any and all of those stupid little snacks that she'd been stuffing herself with went right into her greedy groaning gut. Plastic wrappers filled the trash can and spilled onto the floor as she snacked herself into a stupor. She made herself dinner\u2014a Yeng off-brand substitution for oven-ready pasta\u2014and forced it down on top of her already stuffed stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't until well into the night, when her burner phone rang, that she rightfully came to her senses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rrurp.\" she burbled into the speaker, sick to her stomach, \"Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rachel\u2014glad to get ahold of you.\" Gia's dark voice said over the line, \"I wanted to talk to you about something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was it the same something that Dr. Schwartz talked to me about?\" Rachel said with indignation, \"Something about you getting a job at a Yeng Facility out in Georgia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would she ask you about me?\" Gia said with more anger than concern, \"I told her I had no idea who you were.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would <i>you</i> take a job at a Yeng facility in Georgia?!\" Rachel asked, shifting on her stomach unsteadily, \"And why would you order shit from this school? And why... why didn't you tell me about any of this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGia sighed heavily on the other end of the line, the crinkling of plastic wrapping sounded like static over the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you really think you were the only one on this investigation? Yeng's huge, Rach.\" Gia said before taking an audible bite, \"The lab boys found something fishy in the samples you sent, so I needed more to investigate. Didn't count on them being able to track us down. One thing led to another, I mentioned my time on the Force, and they offered me a job as a security guard. Simple as that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think I can't do this?\" Rachel asked, very suddenly, \"Do you think that I'm not risking my neck out here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For Christ's sake Rachel, you're moving at a snail's pace!\" Gia's abrupt, sudden change in volume made anger crawl up the back of Rachel's throat, \"You've been there a year, you had a lead on vending machines that went nowhere, you've gotten cornered more than a few times, and you were sloppy enough to get us caught.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, you're doing important work, but you're not going to be the lynchpin in taking down Yeng all by yourself.\" Gia's voice calmed slightly, though she still spoke gruffly, \"This is a huge investigation, and we've got people all over the country... the world probably, working on this. Don't get your panties in a wad because you thought <i>you</i> were the only one taking risks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... who's gonna be my contact?\" Rachel asked quietly, almost like a little girl, \"I... I'm all alone out here, Gia...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll still be your contact. It'll just be in my off-time when I'm not at the McCarthy Facility.\" Gia explained calmly, \"That's where most of the equipment that goes to Buttercombe comes from. We managed to get that from your intel. We don't know if it's made there or if it's just designed there, but almost everything you people use up there come from that facility. It's why I took the job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence from Rachel as she felt her anger and frustration melt away into shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any other pressing matters to discuss?\" Gia's eyebrow hook was practically audible, \"No? Good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel had started the night feeling indignant and angry. Like she wasn't being trusted, or that her sacrifices didn't matter. But by the end of that phone call, all Rachel felt was shame. Gia was right, she'd been dragging her feet with this investigation. Getting too caught up in the part of playing a Buttercombe teacher. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe it was time for her to start doing some more detective work...</span></div></div>",

Whereas Dr. Schwartz acted as a sort of gatekeeper, performing interviews and keeping tabs on those who weren't immediately classifiable, Catherine Fitzgerald's sole responsibility on campus was to manage the thus-far vaguely defined yet impossibly permeated system of privileges, balances, and perks otherwise that went to benefit those who had been placed on the system. However, that being said, that was a large order to fill for any one woman who wasn't as impossibly driven as Dr. Fitzpatrick even without the added weight of one blimping brunette in her sophomore year of teaching. Rachel was officially left to her own devices, as far in as she was given a pamphlet and a very brief explanation of what her new tier of disability services could do for her in the broad sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These services are designed to make things easier for you.\" Catherine said, leaning over into her desk and emerging with a freshly xeroxed copy of the Tier III pamphlet, \"Where we were hesitant to place you on the second tier earlier last semester, it's become a bit more...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine paused to look Rachel up and down from the other side of the desk. Her soft belly heaved from the walk down the hall, her thick roll of neck fat rising and falling underneath her less and less prominent chin. The young teacher looked so much rounder than the last time she'd seen her, as if someone had blown her up with a hose and turned her into a parade float. It wasn't the first time that something like this had happened, for sure, but for it to occur to <i>quickly</i>\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Obvious</i> that you require a bit of help in your day to day life.\" Dr. Fitzpatrick continued after a brief pause, \"Feel free to consult me if you have any questions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only problem was that Rachel had <i>so many questions</i>. None of which she could ask without immediately painting a target on her forehead. Where were these new perks applicable? What advantages did they bring? How would they impact her life as a teacher? Who else was on this \"tier\" of SSS, and more importantly, how could she get the code <i>from her bracelet</i>, copy it, and send it off to Gia without either breaking it or alerting everyone that she wasn't exactly the greenhorn teacher that she'd been pretending to be? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving Catherine's office, she felt like she had more questions than answers...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey HERMIA?\" Rachel said quietly to the other smart bracelet on her wrist, \"You wouldn't happen to have access to the SSS roster, would you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small pause as Dr. Schwartz's AI processed Rachel's request. In the time it took for her assistant to articulate a response, Rachel had grown a bit nervous, but thankful when her artificial voice said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sure do, <u>Rachel</u>.\" it said in a strugglingly pleasant tone, \"There are currently 25 teachers placed on your level of Special Services for Stipendiaries, or SSS for short. Would you like me to list them off to you now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Later, when we get back to the cabin.\" she said to the device, \"...So set a reminder around 7.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That conflicts with the Italian Extravaganza event scheduled into the Cafeteria Menu. Would you like me to place your reminder after your previous appointment?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" Rachel answered all too quickly, \"So maybe around... eight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA soft digital tone beeped over the swishing of her thighs as they brushed together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reminder set for eight-thirty to read the SSS Tier III Roster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied with herself, Rachel's round face smiled as she hurried towards the elevator. Her last class of the day wasn't for another two hours, and her meeting with Dr. Fitzpatrick had gone much quicker than anticipated. This called for a reward, certainly. The cafeteria was closed until dinner hours, but maybe she could swing by the teacher's lounge? Surely there was still something left from lunch, or maybe a sweet in the fridge. Then she could pop by the vending machines on the way back to her classroom, that'd make sure she didn't get too hungry before dinner...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small but husky noise of approval rose from deep in her throat at the thought. One hand rose instinctively to stroke her jutting belly warmly. The thought of her favorite snacks dancing in her head as she rode the high that came with putting in effort at her investigation and, effectively, proving Gia wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd ride that high into the teacher's lounge and through no less than three vending machine stops as she trekked across campus, and she wouldn't come down until long after dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel would miss the reminder that she set that night, on account of being far too engrossed in her meal plans to pay attention to HERMIA's soft tones meant to alert her. Lost in a basic desire to enjoy herself and get lost in the sea of flavors that only Buttercombe's Culinary Coalition could provide, she could barely hear the voices of her friends with her greedy guts guiding her that night. She'd come home stuffed to the gills, waddling through her doorway belly-first and collapsed on her couch. She remained there for most of the weekend, hardly moving from the well-worn furniture if she could help it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't until Sunday night that she remembered the SSS roster, glancing almost blankly at her chunky wrists (more, the tightness of her wristbands) until a flash of realization woke her from her logy lethargy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey HERMIA?\" Rachel asked slowly, \"You still have access to the SSS roster?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother moment of deliberation, followed by a soft ding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you'd never ask!\" HERMIA said brightly, \"When you failed to respond to your notification, I e-mailed you a copy of the roster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.\" Rachel blinked in disbelief, \"Dr. Schwartz said you were handy but\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Always happy to help!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u2014Clearly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took some doing, but eventually Rachel rocked her way off of the couch. Her stomach, swollen by the weekend's lethargy and blindly binging on whatever was brought to her doorstep by the Cabinside Service crew, hung low to land on her softened thighs. Her most prominent feature besides a rapidly widening face, swelling cheeks, and uncomfortably plush upper-arms, Rachel would often curse at her stomach as it weighed her down on this chair and that. Pinning her on the sofa, or sloshing from side to side when she did even the simplest tasks. But touching the computer desk in her designated office space was met with more quiet resignation\u2014her thoughts far too preoccupied with the list she was reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo many of her fellow teachers were on this tier of SSS, some of them she knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So many for weight-related reasons...\" Rachel said quietly to herself, \"Like that's a shocker...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she was going to get an honest answer about SSS and what it did, how it affected the teacher's lives here, she was going to have to pick her sources carefully...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho should she interview?</span></div></div>",

I think I could have a talk with her\" concluded the reporter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel went to Sarah Walker's dorm, carrying a large box of cupcakes under her arm. If she was going to visit someone who she had never known, better take some kind of gift, and her sixth sense told her that something to eat would've been well appreciated. When she reached the door, the journalist quickly realized it was particularly wider than any average door, but it didn't surprise her much. After all, Sarah must've been even fatter than Rachel's fellow teacher and friend Megan Porter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could knock, someone tapped her shoulder. Rachel turned around less gracefully than she would've wished due to her bulging belly, and saw a tubby black girl. She was carrying an half dozen of boxes which emanated a delicious aroma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, I have an urgent delivery, so, if you don't have much more to do apart from gazing the door\" said the girl placing an hand on her wide hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ops, s-sorry\" caught by surprise, the journalist moved away. \"Actually, I have to go in too. I need to have a talk with my colleague\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Follow me, then\" snorted the girl as she slided a card on the door lock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened and the girl entered, followed not so silently by the bubbly brunette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here it is! Taiwan special extra-large! Be careful, it's still hot\" announced the delivery girl with a tone so friendly and enthusiastic that for Rachel it was like she had suddenly changed personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally! I was starving! Leave it here, next to me, as usual\" said an husky voice. It came from the bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel saw the girl quckly jumping in the room and just as quickly quickly leaving it with a pile of empty boxes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette knocked the door out of education. From the other side, she could hear the sound of munches which barely stopped while the teacher answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What *chomp* is it? *gulp* Did you forget something?\" asked the heavy voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I'm not the delivery girl, I'm Rachel Conrad. I've been working here for a year\" replied the journalist, slightly opening the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want?\" snorted Sarah Walker. Said question was followed by the sound of other munches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a friendly talk between colleagues. I've also brought something to sink the teeth on\" replied promptly Rachel while showing off the box of muffin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah had never been a social person, and years working at Buttercombe had made her even less social, but she was also a very big glutton, and that sweet present made her eager to talk with this coworker. \"Come here *munch*\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel opened the door, revealing the fattest person she had ever seen. Sarah was at the very least a houndred pounds heavier than Ms. Polluck, who already weighed more than a quarter ton, but the woman in front of her was absolutely massive. Sitting on what looked like a queen sized bed with a frame made of thick metal bars, the woman was taking up nearly all of it. Dressed in a ridiculously large muumuu, her legs had to be wide open to let her belly flow in front of her, reaching the edge of the matress. Her round face had full cheeks, like that of a chipmunk, with long black hair flowing on her back. Squished against her flabby side, rested the boxes delivered by the girl, probably in a place that Sarah's ham-sized arms could reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel had been used to seeing fat women around the school (many of whom fatter than her, much to her relief) and prepared psychologically to meet a tremendously fat woman, or would've made such a face that the titanic woman would've probably been too offended to talk with her. Instead of overreacting, the bubbly brunette handed the muffin boxes to Sarah and sat on a two-seats iron chair, next to a desk, covered with papers, presumably homeworks, and crumbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah was busy filling that large gut of her, making hard for Rachel to start a conversation. \"Nice room, isn't it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gigantic woman gulped down two cupcakes before answering. \"Well, I do spend most of the time here, so I can't complain, but it definitely is\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you rarely leave your dorm, how do you have lessons?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By live-cam\" replied Sarah pointing at a large pad on the bedside table. \"The school provided it to me once I got a tier upgrade\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The school really does take care of us\" commented Rachle, looking at her own belly. \"When did you get the upgrade?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When my old bed began to creak a bit too much\" replied Sarah before shoving in her mouth the two last cupcakes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No wonder she got that fat\" thought Rachel. That woman had gotten so big she was breaking reinforced furniture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what does this tier IV consist of?\" asked the brunette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mostly *munch* in furniture more suited for *burp* me. A bonus of multiple free deliveries *gulp* every day, plus three *chomp* full meals in case I *munch* don't want to leave the room\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel took note of everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was the school like when you just began teaching here? \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterward, Sarah started to talk less and eat more, becoming much less friendly in the process. Presumably, once the gift was fully eaten, that whale of a woman didn't want to be bothered anymore, so Rachel left after gaining some few more infos. Apparently, the SSS program has begun around 15 years before to satisfy some students' particular needs, but had become too expensive for the school, which began the partnership with Yeng to get the necessary fundings. That was a good start, and Rachel knew what she had to do next...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rachel knew what she had to do next. Before parting, Sarah Walker mentioned her sister 'Jenny Benny' and her journalist brain immediately brought up a name. Jennifer? The teacher who made her name well over a decade ago, during that controversy over Culinary Education? Rachel recalled it well since the spillover directly influenced her high school years. All the insults the poor teacher had to endure for publicly saying that a Culinary teacher was primarily a taste-tester, not a cook\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was the woman doing these days? She could be even better informed than Sarah. And perhaps she wouldn't have her nose so deep in the Yeng trough? A quick, innocuous search on the net found that Jenny Walker had established herself as an educational consultant, her web page complete with her current address and phone number. Rachel was about to call her when she paused. She definitely did not want to draw more attention to herself. This required thorough preparation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen a free hour came up the next day, Rachel set out of her cabin, her golf cart fully loaded with consumables of all sorts. If anyone asked, she was going to have a picnic at one of those huge deserted meadows which made up most of the campus. She also conveniently 'forgot' HERMIA and all other electronic devices at home, except for her burner phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel drove to a small copse, parked in its shade and hidden amongst the trees she dialled the number she noted down the day before. And waited\u2026 and waited. She unwrapped and bit into her first cupcake before someone finally answered her call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWalker Education Consultancy, *huff,* Jennifer Walker speaking.\u201d The voice sounded husky, even heavier than her sister's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, hello, Ms. Walker, this is Rachel Conrad,\u201d she decided to use her real name so she could claim innocence if anyone traced it back to her. After all, she was only inquiring for her own good, right? \u201cI was wondering if you could give me a bit of a personal advice. You see, I've been teaching at the Buttercombe Academy and\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, really? How wonderful! How's Ms. Polluck, is she still there? Have you met my sister?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, yes, she is, she's, well, good, I think. And yes, I have, that's how I came across your name, you sister's mentioned you and\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see, I see. Well, tell her I send my regards and that she should get in touch more often. So\u2026\u201d the woman chomped down on something before continuing: \u201cThey're treating you well, I hope?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSounds coming from the phone inspired Rachel to reach for another cupcake. \u201cOh, yeah, sure. They are treating me <i>extremely</i> well, that's actually why I am calling. See, I have been placed on the 'Special Services for Stipendiaries' programme recently and it's<i> amazing</i> but I've begun to wonder how did the Yeng connection come to be? I'm suddenly surrounded with their top-notch technology and it's a little uncanny, frankly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny barked out a short laugh. \u201cOh, I get you, believe me. I really get you. Uh, as to how it started, well, there was some kind of scandal that Yeng was involved in, those fifteen, maybe sixteen years ago. Possibly even seventeen? Doesn't matter anyway, you won't find about it on the net nowadays. Heck, you wouldn't find much even back then. Still, the corporation was pretty badly hit by the public backlash and tried to improve its image by various deals with schools and hospitals, offering assistance and know-how\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see but what's that got to do with Buttercombe exactly?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I was completely new here, I wasn't privy to the deal they struck. But Shannon, erm, Ms. Polluck used to be pretty sharp and quick on her feet so it wouldn't surprise me if she used their weakness to milk Yeng for all it was worth. I do know that we got a real sweet deal out of it in my second year there- or was it third?- and you've been living off it ever since.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel's thoughts backtracked to what Jenny said earlier. \u201cDid you say a scandal? What kind of a scandal was it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, well, I shouldn't be spreading gossip and I know nothing specific, sorry about that. All's been forgiven anyway. Ms. Fukuda was instrumental in revamping Yeng's reputation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was before she became our Vice Principal, right?\u201d Another cupcake disappeared in Rachel's hungry mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, sure. She arrived at Buttercombe much later. I'm not actually sure when exactly she took over since I was long gone by that time. I think Shannon was getting too, uh, tired to handle everything herself so Fukuda was sent to help with running the school, part-time at first until eventually they made her post official. Naturally.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, right. Naturally.\u201d That did not quite explain why Fukuda came to Buttercombe in the first place. However, Jennifer's changing tone in her last two answers told Rachel she shouldn't be pushing her luck. \u201cWell, thanks. That's actually a lot more information than I needed. I just wanted to get a feel for what I'm getting into, see?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, understandably. You said you're on the SSS now? Well, enjoy its perks, believe me, it's worth it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, yeah, I will. I already do, in fact. Thanks a lot and goodbye.\u201d Rachel ended the call shaking and bathed in cold sweat. After months of coddled existence at Buttercombe, both the encounter with dr. Schwartz and now this call reminded her what a gamble she was taking. Now her entire body felt sticky, the shakes made her blouse creep up and reveal her bottom tyre\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need a shower,\u201d decided Rachel. However, as she leaned forward to start the cart, her hips brushed one of her two full picnic baskets. This reminder made her switch her priorities. \u201cAfter I have my snack.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a bit of a struggle, she unzipped her tight skirt and started filling her belly. Her fears slowly receded as she ate, replaced with the familiar feeling of contentment. Her stomach inched forward on her thick thighs and Rachel's priorities reshuffled again. \u201cHERMIA, how much time do I have till my next-? Oh. Well, never mind. I can get back to snooping tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She took a momentary pause from her herculean lunch (the perks of such an easy fa\u00e7ade for sure!) and dialed the Vice Principal of Buttercombe Academy, one Dr. Fukuda Hinamizawa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have reached Dr. Hinamizawa.\u201d Fukuda answered the tone from her electronic speaker curtly, \u201cHow may I assist you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello, this is Destiny Richards, branch Y-44, South Carolina.\u201d the woman Rachel had spoken to said in a much different, slightly deeper tone. Her natural voice. \u201cI just received a phone call from one of your employees about <i>Jennifer Walker</i>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFukuda had been in the middle of her own lunch\u2014one much more modest than her employee\u2019s, but still somewhat rich by her standards. She put her fork down and dabbed at her lips calmly with a napkin, wiping away any residue and smudging her lipstick slightly. She placed her fork to the side, pushed her plate that much further back, and cleared her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you now?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFukuda\u2019s face remained as chiseled and stone-cold as always, but with the added interest of an eyebrow piqued in curiosity. She reached forward, her slight tummy bunching underneath her purple blouse, and picked up the receiver to her phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd, Destiny, when did you receive this phone call?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTwo minutes ago.\u201d The woman said into the vice principal\u2019s ear before not very audibly taking another bite from the cupcake she\u2019d set aside to make her phone call, \u201cFirst time in months that anyone\u2019s actually called this number.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll the more reason to keep this line in service, Mrs. Richards.\u201d Fukuda kicked her leg over her knee, \u201cYou were right to call me so soon\u2014did they ask anything in particular that you feel would be beneficial for me to know about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe was asking about Yeng\u2019s involvement with Buttercombe Academy.\u201d The heavy voice panted slightly, leaning forward at such a size could be quite taxing, \u201cShe wanted to know about SSS, specifically.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t break character.\u201d It was more of a command on Fukuda\u2019s part than a question<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course not. I hit all the key phrases.\u201d The sound of rustling plastic and meaty arms plunging into bags of chips, \u201cSister, time-frame of employment, Polluck. I told her to enjoy SSS without revealing sensitive deemed outside of the character\u2019s grasp.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFukuda\u2019s seniors had been overly skeptical of her tenacity in ensuring that this particular loose end was covered up. It had been a very long time since Jennifer Walker was important in the eyes of the press, but the odd phone call, usually those attempting to dig up a scandal that had long been buried, only served to justify the need for Destiny Richards\u2014a suitable stand-in for the Walker woman, at least over the phone. By keeping a small off-books allowance set aside to hire a professional voice actress indefinitely (compared to some of the extraordinary expenses that Yeng could burn through, yes, keeping Destiny on the side for as many years was very small) they could ensure that whenever anyone wanted to look up Jennifer Walker, Yeng would know about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny Richards had been Jen Walker professionally for more than ten years now, and it was an arrangement that had benefitted everyone involved. Through extensive voice coaching and a thorough psychological evaluation of the original, with help from Dr. Schwartz, Destiny Richards was so convincing as Jennifer Walker that even her sister Sarah couldn\u2019t tell them apart during their now rare phone conversations. As the years went on, it was reassuring to know that Fukuda had chosen a voice actress so committed to the role.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery good, Mrs. Richards.\u201d Fukuda smiled, \u201cI will be sure that your great efforts do not go unrewarded.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of eating on the other end of the line became more blatant. A happy, guttural noise sounded from deep within her voluminous body. Fukuda picked up on it and smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, Mrs. Richards.\u201d Fukuda said, still smiling, \u201cI am afraid that you have contacted me during my lunch, so I must be going.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSame.\u201d The voice said thickly into the speaker<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut before I hang up the phone\u2026\u201d Fukuda switched legs, kicking one triumphantly over the other, \u201c<i>Which</i> of my employees was it that called you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Fitzpatrick was also not coincidentally eating lunch, although she had the added benefit of Dr. Schwartz\u2019s company.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey did this often\u2014they were very good friends. Despite the fact that their personalities could clash at times, Catherine and Helen shared a mutual love of many things. The small amount of German that Catherine remembered from college did well to endear her to the school\u2019s counsellor, and the reverse was true in Helen\u2019s ability to tell wonderful stories that kept her on the edge of her seat. The fact that they both worked for Buttercombe Academy\u2014more specifically, that they both worked for Yeng\u2014had nothing to do with their mutual respect and admiration for one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt did, however, make it convenient for Dr. Hinamizawa at time s when she needed both women in her audience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Catherine had buzzed her in electronically, Fukuda had invited herself in. Standing rigidly where the wheelchair-bound doctor sat, and the now nearly three-hundred-pound counsellor had nestled herself comfortably on the loveseat, she would admit to feeling at least somewhat uncomfortable. As rigid as she was\u2026 it <i>was</i> lunch time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoctor.\u201d Fukuda said to the two of them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoctor.\u201d Catherine nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoktor.\u201d Helen steepled her fingers over her belly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am here to discuss Rachel Conrad.\u201d Fukuda gripped her orange-trimmed file-folder\u2014a visual denotation of which classification of asset Conrad had been assigned\u2014and stared down the bridge of her nose at her two seated colleagues, \u201cShe has been asking questions about Jennifer Walker.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRachel Conrad?\u201d Fitzpatrick made a face, \u201cThe new English teacher who gained about a hundred pounds?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Ahundertf\u00fcnfzig</i>.\u201d Helen corrected, \u201cAh, A hundred <i>und fifty</i> to be precise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s a complete ditz.\u201d Catherine turned back to the burrito that Helen had brought her, dismissing Fukuda almost entirely, \u201cWhy would she be asking about Jennifer Walker? She would have been a preteen when all of that happened.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, there is no denying that it was in fact her who placed the phone call.\u201d Fukuda said sternly, placing the file on Catherine\u2019s desk to reveal all of the notes that had been made about her just since the school year had started, \u201cAnd while there were some minor discrepancies with her conduct previously\u2014her late nights, frequent mailing of packages, and the recent business with one Gia Rossellini, whom we have under servaillance in Y-43\u2014I believe that there is no denying that Ms. Conrad is certainly not here to teach our students.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen and Catherine exchanged looks. The two of them had worked with Rachel far more than their superior had. The two of them knew first-hand that Rachel wasn\u2019t exactly subtle about her desire to be placed on SSS. First there was the bogus HAS claim, and then she seemed to be intentionally gaining weight to be placed on Tier III of the program. This wouldn\u2019t have been the first time a faculty member had done such a thing in the name of receiving a few added bonuses, but it had been precisely these concerns that had kept Catherine from green-lighting Rachel\u2019s admission last year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen had, of course, worked with her the most. And she had also developed her own opinions on the matter. She was a psychiatrist\u2014profiling people was exactly what she was supposed to be doing, after all. However, she had kept quiet on the matter of HERMIA. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat card was going to come into play later, when she was ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see.\u201d Helen grunted as she rolled into a less reclined position, \u201cSo you think Rachel is not what she claims to be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think that at this point, it is undeniable.\u201d Fukuda said with a grave face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is ridiculous, the woman is a complete airhead.\u201d Catherine said dismissively as she readied her knife and fork, \u201cEven if she <i>did</i> research Jen Walker, I\u2019m sure that actor you hired satisfied her well enough.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAch! I <i>love</i> Destiny!\u201d Helen chirped, \u201cShe was the perfect choice and I <i>loved</i> her work\u2014she was my first choice for Frau Walker!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNevertheless.\u201d Fukuda said sternly, \u201cWe must take precautionary action. I would much rather be wrong and have overreacted than correct and unprepared.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a slight pause between the three of them. Despite the fact that they were well and cozy on Yeng\u2019s payroll, only Fukuda had any <i>official</i> authority between the three of them. Catherine had some pull due to her accident and Helen was\u2026 <i>scary</i>. But by and large, Fukuda was not only the person with the necessary firepower to get the ball rolling, she was also the only person convinced that Rachel was going to be much of a threat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026\u201d Catherine said with a mouthful of burrito, \u201cWhat do you suggest?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We take care of the problem.\" Fukuda said, her shoulders squared and her eyes narrowed, \"If Rachel Conrad wants to know about SSS, then we will give her all the experience on the matter she can handle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFukuda scratched something on Rachel's file and pushed it towards Dr. Fitzpatrick, making her eyes widen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then some.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Despite its prestige, the beginning of every school year at Buttercombe Academy was just like any other school. It was a lot of shuffling around, with teachers scrambling just as much as their students were to remember their schedules, plan out their days, and trying to figure out the most efficient way to get their jobs done while also leaving enough room to enjoy themselves. Rachel had thought, at the beginning of her first year, that it was just her\u2014the stress of her <i>real</i> job, combined with what amounted to very little familiarity with teaching. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven still, though the concrete hadn\u2019t dried so to speak, somehow this seemed a bit excessive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel Conrad had come home from her third day of class to find a small U-Haul outside of her cabin, loading up anything that hadn\u2019t come stock in the home they\u2019d provided for her. Clothes, her computer, everything up to and including the fake diploma that Gia had made for her was slowly being lugged into the trailer behind a black truck by several beefy looking guys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd in that moment, Rachel was sure that she had been caught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer heartrate jumped, pounding in her chest and beating loud behind her ears. Everything except the sharp hum of adrenaline faded away as she wobbled out of her golf cart and huffed right up to the moving van.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d Rachel shouted, waving her arms, \u201cHEY!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeads turned, slightly, but no one stopped doing their jobs. However, ahead did poke out from behind her doorway. Short curly blonde locks bobbed excitedly as a rather petite woman\u2014lithe around the waistline, a rarity around here\u2014practically bounced down the two porch steps and hurried up to greet her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi!\u201d she said in a voice that sounded much too deep for a pixie like her, \u201cMy name\u2019s Marcia\u2014Marcia Flannagan; I\u2019m the housing director of\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>What is going on</i>?!\u201d Rachel said in one exasperated breath, \u201cThey\u2019re\u2026 moving! They\u2019re moving me! All of my stuff\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs being relocated to another, larger, <i>better</i> cabin located right\u2014\u201d the small woman came up to about chest-high on Rachel, and she got closer she pointed a pen down the small paved road that went up along the neighborhood, \u201cUp there. It\u2019s another ten minutes or so to drive, but I\u2019m <i>sure</i> that\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the actual hell?\u201d Rachel puffed up to the smaller woman, her shoulders broad and her chest inflated. She could eat this little shit. \u201cI didn\u2019t <i>ask</i> to have all my stuff rifled through!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow Ms. Conrad, please, calm down. Nobody \u2018rifled\u2019 through anything.\u201d Marcia said with what she had hoped to have been a soothing hand on the shoulder that quickly got batted away, \u201cWe\u2019re expecting an influx of specialty teachers flown in for the Foreign Languages department, and it\u2019s a lot cheaper and more efficient to\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust <i>move</i> me without telling me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcia rolled her eyes and put her slender arms on her narrow hips. Pursing her lips and raising her eyebrow, she waited patiently as Rachel descended into a (worry-filled) rampage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat being said, Rachel\u2019s freakout was much more justified from her stance. Yeng paid for everything around here, and Rachel had no doubt in her mind that Yeng, the very company she was investigating, had bankrolled her moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre we finished?\u201d she asked with a click of her tongue as Rachel stopped to catch her ragged breath, \u201cGood. Now we\u2019re running a bit behind schedule\u2014we\u2019d had hoped to meet you at the south gate to tell you about the move after it had already happened. But if you\u2019ll give us five minutes we\u2019ll have everything in the back in two shakes of a lamb\u2019s tail.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2026 what?\u201d Rachel panted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo inside, say buh-bye to your old tiny cabin, and then hope in your cart so we can scoot off to your new home, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiny red heels (now that Rachel could take a minute to see it, this woman was <i>short</i>!) clicked against the pavement as she went over to discuss matters with what had to be the moving foreman. Rachel leaned against her cart and parked her fat butt back in the seat to catch her breath. And to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, she\u2019d brought her tablet with her to class in her bag\u2014including the usb drive that had all of her notes on it. The data extractor that Gia had sent back was in her right tennis shoe for running (not so good for running these days, but an excellent hiding spot!) and everything else was taken care of. She had HERMIA, she had her bracelet, but she was missing something\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe burner phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe off-grid burner phone that she contacted Gia with\u2014it was her only way of contacting her without running the risk of their conversations being dropped in on! She\u2019d left it in the bottom drawer on the right side of the desk in her office. If she left it behind, there was no way that she\u2019d be able to replace it\u2014at least not easily. It\u2019d be months before another phone like that could come her way, if ever. What\u2019s worse was that all of her calls with Gia, a woman whom she had officially no connection with as per her interrogation with Dr. Schwartz, were logged on it. Oh it didn\u2019t get much worse than this\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait!\u201d Rachel called out to Marcia as she passed by the front of her cart, \u201cDid you\u2026 I need to get something out of my desk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, sweetie. We\u2019re <i>very</i> efficient.\u201d Marcia clicked her pen, \u201cWe emptied out every nook and cranny and we put it <i>all</i> in a box for ya.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2026 you did.\u201d Rachel felt her heart skip a beat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnything that didn\u2019t really seem to have a home, we\u2019ll put in your bedroom once it\u2019s set up.\u201d The little woman said with a smile that Rachel couldn\u2019t help but interpret as sinister, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, everything will be there. They don\u2019t pay us to be sloppy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay this got so much worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had actually taken about ten more minutes to get everything loaded up, five more minutes than Marcia had said. Of course, it could have been another five years and it would have felt just as long to her. Rachel had been slowly, very quietly undergoing a meltdown as she tore herself to bits over whether or not that burner phone was still going to be there. If they missed it, or worse yet, if they <i>found</i> it. Rachel had no idea if her cover was blown, but odds were that a mysterious non-traceable phone would certainly raise suspicions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was so freaked out that she wasn\u2019t hungry\u2014coming home from a long day of teaching usually left the poor woman starved. But as the ever-eating ELA teacher pressed her gut against the steering wheel that she white-knuckled, it couldn\u2019t manage so much as a grumble. Her nerves were fried. She needed to know if that phone was still going to be there when she pulled up to her new cabin. She needed to know if her cover was blown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moving truck (Marcia had ridden with the movers) pulled up into the cart-sized driveway, backed out, and allowed Rachel to pull in with her cart. By the time she put weight on her wobbly knees, the men were already busy moving everything into her new\u2014much less humble\u2014abode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s big, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Marcia said with no small amount of pride, \u201cI worked <i>pre-tty</i> hard to score you this baby.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Rachel asked for what felt like the millionth time in thirty minutes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, normally they reserve things like this for the teachers that have been here a while.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcia held out a hand for Rachel to take (more customary than anything else, Rachel now outweighed this woman twice over) as she exited the cart slowly. In front of them was a sizable improvement from the somewhat dinky living space (and increasingly so as Rachel doubled in size over the course of last year) that she\u2019d been living in since day one of her investigation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer new cabin looked to be, and upon inspection on the inside, certainly was much bigger. The living room was more than just a couch and a television set, but also included an office setting and large empty bookcase. The kitchenette had graduated to a full kitchen (and in true Buttercombe fashion, the large appliances made an unsurprising comeback). The hallways were wider and the rooms were bigger. Her bedroom (when not occupied by hurried movers placing her clothes back on the rack in her closet) had enough room for a queen sized bed, another television along the wall, and a desk sitting at the window. All with enough room for her to wriggle her wide behind through without any trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo?\u201d Marcia said proudly, \u201cFeeling silly for being so worked up earlier?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetter still, Rachel saw the opaque white box that had been left on her bed first-thing by the movers. And distinctive burgundy color of her burner phone was right there in the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo great.\u201d Rachel puffed, \u201cI mean, yes, really silly. I\u2019m sorry I doubted you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey always are.\u201d Marcia said with a smile, her ruby rips spread wide at the thought of another bonus coming her way, \u201cNow if you\u2019ll just come with me\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Since moving into the fancy new dorm, the brunette loved spending her time at home, often without moving from the wonderful recliner armchair, her \"magic throne\". Rachel sat on her usual place, on which her butt had left a large print and the recliner, with HERMIA's voice, spoke:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome back, Ms. Conrad. I have some chocolate and mint biscuits\" and the snack dispenser, filled to the brim with biscuits, rose to Rachel's armreach. \"Would you like something else?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Biscuits is fine\" replied the brunette picking one. \"But something salty with these sweets won't hurt\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's some doritos, your favorites\" replied readily the voice as another snack dispenser from the other side of the armchair rose. Filled to brim with doritos. Rachel grabbed an handful of them and shove it into her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HERMIA, can you prepare me a lesson for second year class for tomorrow? And a test for first year class for the next week?\" asked with her mouth still full of chips. Orange crumbs rolled inside her cleavage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure! And remember today there's the Super Spaghetti Special at dinner\" replied the voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for remembering it\" replied Rachel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the last couple of weeks, Rachel had spent most of the time secluded in her dorm, in which HERMIA provided her everything she needed and wanted, meals included (heck, especially meals) thanks to the new high tech kitchen and its brand new appliances which, under HERMIA's control, could make entire courses for the hefty teacher. It couldn't make dishes too complicated, but Rachel wasn't very picky for her food, especially since she ate mostly snacks. Every once in a while, she still went to the cafeteria, partially to still have some kind of social life and spend time with her colleagues and partially for the special meal events the school makes at least once per week. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout even asking for it, the chair reclined and begin vibrating on its own, without having Rachel asking for it. She had asked it many times, HERMIA must have learnt what Rachel likes over the days. The tubby woman closed her eyes a moment to relax, her fat rippling from the vibration of the armchair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, the bubbly brunette was scared of the idea of an AI controlling her entire dorm, however, in the successive weeks, HERMIA never did anything suspicious and proved to be very helpful for the increasingly lazy reporter. After less than a month since moving in, and Rachel didn't know how she could have done before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you turn the tv, please?\" asked Rachel before eating another handful of doritos. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tv turned on. There was a culinary program, during which a baker was making a Sacher cake. It made Rachel even more hungry, and ate more voraciously the biscuits. The snack dispenser constantly refilled before Rachel could scrap the bottom. She also noticed that her belly had... rosen and was almost reaching the bottom of the tv screen. Maybe she needed to cut down with the snacks, she didn't need to gain anymore... Maybe after this one last snack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel was enjoying her new perks, unaware of the hidden cameras inside her dorms, from which Helen Schwartz was monitoring her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue-haired woman giggled satisfied, everything was going according to her plan. Like the others, she wasn't sure if Rachel was a spy or not but, just in case, she had devised a perfect plan: with HERMIA controlling everything in Rachel's new dorm and pampering the teacher, they will gain Rachel's good side. As an expert psychiatrist, Helen understood clearly Rachel's personality: she likes success, but isn't an hard worker, she prefer comforts. But now that they're giving her all of the comforts she could ask for, Rachel would never betrays the school, and instead would be a friendly teacher like many others, while a nice toy for Helen to play with... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If only Evie could see what I'm doing to this girl. She would go crazy\" commented the blue haired woman munching some nachos. Seeing Rachel gorging had always made Helen hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, inside the screen on Dr. Schwarts's desk, Rachel was gulping down some newly made sandwiches. Making some extras which Rachel didn't ask for was also a strategy to break her initiativity and make the woman even more demanding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSchwartz gulped down the taco. \"I'm going to have a lot of fun with you\" purred while gently stroking the screen with a finger. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Even though Rachel had spent her last couple of weeks mostly stuffing herself she still tried to do some investigating. Every time she had went to the cafeteria Rachel had been listening in on other peoples conversations and questioning her coworkers on anything new and weird that they knew about. No one suspected anything weird about Rachel asking so many questions as they thought she was just trying to catch up after not being around so much. People still weren't sure what Rachel had been doing for the last few weeks and the only thing Rachel had told them was that she had been busy, feeling kinda embarrassed that she had mainly just been eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel had gotten some possible leads out of her brief investigations. The teachers were complaining about there being suddenly more students trying to skip class and some had even been stealing food from one of the vending machines. There was apparently an old rumor being passed by some of the students about some mysterious classroom. Then there was some sort of gift or a prize that had been given to some of the staff by the Yeng Corporation. No one really know what it was but they knew some of the people it had been given to. To Rachel surprise it seemed only people she had gotten close with had gotten these \"prizes\". Shiro, Brooke, Rio and Megan just to name a few. And it did seem kinda odd that she hadn't really heard from them after her housing upgrade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Rachel hadn't had the chance to continue with these new, or even with the old, leads that she had gotten as she seemed to be spending more and more time packing food into her ever expanding body. But Rachel had still managed to make progress on the reason she got to the SSS program in the first place. She had been learning the ins and outs of all the appliances in her new home. She had used everyone of them, tested how much they can help and spoil her and with HERMIA's help she had been learning how exactly they work. There were still some things she didn't know because HERMIA wouldn't tell her everything about the appliances as to \"protect the trademarked secrets of Yeng\". The only thing she hadn't tried was her scale, mainly because she didn't feel comfortable knowing how much she weighed now. Also she also didn't want to go through the trouble of trying to see the scale from under her large form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel had gathered a lot of possibly important notes about the Yeng products but all of that \"information gathering\" was also making her get more gluttonous and fatter. And this increased gluttonous was making it harder to focus on actually getting on with her leads and she wasn't sure what was important information and what should she be investigating now. She was starting to feel like she needed someone else's input on this matter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile sitting in her recliner treating herself with some pizza and fries Rachel was thinking about the things she had learned recently and decided that maybe Gia could help her. She started to reach for her burner phone but then stopped. Was she safe to call Gia in here. HERMIA would be listening and there had been some weird things happening like Dr.Schwarts coming in at odd times to ask about the new home and then there was some repairmen coming in to fix something before Rachel even had the chance to report it. Maybe it was just paranoia but Rachel couldn't shake the feeling that someone would find out if she called Gia while still in her house.</span></div></div>",

Even in the short amount of time that she\u2019d been enrolled at this Academy, her brain had more or less been rewired to always take the easy route. And he easy route was to, consistently, come home after classes and collapse into a little pile in front of the television while eating snacks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll do it tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThursday\u2019s really better for her, I should do it then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh but it\u2019s the weekend and I have <i>so</i> much stuff to do\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of leaving the comfort of her cabin was honestly the most unappealing part of it. She wasn\u2019t willing to throw the investigation under the bus for the sake of her own comfort. But everything here was so <i>cozy</i> and she hardly had any reason to leave the comfort of her own home aside from classes. Who even <i>went</i> outside anymore? Rachel had managed to sweet-talk herself into putting off a simple phone call with Gia for almost a week before she finally buckled down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, of course, she immediately regretted it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel had never been an \u201coutdoor girl\u201d to start with. She may have liked skulking around for investigations, but she would have been a much happier woman if there had simply been no outside to begin with. With the bugs and the air and the heat. <i>Yuck</i>. Rachel had come a long way from her humble upbringing, and her desire to get indoors and stay there had been a primary motivator. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo when you add a two hundred pounds weight gain and soft, supple muscles that had atrophied from being carried everywhere by her sturdy, trusty and at-times worryingly overloaded cart, Rachel barely stood a chance!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked ridiculous\u2014a great big fat woman, carrying a comically small picnic basket and a large blanket to sit on. She was toddling along, puffing and sweating after mere minutes of being exposed to the Autumn sun. It was one of the early days of October, the Summer heat having more or less faded, and poor Rachel Conrad still felt like she was going to keel over from mild discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA great belly swung in front of her as she lifted her hammy legs one after the other. It bobbed and weaved expertly, like a boxer in the ring of her too-tight elastic waistband, and eeked its way out inch by inch in all of its pale fleshy glory. Every so often she stopped, wheezing, and tugged the crotch of her leggings up a bit in hopes of sheathing the thing. But every few steps, there it went again\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hate this\u2026\u201d Rachel whined, \u201cI\u2019m so fucking huge\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt hadn\u2019t stopped her from pilfering her picnic basket early. Not even halfway to where she was intending on parking that big round butt of hers and her \u201clunch\u201d was already almost gone. She\u2019d snacked on the ride over, her way out the door\u2026 honestly, Rachel had been eating pretty much since she woke up this morning!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGotta start jogging or something\u2026\u201d she puffed, wiping thick sweat from her brow with one jiggly arm, \u201cCan\u2019t afford to get too big\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she\u2019d finally reached the spot that had pinged as out of the way as possible, Rachel was a mess. Her thighs were blotchy and red, having rubbed their way through her newest leggings. She was sweating down every crevice and every fold, and she couldn\u2019t seem to catch her breath. To top it off\u2014apparently the mosquitos hadn\u2019t quite gotten the message about the season change. She\u2019d been getting poked and prodded by those little bastards since she waddled out the front door!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuff\u2026 huff\u2026\u201d she gasped, throwing the emptied basket down and readying her blanket in a half-assed attempt to keep the ants off of her meaty backside, \u201cJesus\u2026 Christ\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel plopped down with fury and thunder, her entire form quaking with impact. She steadied herself\u2014one hand placed firmly on the gelatinous gut that wobbled uncontrollably between her legs. God, she was getting so big. The SSS program was an important part of her investigation, but she wasn\u2019t exactly keen on <i>relying</i> on it for basic things like getting around. If her investigation wasn\u2019t over soon, Rachel honestly felt like she was going to have to be rolled out of this school\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwatting at a mosquito that had dared to graze her cheek, Rachel pulled out the burner phone from underneath one of her melon-sized tits. It was damp with sweat, even as she placed it against her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the phone rang, Rachel chomped excessively on her last granola bar\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGia?\u201d she whispered hoarsely, both from lack of breath and in hopes of outwitting any surveillance equipment nearby, \u201cSorry I haven\u2019t called.

Rachel winced as she pulled the phone a half an inch further away from her ear as she battled against the sound of Gia\u2019s wheezing. Of course, the <i>one</i> time she\u2019d gotten to call her lead, it would be at a bad time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you\u2026 hff\u2026 mean it\u2019s been\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGia could barely seem to make the sentence out, frighteningly out of breath.

You\u2019re puffing like a chimney.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, m\u2019just\u2026 phew\u2026 l\u2019il out of breath.\u201d Gia gasped, taking another pause (presumably to take a drink of water) before smacking her lips into the phone, \u201cJust got done with my rounds, back to my car.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do they have you doing over there?\u201d Rachel asked, scratching at the already swelling mosquito bites on her thick calve, \u201cLike cop stuff?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wish.\u201d Gia puffed breathlessly, \u201cMost days I\u2019m on guard duty\u2014I sit on my ass all day and scan keycards of the staff that go in and out of the facility.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds fun.\u201d Rachel unpacked a small bag of chips that had been rattling around in her mostly empty picnic basket instinctively, \u201cCan you copy the codes or whatever? Get into some private areas?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m working on it. Everyone gets a new code each month, so the lab boys are trying to rig up one that doesn\u2019t expire.\u201d Gia took another drink, \u201cBut they\u2019ve only let me out of the Box like three times so far. I\u2019ll be lucky to get one shift a week where I can go as deep as I need to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA not-so-small part of Rachel wanted to say \u2018ha, told you so!\u2019 It wasn\u2019t all that easy going undercover on-site in a Yeng facility! These people were crazy prepared and super cautious. All the grief that Gia had been giving her about dragging her feet felt just a little bit unfounded, which made Rachel feel just a smidge better about her investigative skills. Never mind the fact that Gia had had her job for a fraction of the time that Rachel had had hers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blimping brunette shifted on her copious amounts of butt blubber, her vast figure wriggling and rolling as she made herself more comfortable in the span it took to catch Gia up to speed. She told her everything\u2014the new cabin, the automated kitchen, and how HERMIA had synced to everything in the house almost immediately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho\u2019s Hermia?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe assistant that Dr. Schwartz gave me.\u201d Rachel smacked her lips, salt granules stuck to her puffy pink face, \u201cIt\u2019s super convenient.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou kept that thing?\u201d Gia scoffed, \u201cI would have tossed it in the garbage\u2014what if it\u2019s listening to you right now, Rachel?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRelax, I left her at home. And I never say anything too incriminating when I\u2019m there, or wearing the wristwatch.\u201d Rachel wiped her face, \u201cBesides, she\u2019s been programmed with some pretty basic teaching essentials\u2014I basically couldn\u2019t do my job without her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, I knew I should have put you undercover as like a secretary or something.\u201d Gia groaned, \u201cThis is taking too long.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel couldn\u2019t have agreed more. This was taking forever, and she felt like she\u2019d done absolutely nothing to contribute to the investigation. Aside from getting put on SSS, every lead she\u2019d had wound up as a dead end. So basically, all she\u2019d managed to do was get really fucking fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat HERMIA thing.\u201d Gia asked suddenly, taking Rachel out of her thoughts, \u201cDo you think you could send it to me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHermia?\u201d Rachel repeated, \u201cI don\u2019t know, Gia\u2026 I kinda like having her around\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA copy, Rachel.\u201d Gia growled, \u201cMaybe if it can sync up with all of the Yeng technology up there, it can do the same down here, and I\u2019ll be able to get some answers on my end.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think that\u2019ll raise some eyebrows?\u201d Rachel winced, \u201cI mean, what if Dr. Schwartz\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSend me a copy of the program. Use the Data Extractor I sent you. You remember, right?\u201d Gia bulldozed through, \u201cIs that clear?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re clear.\u201d Rachel curdled at Gia\u2019s police academy training, \u201cAnything else you want me to tackle while I\u2019m up here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually there is\u2014a lot of tech that\u2019s made up there comes from this site, and I want to get some detailed specs on it. Do you have that camera we sent you with?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel thought, long and hard, about where that camera might have wound up. With the move and everything, it could have been anywhere. Admittedy, Rachel had been a little more concerned with her dietary habits than her organizational skills lately. Her cabin was kind of a wreck\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can find it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can find it.\u201d Gia\u2019s eyeroll was practically audible \u201cWell, <i>when</i> you find it, I want you to take pictures of something called the XLR-8.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAccelerate?\u201d Rachel repeated in confusion, \u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of acceleration going on up here, Gia.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI figured. But since most of the tech goes up there to be tested first before being released to the public, I don\u2019t have a clue what you\u2019ll be looking for.

All I know is that it's supposed to be some kind of souped-up mobility scooter, a weird-looking one probably. So move your fat butt, look around, find one, take pictures of it and send them to me. Don't call me until then, lazybone.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGia's words echoed in Rachel's mind as she cursed her undercover partner. Gia was one to talk about laziness! She'd had to brave mosquitoes and bugs and\u2026 and ticks and God knows what else to contact the woman and this was how she repaid her?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut her tantrum did not last long. Growls soon reminded Rachel just how long she was sitting on her blanket with an empty basket. She ran her fingers along the bottom for crumbs, found only some ants. After a moment idly wondering what they might taste like, Rachel's anger refocused. She wasn't going to spend outside a single minute more! Not when her palatial cabin awaited with all the snacks she could wish for!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFired up, Rachel tried to jump up from the ground, stand up somehow\u2026 and failed. Her inflated gut didn't let her even sit normally, she had to spread her thighs to make room for all the excess flesh. Standing up like this was unthinkable. She doubled her weight since the last time she'd sat on the floor and she certainly hadn't gained any muscle. What to do now? Call for help?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel was beginning to feel tendrils of fear creep along, gripping her mind. Oh, sure, someone would come to help. But they would be asking. And they might tell Dr. Schwartz or Ms. Fukuda and then <i>they</i> would start asking questions\u2026 She shivered and it wasn't just because it was getting cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow fear calmed her down and made her think about her predicament rationally. Rachel rolled over onto her belly and inched her thighs higher up. The fatty folds actually made it easy at first as they raised her behind. But soon she began to lift the weight of her gut off the ground and it was murder for her tender thighs. And when she tried to prop herself up with her arms, they protested even louder against the abuse. \u201cHell! That hurts!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took her good ten minutes before she steadied herself, kneeling supported by her hands. Her heart raced like mad, she was drenched in sweat, her gut brushed the ground every time she inhaled. Rachel knew she had only one try. If she failed to stand up, she'd collapse down on the grass and never again gather enough strength for a second attempt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took several deep long breaths to ready herself and pushed herself up with all her waning strength. She made several quick short steps to find balance on her feet, afraid she might sprain her ankle. Somehow she made it, shaking like a bowl of jelly and feeling ready to keel over and die.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel even had the foresight to grab a corner of her blanket. Otherwise she'd have been forced to leave it here, she definitely wouldn't have been able to pick it up once she stood. But her trials weren't over yet. She grabbed the basket (luckily the handle was high enough for her to reach without bending down much) and waddled towards home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer return journey was even worse. It seemed endless, as if someone kept snatching her cabin away. She trudged on, focused on moving one leg ahead, then the other\u2026 she was genuinely surprised when she finally bumped into the wall of her cabin. A couple more steps, a swipe of her bracelet and the door slid open, enticing smells wafted out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA familiar voice welcomed her back. \u201cHello, Ms. Conrad. Please, have some mint biscuits, your favorite,\" and a tray rose to greet her as she huffed inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, HERMIA\u2026 you're a\u2026 lifesaver.\u201d Rachel collapsed on the closest armchair and emptied it in record time. After the worst pangs of her hunger were sated, she realized what a sorry state she was in \u2013 her clothes torn in so many places, green from all the grass, mud stains everywhere, even on her gut and hips\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHERMIA, I want a hot bath right now. Get to it. And while I'm there, warm up two pizzas for me \u2013 no, three. And some lasagna and coffee cakes for dessert\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Mistress. I can serve you in bath, if you like.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, really? Can you? What are you waiting for?\u201d<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><br>\r\n***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say Rachel Conrad did not make any more progress with her investigation that day, preferring to eat herself into oblivion. Only when she returned the next day from an arduous day of teaching English Lit, did she recall what Gia wanted her to do. More specifically, what she needed to do before she could even fulfill Gia's demand. Find a camera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd last seen it back in her old, small cabin. The movers should have packed it up with all the rest of her stuff. But where had they left it? She knew it wasn't anywhere among the things she used every day \u2013 she'd have freaked out already. So where could it be? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bit of looking around brought her to unopened crates in the closet. They were there since the movers left them and there were plenty, mostly full of clothes she'd long overgrown. But three crates on the far right had <b>Miscellaneous</b> on their side so Gia's camera was likely to be hiding in there somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the size and shape of those crates, Rachel decided she needed to fortify herself first before delving into their depths and waddled away. She retreated to her kitchen and HERMIA's care which inevitably meant that she never got back to her closet that day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second day after calling Gia she rose from bed early, woken by a bad conscience or possibly hunger. She almost entered the kitchen but turned back, deciding to start digging on empty stomach, before any more distractions made her forget again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClad only in her nightie, Rachel tried to turn the first crate upside down but found she could not lift it in her pampered arms. Cursing again, she brought in a chair from the kitchen and started emptying the junk piece by piece. And then the second crate when she couldn't find what she was looking for in the first one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily the second crate was the right one. Rachel grabbed the annoying piece of electronics, not even bothering to look at it, and rushed (all right, waddled) to have breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she was waiting for a second stack of pancakes, she started thinking about her present assignment. She picked the camera up, turned it over. What was so special about it that Gia insisted she use this camera and not any other? And where in Buttercombe would she be most likely to come across a mobility scooter prototype?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was never more obvious to Rachel that she had done little to play the part of \u201cfellow teacher\u201d than it was during the rare instances in which she was required to use that part to gather information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the beginning of this mess, she supposed that it was due to her guilty conscience. After all, how could she rightfully get to know these\u2014as far as she knew, these totally innocent\u2014women only to sneak around and scribble down notes about them the minute they turned their backs? There was a perfectly practical reason, keeping everyone within a reasonable distance from finding out her dirty little secret. Plus, keeping everyone at arm\u2019s length meant that it wouldn\u2019t hurt so much when she (inevidibly) helped blow the roof off of this place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut after she\u2019d gotten her stripes (her double-wide, elastic stripes) the real reason that she didn\u2019t keep up regular communications with the other women could be chalked up to sheer laziness. Complacency even, which had been the one thing that bothered her most about Gia\u2019s new dismissive tone towards her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe simple fact of the matter was that she was a teacher at a highly prestigious Academy that kept its students sedentary with plenty of assignments and homework, giving her a lot to grade. She\u2019d spent half of her time on campus intentionally trying to gain enough weight to be placed on SSS and <i>that</i> had taken up plenty of time in and of itself\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that she was an out-and-out couch potato, with her every need capable of being taken care of by her fancy kitchen\u2026 why would she <i>want</i> to leave her cabin? Especially if she didn\u2019t have to!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd while she certainly saw her fellow teachers on the clock\u2014in the teachers\u2019 lounge, sometimes over lunch, and between classes if she chose to meander the hallways for those meager fifteen minutes instead of snacking or fiddling with her phone between breaks\u2014she could hardly be bothered to spend even a portion of her Reporter\u2019s Intuition on the women who <i>weren\u2019t</i> running an ostensibly evil corporation through a suspicious prep school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo when she got a good look at Brooke for the first time in a good long while, she almost didn\u2019t recognize her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Rachel\u2014\u201d the sophomoric teacher waved breathlessly, \u201c\u2014haven\u2019t seen you in a minute!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, sorry about that.\u201d The fat woman grimaced, \u201cI\u2019ve been\u2026 um\u2026 super busy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t have to tell me twice about that.\u201d Brooke\u2019s impressive chest wobbled in tune with her pudgy gut as it plumped visibly over the waistband of her skirt, \u201cThey keep us <i>plenty</i> busy around here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she said it, Brooke pat her budding gut derisively. She was by no means as large as Rachel had gotten (somewhat disheartening, given that they\u2019d started at the same time) but Brooke had gone and gotten good and big since she\u2019d started last year. She carried most of the, oh, hundred pounds or so in her upper half. She\u2019d grown great big arms with a flabby chest and an impressive set of round pink cheeks. She looked happy as could be though\u2014like she\u2019d never weighed a pound less in her life, if Rachel hadn\u2019t known otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, how have you been?\u201d Rachel shifted awkwardly on her fat little feet, standing for so long had become unnatural to the sedentary sleuth, \u201cI heard you won, um\u2026 some kind of prize?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2014it\u2019s nothing.\u201d Brooke waved dismissively, \u201cIt was a voucher for the cake walk we had back then. Like I need more cake.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel laughed, putting her hands on her hips and trying to suck in her stomach as far as it could go. She corrected a few inches of its sagging, but there was still no contest between the two of them. She was clearly still larger by a wide margin. Her gelatinous form far outweighed the chunky shape of her fellow English teacher. Her whole frame was wider, her arms were flabbier, her hips wider, and worst of all her belly had only shrunken to <i>match</i> Brooke\u2019s in size once she\u2019d sucked it in as far as it would go. At her jowl-rippling laughter, it slowly swelled back out to assert its superior size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike any of us need any more cake.\u201d She finally said, shyly, as she held a self-conscious arm in front of her stomach, \u201cUm\u2026 I heard that they gave away some kind of\u2026 super cool scooter? Do you know who won that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh that thing\u2014you know, I heard one of the security guards talking about that just the other day.\u201d Brooke grunted as she leaned into her belly to grab her coffee cup, \u201cI think one of them might know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSecurity guards?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you can call them that.\u201d Brooke snorted, \u201cJust the other day, some little brats threw eggs at my cabin and they did absolutely nothing about it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear that\u2026\u201d Rachel bit her bottom lip as she realized, very quickly, that there was no way to approach her next question tactfully, \u201c\u2026<i>Which</i> security guard, did you say was talking about this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood afternoon Ms. Conrad.\u201d Said a familiar voice with a dimpling smile, \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRio quickly finished off the ice cream cone that she\u2019d been eating inside the comfort of the toll booth. Her kinky black hair floofing out dangerously from underneath her Security cap and the sun shining brightly in the lenses of her aviator shades, she looked the picture of authority. Well, she might have been. Rachel knew her for the somewhat silly, easily bribable woman that she was behind that booth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, that was the reason that Rachel had brought the coffee cakes with her\u2014in case Rio needed a little \u201creminder\u201d as to what helping her might bring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the time that Rachel had seen her last, it was clear that Rio had only gotten larger. Even from the waist-up (which was all she could see from outside the booth) Rio looked positively round these days. Her cheeks were round, her arms were round, her chest, her belly\u2026 no doubt that her ample rear end was the roundest part about her these days. Without standing up, Rachel could see what she <i>thought</i> were arm rests on either side of her muffintop. Experience (and a little bit of dread) told her that the khaki brown lumps at either side of her were <i>not</i> arm rests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt has!\u201d Rachel did her best to smile in the heat, sweating like a mule after the grueling walk from her cart to the booth, \u201cI just\u2026 uh\u2026 heard you got promoted!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI did!\u201d Rio said dreamily, smiling widely (chocolate staining her teeth). She took a celebratory lean back in her chair, which caused an excruciating groan from the invisible thing and provided another six inches or so of Rio\u2019s robust belly to look at as it eeked from the bottom of her uniform, \u201cOut of the hot sun, no more night patrol, and no more squeezing my <i>culo</i> into those stupid tiny carts.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, it was the <i>carts</i> that were small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I guess that means you\u2019ll need to find someone else to bribe into helping you get your bags after dark!\u201d Rio joked, her round brown gut sloshing with laughter<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 I don\u2019t get out much these days.\u201d Rachel said with a depreciative pat of her own gut, \u201cI should, but I don\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know the feeling\u2014one day they\u2019re gonna have to butter me up to squeeze me out of this booth.\u201d Rio pat her stomach in a similar fashion, \u201cIf it ain\u2019t smokes, it\u2019s the vending machine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026 right.\u201d Rachel clicked her tongue awkwardly, \u201cI, um\u2026 I heard you happened to see a funny looking mobility scooter?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah?\u201d Rio cocked a prominent black eyebrow, \u201cWhere\u2019d you hear that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThrough the grape vine.\u201d Rachel sniffed, \u201cAnd I was <i>wondering</i>\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf I knew who got the big prize?\u201d the plump Puerto Rican\u2019s smile turned devilish, \u201cAht, you know I can\u2019t tell you that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhich is <i>specifically</i> why I brought these.\u201d Rachel said with a greedy grin of her own as she held up her bag of coffee cakes. There were literally twenty of them\u2014all fresh from the vending machine, \u201cGiven your <i>proclivity</i> for helping me out in tight jams.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe only thing tight after this is my belt.\u201d Rio snorted. Like she\u2019d worn a belt. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a deal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRio buzzed the toll booth window open and Rio leaned out the side with some effort. Her flabby gut pouring over and onto the counter, she held out her pudgy arms eagerly in anticipation of Rachel\u2019s bribe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, you didn\u2019t hear it from me.\u201d She had already unwrapped and bitten one of the coffee cakes in half, \u201cBut it went to\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

No reason, just\u2026uhm\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel blanked as she felt the sugary stranglehold that she held on Rio\u2019s attention weaken. It must have been the comfortable job that would have been much more unbearable for her to lose. Rio\u2019s comely Hispanic features began to darken as she hunched herself into a more authoritative position for exactly the first time since Rachel had gotten to know her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was\u2026 supposed to get it, actually.\u201d Rachel lied, running her fat little hands in front of her belly nervously, \u201cYou see, there was some kind of mix-up and\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh-huh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was just wanting to see if, maybe I could talk to her about taking <i>mine</i> once it came in, and\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease step away from the gate, gringa.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that, Rachel\u2019s reliable connection in Rio was severed like polyglass sliding down on top of her fingertips. The plump-rumped security guard would be of no more help today\u2014that much was for sure. Even as she munched on the sizable bribe that Rachel had given her\u2026 the woman had no shame!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, at least she had been given a lead. Hunter something. Vandergriff Building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorse reporters had done more with less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as Rachel liked to tell herself that she was <i>done</i> gaining weight\u2014in that she\u2019d played her part and gotten to be about the right size required to be trusted around here\u2014she had a nasty time kicking <i>thinking</i> like how she\u2019d been living for the past year or so. Scooting over here on her cart hadn\u2019t been her plan of action, but once she\u2019d gotten red faced just climbing the gentle slope that led up from Rio\u2019s guard booth back to where she\u2019d parked her cart, well\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt any rate, stopping for a snack was no excuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had no idea what had come over her\u2014she was out of control lately. Eating everything she could get her grubby grabbers on without so much as a pinch of resistance. It was times like this that she marveled\u2014in a sort of horrible awe\u2014at the quick rate of her expansion. Of <i>course</i> she\u2019d blown up so big! She could barely go five minutes without stuffing her face!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as she lifted one thick leg over the other, thighs swishing and chafing and rolling over one another in every awkward lumbering step, Rachel couldn\u2019t help but feel ashamed. Once upon a time she\u2019d dreamed about going into television reporting. What channel would have her now? She was all belly, with a fat little face and wobbly lunch lady arms\u2026 she couldn\u2019t wait until she\u2019d blown the lid off of this place so she could get back to <i>normal</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith or without liposuction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had only taken HERMIA a quick look at the roster to determine that there were only three Hunters enrolled in the entire school. Hunter Peters, the Junior who was the daughter of a famous author, Hunter Dewhitt, the daughter of a business tycoon, and both of which were housed in the Masters Building. The only Hunter who was boarded in the Vandergriff was Hunter Black\u2014daughter of a Yeng employee with an impressive history of stellar grades, here on sponsorship and merit from one Doctor Helen Schwartz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel supposed that, even if it was only sometimes, life would throw her a bone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut of course, whenever it threw her a bone, a long hallway was not far behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel huffed and puffed her way down the double-wide halls of the dorm building. It had been constructed sometime after Buttercombe Academy had acquired sponsorship from Yeng, and thus was built a bit more modern than the dormitories still located in the main building. Whereas the first two floors focused on business and the Arts, the top four floors above that were dedicated to cradeling the coddled children of elites and socialites in as much comfort as could conceivably allow. The hallways were spacious, the doorways were wide, the stairwells were spacious and the elevators (and <i>escalators</i>\u2014that was an advantage this building had for sure!) were plentiful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, too, were the vending machines. The monolithic LCD screens shimmered down every hallway, staring Rachel down from either end. Cut seamlessly into the wall, she felt like she\u2019d pass one every three or four dorms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoor, door, door, food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoor, door, door, food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was no wonder everyone on campus was so <i>fat</i>\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to get a hold of myself.\u201d She mumbled after stopping for a bit too long to ponder the contents of the vending machine in front of her, \u201cI\u2019m going crazy here\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter Black, she had to find Hunter Black. She was her best chance at finding this whole XLR-8 thing and putting another pin into the weird, weighty puzzle that was the Yeng Corporation\u2019s relationship with Buttercombe Academy. With their relationship with her. The sooner she found Hunter Black, the sooner she\u2019d be one step closer to dropping this weight and get put on another assignment. Hopefully one that went <i>far</i> less deep undercover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally\u2014she came to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nC 137; Black, Hunter. A single dorm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a Sophomore student, even the rich and the famous ones, that was a bit peculiar. Rachel had surmised in her notes that the \u201cbuddy system\u201d ascribed the most student housing was to help reinforce conditioning. Slamming two bricks together, mortared on one side as it were. Gia had told her as much upon reviewing (what little) notes she\u2019d sent back\u2014why was some nobody like a Yeng employee getting special treatment over the daughters of celebrities and tycoons?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKnock knock!\u201d Rachel said in her best \u201cMs. Conrad\u201d voice, \u201cHunter Black?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026 are you a teacher?\u201d a tinny, echoing voice sounded from somewhere above, making Rachel jump, \u201cI\u2019ve never seen you before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsure as to where to actually <i>talk</i>, Rachel just looked around for a little bit like an idiot before finally spotting the small camera that had been placed overhead, as well as the pint-sized speakerbox mounted into the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m Ms. Conrad\u2014I teach ELA 3 and 4.\u201d She said, adjusting her long brown hair and running a few crumbs out with her fingers, \u201cI was hoping to talk to you a little bit?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a silence on the other end of the line\u2014made more painful by the distinct electric hum of her speaker. This gave Rachel enough time to probe her memory, concerning what she\u2019d dug up on her newest lead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just figured, you\u2019re such an <i>advanced student</i>, Hunter.\u201d Rachel said with no small amount of flattery, \u201cYou\u2019re going to be taking my class next year when you\u2019re a Junior so\u2026 why not get better acquainted now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTickled, the privileged teen ticked the button again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I just unlocked it\u2014come on in, I\u2019m in the back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel did her best to keep from running her hands together. If only her whole job had been that easy! Lying to children was easily the most rewarding part of her job, especially if it meant she\u2019d be able to get a lead on this XLR-8 chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping inside, Rachel soon came face to face with Hunter Black\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was a sight to behold. She saw a sleek tricycle, all streamlined chrome in front, yet widened out over the rear axle so much that it would barely fit through the extra-wide door of the dorm. The wheels were small but wide, perhaps to better distribute its weight on the floor. A plush red settee occupied all the space available on top, with a large chrome hump behind it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter looked a little small for the seat but not for lack of trying. The girl sprawled across her throne, her humongous boobs resting on a well-fed tummy, thighs like trunks spreading across the red velvet.

Pleased to meetcha.\u201d She offered her hand and as Rachel shook it, she noticed the fat-inflated palm lacked any muscle definition \u2013 not that her own palm fared any better and she had over fifty pounds on the girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome in, have a seat.\u201d That flabby handshake was the most vigorous movement Rachel saw her make. Otherwise she just tapped her stubby fingers at the touchscreen and guided the joystick, turning her mobility scooter back to a lavishly equipped kitchen \u2013 just like Rachel's, in fact. \u201cWanna cheesecake?\u201d And before she could even agree, a mechanical arm extended from the chair hump and deftly placed it on the table alongside a thick milkshake. But clearly Hunter's hospitality was mainly a pretense to indulge since a second cake followed and the arm started feeding big chunks of it straight into her gullet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you're the Junior English teacher, Ms. Conrad?\u201d Hunter managed to ask between swallowing. Clearly she'd had plenty of practice in speaking with her mouth full. \u201cGood. I'd always wanted to ask about the meaning of\u2026\u201d and she followed with a question on some obscure French novel Rachel had never heard of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel was stumped. Despite teaching it for a year, this spoilt student managed to find a weak spot in her armor with her first question. \u201cUmm, I mean,\u201d she squirmed in her seat. As she searched around for an answer \u2013 <i>any</i> answer \u2013 her eyes zoomed on a spot on Hunter's cleavage where her chest stretched the pristine white Buttercombe-issue blouse. There were a couple darker spots there in several different colors, possibly smudged chocolate, mustard and ketchup. Instead of thinking about literature, Rachel's mind started wondering how long had they been there. Judging by the tidy kitchen, the girl was no slob. Did she eat all that since coming back from her classes?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter noticed her look and must have misinterpreted it because there was a clear hint of amusement in her voice when she went on: \u201cSee, I've always thought that the author wanted to express\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt let Rachel off the hook. She could nod wisely, adding, \u201cPossibly,\u201d \u201cYeah, maybe,\u201d or \u201cExactly,\u201d all the time feeling like back at school when she neglected an assignment and had to fake it. It soon became clear that in spite of her laziness and other faults, Hunter Black was frightfully intelligent and remarkably well-read. Evidently she was a favorite of Dr. Schwartz for a reason. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd either she was always this chatty or the presence of an unknown teacher made her show off out of nervousness. It took some time before her tempo slowed down Rachel managed to wedge in a question of her own. \u201cIs that a new mobility scooter you have?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah! Beauty, isn't it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt looks real good. Everyone must be jealous, right? I wonder what can it do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, it does everything! You've seen the arms already, there's a storage inside big enough to last me all day and the scooter refills it every time I drive by a vending machine of the right kind\u2026 The Y-Tablet lets me download my assignments and do all the homework and <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">browse the net in class</font>. There are massage nodes throughout, it's sooo relaxing when you switch them on\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel again listened to the verbal flood, nodded and made mental notes for Gia until Hunter swallowed the last piece of her cheesecake and stifled a burp. \u201eOops, sorry. I've overdone it a little. But if you don't mind me asking, why are you so interested in the XLR-8, Ms. Conrad?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUh-oh. Should she stick to what she'd told Rio? Judging by her reaction, better not quite. \u201cWell, I was hoping to get one of these, uh, accelerators, myself. So I wanted to see one first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, I see. In that case, there is one other major factor to consider.\u201d The fat student patted her tummy, a little bigger now that the cheesecake joined everything else she'd put inside today. \u201cMind you, it is far too early yet for a complete assessment but I can estimate that depending on your previous habits you are likely to put on forty to sixty percent of your current weight due to a drop in physical activity and further twenty to thirty percent due to consumption made more convenient. In other words, if you are unlucky, you might double your current weight. Possibly more, further testing is required.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was interesting how her vocabulary switched to a more mature 'tester speech.' Dr. Schwartz had her well trained, mused Rachel. \u201cSo you want to give it up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNO WAY!\u201d For the first time since they met, Hunter showed a different emotion than detached amusement. She pushed several buttons, whirring likely signified those 'massage nodes' sprang into action, a robotic arm emerged holding a milkshake. The girl took a long sip to calm down. \u201cIt's mine! Once you try the XLR-8, there's no going back. It's better than sex!\u201d Her olive skin turned beetroot red when she realised what she blurted out in front of her teacher but she stuck her chin out, unapologetic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, I'll let myself out then?\u201d Rachel rose with a grunt, noticing her cake was gone too. Halfway to the door she remembered what Gia'd instructed her to do. She turned back with a longing look at the XLR-8 that was not an act. \u201cOh, could I snap a couple shots first? So that I know what to ask for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing!\u201d The girl's good mood was back. She posed with her scooter for several photos, spread lazily in its cozy embrace with a robotic arm feeding her a burger. \u201cCome back again some time! I might even let you borrow my ride for a while!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, really? I might take you at your word.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rachel Conrad visited Hunter Black three more times over the following two weeks, and had reached a few conclusions regarding the reclusive and pampered student. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, she decided to change her original assessment from \"frightfully intelligent\" to \"absolutely terrifying.\" At one point, Hunter had asked what works she taught in her class. At the mention of Beowulf, the over-endowed teen mentioned in passing that she should start brushing up on her Old English, and seemed disappointed when Rachel told her they were using the modern English translation. <i>\"Seriously, what kind of teen learns Old English 'just because'? That is just wrong.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was quite clear that, while Rio may have considered Dr. Schwartz's interest as mere nepotism, Miss Black was brilliant. Rachel had checked out her test scores between classes one Tuesday, and almost thought about spitting out her honey cake, such was her surprise at how high they were. Even without the good doctor's hand being involved, Hunter easily qualified for any of the available academy scholarships, and it was obvious that Yeng would be very interested in bringing her on at the conclusion of her studies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully for the undercover reporter, it seemed that her genius had also left her rather naive and trusting. Given that Hunter knew her curriculum better then she herself did, Rachel had quickly given up disguising that the purpose of her visits was the XLR-8. The widening sophomore had had no qualms about letting her take as many photos of the machine as she wanted, and even let her test drive the scooter. <i>\"She is right, though. That thing is really, REALLY nice. No wonder she got so worked up about potentially losing it,\"</i> Rachel had thought as she reluctantly lifted herself from its plush seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she watched the hefty student tried to rise from her couch to reclaim her throne, Rachel's mind absently wandered to another of her conclusions. Namely, that even in a school as unrepentantly gluttonous as Buttercombe Academy, Hunter Black was almost singularly food-focused. It was exceedingly rare that her jaws ceased chewing for even a moment, and Rachel had yet to see her without something substantial to munch on within arms reach. And if she was drinking something that wasn't a milkshake, guaranteed it was a Yeng-brand cola.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven the treats she offered her guest mostly found their way into her bottomless stomach, and her body clearly showed the inevitable after-effects. Despite the short time she'd known her, Rachel was certain the already sizable student had gotten fatter. Hunter was wearing the same shirt as she'd been for their first meeting, the mustard and ketchup stains never quite washing out, leaving it easily identifiable. Her generous measurements may have stretched it before, but now it seemed fit to burst, in particular around her monumental bust line. Hunter was currently not wearing the standard Buttercombe blazer, and Rachel could see all three of her thick, well fed belly rolls softly stretching against the too-tight fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Hunter a couple of tries to rise from the low couch, and her enormous breasts bounced off her thickly padded knees as she slowly rose, sending a gelatinous jiggle through the lardy things. Her flabby thighs forced her to adopt a heavy waddle as she crossed the room, and as she sat down on her scooter with a grateful sigh, Rachel couldn't fail to notice that even that short trip had left her short of breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Holy Hell, she's getting so fat,\"</i> Miss Conrad thought as she subtly eyed Hunter's posterior, judging if it filled more of her seat or not. <i>\"Forget the sophomores, I think she might be giving some of the juniors a run for their money. It's like she's trying to gain weight. Is that her goal; become the fattest student on campus? At her current pace, she might outgrow that whale Polluck, though she does have one hell of a lead. Heck, I'm maybe 40 pounds or so heavier then she is, and she might out-weigh me before the next midterm...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel rubbed her own large belly, feeling a little guilty about how good she felt knowing, no matter how big she got, there would always be at least one student far fatter then she is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how was it?\" Hunter said. The caramel colored ball of dough had eaten enough calories while seated on the couch to sustain a small family, but still had room for her robotic helper to feed her a double-fudge chocolate muffin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God, it was divine,\" Rachel said as Hunter finished her muffin in a couple quick bites. As she picked the crumbs off her suffering blouse and deposited them in her mouth, the \"teacher\" continued, \"I thought my back was going to turn to goo from those massage points.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, they'll do that,\" Hunter giggled as a touch brought another muffin to her maw. \"Sorry, I forgot my manners. Did you want one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thank you. I've taken up too much time as it is; papers to grade.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah. I won't keep you then. Chow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"What an appropriate choice of a word,\"</i> Rachel thought as she watched the growing girl take a big bite of another of Yeng's calorie bombs. She tried to ignore her own stomach's cries of hunger at the thought of food, and took a final, discrete look at Hunter before leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Yeah, her butt has definitely gotten bigger.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n*** *** ***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Miss Conrad had left, Hunter thoughtfully chewed her muffin. \"Hmm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter was used to people misreading her. It had happened all the time back at home. She seemed like this quiet, bookish young girl. Unadventurous. Totally sheltered. Nothing at all interesting about her, until puberty, at least. Shockingly naive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, that wasn't quite true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo much of Hunter's life wasn't on any file that Rachel Conrad could read, hidden by the school's privacy policy. Hunter wasn't your standard Buttercombe student. Born to a single Mum with two older daughters already, Hunter had been raised poor. The family had lived hand-to-mouth for as long as she could remember. They'd lived in rough neighborhoods because the rent was cheap. They ate cereal for supper because it was practically free. Hunter ate buttered bread for lunch at school because lunch meat was too expensive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd also seen much of the uglier side of the world that so many of the privileged students here hadn't. She'd been hiding behind her Mum when the 7-11 they were currently shopping in got robbed. She'd seen a guy get beat to within an inch of his life because he didn't have enough money to pay the muggers who'd surrounded him. She'd slept in a cold car with her Mum and sisters when they got evicted for failure to pay the rent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUltimately, though, they'd managed to survive. Eventually, the three elder Black's all found work and they finally got a good place to live. Harper, her Mum, was at last able to finish high school. She'd subsequently taken a Business course online, and eventually managed to get her current job at Yeng, solidifying the family finances permanently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer two sisters, Parker and Piper, had also made their way in the world. Parker was more then a little rough, and Hunter could still vividly recall the busted nose she'd given to one old creeper who'd gotten rather 'handsy.' She seemed to have a bit of trouble holding on to work for any length of time, but she was usually on time with the rent she owed their Mum. From what Piper had told her, that was actually quite the improvement over how she used to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of Piper, she'd been Hunter's primary caregiver during her younger years, as Harper was working. Once Hunter was old enough and the other two became more available to help out, Piper had held a couple of different jobs over the years, though perhaps the most important was the one which allowed her to meet Helen Schwartz. It was a combination of Auntie Helen's recommendation and the employee scholarships that had allowed Hunter to attend the academy, and open doors the family could never have dreamed of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd all it had cost Piper was an additional 400 pounds or so. Now, she had lost a ton of weight since then, though her Mum's e-mails did say that she was starting to widen once again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless of any of that, Hunter's rough and tumble background had instilled her with a lot of street smarts, a healthy dose of cunning, and a perpetual sense of paranoia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there just was something not-right with Miss Conrad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter rolled her way to the kitchen and began preparing a platter of fried chicken for her early dinner. Despite how much she'd already eaten today and the food on the way, she promptly microwaved some pizza for a pre-dinner snack. As she waited for the pizza to finish heating up, she opened her tablet and began writing her report.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe youngest Black was not only a student at Buttercombe, but was also acting as a junior laboratory aid to Dr. Schwartz. She was currently acting as a guinea pig for some of the compounds the two were working on, at her own insistence, though Helen had refused her more reckless suggestions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Yeng Brand Stomach Aid experiment: success. Stomach elasticity at 123.72%<br>\r\nMilkshake caloric enhancer: partial success. 4k calories per serving confirmed, but still has chalky aftertaste.<br>\r\nHealth additive 278-B: success. All my vitals are in healthy ranges.<br>\r\nAdditive 42-C: success. Calorie absorption rate up 3.94%.<br>\r\nWeight increase since last report: 14.07 pounds</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Hunter typed, her pizzas dinged, and she paused her report to add another deluge of calories to her rapidly growing form, popping a button off her blouse with a giggle as she did so. As she happily fattened herself, he thoughts turned once more to Miss Conrad. <i>\"There's something weird about her. She's way too interested in the XLR-8. Lots of photos, too. Too many, in fact. And her knowledge of her own subject seems poor. Still, I am lacking in evidence. Do I report this...?</i></span></div></div>",

You know the rules.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter sighed. \u201cAlright, Aunt Helen.\u201d She did indeed know the rules. Helen Schwartz had alway been a large, although not very tall, presence in Harper\u2019s life. And since coming to Buttercombe, their relationship had grown in so many ways. One of these ways was coming over for Sunday dinner, every week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunday evenings were only time of the week that the cafeteria closed, so most girls had to subside on snacks and microwaved meals, but Hunter got to enjoy her Tante\u2019s home cooking. It might not be as much as she normally ate, or as fattening as she\u2019d like it to be, but it was infinitely more intellectually and emotionally nourishing. Hunter her put her textbooks away, while Helen poured the tea to get things started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow were classes this week?\u201d She asked, moving onto her own cup. \u201cNothing too challenging, I suspect.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d Harper said, bored and frustrated. She sank her fat face into her fist, her cheek bulging around it, and her lips, and stared at her tea, waiting for it to cool. \u201cI did have something interesting happen though...Rachel Conrad has been poking around my dorm room--\u201d Harper slowly started on the topic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen raised an animated hand to stop her, rushing to get out of her chair. \u201cAch, wait, let me get the pollo pibil. I want to hear all of this in one sitting.\u201d Hunter wasn\u2019t going to stop her if it meant getting some food. Helen hurried into the kitchen, and returned with a pot lined with banana leaves, ladling stewed chicken and pickled onion into a bowl for Hunter. She stood over the girl as she took her first bite, making sure she enjoyed it, before she gave Hunter a gentle rub on her lard covered shoulder blade, to aid her digestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly then, did Helen turn to her own meal, and bring out the bread and pickled herring that she was going to have as tonight\u2019s sides. She also brought out a bottle of beer, which she opened with a bottle opener at the table before finally allowing herself to sit down, when Hunter asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCould I have a beer with dinner too, Tante Helen?\u201d She said in a sweet voice, trying her best to sound casual about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen smiled, and sighed with a mixture of amusement and exasperation. Hunter was trying to manipulate her with that \u2018Tante Helen\u2019 line. She pursed her lips and stared her down for a second, a trick she\u2019d learned from watching Harper. Just long enough to make her squirm. \u201cYou can have <i>one</i> beer with dinner. And then you will tell me about Frau Conrade, ja?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJa.\u201d Hunter smiled and leaned back in her seat, rubbing her belly with contentment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen brought her the beer, and then finally dinner began. After she slurped down the contents of her first bowl, Hunter said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe came around starting a few weeks ago. She claimed she wanted to prep me for next year\u2019s class, but it seems like I could teach her. Still, it\u2019s a good excuse to learn Old English. Do you speak it, Aunt Helen.\u201d Hunter happily told her while dripping pickled herring onto her bread with her fork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNein. Never saw the use for that one. I suppose I could learn it with you.\u201d Helen said, distracted. She took a sip of tea and stared off in thought before asking. \u201cBut you don\u2019t believe that\u2019s her reason for visiting?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter smiled and shook her head, before shoving a huge hunk of bread into her greedy maw. She hurried and swallowed, so she could answer. \u201cShe\u2019s definitely up to something. She\u2019s really, really interested in the XLR-8.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen put down the teacup and looked at her seriously.. \u201cYou\u2019re mind is not only gifted at science, but at life. You\u2019ve done well to see through her scheme. You are everything I could hope for in an apprentice, and dare I say, heir.\u201d She could see it in her eyes, Hunter was touched. That was everything she wanted to hear, and she didn\u2019t even know it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the serious moment broke as Helen pinched her chubby cheeks affectionately, and poured her another bowl of pollo with pride. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what are you going to do about her?\u201d Hunter said, happily munching away while Helen stood over her and watched. \u201cDo you know why she\u2019s doing this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Schwartz put a hand on Hunter\u2019s shoulder, and leaned towards her ear, her lips just inches away. \u201cHunter, remember those experiments I wouldn\u2019t let you try on yourself, because they were too dangerous?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Ma\u2019am.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen gave Hunter a firm, almost painful squeeze to the shoulder. \u201cTry them out on her, and report back to me.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cAnother mint milkshake, Ms. Conrad?\u201d Hunter Black drove from the dining area to the kitchen dispenser and stopped to look back. She turned the whole scooter around rather than turning her head, though. She had to be careful, she'd already lost the top button of her blouse and while she didn't mind showing off more of her cleavage, a teacher might disagree. Though <i>this</i> English Lit teacher, firmly lodged in her sofa, was oblivious to Hunter's wardrobe worries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel Conrad was struggling to reach the last brownie on a tray on the table over the obstacle of her full belly. Now she only gave a piggish grunt, presumably meaning consent, too absorbed in her fight for the last morsel. She rolled on her side, her fat gut spilling out from her blouse, to triumphantly seize her prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, and a chocolate one for me. Working on it, just a sec,\u201d Hunter smiled for herself as she punched in the code which would add 35-RX to the teacher's milkshake. It had to be mint or some other strong flavour to mask its distinct taste. That it also hid the chalk-tasting caloric enhancer was an added bonus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdditive 35-RX had so far been tested on pigs only. Their skin is structurally the closest to human and this substance had been developed as a supplement preventing the formation of stretchmarks, potentially a highly marketable product for Yeng. However, it turned out to be dangerously more effective than intended. It loosened any tissue it got into touch with, beginning with stomach lining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd could I have another tray of brownies with it?\u201d pleaded Rachel after she swallowed her last one almost without chewing. \u201cI just don't get it, I can never get full these days.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's normal. As long as you're hungry, just eat, Ms. Conrad. No need to apologise, I'm going to order more pizzas for myself too,\u201d and Hunter made a note on her Y-Pad before sending another order out. According to the reports Tante Helen sent her, test pigs never felt full either as their digestive tracts stretched ever further. Apparently there was even a case or two where their stomachs burst open before the lab assistants realised what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Ms. Conrad had been using 35-RX for five consecutive days now and hadn't burst yet, proving human body superiority. Her daily consumption increased by 37%, according to data collated by HERMIA at her home, the cafeteria, Hunter's own kitchen and numerous snack machines around the campus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I should instruct HERMIA to start adding 35-RX to Ms. Conrad's breakfasts and dinners,</i> Hunter made another note, <i>otherwise she might skip a dose if she fails to visit me.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough that was getting increasingly unlikely. Rachel apparently enjoyed the company of a girl who fulfilled her every craving and in whose presence she could feel she was holding back. Enjoyed it so much that she was coming here every free hour she could and left only with extreme reluctance, stuffed to the gills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruth be told, Hunter was beginning to enjoy the teacher's company as well. Aunt Helen seldom had time these days and when she did, she had illogical objections to testing her experimental substances on herself. It was nice to finally have an eating companion who could hold her own, even if she suspected her motives. Moreover, Hunter estimated that at a current rate of expansion, Ms. Conrad's stomach should even exceed her own capacity in two more days. And then Hunter hoped Tante would finally relent and let <i>her </i>use 35-RX too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was looking forward to it. But for now\u2026 Maybe she could speed up the process? Give her a gentle push? \u201cUmm, Ms. Conrad?\u201d She put on her best impression of a naive schoolgirl and smiled sweetly. \u201cI was thinking we could have a proper pig-out today, please?\u201d<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><br>\r\n***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA proper pig-out? But I thought\u2026\u201d Rachel bit down the rest of her answer. Her blimping teen host evidently did not consider any of their previous feasts worthy of that name. Could the girl cram even more food into her stomach?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstinct was telling Rachel to refuse and run away while she still could. However, lately it was more and more often her gut which had the last word(s). And right now they were:<i> A feast even bigger than yesterday? Yummy! Go for it! </i>\u201cUh, actually, that sounds nice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt does, right? OK, we need to plan it all out. Cafeteria closes down in two hours so we can start by ordering the entire evening menu. When we're done with that, I'll tap into the Room Delivery Service while there's still something decent to be had\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait. You can have food from the cafeteria sent to your dorm?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, anytime. As long as there's anything left. You mean you can't? Anyway, after the RDS gets raided by the rest of Buttercombe girls, we can move on to my own supplies, frozen pizzas, pasta, desserts, ice cream et cetera. Sounds like a plan, eh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, right,\u201d Rachel blinked in horror, thinking of the mountain of calories she was about to consume.<i> I need to get my appetite in check, fast. Before they have to roll me out of here. </i>She took the offered milkshake and sipped from the straw to calm her nerves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhile we're waiting for the first delivery, here's your tray of brownies.\u201d The mechanical arm lifted again, prompted by Hunter's fat fingers brushing the Y-Pad, and deposited several pounds of almost pure chocolate next to Rachel. Than it retracted back to the microwave to pick up the first of three Hunter's pizzas. \u201cOh! And if you're still hungry after, you can have one of my pizzas. Like pepperoni?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No way! </i>But Rachel was already salivating. \u201cYeah, I do. Thanks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, you're welcome, Ms. Conrad.\u201d Hunter gave her an eager smile, though that eagerness was mostly aimed at the pizza the robot was holding in front of her mouth. She leaned forward to bite into it and the rest happened so fast that Rachel had to replay it in her mind to put the event together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the gluttonous student leaned forward, it set the entire mass of fat covering her body in motion. First a button flew off the top of her blouse, making her cleavage even deeper. Then the sound of tearing cloth could be heard from the area where her hips stretched the brown skirt. And finally the buttons around her midriff gave out as well, olive flesh spilling out like a flood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter did not seem embarrassed in the least. \u201cOops. Need to drive down to Mrs. Banks for another size upgrade,\u201d she chuckled. \u201cHuh. This uniform lasted all of three weeks. I hope I am not slowing down. Oh well. Such a little accident won't stop us from eating, eh, Ms. Conrad?\u201d and she took a large bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Three weeks? Slowing down? How come the girl's not twice my size already?</i><i> I should really say no while I can.</i> But the fact was she couldn't; the hollow emptiness in her stomach cried out to her, wanting to be filled. \u201cUh, right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so Rachel ate. She devoured the brownies and a pizza and a platter of lasagna and a bucket of fried chicken, and her stomach was still demanding more so she carried on filling it until\u2026 the world blurred.</span></div></div>",

The short woman had her arms crossed over her chest as she gave her \"niece\" her dressing down. \"Now, explain to me vhat happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, after you gave me leeway to experiment with Ms. Conrad, I decided to use 35-RX...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ja, ja, I am avare of that part. I should haff known you would choose that one. You bombarded me with requests for self-use daily for several months. I meant, vhat happened to Rachel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter cleared her throat before continuing. \"She initially seemed to take to the compound well. Her daily consumption was up a full 37%, and her daily calorie count had shot through the roof.

And she could almost eat as much as me! Do you know how rare that is!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter had been beginning to shout, but she immediately retracted when she saw the look that Dr. Schwartz was giving her. Continuing on far more meekly, she said, \"But there was an unforeseen side effect of the chemical.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter fell silent for a moment. Helen cleared her throat, indicating that she should continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter sighed. \"Since it eliminates the feeling of being full, it creates the potential for someone to eat a dangerously large amount. In the case of the test pigs, they ate until they suffered internal injuries. I'd thought I'd figured out the problem, and I was partially right! I managed to get the formula to more rapidly increase elasticity before it began to deaden the sensation of feeling full, so a person wouldn't risk tearing their stomach lining before their body could cope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it kind of worked. At least, until her diaphragm got compressed by the sheer quantity of food she'd consumed, leading Ms. Conrad to pass out from a lack of oxygen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter said that last part half-whisper, and so fast that Helen could barely catch it. Not that she needed to, mind, having read the hospital report before questioning Miss Black. <i>\"Still,\"</i> she thought, <i>\"It's important that she admits her mistakes.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe softened a bit as she saw Hunter beginning to tear up. She wasn't used to being wrong, let alone having an idea of hers nearly end so catastrophically for someone else. Helen wrapped her up in as big a hug as she could manage around the tubby teen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Auntie Helen! I didn't mean to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shh, it's alright,\" the Doctor said, patting her on the back. \"There's no permanent damage done. A few veeks of bed rest, und Ms. Conrad vill be right as rain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSniff. \"What about long term effects from 35-RX?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ve'll just haff to vait und see. If she cannot properly manage to limit her own food intake, we'll haff to get involved.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It would be wrong to call Gia Rosellini ascetic. She had always been wary of her Italian heritage; unwilling to blow up like her mother, aunts or even her sister, she'd built up iron restraint that kept her appetite in check \u2013 mostly \u2013 and stopped her when she wanted to indulge. It often sucked but it kept her figure svelte and action-ready into her thirties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would be doubly wrong to call Gia ascetic today. Her new undercover assignment required her to indulge every day to fit in \u2013 at least that was what she kept telling herself. She also conveniently forgot that her first binges preceded her arrival at the Yeng facility, actually dating from the first package from Buttercombe. Instead she told herself it was her duty to eat if she wanted to avoid drawing attention. So she ate, a little too eagerly perhaps, and as a result she was beginning to fit in among her new security pals in size as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt hadn't been so bad at first. Gia's genes blessed her with plenty of curves and they had been getting more bountiful. Sneaky, envious glances at her chest and booty actually convinced her for a time that it was a good thing to throw away restraint and let loose (temporarily, of course). That was a mistake \u2013 just like her mother had warned, these days the biggest curve of her body was the swell of her stomach, now resting on her thick thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was thankful that she had the back entrance desk duty today. Not that she'd get so lazy, no way! But everyone else in her shift did which meant constant fights over who got to stay inside to man (or woman) the guard posts. Since Gia was still one of the more mobile ones, she often drew the short straw. And when she got to sit behind a desk, it was usually the main entrance which had a two-person detail. Today was the first day in weeks that she could sit down unobserved and access the facility systems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that it got her far, today like any other day on this mission. She hated to admit it but her rate of progress was even slower than of that lazy would-be reporter whose incompetence made her take this job in the first place. It was so frustrating! She took another donut from the visitor box to calm her nerves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuh. Come to think of it, Rachel Conrad had missed her scheduled phone call. That was nothing unusual in itself, the woman was getting ever lazier as they spoilt her in that boarding school. But she was unavailable when Gia tried to contact her yesterday. Should she try again now? But the reception could be bugged\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave a good evening, Toshio, and see you tomorrow,\u201d she broke off her musings to give a warm smile to a departing Oriental. This handsome, muscular youngster (all of 25 years) was the best thing she'd found here so far. He had been enamored with her curves from their first meeting, when she'd had guard duty at the R&amp;D, had been bringing her chocolates and sweets ever since. Today he must have made a detour to see her here since he normally parked in front. She was toying with the idea of making him take her on a date \u2013 purely as a way to mine a promising source, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Enough.</i> She forced her thoughts to return to the problem of Rachel Conrad. She glanced at the big clock in the hall; her shift would be over in an hour, it would make more sense to wait until then. She decided to check Rachel's social networks in the meantime to make sure she was OK.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel's posts were more than boring lately \u2013 a steady stream of photos depicting all the wonderful Buttercombe culinary delights that made Gia salivate (and eat another donut), and a long list of films and shows the fake teacher watched for free, courtesy of the Academy. But as Gia scrolled down all that garbage, she was growing uneasy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the past, Rachel had been posting more or less regularly every other day, sometimes missing a day, at other times she posted every day for a week. But no matter how hard Gia looked, she could not find a single post from this week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was getting bad. Gia had to get in touch with Rachel, but how? She'd arranged a dead drop for her in the neighboring town but she doubted the undercover journalist even remembered it anymore. Should she have a look there or drive straight to the Academy and claim her friend invited her for a visit? Direct action was often the best approach, least expected\u2026 but it could also bring the direst consequences for Gia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat to do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

One that she\u2019d made in hopes of getting her closer to the root of the strangeness in at least <i>one</i> of Yeng\u2019s plants across America. It had helped provide some extra cash on the side (a much-needed benefit since she seemed to be <i>outgrowing</i> clothes on an almost weekly basis by now) but it wasn\u2019t worth pulling out of the direct line of duty for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll she\u2019d done is sit on her butt and act out the part of rent-a-cop, and even then she\u2019d only barely gotten any closer to any of the mysterious product that moved in and out of this particular subsidiary.

Now that there was even more cause for concern, Gia was sure that she was needed much more on the campus of Buttercombe Academy than she ever had been at this facility. <br>\r\nRachel had already missed three of their weekly phone calls, but to not have any social media presence either? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel might have been in real trouble\u2014no one knew what these creeps at Yeng were capable of!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGia knew that she had to get up there\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut at the cost of her own part of the investigation?

She'd been closely involved with the investigation for more than a few years now, and throwing all that under the rug because some reporter (okay, not just <i>some reporter</i>, but still) got into some hot water and seemed to drop off the face of the Earth wasn't the logical choice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt could jeopardize everything if one day \"Gia Tortelli\" just up and quit, and on the same day a woman matching her exact description showed up at the gates of Buttercombe Academy. Even if she didn't show up, even if she managed to get Rachel to come meet her at a safe location, there was no information about the setup of the campus. The place was loaded with the daughters of billionaires, tycoons, and politicians on top of being heavily affiliated with one of the most secretive international corporations of the day and age. If Gia was caught <i>on film</i>, even with her back turned, it could get back to Yeng.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey'd seen her from every angle (unfortunately, there was plenty to see nowadays) and they could ping her ID in no time. Then it was just a hop, skip, and a jump away from figuring out Rachel's credentials were false, and then the entire operation would come under scrutiny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Years</i> of work, down the drain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven for Rachel Conrad\u2014someone who she felt personally responsible for, despite her glibness\u2014that wasn't a risk that Gia was willing to take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she did the responsible thing and put in a request for a few days off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took two weeks for her to get approved for the time off. She'd put in the request in mid-November and hadn't heard until December that she'd be able to take time off from her job. In that time, she <i>eventually</i> heard from Rachel, albeit in not so many words. They exchanged no phone calls and very few text messages. Gia had sent her a message every three days (a simple question mark) and every time after an hour-long delay she would receive a curt, simple:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">not now.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't like Rachel at all. Even her shorter messages were more flowery and needlessly friendly. On the upside, her social media posts came trickling back in, though many of them were statuses instead of pictures. None of them used the codewords that they agreed upon and occasionally remembered to update, so Gia didn't see any <i>additional</i> cause for alarm. At least she was alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd if she wasn't, Gia was going to kill her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegistering to enter Buttercombe Academy as a visitor was a twenty-four-hour process. It required approval from both the Vice Principal, former Head of Yeng's Eastern Seaboard branch Dr. Fukuda Hinamizawa, and one Shannon Polluck. Why it took an entire day's time to submit and achieve approval from just two women was beyond the more curt and officious Gia Rosellini, but that was beside the point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the time that she had spent in the neighboring town of Wellington, she had come to discover that Yeng's stranglehold on the mountainous Academy also choked down lower into the valley. Yeng's fingerprints were all over the town, via name-brand and shell company subsidiaries. From the look of things, there wasn't a truly local business in town\u2014just about everything relied on Yeng in some way, shape or form whether they seemed to know it or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scenery was idyllic; the beautiful mountain air was so clean that even Gia's smoke-damaged sense of smell could tell the difference. There were flowers in boxes outside windows of cozy mountain homes, cute little brick sidewalks that connected every corner. Flowers and grass were everywhere, and the town looked to be in great shape... figuratively speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The <i>size</i> of some of these people...\" Gia tried not to whistle as she passed a pair of four hundred pound women in their mid forties, struggling to waddle down the sidewalk, \"It's like a Norman Rockwell painting aboard Abercrombie Station...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost everyone that Gia's taxi had passed weighed more than two hundred pounds. The men, the women, the children were all ridiculously obese. It almost felt like she hadn't left the office at all. Officer Nora would fit right in with that poor man who couldn't bend over to tie his shoes. Her superior back at the plant was about twice her size and had about a twentieth of her gumption, unless it came to delegation. Even the new cadet Woody would have looked at home, given the starter belly Gia had left him with. She knew first-hand how addictive Yeng products could be, but the boy had come straight out of Military school with washboard abs that she may or may not have liked to appreciate in a less than professional way. Much like them these men and women toddled, waddled, and sometimes rolled on expensive-looked mobility scooters that filled the walkways, slowly going about their days as members of the Yeng Corporate machine...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should have sent Rachel here...\" Gia remarked almost casually to herself, \"If there's half as much Yeng down here as there is up there, we'd have plenty to work with at half the risk...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe winding trail up the mountain took a full forty-five minutes to drive. Even with the local driver who cut corners too sharply and sped far too leisurely for the likes of someone rolling up a mountain, forty-five minutes was a long time to sit and think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSit and think and worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Go over your cover story</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGia took a deep breath, her double chin spreading wider over the beige neck of her new sweater. Her chest rose as she fought the vague feeling of nausea that came with walking into uncharted territory. She'd never been to Buttercombe. She'd studied it on maps, she'd carefully pieced together a profile of the place with the notes that Rachel had sent her over the year and a half that she'd been stationed there, but never...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your name is Gia Tortelli.\" Gia repeated to herself, \"You're friends with Rachel Conrad. You work with Yeng at a site in Georgia. You're here to visit her for the holidays before you go back to work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out her breath, belly rolling up the hem of her not-as-big-as-she-thought new sweater as her flesh managed to poke through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you are <i>definitely</i> not a cop.\"</span></div></div>",

Yes she <i>did</i> work at a Yeng facility, in case anyone asked.

That stupid white uniform made everyone look like a marshmallow. At least her dark skin made it look a bit more fashionable, even if it made the fluff of her belly stand out that much more. Her curly brown hair fell into perfect ringlets along her caramel puddles of cheeks, crowding her chocolate-stained lips as her jowls rippled with authority.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, I'm Gia Tortelli?\" Gia said into the talkbox, \"I've been approved for visitation?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you visiting?\" the bottom-heavy Puerto-Rican asked in a bored, flat voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rachel Conrad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please pull up the notification on your DayPass app that you've been accepted, ma'am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGia slid her thick thumb across the screen and readied it in the delivery tray, only for Officer Alvarez's gloved hands to wave it away nonchalantly. Having seen the golden yellow notification ticket on the screen, she extended one chubby finger to the gate button and waved Gia through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShifting uncomfortably in her tight black slacks, Gia waddled through the front gate's partition with some difficulty. Officer Alvarez hadn't opened it all the way, leaving just enough space for Gia's wide rump and full gut to catch the sides. It mussed the black double-breasted coat she'd been assured helped hide her substantial weight gain, leaving a faint trail of gray dirt between the buttons and along the torso. She'd been batting at it, trying her hand at dusting it off without making her belly jiggle too much in the process, when she was greeted by a shrill beep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guten tag!\" came a high, yet somehow throaty tone of voice, \"Velcome to Buttercombe Academy for Gifted Girls!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small, spherical woman had driven up to greet her at the gate. She had thick black frames and short blue hair, cut in a deceptively choppy pattern that belied the care taken in the styling. Gia recognized the woman (vaguely) from the file that had been compiled over the years of various notable Yeng affiliates and employees. Give or take a few pounds (in this case, a lot) Gia could still recognize one Dr. Helen Schwartz\u2014head of R&amp;D in Daven's Port for a few years before being quietly parting ways with Yeng and hired on as Buttercombe Academy's new Guidance Counsellor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe years had clearly not been kind to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen had grown exceptionally fat since her personnel file had been updated. At such a short weight, the weight was bound to pile on. She barely stood to Gia's chest, but necessitated a near two steps back in order to avoid their respective girths from brushing. Helen's belly was deep, and hung low over her pillowy lap as two squat, thick legs spread wide to support her growing weight. Two hammy arms exploded in size on either side of her smothering chest as she slowly came to stand on her poor fat feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Dr. Helen Schwartz\u2014head Guidance Counsellor for the girls on campus.\" she said in her thick German accent, \"I vould like to extend to you our deepest hospitalities. It is so nice to meet you in person, Gia!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight then and there, the hardened ex-detective nearly had a heart attack. She felt her insides freeze and the pit fall out of her stomach as this woman called her by her name. For a moment, she considered that her cover might have already been blown from the moment she got there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ach, you don't remember.\" Dr. Schwartz said with a belly-quivering laugh, \"We spoke on the phone, ja?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" Gia breathed a sigh of relief, \"Oh! Right, Dr... Schwartz.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Schwartz.\" Helen corrected her pronunciation, \"Helen Schwartz.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Schwartz.\" Gia repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ja, much better\u2014but you may call me Helen.\" her gopher cheeks dimpled as she took Gia's hand for a surprisingly firm shake, \"In fact, I would prefer it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... alright.\" Gia resisted the urge to look suspicious, \"I, um... I'm here to see Rachel Conrad. Is she around?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, of course, Rachel is on campus, preparing for her last day of classes before the Winter Holiday.\" Helen took Gia's hand in both of hers and pat the spread of her knuckles placatingly, \"Und as soon as we get you checked in at the infirmary, we can go see her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Infirmary?\" Gia whipped around, \"What infirmary\u2014I'm just here to see my fri\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ach, I know I know, I am so sorry about the trouble.\" Helen grunted as she gripped the pole railing of her golf cart (Gia's eyes widened in shock as the opposite wheels lifted inches off the ground!) and settled herself back into her seat, \"Unfortunately due to health concerns, we are required to have visitors undergo a routine check-in with our nurses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGia squirmed uncomfortably in her position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if I decline?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen sucked air through her teeth, a short exhale as she caught her breath from all that wobbling around greeting her guest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I will ask Rio very nicely to open up the gate and you may walk through.\" she said in a stern, but nonetheless pleasant tone of voice, \"We care very much about the safety of our girls here, Ms. Tortelli. I understand that sometimes the red tape can be, erm...<i>verworren</i>... but it is ultimately for the safety of our very dear students.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGia took another deep breath, testing the confines of her coat as her swollen figure pressed tight against the breast, chest and waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess.\" she said in a Rosellini-style grunt, \"Do I ride with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please!\" Helen said with a cute little pat of the seat next to her double-wide rump, \"I will give you a ride, und then I will take you to Frau Conrad once you are finished with your physical.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great.\" Gia grimaced, squeezing her wide hips next to Helen's in what felt like a war between pizza dough avalanches, \"Best vacation ever...\"</span></div></div>",

Gia had always been frightened of doctors, and generally avoided checkups as much as possible. The fact that this doctor was on the Yeng payroll only made this situation a hundred times more terrifying. \u201cAre you like...qualified? Like are you even that kind of doctor?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cLet me see\u2026\u201d Helen thought about that for a moment, stroking her chin while looking up at the ceiling. \u201cI have a Medical Degree, as well as a PhD in Pharmacology, Psychiatry and another in Public Health.\u201d Gia whistled appreciatively. Helen\u2019s gaze turned playful back towards Gia. \u201cDo you know anyone more qualified?\u201d She teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHow about the school nurse?\u201d Gia grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t quite know where Shiro did her doctorates.\u201d She joked. \u201cBut at any rate she\u2019s busy with students. It is flu season after all. Hence why we are doing medical examinations for guests.\u201d She explained while readying an otoscope. \u201cOpen wide and say <i>\u2018aaah\u2019</i>\u201d She instructed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Gia resisted with her arms tucked under her chest, causing her sweater to ride up slightly. Helen waited patiently, like she was a petulant child. Reluctantly she opened her mouth and let Helen poke around in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOnce the flu bug gets in, being confined in such tight quarters, living and working together, it spreads through the student body and faculty quite quickly.\u201d She elaborated, while looking inside Gia\u2019s mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She backed away and cleaned the otoscope. Gia started to soften. That made sense. And it\u2019s not like they could learn anything about her just from a simple medical examination. There was no need to be jumpy. She still didn\u2019t have to like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhere did you say you went to med school?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d Helen corrected her, firmly, while writing down some notes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c...right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBut if you must know, Humboldt University.\u201d Helen reassured her, before feeling up her lymph nodes. \u201cDoes that hurt, any?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNo?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cGut.

She reached behind Gia\u2019s arm and tugged her along. Gia was aware, even in her pathetic shape, she\u2019d have no problem resisting the tiny marshmallow trying to pull her around, but that would probably kill any hope of seeing Rachel. So she just sighed, and rolled her eyes, and followed the doctor along. \u201cYour shoes, bitte.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And so, Gia took off her shoes, sucked in her gut, closed her eyes, and stepped onto the scale. And flinched as she heard the metallic clang followed by the doctor having to adjust the weights up higher and higher until\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c126 kilos!\u201d The doctor announced, happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Gia opened one eye. \u201cAnd in pounds that's?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201c278 pounds. A healthy weight.\u201d She made a mark in her notes before looking up at Gia, and shaking the hair from her face. \u201cThe same as me.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Half an hour later Helen Schwartz leaned back in her reinforced office chair, making it creak, and ticked off another answer. \u201cLet us imagine a hypothetical situation. You have three cupcakes. What are you going to do with them, how many would you save for- Wie ist es\u2026 Ach! For a raining day?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere was the doctor going with her pop quiz? Gia would be the first to admit that a health exam makes sense of sorts before visiting a seriously ill patient but what was all this? The questionnaire so far felt as if Dr. Schwartz was testing her susceptibility to Yeng additives. And while the good doctor tried not to show it, Gia Rosellini was an old pro in her field too, she could easily tell what kind of answer was expected by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy save any? I'll eat them all right away!\u201d <i>Not that I ever would,</i> she assured herself. As she tried to imagine the situation, it annoyed her that stomach suddenly growled. She could almost smell them\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGut, gut. Instant gratification indeed,\u201d and Dr. Schwartz made another note before swivelling around in her chair and opening a laboratory cupboard to produce a half-empty tray. \u201cAlso, I am reminded we had some cupcakes delivered this morning so have one. Or three.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGia dutifully chuckled as she reached for them.<i> I have to play the role,</i> she justified it to her conscience. \u201cThanks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnd last question, a practical one. You are a friend of Ms. Conrad, huh? Vhy are you visiting Buttercombe now?\u201d and the plump doctor snatched a cupcake for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe file Gia had on Helen Schwartz was far from complete, far too thin compared to the woman that now watched Gia's reaction like a hawk. Even from the little Gia knew, however, it was apparent that wherever Helen was posted she always played a major role in Yeng plans. And that also meant she was one of the real powers at this school, whatever the official structure said. She definitely deserved looking into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she was first and foremost a shrink so Gia made sure she was looking harmless and puzzled as she said: \u201cWell, I haven't heard from her for ages, she completely fell off the grid, then I hear she had some kind of accident\u2026 Of course I would come to see her! To find out what's happened, if she's OK.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNa ja, nat\u00fcrlich. Ach, vell, this will be all from me, I will now call a guard to show you the way to your friend.\u201d And as Gia grabbed armrests to push herself up from her chair, the doctor unexpectedly added: \u201cShe gave us quite the fright, you know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What fright?</i> But Gia had been going undercover for years, she wouldn't just blurt it out like that. \u201cOh, yeah, right. Can you tell me more about it? I mean, as an experienced medical professional\u2026\u201d she let her sentence linger so that Dr. Schwartz would feel tempted to complete it, to show off her expertise.</span></div></div>",

Doctor-patient privilege, you know?\u201d The doctor rummaged in her drawer until she produced a wristband with a VISITOR tag. \u201cHere, put this on, it vill let you to our infirmary. Take the lift to the fourth floor, you can find your friend in Room 412.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm, thanks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are velcome to stay as long as you like, Miss Tortelli. And while you are here, do not hesitate to sample the fruits of our kitchens. I am sure you would appreciate them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, bye.\u201d And Gia rather hastily fled the office, resisting the urge to wipe off sweat. Whew! Finally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Gia entered Room 412, her first thought was that she must have misheard. There was no sign of Rachel Conrad as she knew her inside. In fact, there was only one patient lying on the bed, happily chatting with a tall, plump nurse over a plate of donuts. But that couldn't be Rachel, could it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr maybe\u2026 The woman was covered with a fluffy duvet head to toes, all Gia could see was her face and there was a certain resemblance, though all her features were swollen \u2013 especially her cheeks were making her squint. It looked as if Rachel had met a particularly angry hornet swarm. And the voice was similar to Rachel's, if deeper and slower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she entered the room, Gia caught her last words. \u201c-I think that lemon glaze improves on the taste, adds a certain contrast\u2026 Oh, Gia! Hi! What are you doing here?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRachel! What do you think? What's happened to you? You never call, never write\u2026 I had to show up, as your friend. I was worried sick.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose unfamiliar round features contorted in contrition. \u201cUmm\u2026 Sorry, Gia, but I've <i>been</i> sick.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurse raised a finger. \u201cBetter use its proper name, Rachel. You had the Dissociative Digestive Disorder.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBasically that means you stop feeling full,\u201d Rachel offered helpfully. \u201cThere's been a lot of it going on around here. Even Shiro here got a mild case of it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Yeah, right, </i>Gia thought skeptically.<i> Put a fancy name on it and everyone'd believe it. I bet that tall nurse made it up just so we wouldn't blame Yeng and their machinations.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Shiro only sighed, sucking in her stomach. \u201cUh, hello, I am Shiro Fukiyama, the school nurse,\u201d she offered her hand, smudged with sugar and grease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPleased to meet you, Gia\u2026 Tortelli.\u201d The hesitation was minuscule but it was there, Gia chided herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, the nurse did not seem to notice, going back to their conversation. \u201cAnd yes, Rachel is right. I must have caught from a student. It is a highly unpleasant disorder indeed. Poor Rachel here was the worst case we've had so far. Anyway, want another donut, Rachel?\u201d she asked while observing her patient closely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm, I do but I shouldn't.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, good, that's right.\u201d Shiro sighed with relief, letting her small tummy spread out again. \u201cSo, Rachel, since your symptoms have finally receded, you are now officially released from my care. Just remember to watch what you eat, follow HERMIA's nutritional advice and should excessive cravings return, call me immediately.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight, right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I suppose your friend can take you to your cabin?\u201d Shiro turned to Gia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, yeah, sure. Of course.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood. Now let's help Rachel get up and get her to the cart.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing Rachel in her pyjamas came as a delayed shock to Gia. Even Rachel's cherubic face did not prepare her for the avalanche of fat that poured out from the too tight fabric, jiggling with every move. And from the way she was breathing hard after having to take a couple steps from her bed to the waiting cart, it was clear she was in pretty poor shape too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, finally. Here, take this. It's cold outside.\u201d Shiro gave Rachel a blanket, \u201cAnd come back for a checkup tomorrow. There'll be donuts waiting!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, yeah, I sure will. Thanks for everything, Shiro, bye. And Gia? Come join me in the cart. Trust me, you don't want to walk all the way to my cabin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh, OK.\u201d The golf cart was wider than what Gia was used to seeing but it was a tight fit for both of them all the same. <i>How could she triple her weight in less than a year? Gia wondered as they were driving out of the building. I know she was supposed to get fat for the mission but she must have no restraint to get THIS big.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cUh, Gia? Are there any donuts in the box at your side? Can you pass me one? Have one for yourself too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGia grunted, she had to squeeze to get it. \u201cThere are\u2026 brownies, donuts, cupcakes\u2026 someone made sure you'll be well-provisioned. But you did not want any in the infirmary.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course not. They'd have kept me there for another week otherwise. And back home HERMIA's watching me but here nobody can see me eat them. Except you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGia rolled her eyes but did as she was asked. \u201cSo, uh\u2026 that HERMIA is your assistant?\u201d she added while her fingers were busy typing. No matter what Rachel said, she would bet Yeng had the vehicle bugged. Only when she was finished, she passed her phone along with the requested donut. \u201cHere.\u201d<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><br>\r\n***<br>\r\n</div><br>\r\n\u201cThanks.\u201d Rachel stopped the cart and turned to her. It was a tight fit. Gia had always been voluptuous but now?<i> How could she double her weight in less than a year? At least I did it for the mission, she must have no restraint. Look how she is demolishing that cupcake. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly bit into the donut and looked at the phone. <b>Give me what you have on the XLR-8. And when we get to the cabin, we must make a copy of HERMIA with your Data Extractor.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankly, she wasn't interested in hearing Gia's reproofs. \u201cUh, yeah. But look, it's cold out here, let's hurry inside.\u201d She pretended to concentrate on driving (and eating) while she was frantically thinking how to deal with her real boss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruth be told, Rachel Conrad was no longer sure why she'd agreed to go undercover to Buttercombe. The strange sickness somehow messed up her memories, both old and recent. She wasn't even sure how she caught it. Most likely from that fat student with the accelerator, what was her name, Harper? But the details were foggy in her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlenty of things were foggy these days but Rachel's life did have a couple anchors she was clear about \u2013 Buttercombe cuisine, the comforts of her home and a firm conviction she did not want to give up either of them. Right now that meant avoiding Gia's displeasure without revealing her true colors to Buttercombe management. How should she best go about it? Should she give Gia what she asked for, in hope she would go and leave her alone? Or should she stall and delay and hope Gia's attention would be diverted elsewhere? Possibly she could even get infected by the DDD as well?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Fukuda finished her sentence with a wry smile and looked Rachel once over. The poor girl was visibly trembling now, and Fukuda had the look of a polar bear ready to pounce on a cornered seal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh- what do-\" Rachel tried to stammer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough,\" Fukuda cut her off abruptly. She held her palm outward and the door closed behind Rachel. Startled, Rachel glanced behind her. Of course the doors here were automatic... and a soft click confirmed that the locks were automatic too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her other hand, Fukuda gestured to the black bracelet on her outstretched arm. \"We've noticed, Ms Conrad, your frequent and... sporadic use of of the facilities' vending machines.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that uncommon?\" Rachel gulped. She was sweating now, visibly nervous and cowing under Fukuda's scrutiny. How much did Fukuda know? What had been the giveaway?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not, dear,\" Fukuda continued. That \"dear\" couldnt have been any less sincere. \"But your bracelet shows that you have a tendency to frequent these machines at,\" she paused again to find the right word, \"peculiar hours.\" She began slowly, casually walking toward Rachel, calmly closing the distance between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel could have kicked herself. Of <i>course</i> the ELECTRONIC bracelet used to access the ELECTRONIC vending machine would keep an ELECTRONIC record of all her transactions. There was never any point in sneaking around during the night; she'd only justified Fukuda's suspicion!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, you'd be far from the only one to sneak away during class to use a vending machine,\" she continued with a knowing smile, \"but most faculty tend not to wander to so many different machines in a single class period.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo not just the times of the transactions but the locations as well. Rachel knew the jig was up. She had been found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All of those on top of your late-night excursions,\" Fukuda stopped advancing, \"lead me to believe that teaching here is not your primary inclination, Ms Conrad. Am I correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel's heart was beating a dozen miles a minute. Fukuda hadn't yet shown a single shred of anger, but that only made Rachel fear any sudden outburst even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...\" she began to plead. This couldn't have been going any worse! Rachel wasn't a spy or an assassin or anything. She was a goddam reporter!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I- it's just my job! I never wanted to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But to think Huan would stoop to hiring an undercover...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait. Who? Huan? Yeng's... business partners?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is the board really that suspicious that they'd send one of their own in disguise?\" Fukuda looked down, musing to herself now. \"And inspecting every single machine...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFukuda looked back up at Rachel, who was still panicked but now equally confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmph. I made the mistake of think you were merely enjoying our food... But apparently you're paying much more attention to what you're consuming than you're letting on. I would expect as much... from a food critic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA food... critic?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, Fukuda's conclusion may have been wrong, but there was no denying that it made sense. Skipping classes to go hunt down vending machines? Making sure to hit every single one? Taking those extra-long lunches with Brooke? This all gave Rachel an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Rachel began, heart still pounding. This had to work. \"I suppose you caught me in the act,\" she did her best to give a relaxed smiled. She didn't think she'd succeeded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However, we can keep this between us, if it's all the same to you, Miss Fukuda.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFukuda raised a brow. \"Oh, can we?\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there's no point in reporting me back to Huan; you know they'll just deny everything. Why else do you think they would have hired an independent contractor? No trail.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn truth, Rachel just needed a reason for why nobody at Yeng-Huan would have heard of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFukuda nodded, \"Of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I must say, I've only just gotten through all of the vending machines. I have a LOT of ground left to cover, and you know turning in an incomplete report will only mean my superior will find someone else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat part technically was true. \"Persistent\" was Gia's middle name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the one with the advantage, Miss Fukuda,\" Rachel navigated carefully, \"you're the only one who knows why I'm really here.\" She looked closely at Fukuda's eyes for any tells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is true...\" Fukuda muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Good,' Rachel thought, 'she just confirmed she hasn't told anyone else yet.' Rachel's breathing was getting easier. This was working after all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFukuda looked off to the side, clearly contemplating the woman before her and the situation that she had presented her with. After a few gruelingly long seconds, she looked back up to Rachel. With a stiff smile, she casually waved her arm again. The door behind Rachel clicked open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes. Miss Conrad. There is quite a bit more ground left for you to cover. Why, you haven't even seen our private dining rooms. Come with me,\" she said, swiftly walking past Rachel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel turned around to follow. \"But wait,\" she began, \"my class,\" she gestured to the empty room behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFukuda whisked around with another faux smile. \"I've already arranged for a substitute,\" she indicated her black bracelet once more. \"Now come.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel gulped. It wasn't a request. Still not knowing if she was out of the fire just yet, Rachel followed suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe building that Fukuda took her to was one Rachel hadn't seen before. Exiting from a cart, she trailed after Fukuda warily while the older Japanese woman waved her bracelet in front of a sleek black scanner next to a side door, the door opening with a long, clear beep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After you,\" her voiced dripped with honey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFukuda led Rachel down a long, lowly lit hallway while she conversed with the in cognito \"food critic\" by her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've no more need for pretenses,\" she calmly explained, looking forward rather than turning to face Rachel. Rachel's eyes, on the other hand, were glued to Fukuda's face. \"And you've no need to worry for the dispelling of your facade,\" she articulated primly. \"I'll be honest, you were not exactly the best new teacher at Buttercombe. You'll take the next few days off as part of a \"relocation\", before being replaced with another, more capable faculty member.\" She stopped at a large, ornate wooden double door. Despite its size, it gave way with only the slightest push.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This will be your new station,\" Fukuda gestured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel gasped. She had been taken to a fairly large dining room, as Fukuda had promised, fully varnished with red carpet, rosy oak walls and- was that a fireplace? Rachel stepped gingerly into the room, taking care to step around the bearskin rug that adorned the red floor. No telling how much that thing cost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel's destination was pretty clear. In the center of the room, squared evenly between the two large double doors on either end, was a long oak varnished table that matched the walls. The underneath and legs of the table were embellished with the typical Buttercombe flair; chubby cherubic angels frolicked with various plates of different pastries in each hand. The wooden carvings almost seemed to dance in the flickering of the firelight, the primary source of luminescence in this rustic red room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe table, although long, was completely bare and only had one chair at the very end. An armless chair, it appeared large, plush, red and expensive like everything else in this room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have a seat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel did exactly as she was told, pretty sure of what was about to happen. Her stomach let out a loud rumble in anticipation as well; that ride over hadn't been particularly short and Rachel desperately needed something to calm her nerves. Fukuda merely smirked and waved her bracelet once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if exactly on cue, the doors opposite the ones they had entered burst open. Silver carts laden to the brim with the most decadently deliciously smelling cuisine Rachel had ever seen were wheeled out by appropriately dressed but completely silent staff- all thin, wiry and Japanese, who began hurriedly  offloading their ferry to the sturdy center table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel almost moaned audibly. With no prompting needed, she picked up a fork and a knife and immediately began digging in to an absolutely heavenly carbonara that had been surreptitiously placed in front of her. The servers paid her mind, slowly surrounding her with mini-tables loaded down with silver plates, shining platters and even crystal carafes of clear red liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you're already eager to get to critiquing,\" Fukuda nodded approvingly. \"I assure you that you will be dining on only the best the academy has to offer from this point. Of course, I still implore you to make frequent use of the cafeterias during lunch and dinner hours, confirm that we are not cutting corners with ordinary students and faculty either.\" Fukuda poured herself a glass of wine from one of the carafes and sipped before continuing. Rachel was far too preoccupied to interrupt. \"But outside of that, you'll be here. If anybody asks, you're merely involved in an \"Assisted Study\". Your contemporaries- and Huan- will still only see you as a fellow teacher. However, we'll see how well you acclimate here for the next few months.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait a minute, next few months? Rachel made her way through her next few mouthfuls before turning to ask Fukuda a question, but the woman had already vanished, her light footsteps masked by the sound of invigorated chewing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe returned to the spread now in front of her, only about an eighth of it demolished and plenty more coming her way after. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat had she gotten herself into?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"The Yeng Corporation does not believe in shortcuts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel's hands had become particularly skilled with a knife and fork since she'd been assigned to Buttercombe Academy. Her fingers were nimble and her instincts with cutlery were sharp. While Fukuda spoke to her, she carved up slick meaty breasts of chicken cordon bleu. Dotting the plate with stabbing motions of her fork as her bites fell apart, she ensured that not an ounce was wasted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you can see, we are putting our chefs to good use.\" Fukuda's narration after her original departure had since come through speakers built overhead, but she was present in the lobby today. Watching and sipping from her glass of red wine, \"Headed by the world-famous Bunnie Blake, our culinary team is an efficient, well-oiled service just as dedicated to quality and refinement as it is to the improvement of their craft.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow many times Rachel had heard an approximation of this little speech in the past few days would have been anyone's guess. Dr. Hinamizawa often spoke highly of Yeng in a clearly practiced, scripted manner, even unprompted. With her slight accent and her even tone, never raising much higher than a carefully calculated volume, Fukuda could have easily been shooting a late-night infomercial or a training video. Regardless of whether her presence was tangible or not, the hours where Rachel could hear the doctor's speeches were often the ones that proved hardest to get through her \"task\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe food was delicious, that wasn't the issue. Rachel had been convinced that Buttercombe's cuisine was the epitome of finery beforehand and, no matter what Fukuda said, she could easily tell the difference between what she'd been feeding her and what she'd been dining on since she had agreed to teach at Buttercombe. The problem was Fukuda's presence\u2014in and out every few hours\u2014was distracting. Her reporter's instincts had told her to grill the woman as much as possible, or plug her for any information she might be able to get out of her. But the instincts that she had developed during her time at Buttercombe, the ones that told her to keep eating despite the fullness in her stomach or the tightness of her belts, found her an annoying obstacle to tune out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel would tell herself frequently, in the back of her mind, that the next time Fukuda entered the room or spoke over the PA, she'd ask her some questions. Get some information that might move her investigation forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had yet to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The next course to be served is a smoked duck and peanut butter soup.\" Dr. Hinamizawa continued over the sounds of the fraudulent food critic's feasting, \"Notice the oddity of the pairing\u2014the Yeng Corporation believes that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel was one of the few in the cafeteria to stop after a single serving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach was still tight from her \"Assisted Study\", a rock hard rounded gut bore underneath her sweater. Four days into her new assignment, and she'd only just now worked up the nerve to enter the cafeteria like everything was normal. It had been the first time she'd seen Brooke or Megan since Dr. Hinamizawa had reassigned her. Her welcome had been a warm one, surely, but her friends had begun to worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where have you been these past few days?\" Brooke asked, \"Dr. H wrangled up a sub pretty fast and then you were just... gone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been...\" Rachel burped into the back of her hand, \"Sick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSick is right. Day in and day out, she'd been eating like the richest garbage disposal in town. She'd been getting home and collapsing in bed, first chance she got. The fact that she wasn't at home in her cabin right now was a testament to her willpower. She needed to keep up appearances. If she wanted to get anywhere she needed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForget the investigation\u2014it was just nice to talk to someone who wasn't Dr. Hinamizawa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that explains it.\" Megan laughed, her ring of chin rippling, \"I'm sure you'll get your appetite back in no time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure...\" Rachel grimaced, sipping from her water...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Yeng Corporation believes that an excellent whole is comprised of excellent components.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel was panting. Who knew how long she'd been eating? The longer the day dragged on, the more dishes were pulled out of that private kitchen, it became more and more difficult to track the hours as they passed. Her stomache distended to rest in her soft lap, warm with the heat of pressure. The button on this, her last good pair of work pants, had busted off sometime this morning between the round of deviled eggs and what had felt like a loaf of french toast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take note of the individualized flavors; the components that make up your Sea Urchin Ceviche are all very distinct, but come together to make something much more rewarding and satisfactory as a whole.\" Fukuda sloshed her wine in her glass, the bottom of the bulb fogged slightly, \"I am sure that you will note the care with which the complementary ingredients have been chosen\u2014not haphazardly, but with precision and purpose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel had to agree, the menu was divine. She'd never had the same thing twice since she'd changed her cover story from English Teacher to Third Party Food Critic. She had expanded her menu and tasted some of the most incredible meals of her life since her cover was \"blown\". Sure, she often let her mind drift during her meals. But around this time of day, the last thing on her conscience was how her students were faring, or what rumors were being spread about her continued absence at classtime...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I know you are probably getting full.\" The sound of the kitchen doors opening came at the slightest pause, Rachel's pink tongue lolled to the side, \"So we are beginning our dessert course now. Chocolate parfait has always been a favorite of...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have been calling you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGia didn't sound happy. She often didn't, at least when business was concerned. But Rachel could tell that the six missed calls this week had left a sour taste in her mouth. And not in the pleasurable way, like the bitter melon ice cream that she'd had for dessert before driving home. If Rachel hadn't left her burner phone right by her bedside the morning before, she probably would have slept through another one of Gia's phone calls too\u2014her stomach squelching, doming above her while she slept off the incredible meals she'd gorged herself on throughout the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm...\" Rachel took a deep breath, her stomach settled awkwardly, \"Sorry. There's been a... hiccup.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A <i>hiccup</i>.\" Gia repeated in a stern elevated tone, the sound of her palm hitting the desk on the other end indicated that it was <i>not</i> a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just... just trust me.\" Rachel managed, her eyes bleary and her brain fuzzy with food and sleep, \"Gotta go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rachel Conrad, do <i>not</i>\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel's thumb hung over the END button on her phone for the slightest of moments before her arm fell back down to bounce against the mattress. She was already asleep by the time she'd shut her eyes again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the risk of exposing what she was <i>really</i> doing at this academy, Rachel continued to explore the newfound layer to her facade. After her first week ended and she settled into her new routine, she did her best to blend the hiccup (as she'd called it) of her Assisted Study (as Dr. Hinamizawa called it) into the larger narrative of her cover story at Buttercombe. She'd told her friends and any relevant coworkers about a vaguely defined job \"with the Vice Principal\", and managed to keep them at a safe arm's length away over dinners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo need in letting leads run dry, now was there?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs expected, between her private eating area and the dinners that she'd worked herself up to with her friends and coworkers, Rachel continued to grow like never before. In an a school where almost everyone, especially the new arrivals, seemed to steadily expand outwards Rachel quickly gained the lead. With a steady influx of food and more calories than any one woman could have known what to do with, slim and TV-ready Rachel Conrad was being buried beneath pounds upon pounds of excess blubber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time rolled on, one thing steadily became clear\u2014Rachel Conrad...</span></div></div>",

The auburn-haired woman is now very convinced her parents are full of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd always loved history, and wanted to get into the field, but struggles with her studies left her GPA too low to try for her Masters. Making matters worse, she'd attempted to get herself published with her own money, as no publishing house would carry her book. Unfortunately, the book was a total flop, adding those debts on top of her crippling student loans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if her debt load and lack of professional and academic success wasn't enough, Izzie has been struggling with her weight since high school. From a graduating weight of 105 pounds, the bookish nerd has yo-yo'ed up and down until now, leaving her quite uncomfortable at a new, all-time high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecently split from her cheating fiance, Isabella has just gotten her first job since graduating six years ago, a fact her parents are all too keen to rub in. It was through a close friend of her mother that she even got this job, and none too soon, as she didn't have a dime for the rent on her apartment. Now, if she can just get her weight and debts under control, life will be good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabella is a short woman with ivory skin, and her wavy red hair runs halfway down her back.<br>\r\nAlready quite round and flabby, she tends to gain weight like a bell.</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Alice Sorensen</b><br>\r\n<i>25, Blonde, 5'7, 167 lbs.<br>\r\nMath I/II</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"right\">Alice really wishes she was somewhere else right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn alumni of Buttercombe academy, she'd spent her formative years in these very walls. This place had really helped her grow as a person. Literally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery semester at Buttercombe had seen her piling on the weight. Outgrowing uniforms quickly became a regular thing, and she was quite the target of fun for her siblings whenever she came home for a spell, far larger and hungrier then when she left. Every time, she swore that she would lose the weight, or at least halt her gain. And every time, she'd restrain her appetite for days at most, then start stuffing herself silly once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she graduated, she was a whopping 412 lbs. Walking fifty yards without a break was a herculean task, and going more then an hour without dropping something sweet or greasy into her hollow leg, utterly unthinkable. Her weight continued to rapidly rise throughout her first semester of college, despite the less than fat-friendly atmosphere, but she hit a breaking point. Namely, in a single day during finals, she crushed her couch, split her pants, and got trapped in her car by her gargantuan belly. With the help of her room mate, she weighed herself that night, and was stunned to find out she was only six pounds short of breaking 500.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe huge young woman decided right then and there that enough was enough. Sticking to a strict exercise and diet program, she managed to shed an astounding 327 lbs. However, while her weight loss plan might have been successful, her professional life was less so. Despite sending out multiple resumes, only a handful of schools had called her in for an interview, and none had hired her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSave one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd only applied to Buttercombe as her back-up, back-up school, and much to her chagrin, they were the only ones willing to hire her. Beggars can't be choosers, though, so she'd accepted the job. Besides, she wasn't the weak-willed girl she'd been in her teens. This time, she'd control herself. This time, she wouldn't stuff herself like a prize winning hog. This time, she would keep working out. This time, she wouldn't gain an ounce. This time would be different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice is of Danish descent, with bright blue eyes and long blonde hair, typically kept in a ponytail.<br>\r\nShe typically gains a lot in her belly, though her booty and thighs certainly hold up their end.<br>\r\nAt story start, she looks a little soft and has a small pot belly, though she is surprisingly athletic.</div></span></div></div>",

As they passed the gate, her breath became shallow and stressed. Her nerves were firing on all cylinders. <i>\"Calm down. It's just a building. It's just a building. It's just a building.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was, in truth, more then a building. The whole of Buttercombe campus was a den of memories for the blonde. The new teacher had been a student within these very walls, and she had no shortage of good memories here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd bad ones, as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"It's different now. YOU'RE different now. It won't happen again. It won't happen again.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice Sorenson had, in just a few short years at Buttercombe, had grown to a then-staggering 412 pounds by graduation. Given she'd only attended the school for three years and had been a mere slip of a girl at 119 pounds on entry, she'd managed to put on close to a hundred pounds of jiggly fat per year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't hard to figure out why, if she was being honest with herself, as her appetite had been totally out of control. On average, she had been eating four meals a day on weekdays, and five or six on the weekends. Pre-bedtime and midnight snacks were the norm, and she was always eating something between classes. Her belly had initially hurt with how much she was putting away, but it was so good she didn't even consider slowing or stopping eating as potential options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce her belly had stretched out to accommodate her rate of consumption, Alice had watched her weight skyrocket. During her junior year, she managed to outgrow three uniforms in a single month. Her family had been stunned with just how huge she'd gotten, and their incredulity only increased with with her waistline with each milestone. Her Mum had been an endless repository of diet advice and healthy suggestions, and Alice had found her worrying exhausting to deal with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer siblings, on the other hand, had been simply aggravating. They had teased her mercilessly, only getting worse and worse as she got bigger. Her one sister, Cathy, developed a bad habit of slapping her growing behind or shaking her wobbly gut rolls when she was unaware of her presence, even going so far as to sneak a photo of Alice when she was seated on the couch in sweat shorts and a bra. It was a less then flattering shot of the massive young woman, with a large pepperoni on one end table and a plate with four double cheeseburgers on the other. Cathy had dubbed the photo, \"the Land-whale in her natural habitat,\" and used it as blackmail material to force her widening sibling to eat whatever she put in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer brother, Theo, had been just as bad in his own way. He was constantly plying her with treats and honking huge amounts of fatty foods, seeming to think if she was going to be fat, then she might as well go whole hog. Even when she was at her heaviest and could eat all day without a break, he somehow managed to force enough food down her throat to leave her painfully stuffed to the brim every single time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt probably says something about her time at Buttercombe that Alice actually expected to lose weight during the holidays, but thanks to her and her siblings efforts, Alice's weight spiked every time she went home for an extended period.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt grad, she'd been one of the biggest girls on campus, though she knew from talking to the school nurse (<i>\"What was her name again?\"</i>) that the average student weight had gone <b>up</b> in a big way since she'd been there. <i>\"And, more worryingly, teacher weights...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice had been a little surprised to hear Shannon Polluck was still the Head Mistress of Buttercombe academy. She'd been a fairly big woman when Alice was a teen, and she was absolutely stunned when she saw just how much Miss Polluck had expanded in the years since. Miss Polluck was now a planetary ball of lard, stretching her poor uniform to its utmost and eliciting some <i>very</i> worrisome creaks from her hugely oversized office chair. <i>\"She couldn't even stop eating during my 'Welcome to the Team' meeting. Heck, she's so fat she couldn't reach past her belly to grab another doughnut and had me pass them to her...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice could only hope that Miss Polluck's gargantuan ass was merely skewing numbers to the heavier end, but she'd find out soon enough. There was still about a week before classes start, and only a couple students had shown up so far. Her lesson plan was ready to go, so this time was mostly about meetings and getting to know her fellow staff members. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cab had pulled to a stop in front of the main campus building as she was lost in thought, and she exited the vehicle and grabbed her bag from the trunk. She looked at nearby sign, proudly advertising Yeng Brand Stomach Aid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother major change from her time at Buttercombe was the new addition of Yeng. The corporation had been a major sponsor for the school for a lot of years, but now it had grown into a full partnership. Beyond extra funding, Alice wasn't too sure what this yet meant, but she had a meeting with the Yeng representative that would hopefully answer some of her questions. <i>\"What was the name? Hinaizawa?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Alice herself had also changed a lot from her time at the academy. Her first semester at college had seen her gain until she was only a hairsbreadth away from the big 500. She'd managed to put on as much weight in three months as she'd put on in a year at Buttercombe, and this turned out to be the wake-up call she needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the last couple of years, Alice had managed to shed an astonishing amount of weight, managing to drop herself to a comparatively svelte 167 pounds. It had been a lot of hard work (and, admittedly, an expensive bit of surgery), and she was proud of her new figure and athletic prowess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice remembered how she used to be. Her gigantic belly softly stretching to her knees, even when standing. Her couch-crushing ass reaching from one arm rest to the other. Stopping halfway up a flight of stairs for an extended break, panting heavily and feeling sweat pool between her wobbly rolls. Her endless, rumbling belly and its desperate need for more and more and more...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice Sorenson really didn't want to go back to that, and her cruel siblings were already placing bets on how much she was going to gain. The fact that they were only giving 3 to 2 odds for her breaking her old weight record stung a bit, but she was terrified that they'd be proven right. <i>\"Heck, I'm already feeling hungry.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe frowned, wondering why she felt hungry given she'd only eaten an hour ago. As she looked around, it didn't take too long for her to figure out why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was currently standing downwind of the campus dining hall. Her skin went pale and her lip trembled in fear. <i>\"No, no, no! It doesn't mean anything! Cathy and Theo are wrong! I can do this! I can hold out! I'm stronger then this! I am, I am, I am!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice was so lost in thought that she didn't see the person behind her approach, and she physically jumped when they called her name. Turning around, she saw...</span></div></div>",

She turned around, clutching her rapidly beating heart, to see a middle aged Japanese woman. She was a little taller then she was, and a bit thinner. Not a single strand of hair was out of place, and it was a testament to the skill with which she'd done up her traditional bun that it barely shifted as she jumped from Alice's scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyes wide, she said, \"I apologize. I didn't mean to scare you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, it's okay.

I know our meeting isn't until tomorrow, but after a quick bite, I could give you a tour of the campus and we could get to know each other a little better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fears of the lunch room once more came to fore, and Alice felt herself grow pale. \"Oh, no, I'd hate to impose...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense, I insist.\" Miss Fukuda picked up Alice's bag, ignoring her reaching grasp. \"Shall we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot seeing any way out of this, Alice nodded, hoping her grimness didn't show on her face. \"Sure, I'd be happy to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*** *** ***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Helen Schwartz was sitting at her desk. Perhaps a bit old school in the digital age, she was looking at the results of a recent formula change on her monitor, and scribbling notes in her messy shorthand as she read. As she wrote, the microwave behind her dinged, and she paused in her note taking to retrieve the cup of coffee she'd just reheated. As she was crossing the little room, her desk intercom went off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Ov course,\"</i> she thought. Taking a sip of her caffeinated beverage, she opted to open the door rather then return to her desk. Seeing exactly who she expected too, she stated, \"Miss Hinamizawa. Do come in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer \"Boss,\" as much as Helen considered herself to have a superior she need answer to, walked over to Helen's desk and took a seat. Perhaps that might have been construed as an insult by some, but the two women had worked together for enough years that Helen knew there was no offense implied. It was well known that the German doctor seldom sat at her desk, and was prone to pacing when faced with an interesting or challenging problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Schwartz's interest was now piqued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Somezing interesting has happened, I think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed. I was able to get Alice Sorenson to take our recent vacancy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen, who was somewhat prone to tuning out Fukuda, only vaguely remembered the name. \"And? I vould imagine that you haff somezing more exciting than hiring a new science teacher to discuss vith me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Math. And yes, most certainly. She's an alumni of Buttercombe from during Phase 1 of Yeng's involvement with this school. And she's the last active recipient of formula 27-B.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>THAT</b> certainly got Dr. Schwartz's attention. \"Impossible. All subjects are accounted for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That you know of, yes. Your paperwork on the subject, as usual, is perfectly detailed. However, Yeng decided to run their own tests on the formula.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vithout my involvement or knowledge, I see.\" The formula in question had been developed by Dr. Schwartz many years ago, back when both she and Fukuda had been based in the city of Daven's Port. 27-B was meant to be an improvement over its sister product, 27-A. In both cases, the formula was designed to enhance the addictive properties of Yeng brand foods, boosting sales accordingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n27-A had a couple of serious flaws. Namely, certain compounds would neutralize the formula, and actually would turn the addictive chemicals in Yeng products into a deterrent. Depending on how one viewed such things, the other result was perhaps even worse. The test subjects of 27-A to a one were horrific gluttons. Eating non-stop, they all ballooned enormously, and clearly had no self-restraint left for their gargantuan appetites. After a whole string of subjects were hospitalized, Yeng panicked, and ordered all test subjects to be given the antidote and this whole line of research swept under the rug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is when Helen Schwartz got involved in the project. The promise of more sales and guaranteed customers was far too enticing, and Yeng gave her their unofficial support. Helen would later confide in Fukuda that she'd never seen a more incompetently manufactured compound in her life. Frankly, it had looked like it was designed while drunk, protein compounds and chemical chains tacked on like someone attaching layers of plywood with a nail gun until, by accident, they'd managed to assemble a house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA house that only succeeded in barely functioning as a house, to be blunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen redesigned the chemical from the ground up, aiming for the end result of perfectly addicted customers. Working within the framework she was given, Helen successfully composed 27-B. However, Admin was less than thrilled with the way in which she did it. Namely, rather then deal with the rampant gluttony of her subjects, Helen instead aimed for the formula to correct many of the worst health effects their diets would entail. Once again, every subject exploded with fat, and the bosses were not moved by the fact that they were considerably healthier butterballs then the first batch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking matters worse, from their perspective, was that Dr. Schwartz had corrected the \"antidote problem,\" meaning pulling the plug on this project was almost impossible. Many were bundled up and hidden in a mothball facility, and a lot of cash changed hands to keep this quiet. Only Fukuda's insistence had allowed Helen keep her job, and as far as the doctor had known, that had been the end of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't be surprised. You made great progress on the original, but were seen as a dangerous failure, to use their language.\" Fukuda made quotes around the words from the report. \"There were some who believed they could improve on your efforts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Und how did zat go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Poorly.\" Fukuda pulled out a report from her briefcase on the floor. \"42 test subjects in all. 31, no effect. 8, increased appetites for a week, then a sudden drop off. The same eight were also the eight lightest students in their graduating class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The remaining three are considerably more interesting. All three with greatly increased appetites. All were consistent, with or without the additive present in the cafeteria foods. Alice Sorenson was easily the largest of the bunch, both in sheer size and in appetite. Strangely enough, her largest gains were away from Buttercombe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Und she is still actiff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes. She's not much larger then I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remarkable.\" Helen was right to be surprised. The test subjects in her notes were many things, but certainly not active. All had been immobile for some time, with the majority continuing their rather impressive gains after crossing that threshold. A few had grown so large that even 27-B couldn't correct everything, forcing Helen to develop and administer 27-B2 in secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed. I pulled a lot of strings to make sure she wound up back here. The formula is still having an effect on her, if her lunch is any indication. Perhaps this is a chance to finish what we began so long ago, no?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen Schwartz smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*** *** ***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice rubbed her painfully stuffed stomach. She'd made an absolute pig of herself at lunch, and her grand tour involved Fukuda half-carrying her back to her room. Even thinking of all she'd just eaten nearly made her have a panic attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"It was just one time. It was just one time. You won't always eat a whole cheesecake at lunch. It was just one time. Just a pie. And a bit. And a rack of ribs. Seriously, just one time...\"</i></span></div></div>",

If things had gone their way, she thought, the baseball program would serve as a source of pride, and perhaps it could even help keep students fit as the months went by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut they didn't. Not by a long shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the first year was somewhat successful, during the second year the team members of the Buttercombe baseball team had bloated up considerably, with one student, a certain Hester Rhea, even getting to the point of being immobilized for about a month or two. The certain cause, nobody was sure about. But Marsha believed it had to do with a combination of a certain sweets loving RA and Hannah Hammond, who briefly served as a TA sub coach for her team before heading off to Stuffington U.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause of that, the team had one of the worst seasons in the history of all baseball, and to avoid humiliation Shannon Polluck had shut down her baseball team. While she had stayed, she was demoted to a teritary coach, namely forced to help in keeping students fit outdoors via the occasional outdoors run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout 14 years after this initial demotion however, Marsha would eventually become the primary coach and gym teacher, following Ashley Knight retiring upon reaching an astonishing 600 pounds in weight. Now in charge of the new program, Marsha had made an effort to slim down in time for the new year, trying her best to cut down on eating her beloved hot dogs and instead trying a Atkins style diet to lose weight, combined with some heavy exercise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting to the bathroom, Marsha would look down at her scale. \"Well Marsha... time to see what this diet has brought you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping on the scale, Marsha would wait for the numbers to settle, looking down to her rounded, sagging belly. Hearing the mechanical ping that it was done, Marsha would push her belly to the side to see the results of her diet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"350 lbs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she had lowered her weight by about a hundred pounds, which was certainly impressive for the newly primary coach, Marsha would frown as she would then move her body to the mirror. Looking at it, while she would see some muscle on her arms and legs from the heavy exercise, her gut was still heavily rounded and stretching out, while her rump still looked like she needed at least two seats to sit down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I know it takes time to lose weight but I wish I could be skinny again... at least just for tomorrow so that I can impress my new students...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince the first day was all about getting students introduced to the school, Marsha ended up being free for the day, leaving her to spend her day on her own.

Carrie Porter had opted to spend the Summer Break with her family, which meant she had had to pack her bags from her living quarters at Buttercombe Academy and crash with them for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis meant the blubbery brunette had to drag her bags from her car all the way up to her suite from the previous year. As to why she didn\u2019t just lug them into one of the many golf karts and just drive up the small path\u2026that reason was swaddled all around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie was big, she knew it, everyone knew it; and if she didn\u2019t want to get any bigger she needed to do something about it. Substituting driving for walking seemed like a good idea at the time, but it was leaving the unfit, un-toned woman drawing deep wheezing breaths like a winded cow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe should have felt really good about the exercise; especially after staying with her parents for just over two months, most importantly her mother. She loved her mom to bits, but god dam did her life revolve around food. Carrie had had temptation around her every waking moment, not to mention meals that were filled with enough calories-per-serving to feed a wrestler for a week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course Carrie had no willpower whatsoever (which was why she was in her current predicament), and had pretty much cleaned every plate. It was a habitual thing; as a child Carrie had gleefully eaten massive portions and asked for seconds. It wasn\u2019t until High School that Carrie finally realized that her eating had consequences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike her sister, Carrie had gone to a comprehensive, which meant no excess funding for the fat kid who couldn\u2019t fit in any of the desks, or broke a chair every other week. This pushed her to do something about it; and while Carrie never slimmed down (her genes sought to that, when a pound stuck it stuck for good), she did slow her exponential growth dramatically; all this while her big sister (previously the slimmest member of the Porter household) ballooned under Buttercombe\u2019s care. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich was why Carrie had been so disappointed by the previous year, and her first year working for the school her sister had once attended as a student. All that hard work and restraining herself, only gaining a scant ten pounds a year at most prior, and suddenly she had ballooned by five times that after stepping foot on the school\u2019s grounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after what felt like an age, Carrie arrived at her chalet. Beeping her keycard on the sensor, she opened the door and dropped her suitcase to the floor before doubling over and placing her hands on her knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweat poured from her forehead, some even dripping onto the wooden floorboards. Her tongue lolled out as she panted, desperately trying to suck in as much air as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026swear\u2026no more\u2026exercise\u2026until\u2026I drop\u2026the weight\u2026\u201d Carrie said to herself in gasping breaths. She had never been anything near fit; a solid F for Gym class every year had highlighted that. But her sentence was part of the problem, Carrie often made little excuses to herself; and last year was full of them. She had even convinced herself to eat three slices of cake at a teachers leaving party. Not a good sign for a prospective dieter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Carrie\u2019s ordeal was not quite over yet. Rather than unpack or shower, the hefty woman wobbled over towards the couch, aiming to collapse her huge form across it. As she waddled, she had to stop and hitch up her pants several times, plump fingers wrapping around the waistband and wrenching upwards, nearly giving herself a wedgie. Carrie was an incurably lazy woman at heart, even when it came to her wardrobe. When an outfit she liked stopped fitting, Carrie wore it to near destruction, rather than buy one in a more fitting size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer immense width hit the couch with barely a creak from the springs. Being as big as she was, Carrie qualified for the SSS treatment, and as such she had had her furniture reinforced to withstand a woman of her magnitude. As she gathered her breath, spread-eagle across the seat, her piggish eyes darted across the table and spied the welcome basket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer dry lips were moistened by her tongue, flirting with the edges of her mouth as it watered at the idea of more food. She hadn\u2019t eaten since she started her drive, and she had just done such hard work dragging her case\u2026she deserved a little treat right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrunting like a sow in labor, Carrie exerted as much force as she could, her fat body rolling forwards and her belly slapping the lip of the table. Thankfully the basket wasn\u2019t situated far from her chubby finger\u2019s grasp, so her soft pudgy skin met wicker very quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning upright, Carrie peered inside the basket. Yeng brand goodies were practically overflowing it like some cornucopia of sugary treats. Reaching for one of the topmost items, Carrie came away with a muffin so plump that it\u2019s muffin-top rivalled her own in pudginess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette bit down, and her eyes rolled back at the taste. That was the good stuff; her diet last year had constituted of so much Yeng-brand food that she had become addicted to it. Going an entire Summer without it, coming back felt better than sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin moments the oversized confection was resting soundly in Carrie\u2019s figure-dominating belly, sausage fingers being licked eagerly for the last residue. Carrie looked back into the basket; one more wouldn\u2019t hurt would it? Soon her teeth were sinking deep into a honey-bun, its sweetness dancing across her taste buds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes passed by in a blur as item after item vanished from the basket and into Carrie\u2019s gut, each one framed with a more pitiful excuse as Carrie glutted herself to her heart\u2019s content.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany minutes later, and Carrie felt her pink-painted fingernails scrape the bottom of the wicker basket and come up empty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh oh\u2026\u201d Carrie muttered as she looked down at herself. She was a total mess; crumbs dotted the crease between her breasts and belly, and the latter had emerged fully from its cloth covering; with her cavernous belly-button for the entire world to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at the basket and realizing she had failed again, Carrie gave a dejected sigh. Looks like it was salads and no desserts for the next week to try and counteract that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no desire to find herself scraping the basket for specks and crumbs, Carrie decided a shower was in her best interests for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Carrie tried to right herself, she felt the force of gravity yank hard at her confection-filled belly. Her big blobby sphere was looking less like a big sack of lard and more like a beach ball made of fat. Sighing to herself and promising again to rid herself of the swaddling adipose, Carrie waddled towards her old bathroom, undressing and lazily tossing her clothes to one side as she went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA blissful sigh passed her pink lips as she felt the cool tiles contact her feet, aching with carrying such an immense load all day. But that was nothing compared to the bliss she felt as the warm water rushed across her body, washing away the painful fullness of her belly and allowing her to drift away into\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Knock knock knock*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFudge!\u201d Carrie faux-swore under her breath as she turned off the tap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be just a minute!\u201d She yelled, poking her head out of the shower and simultaneously (and accidentally) splashing the room with her wet hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie didn\u2019t have time to be thankful that Buttercombe had provided towels in her size as she tucked the fluffy article around her widest part, before waddling as fast as she could for the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d Carrie asked as she opened the door, her long wet hair plastered to her chest and shoulders.

They hadn\u2019t seen much of each other since, but she would never forget the pressure that she felt sitting across from such an accomplished, distinguished\u2026 downright intimidating woman! She was a much harder interview than the headmistress. And while Carrie hadn\u2019t exactly been <i>avoiding her</i> she hadn\u2019t really been seeking out her company either\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello\u2014I am Dr. Hinamizawa, looking for\u2026\u201d the small Asian woman said politely, her eyes flicking to the clipboard she held in her hand, \u201cCarrie Porter?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you\u2019ve found her.\u201d Carrie joked awkwardly, \u201cIs\u2026 everything alright?

She had her own office, a living area, bathroom, and bedroom with a full kitchen suite. Even with her considerable size, Carrie never felt particularly cramped or like she couldn\u2019t move around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, somehow having Dr. Hinamizawa in the cabin with her made her humble abode seem that much smaller. Which didn\u2019t make much sense, considering some of the rather large women that Carrie had entertained since her employment here began. Perhaps it was her intimidating personality? Dr. Hinamizawa didn\u2019t seem to pose any outward threat, but somehow Carrie could never bring herself to relax in front of her vice principal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you for the coffee\u2014you really didn\u2019t have to.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe good doctor accepted the small yellow mug graciously. She took a sip, and placed it on the table in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s my pleasure!\u201d Carrie answered a little too eagerly, \u201cI mean, it\u2019s not every day I get surprise company!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie laughed awkwardly, making her cheeks ripple and her tummy quake. Hopefully it wasn\u2019t too obvious as to just how unaccustomed to company she was. The large woman lowered herself down in the sofa opposite her guest; the reinforced furniture barely making a squeak as she settled her supple form on the off white cushions of her couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what brings you by today?\u201d Carrie asked, taking a drink of her own (sugary, milky, honeyed) coffee in an effort to calm her nerves<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you to say that I cannot visit a fellow coworker?\u201d Dr. Hinamizawa teased<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? N-No, I just\u2014\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRelax, Carrie Porter.\u201d The vice principal shifted in her seat, her thick frame brushing against her blouse, \u201cI am only joking. My visit is not without merit, however. There is a matter of pressing importance that we need to discuss\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie swallowed another mouthful of coffee.

Are you ok Ms Porter?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie blinked again, shaking herself out of her thoughts. \u201cYes, sorry\u2026did you say two lunch breaks?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor smiled. \u201cYes, we found we have a lot more new teachers and fewer leaving staff than expected this year. So there are plenty of classes accounted for. So we selected a few to have an extra break; as an English teacher, and normally under considerable pressure being an essential class, I am sure you would be pleased with the news?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, really pleased\u2026\u201d she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as she talked, back of Carrie\u2019s mind was screaming at her. <b>No!</b> She did <u><i>not</i></u> need a second lunch break. Her weight problems were already on a slippery slope, and the idea of being surrounded by heavy fattening Buttercombe cuisine for twice the amount of time each day seemed like a one way trip to a waistline disaster zone! There was no way she could agree to this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou get two lunch breaks now!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d Carrie replied, drawing circles with her fork on an almost-empty plate. The brown-haired woman felt like she had swallowed a lump of lead; how could she have agreed to this? All those years of dieting and keeping herself under\u2026somewhat control, just to double her temptation like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell count me jealous; with how the food tastes here, I would give my right leg for a second lunch break.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting across the cafeteria table to Carrie was Judy Davis, Home Ed teacher and best friend to the blubbery woman. Judy was starkly different from Carrie; with dark brown skin, long luscious black hair that flowed around her shoulders like a waterfall, long legs and standing a few inches taller than Carrie. She was a stunning beauty of a woman, who often found herself the subject of the dirtiest comments scrawled inside the bathrooms. Despite her almost over-the-top makeup and shimmying strut, she was well known for being quite pleasant to her students\u2026just only when they were behaving themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever the two women did share some similarities; both were new teachers who had started one year ago, this connection being the ground-work for their friendship. Like Carrie, Judy had also put on quite a bit of weight last year; arriving at the time, Judy could have been described as slightly thick. Now though she was certainly extra thick; with a large ass that was starting to become a mini-shelf, thick thighs that were beginning to show signs of cellulite and folding over her knees, and a pair of ripe melon-like breasts that did a good job at hiding her newly-squishy midriff in their shade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was the kind of build where it would have been hard to initially call her fat, but was now starting to show signs of being a total fat-ass. This was easily demonstrated by how much she like snacking and overeating way too often; she was already on her second slice of pie that morning\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Carrie was still lamenting her predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTwo lunch breaks\u2026.gawwwwd! Now I know how Cer got so fat here in high-school!\u201d Carrie whined, planting her face on the table, causing her double-chin to squish on the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCer?\u201d Judy asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCerys\u2026my sister\u2026\u201d Carried prodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoooh yeah\u2026\u201d Judy replied, trying to hide how she had totally forgotten that Carrie had ever brought her up. \u201cWell if you put on some more comfort weight you could give her a call\u2026perhaps she can give diet tips?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie raised her head off the table and gave the dark-haired woman a dirty look. \u201cCerys? Give me diet tips?\u201d she scoffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Don\u2019t tell me she never lost her puppy-fat?\u201d Judy tried to laugh off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy\u2019s chuckle stopped as Carrie\u2019s scowl deepened. \u201cLook I love my big sis\u2026but she\u2019s a total blob.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome ooooon!\u201d Judy laughed again. \u201cShe can\u2019t be <u>that</u> big!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d Carrie replied, laughing a little herself now. Reaching for her purse, Carrie began to fish around for her phone with comments along the lines of \u201cseeing is believing\u201d. With her phone in-hand Carrie tapped away, heading towards an album marked \u201cfamily pics\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning the phone around to face her friend, Carrie gave the picture some context. \u201cThat\u2019s her at graduation.\u201d she stated flatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god!\u201d Judy gasped, staring intently at the picture. \u201cDid they charge for the crane?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, dad was happy about that.\u201d Carrie remarked, as if this was a totally normal thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can see why she hasn\u2019t dropped the weight. Would take me years to lose all\u2026<i>that</i>!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie could see she had made her point, but wanted to stamp it in a bit more. \u201cShe\u2019s bigger now,\u201d the rotund woman commented as she took the phone back and began to slide her thumb across the screen again. \u201cHere she is at the last family meeting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy looked at the latest photo and her eyes bugged. \u201cOk\u2026I think I have had enough to eat\u2026\u201d She remarked, pushing her slice of pie away from her side of the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou would be amazed how few people she has that effect on\u2026\u201d Carrie muttered under her breath, recalling the whale-sized friends Cerys had brought home for the holidays one year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, question is, what are we going to do?\u201d Judy asked, changing the topic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo idea\u2026I can\u2019t go back to the vice principal about it, that would mess up whatever system she was trying out\u2026plus I don\u2019t wanna lose face in only my second year here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was going to suggest something about improving your willpower\u2026especially considering you just ate my pie\u2026\u201d Judy commented, pointing a long well-painted nail downwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Carrie replied; looking down to see that not only had Judy\u2019s plate been emptied, but there were more crumbs than she remembered nestled between her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh doodlebugs!\u201d Carrie huffed, cleaning herself up. \u201cAlright\u2026fine, I can go talk to the counselor, see if she has anything that can help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou could also see if the nurse has any appetite suppressants?\u201d Judy added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Carrie just made a face at that idea. \u201cThat sounds a bit\u2026drastic.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy leaned forward, her hefty bosom wobbling like jello. \u201cHun, I just saw a picture of your mom and sister\u2026and unless you\u2019re adopted or something, that option ain\u2019t drastic enough.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine fine\u2026any other ideas?\u201d Carrie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm\u2026I could try to get one as well? Act as your diet buddy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie snorted, \u201cGreat, then we\u2019ll both end up fat.\u201d As she said this, both her and Judy\u2019s guts gave out loud synchronized hungry rumbles. \u201cOk\u2026fatter\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I got nothing else.\u201d Judy shrugged. \u201cSo unless you come up with something, it\u2019s either those ideas or you get in on the sister act.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie thought for a moment...</span></div></div>",

Rebecca was hired after touring in a notable orchestra, although she left on some bad terms as she readily jumped at a position at the academy. Rebecca has a reputation not only for her skills at mastering several instruments or writing operas since she was eight but for her notorious bloating habit. Rebecca's had a lifelong beverage binge cycle, becoming more acute when she moved back to the states. Over the years that's mutated into yo-yo dieting where she slims down one semester and becomes zaftig the next. Is she currently waxing or waning with her weight? Who's to say, Rebecca doesn't really care about her size, rather the uncomfortable truth that her impending birthday means she's pushing forty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca is a stupendously tall, statuesque woman with soft curves.

Although she trimmed down a bit after returning to her multi-ethnic roots, after becoming an international fushion-cusinie chef her outrageous curves have only become more dangerous. She's been teaching at Buttercombe for almost five years and the weight has continued to pile on. She wears her weight well, being as thick with her assets as she is thickly accented. Somehow she's oblivious to her pin-up worthy body shape.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Reputation meant everything at Buttercombe. Throughout the years, the academy maintained its reputation of attracting the best of the best. The private academy vouched for the best teachers and the brightest young minds of the next generation of women. The partnership with the Yeng Corporation was a testament to that, as the company become one of the most prominent in the world and one of the best to work for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd when it came to talent, one of the most notable the academy had attracted was a certified music genius. Even if she was a big tall ditz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca Voll-Spillum had been a prodigy in the music arts from as far back as she was able to talk. She wowed her classmates through elementary and middle grade, received special attention and went through an entirety of graduate work in only a matter of years. Then, after choral and viola auditions, she became the youngest viola first chair of the Intercontinental Orchestra, debuting in their revival tour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all before she started work at Buttercombe! Although, many critics and fans alike thought she was cutting her career in the orchestra short when she walked away to teach prep at an exclusive Virginian boarding school hidden away in the mountains. There had been rumors circling around for a time, when inquisitive minds started looking into what made the mind of the brilliant classical musician tick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome thought she had a failed marriage, indicating her hyphenated name as proof when compared to the rest of her family. Others dug into the Spillums directly to root out every last sordid detail. Of the Spillum family life that had moved about constantly to better Rebecca's music education at the cost of home life stability for her younger sister Pauline. Of a father who owned a nightclub with shady dealings, a mother with a maiden name of Francine Ulster who was a minor Buttercombe alumni in the same class as Headmistress Pollock. Surely her mother's connections had landed Rebecca her teaching career?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn truth most of that gossip was hogwash. Rebecca had been hired solely for her talent, not connections, leading to an awkward period as the gifted genius had to learn what it meant to actually teach. Rebecca's mother was remembered by the headmistress, as you would remember a former friend from your school years, but the connection ended there as time drew people apart. Half of Rebecca's initial year teaching was spent trying to reconnect with her sister, a transferred Sophomore, to variable success.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all in the past. To see Rebecca Voll-Spillum now, all these years latter, was a sight in and off itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now on the chord changes,\" Rebecca was seated at the piano, \"the transference from the minor to major key brings a triumphant sound, especially with this crescendo to fortissimo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was her first music class of the semester, one of Rebecca's favorite times of year, when she got to meet returning students and see what new minds where brought to the academy. She usually pulled out all the stops of her repertoire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hard to tell what about the music classroom was more unusual. Perhaps it was the tidbit that Rebecca was not leading off her Music Theory class with the likes of Chopin, Bach or Beethoven, but the ska beats of No Doubt while she imitated Gwen Stefani's singing perfectly. Or maybe it was the fact that you never saw a baby grand piano flanked by two water coolers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca was known as one of the more fun teachers on campus. Her personality was sometimes far younger than her maturity suggested, plus she didn't mind if students brought snacks and treats to share in class. Although, having food remnants in your throat was problematic for most vocalists and musicians, so Rebecca ensured that plenty of water was on hand to flush down the phlegm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was quite common to see the music professor with water or beverage on hand. Her desk was a clutter of bottles and cans at any one time. When Rebecca stood to her full, full height the evidence of her lifestyle at Buttercombe was quite visible. She favored loose, flowing clothing with plenty of give, usually in dark or neutral colors. Her tall frame had rounded out considerably, although not to much fat graced her face or slender neck. Each curve had soft, shimmying fat that made Rebecca look like a human water balloon when she walked. That wasn't too far off of a description, given how long she could quaff a drink. Her stomach formed two rolls even when her belly was empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca liked all kinds of music. From classical, rock, bossa nova, blues, metal and many others, she used several examples in her lessons. Her tastes were as varied as the contents of her mini-fridge. Overall Rebecca was an enthusiastic if ditzy genius adaptive to change. The start of the school year was always one of change and for Rebecca this one would be no different.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I heard she was as big as Miss Walker, you know, the OLD culinary arts teacher?\" whispered one girl to her neighbour.<br>\r\n\"No way, nobody could be as fat as Walker\" exclaimed the second girl, shaking her head in disbelief causing her modest double chin to wobble.<br>\r\n\"Well she did used to be a chef before teaching and you know what they say about trusting a skinny chef\" retorted the first again, nodding her head in a decisive notion as if the old adage gave any kind of supporting evidence to her rumour. Rumours aside however, the entire senior class was about to discover exactly what the fabled Jafit Gamor looked like as the door to the classroom creaked open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJafit had always found enjoyment in food, be it producing delicious meals for her family and friends to over indulging herself regularly. The latter enjoyment was one formed whilst studying at Buttercombe in her youth that she never managed to shake upon returning home much to the surprise of her parents who didn't recall their beautiful daughter looking quite so...American. All that aside, she now strutted into her first class of her fifth year teaching at the prestigious Buttercombe Academy rather than receiving lessons and she could not be more excited. Based on their expressions Jafit could only assume that her new class were just as excited as her!<br>\r\nIf only she realised they were in awe at her very presence itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a prolific foodie to boot and much to the shock of her parents, Jafit had put on some pounds over the years but few were so blessed with such an eye popping hourglass shape as she was. As she strolled to her desk, each sun kissed leg brushing past each other with feet donned in her ever stylish heels, her bouncing rear resembled twins fighting under her tightly stretched skirt, the faint bite of her skimpy underwear visible against the bulging smooth fat of the blossoming cheeks contained within. Each clicking step caused her heaving bosom to jiggle in protest against her slightly too small bra which in turn was trying to escape her tailored collar shirt which only served to highlight her deep cavernous cleavage. Despite her immense proportions, the rest of her olive skinned body held very little fat with only her thighs having any kind of thickness worthy of note as they tapered out from her wide hips down to her knees in smooth long columns without a single blemish or hint of cellulite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning class\" cooed the Spanish beauty, her accent the only aspect of her being thick enough to contend with her immense proportions.<br>\r\n\"Good morning Miss\" replied the class in unison, most of them still in awe of their tutor. Even amongst the uniquely figured individuals of Buttercombe, Jafit Gamor was a specimen all on her own.<br>\r\n\"So girls, I understand that you are all of the senior class yes?\" asked Jafit, leaning into her desk slightly causing her chest to surge forward and enhance the depth of her cleavage. One particular student at the front of the class nearly fell out of her chair at the sight of such quantities of breastage as the rest of her class nodded in answer to the buxom tutors question.<br>\r\n\"That is wonderful! So, because of this, I am asking of you today that we shall all prepare an American treat for our first class together. I know that you are all expecting to learn some more...exotic recipes but first you shall all show me something you enjoy\" Jafit happily rattled off to her students with some enthusiasm. Despite her Mediterranean heritage, the Spaniard had inherited quite a taste of American 'delicacies' throughout her years living state side and felt it was an appropriate first lesson to get her new class accustomed to her teaching styles as well as gain some early insights into each students ability.<br>\r\n\"So you want us to make, like, apple pies and burgers and things like that?\" asked a rather bottom heavy red head with a belly to match from near the back of the class.<br>\r\n\"Exactly\" mused Jafit, each suggestion causing saliva to pool behind her lips \"anything much like those would be perfect\". The premise did strike most of the class as slightly odd but nobody could complain at a much easier class than they expected.<br>\r\n\"Well, when you are ready to start\" smiled Jafit, beckoning the class on with a raise of her slender arms.<br>\r\nAnd begin they did<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*******************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn very little time, the entire classroom was ablaze with a peculiar combination of sweet and savoury, a slightly weighted split towards the sweet side of the spectrum as the girls took to preparing their first culinary pieces for the year. As the mass of yellow uniforms buzzed through the class, Jafit slowly milled between them, dotting from student to student, observing their progress and offering gentle advise where necessary to avoid burning or flavour combination disasters. Such things were slightly self serving as Jafit would be taste testing all the dishes prepared, but then, why should she have to indulge in things that were not to her taste?<br>\r\nBefore long, all of the Buttercombe seniors had added their finishing touches and had their creations plated up ready for their first assessment.<br>\r\n\"Are we all completed now, yes?\" asked the bubbly tutor, hands on hips at the front of the class again.<br>\r\n\"Yes Miss\" replied the class, again in unison<br>\r\n\"Fantastico\" exclaimed Jafit in a burst of her native Spanish tongue, much to the amusement of her class \"so if you could all please bring forward your food so I may try it I can start to assess you.\"<br>\r\nWith pleasant compliance, each member of the class brought forward her creation one at a time to allow their teacher to taste what they had produced. Years of working in the food industry along with some intensely gluttonous teenage years had allowed Jafit to develop an appetite that rivalled her hip girth in size making testing twenty or so dishes in one sitting a surprisingly easy task. In keeping with her characteristic ignorance of her own stunning physique however, Jafit's ignorance continued to shine through as her delicately thin waist swelled out from the feasting exertion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA double stacked burger, a densely packed apple pie, a pair of thickly wrapped burritos, three choices of decadent chocolate cake, a selection of doughnuts, pancakes and waffles all cooked by one student...these were just a few of the treats put forward for assessment, all of which were delightfully received and contributed to the modest food baby forming between Jafit's hips which, after testing a salted caramel and white chocolate muffin as large as her hand (her last treat for sampling), formed a delicate curve in the front of her figure forming shirt. Her otherwise immaculate figure betrayed her slight bloating, offering the slightest peek of her curving stomach where an overstretched button hole parted slightly to reveal a similarly tanned midriff in keeping with her on show thighs and cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooph, thank you very much girls\" huffed the stuffed teacher, a delicate hand laid over her stomach as she spoke \"you will be pleased to know that you have all passed with flying colours.\" The Mediterranean beauty wiped her mouth with the back of her hand as the class cheered just in time to hear the bell signifying the end of class ringing through the hall outside.<br>\r\n\"I hope you have enjoyed today's class and I look forward to seeing you next time\" called Jafit from her chair as the class poured out the door, a wave of goodbye calls reaching back to where she sat.<br>\r\nWith a smile on her curved lips, Jafit leaned back slightly in her chair as she peered down her figure which was largely blocked by her immense chest. Still smiling, she idly grabbed one of the chocolate cake offerings and stabbed into it with a folk, indulging in another large bite, and another, and another...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Gamor\"<br>\r\nThe voice made the stunning chef jump from her near slumber, chocolate crumbs coating her lips which she licked away with haste as she rose to her feet.<br>\r\n\"Sorry to disturb you, I just wanted to have a word if I may\"<br>\r\n\"Of course, of course, please come in and be seated\" offered Jafit to the voice from the doorway </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Thank you, thank you\" cooed Dr Fukuda Hinamizawa as she strode through the class and delicately planted herself down on a chair opposite Jafit, a slight roll of pudge resting on her thighs as she did.<br>\r\n\"How may I be able to help you?\" asked the bloated cookery teacher, idly running her finger tips over her swollen stomach beneath a tighter shirt than the one she put on that morning.<br>\r\n\"Straight to the point, I like it\" nodded Hinamizawa with a slight smile spreading across her lips as she spoke.<br>\r\nJafit's prolific career as a chef meant she was frequently complimented and, as such, had become accustomed to such positivity to herself or her creations. She would also be lying if she were to tell anyone that she did not enjoy the adoration associated with compliments, a sense of enjoyment that was currently warming her heart knowing that the good doctor was impressed with her attitude already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me just start by saying you are a wonderful asset to this school and have yielded fantastic results within the student body\" continued Hinamizawa \"barely a day goes by when I don't hear somebody speaking highly of you and the work you've done since joining the staff at Buttercombe\"<br>\r\n\"Oh why thank you\" Jafit blushed visibly through her sun kissed complexion \"I just wish to help by sharing my skills\"<br>\r\n\"Well you certainly have so far, it's hard to believe you have only been with us for five years\" Hinamizawa continued to gush, well aware she was feeding Jafit's ego by the spadeful at this point \"I was hoping that you would be able to help with a new venture concocted by some of my colleagues within Yeng that they wish to trial within the school\"<br>\r\nCuriosity piqued, Jafit looked intently at the woman before her. Jafit was well aware of Buttercombe's association with the megacorporation Yeng Industries but had rarely needed to mingle with it so directly, certainly not being asked to be directly involved before now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Spaniard readjusted herself in her chair causing her bosom to jiggle within its confines (Jafit could not wait to get her bra off at the end of the day) as she pondered this vague proposition.<br>\r\n\"What exactly would you want me to do?\" asked Jafit resting her chin in her hand, gaze wandering slightly to the remains of her chocolate cake longingly. Her look did not go unnoticed.<br>\r\n\"Well what we're looking for Miss Gamor is...please eat, don't let my presence stop you...well the product we have in question is what my colleagues have opted to call a supplement\" elaborated Hinamizawa.<br>\r\nStill intrigued, Jafit slid the cake she was eying closer so she could nibble away at it as she thought, it was so sweet of Dr Hinamizawa to not think ill of her for eating during their meeting.<br>\r\n\"A supplement?\" asked Jafit between a mouthful of cake whilst using a finger to coax a rogue crumb back between her lips.<br>\r\n\"Something like that, yes\" continued the doctor \"at Yeng we have a whole division committed to wellbeing and health and their latest discovery is a universal supplement that, upon consumption, allocates itself to fill any gaps the body may have on a vitamin or mineral level due to poor diet\". Hinamizawa looked at her colleague all knowingly but picked up on Jafit's confusion as her chewing slowed leaving a look of bemusement in its wake.<br>\r\n\"Sorry, that's the explanation I was given and it's not all that simple\" the doctor laughed innocently.<br>\r\nJafit laughed as well, although she wasn't entirely sure why. At this particular moment she felt comfortable talking to the doctor and was looking forward to knowing how she might be able to help with her project.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me start again\" declared Hinamizawa, clearing her throat \"basically what we have is a substance that can keep people healthy, regardless of their diet, and we would like you to help us by implementing it into recipes and seeing how it reacts when used in food\"<br>\r\n\"So you want me to add this to my food when I cook, yes?\" asked Jafit, still seeking clarification as she was still confused as to what was being asked of her.<br>\r\n\"Exactly that my dear, all we ask is that you are open to have me drop by every so often and check in on how you're getting on\" smiled Hinamizawa.<br>\r\n\"Well I think that would be possible to do\" nodded Jafit, sliding her cake out of the way again \"when would you like me to start?\"<br>\r\n\"You can start immediately if you wish\" replied the doctor, leaning under the desk they were sat at and producing a case that Jafit had not realised she had before \"there are a load of samples for you here, please feel free to use them all if you can\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, well thank you very much. I do look forward to trying this 'supplement' out with my food\" replied Jafit, taking the box and sitting it to one side to take with her later after classes.<br>\r\n\"I'm glad to hear you so enthusiastic about this project, I hope we can get some wonderful results by working together\" beamed Hinamizawa, extending a hand to the Spaniard \"I'll be in touch so we can organise a meeting to gather your initial thoughts and feelings on the matter.\" Hinamizawa grasped the younger woman's hand and shook it briskly before turning on her heels and marching back out of the classroom without another word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlightly stunned by the interaction, Jafit stood looking at where Hinamizawa had once been and then glanced down at the box of sachets under her desk.<br>\r\nAlthough she wasn't entirely sure what she had agreed to, Jafit could not help but feel excited at being part of such an obviously important project.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, this is Hinamizawa\" the good doctor answered her phone as she walked down a corridor, weaving between students milling past her.<br>\r\n\"Yes, I've just been to see Miss Gamor and have left the package with her. She seems compliant enough and willing to help us\". A wry smile cracked across the doctors lips as she spoke.<br>\r\nWhoever was on the line seemed pleased as well but then said something that nearly stopped Hinamizawa in her tracks. Rather awkwardly, she quickened her pace towards an empty classroom, slid herself round the door and closed it firmly behind her.<br>\r\n\"No she does not know what it REALLY is\" hissed the black haired doctor \"who do you think I am? Of course I didn't tell her she's testing a highly experimental weight and metabolism enhancement drug!\" Hinamizawa was quite angry at this point, spots of spittle had sprayed her phone and a vein was angrily pulsing in her left temple.<br>\r\n\"As far as Gamor is concerned she's helping us test a vitamin and mineral supplement for general health\" anger subsiding slight, Hinamizawa rubbed her eyebrows to vent her aggression as she listened to her contacts response.<br>\r\n\"Yes I will be keeping tabs on the situation and keep records of Gamor's progress with the substance\" anger eased, the doctor began to pace to stretch her legs as she spoke<br>\r\n\"Thank you for your ongoing trust in my abilities\" snapped the doctor sarcastically \"yes, goodbye, bye\"<br>\r\nAngrily stabbing at the end call button with her finger, Hinamizawa put her phone away and exited the room she had hidden herself into, striding away at a great pace.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Phew, it had been a long first day back at Buttercombe.<br>\r\nAfter her meeting with Dr Hinamizawa, Jafit had had three more classes across various age groups which, in turn, had mostly all produced specimen dishes that required taste testing and grading. As such, the Mediterranean beauty was looking somewhat more stuffed than she had that morning and was in dire need of some comfort.<br>\r\nKicking open the door to her luxurious teachers apartment, Jafit wiggled elegantly into her onsite home kicking off her work heels just inside the door as she did. Padding through her living room in bare tanned feet, the Spaniard unbuttoned her overburdened tailored shirt which, between the immense pressure of her boobs and the added exertion of an overtaxed, previously flat, stomach, practically burst open from the front first. The sudden release of pressure felt like a rush of fresh air into Jafit's lungs and she moaned happily to herself.<br>\r\nUpon reaching her bedroom, Jafit shrugged off her shirt, allowing it to fall to the floor and exposing her entire upper body in all its tanned, enormously chested glory. Stood before a full length mirror the skirt was dropped next, exposing the rest of her immensely proportioned body which required stretching the waistband further to accommodate the release of the hourglass shaped chef's wide hips and even wider bum. Whilst bent down, the Spaniard glimpsed a familiar peek of the steel reenforcements forming a part of her super king sized bed. Before moving to Buttercombe, Jafit had never even imagined such a large bed never mind requiring it to be given additional support to such a high degree. She did, however, suspect it was standard in a place like Buttercombe with all these Americans. After one last glance in her mirror to observe the contrast between he olive skin and the light blue of her matching underwear set, she turned on her heels, causing a sizeable wobble in both her chest and arse as she did, grabbing a bed top for the evening as she did and strutted back into her living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked, Jafit slid into her short sleeved tshirt which stretched impressively over her chest but, as such, did not reach her hips leaving a slither of tanned stomach exposed to the room. This did not bother the buxom chef, however, as her attentions were elsewhere, focusing on snapping the clasp on her bra and pulling the sizeable undergarment out from under her top, tossing it to one side. Finally free for the evening, her large breasts plopped heavily against her and wobbled in sync with each step she took as she beelined for her expansive sofa to get comfy for the night.<br>\r\nUpon reaching the large seating piece, Jafit dropped herself from her full stood height into a curled seating position to increase the enjoyment from the soft comfy sofa beneath her bum. As she landed, Jafit was made aware of the familiar sensation of her sizeable padded rear end spreading beneath her from the impact of sitting and the amount of weight pressing down into her seat. Although oblivious to the specific appeals of her physique, having lived with it for so long now, the well proportioned chef was not oblivious to her softness which she did enjoy a great deal. In particular she was fond of her general thickness and the way that her clothes reacted to her size. This did make her smile as she turned on her tv.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while of channel hopping to minimal success, Jafit felt the need to do something else with the rest of her evening. It did cross her mind to explore her annual welcome bundle but, despite the sheer size and allure of its contents, that wasn't quite what she wanted. Scanning the apartment, her big brown eyes eventually locked on the box that Dr Hinamizawa had given her. Slender feet first, Jafit slid from her seated position and skipped toward the box, voluptuous assets bouncing uncontrollably as she did. Leaning forward, braless boobs nearly filling the box before she could get her hands in, Jafit examined the contents of the box, finding piles and piles of sachets of powder. With her delicate hands, she grabbed one from near the top and examined it. The package was clear and had no clear instructions on the packet as to what to do.<br>\r\n\"Interesante\" muttered the Spaniard as she looked a bit more, finding a hand written note within the box...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Just add to food or drink of any sort and mix thoroughly to activate'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving spoken to Hinamizawa, Jafit was convinced this product was greatly important and, as a chef, it was only right to test it first before subjecting anyone else to it, her dad had taught her that as she grew up. Shrugging, Jafit padded into the kitchen, and, after having to hook a wedgie out from between her bulbous cheeks, grabbed a large glass from within a cupboard. She knew she wasn't hungry after all the taste testing she had done that day but a drink would hit the spot just right. With little thought the curvy chef poured herself a glass of milk from the fridge and examined the sachet of powder again. No information on doseage, no extensive explanation of how to use it. Just mix until dissolved.<br>\r\nThrowing caution to the wind, Jafit tore the top off of the packet and, with a table spoon, dumped three large heaped spoons of powder into her glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the powder dissolved instantly but Jafit mixed vigorously for good measure before tapping the edge of the glass and discarding the spoon into the automatic dishwasher. Most of the appliances were extremely user friendly or completely self sufficient, another perk of being a part of the Yeng corporation machine that ran Buttercombe these days.<br>\r\nTentatively, Jafit sniffed her now mixed concoction and was nearly knocked backwards. It still smelt of milk except it was something...more. It was the creamiest and sweetest milk the chef had ever had the pleasure of sniffing. With a childish smile she took a small sip and moaned softly. It was as delicious as it smelled, if not more so and she scurried back to her seat, bouncing all the way but not spilling a drop even as she heavily landed back on the sofa.<br>\r\nJafit had not intended to inhale the glass full but before she knew it she was hungrily licking her lips and peering through the bottom of the glass. Along with the intense flavour dancing on her tongue and down her throat, a warmth seemed to build in the Spaniards stomach which she longingly caressed through her night shirt. Oddly, she could swear the same warmth was spreading in her chest, hips and bum but she couldn't be sure as her mind wandered in enjoyment.<br>\r\nThoroughly content, Jafit settled in to watching tv as her yearning for food subsided after a single glass of milk. Little did she know that reactions within her body were already at work that she couldn't dream of understanding.</span></div></div>",

God, what happened last night? Did she really fall asleep like this? What time even is it? She bent forward to check her phone on the coffee table: 12:07 PM. It's a good thing cooking didn't meet Tuesdays and Thursdays, her big ass would have been kicked out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Now that that was out of the way, Jafit began to make some peculiar observations about her situation. Number 1: she was absolutely, positively stuffed. Her normally small stomach was protruding cartoonishly beneath her shirt like a dome, taut and hard. The second observation was related: she was surrounded by trash. Not just any trash, mind you, but empty wrappers and containers of a binge gone mad. Her welcome basket was demolished, laying empty on its side in the middle of the floor, its calorific contents having been devoured and discarded around Jafit's butt and feet. But that's not all; she also spied the remnants of that whole gallon of milk, two empty tubs of ice cream, and a couple pizza boxes (did she order delivery?) among others. She placed a shocked hand on her engorged, upset belly and wondered if it's even possible for a human being to eat that much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Jafit picked herself up off the couch and stared for a second at the cushion as the butt indent she left in the leather decompresses.

This was going to be an interesting day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0This bathroom and by extension all the bathrooms in Buttercombe's faculty housing were recently remodeled with much bigger people in mind. The tub was large and wide, the shower head powerful and extendable, and the toilet strongly built. There were handrails placed around the larger-than-normal room, presumably meant for the school's multiple handicapped teachers. None of this surprised Jafit, the school clearly had an obesity problem, which the administration was more than happy to accommodate. In her earliest year teaching there, she had seen many a public bathroom out of order because some student got herself stuck in a stall or a teacher somehow managed to break a porcelain throne with her bulk. These embarrassing displays happen rarely now: everything had been made much, much more accessible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Jafit brushed her teeth and subsequently stripped down, pulling her shirt and underwear off and plopping them to the floor. She took a moment to admire herself in the mirror. Before this moment, despite having the body of a fertility goddess, Jafit had never seen herself as a sexual being. Don't get me wrong, she'd had many a partner in the past, but she never truly realized how desirable she was. Then, for the first time, looking in that overly large bathroom mirror, she got it. Like the supplement she drank last night flipped a switch in her brain, she touched her brownish skin delicately, rubbing her hand across her torso to her hips. She cupped her huge breasts in her hands, pushing them up and squishing them together. She turned around and admired her booty, giving it a squeeze and a hearty slap. She bit her lip. God, did she actually just turn herself on? She hurried into the shower for some more experimentation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After a long, hot, steamy shower, Jafit emerged a new woman. Well, not really, but she felt like it. Her self-confidence was brimming like never before. She felt she could conquer the day with her curves, get any man or woman to bow down to her. She felt immensely powerful and... hungry? To her surprise, her stomach's size had receded quite a bit. It was still bigger than normal, but it was certainly much smaller than it was this morning. Oh well. Must have just been morning bloating. She draped herself in her towel and started on her way to her room to dry her hair when she noticed the scale. Jafit hadn't weighed herself in a couple weeks, so she figured then would be as good a time as any to go ahead. When she stepped on, however, it read a number she wasn't exactly expecting: 199 pounds. That can't be right, she thought to herself. Sure enough, after stepping off and stepping back on again, the scale still read 199. She was just 190 two weeks ago! This had to be some kind of mistake. It was no secret to Jafit that she had been steadily packing it on as of late; when she started working at Buttercombe she was around a relatively small 140. But that was 5 years ago! There was no way she gained 9 pounds in two weeks. No way. Either way, she wasn't beaten up about it. No little weight gain was going to ruin the cloud that Jafit was up on, not today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Still toweled up and her short hair freshly dried, Jafit crammed her butt between the arms of her office chair at her desk in her bedroom, ready to check some emails. She opened her laptop and saw that among the usual clutter and account notifications was a message from...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Good morning Miss Gamor,<br>\r\nI trust that you had an enjoyable Summer vacation and feel well rested ready for the coming year.<br>\r\nAs per Yeng procedure, it is time for your annual check up which, as always, I will be carrying out when it is possible to fit in with your inevitably busy schedule.<br>\r\nPlease let me know as early as possible when would be suitable to carry out the assessment.<br>\r\nIn the mean time, take care and I look forward to seeing you again soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiro Fukiyama<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough they had rarely seen each other, Jafit had always enjoyed the company of the school nurse when they had spent time together. With her new found confidence brimming inside of her, the prospect of partaking in the annual ritualistic health check was proving to be quite exciting. With a smile on her face and a warmth in her heart, Jafit took to replying to Shiro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am glad to hear from you Shrio,<br>\r\nMy Summer was very pleasant and I enjoyed the rest. I hope that your time away was also enjoyable with you working so hard all year round.<br>\r\nI am free for the rest of the day if you are able to fit me in at some point.<br>\r\nI look forward to seeing you soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJafit<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd send.<br>\r\nLeaning back into her chair, Jafit smiled as she hoisted her towel up slightly to maintain her dignity. Feeling entirely content with her current position, the Spaniard had to resist dozing off again so in order to fight it she took to her feet and padded to her bedroom to get dressed. Optimistic that the nurse would be able to see her that day, Jafit opted to dress accordingly which in this particularly moment meant light and skimpy. Despite her impressive physique and much to the surprise of others, the young chef had never frequented a gym but she was in possession of many items of gym wear that can only be described as worn ironically. With her towel now discarded on the floor and wandering completely naked, Jafit bent to look through one of her many drawers to find what she was looking for. As she looked she couldn't help but wiggle her arse as it peaked in the air and, even without its natural jiggle, the thickness of her lower half far exceeded her waist. Such curviness was ever more prominent in her current position.<br>\r\nAfter a moment of searching the chef was able to find what she was looking for; a matching set of gym shorts and sports bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWarm smile persisting, Jafit stood tall with garments in hand and proceeded to pose herself in front of her mirror again. In awe of her bulging naked form and with a slight sense of arousal building the tanned beauty started to dress herself, starting with her shorts. She lightly stepped into them and then proceeded to pull them up her shapely legs. The garment rose smoothly up her legs to a point but, just above her knees where her thighs started to thicken as they tapered out into her wide hips, things started to go a little less smoothly. Jafit felt the cuffs of the legs touch her thighs but continued to pull the shorts higher as they began to feel tighter around her luscious thighs. The closeness of her clothing was only building Jafit's arousal as she watched her shorts climb her legs in the mirror until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer shorts grew too tight almost instantly and the gentle pull that had got them so far was proving no longer successful. Gazing down her body, Jafit realised the shortfall and gave a much firmer pull. This allowed the shorts to slide a few more inches before sticking again, this time so close to the end but unable to stretch over her immense hips and inflated arse cheeks which were currently being squeezed tightly by the stretchy waistband of her shorts. Now, Jafit knew that her choice of outfit was for a much smaller woman as she had bought it some time early in her tenure at Buttercombe, but refused to let that break her determination, if nothing else she had a burning desire to see her body tightly encased in gym wear designed to accent her curveage. Grabbing onto the waistband of the shorts again, the voluptuous chef bit her lip and closed her eyes tightly as she started to pull again, delving deeply to overcome the problem...<br>\r\nAnd then suddenly, her hands shot sharply upwards and she felt a tight pressure around her lower half. Letting out a half moan laced in her Mediterranean accent, Jafit knew the shorts had risen the last jump up her legs. Breathing out softly with a gentle laugh and gazing over her bulging lower half Jafit was amazed at how amazing she looked. Lost in her own self adoration, she nearly missed the sound of her shorts tearing sharply. Shocked, a hand instantly short to her behind only to find no tear much to her surprise. It wasn't until she looked in the mirror again that she noticed the tear was running up the outside of her thighs up the seam of the shorts themselves, the strain had obviously proven too much and they had given way to allow some breathing space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLost in awe of her body, fingers trailing over the tear in her shorts it nearly flew her mind that she was only half dressed. Turning to grab the matching bra, Jafit noticed the small overhang forming around the lower portion of her stomach which protruded slightly over her tight waistband. With bra in hand and her huge boobs heaving from the exhilaration of her own body she posted her slender arms through the corresponding holes and lifted the shoulder straps over her head. And now the hard part. Bunching the material into a roll, Jafit slowly started to pull it down over her chest inch by inch. This time she watched as she slowly encased her upper body, the garment filling up gradually with her immense chest. As she continued her breath sharpened slightly, causing her chest to swell more but this seemed oddly ineffective at hindering her progress. So much so that, before she even realised, the bra was on. Mostly anyway. Posing for herself it was clear that the bra pinched slightly into her back and, due to the size of her chest as a whole, it was not able to form a tight fit around her stomach as it should with the fabric stretched so far to maintain her dignity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven more lost in her own self adoration, the Spaniard felt herself caressing her body gently with her fingertips dancing over her many inches of tanned skin. Moaning softly, Jafit was not aware of the external world until the sound of knocking echoed through her apartment.<br>\r\n\"Wonderful\" muttered Jafit softly to herself.<br>\r\nPractically skipping through the house, Jafit opened her door with great enthusiasm to welcome the nurse into her home.<br>\r\n\"Oh hello Miss Gamor, so glad we could meet so soon\" said Shiro Fukiyama, extending a hand out to the Spaniard before realising the skimpy nature of her outfit \"oh dear, I'm sorry, I'm not interrupting anything am I?\"<br>\r\n\"No, not at all, please come in\" cooed Jafit with excitement striding back in to welcome the nurse who sheepishly followed behind.<br>\r\nPart of her job meant that Shiro was not allowed to judge her clients but she couldn't help the twinge of shock as she watched her voluptuous friend jiggle through her living room. She used to be so thin, a beaming example in an otherwise rapidly expanding school environment AND she was in the cooking department. Such potential to help...<br>\r\n\"Would you like anything to refresh yourself?\" asked Jafit, standing proudly in front of her leather sofa with her delicate fingers holding her less than delicate hips.<br>\r\n\"Erm, no thank you, I won't have to stay too long\" replied Shiro, trying not to stare at her colleague.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe extremely thin nurse set her bag down and produced a tape measure, a set of scales and a blood pressure cuff.<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you remember how this goes now\" Shiro blankly said, entering her professional mode as she walked towards Jafit preparing to take some measurements for comparison.<br>\r\nFirst her height was collected, her usual 5'10<br>\r\nAnd then Shiro worked down her friends body, starting at her chest which caused Jafit to bubble with excitement, visibly shown in the swell of her breathing. Then Shiro moved onto the Spaniards sun kissed waist which led her to get uncomfortably close to Jafit's heaving bosom. Finally to complete the set a hip measurement was taken which actually garnered a noticeable look of surprise from the svelte nurse.<br>\r\nFollowing on from the measuring part of her check up Shiro set the scales before Jafit and signified for her to step forward. Beaming, the bulging chef gladly stepped forward and allowed her arm to be lifted to fit the blood pressure cuff.<br>\r\nDisappearing in her own head again, Jafit was drawn back by the sound of multiple beeps and instinctively stepped off of the scales.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, thank you for your patience Miss Gamor, all your checks are completed\" stated Shiro \"I must say, despite you having gained nearly 20lbs since last year and with your...proportions growing with some speed for a woman of your height your health is frankly immaculate\"<br>\r\nJafit couldn't help but smile widely at the news, bouncing slightly on her toes causing gentle quakes through her bulging assets above and below.<br>\r\n\"I must say Miss Gamor, you are actually in a better state of health then you were last year. I must ask, is your attire part of a gym regime?\" asked the nurse, curious at the improvements despite her colleagues weight gain.<br>\r\n\"Nope\" smiled the cooking tutor \"this is just me being comfy and happy\"<br>\r\n\"Very well\" said Shiro with a small smile \"well thank you for your time and I hope to see you less formally soon\"<br>\r\n\"That would be lovely\" cooed Jafit as she waved her friend goodbye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied beyond belief Jafit dropped herself onto the sofa heavily, curling her thighs up to her bum with a randy smile across her lips. She could enjoy this life. A lot.</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Jafit lounged on her sofa after the checkup from Shiro, she noticed the time. It was about two fifteen. While her cooking courses did not resume until tomorrow she did have her language class at three followed by a tutor session that evening. While she liked the pampered living at Buttercombe Jafit also had a stellar work ethic, not being one to rest on her laurels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough her fraying, ill-fitting gym clothes were suitably revealing for the budding exhibitionist's health checkup, Jafit knew they wouldn't do for teaching. She did have standards and didn't want to imagine what sort of scandal might form about the academy if she showed up to the classroom in such a revealing outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, even though she had awakened late in the day, Jafit didn't find herself that hungry. It probably had something to do with the supplement she had started on to help test for Yeng. Or the evidence of what had been a forgotten late night binge. Jafit understood her metabolism very well and decided to have a snack anyways as she got up to make some food in her kitchenette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarring the occasional indulgence, such as her first cooking class of the semester where she encouraged her students to go all out on their most familiar cuisines, Jafit owed much of her extraordinary health to her diet. Like any true chef she made her food from scratch whenever she could. It had only been during her own schooling at Buttercombe that the Israeli-Spainard had been introduced to overly processed foods. Her signature creations gathered key nutrients from real vegetables, complex whole grains, and natural fats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJafit fancied her natural fats, owing to the growth of her outrageous curves from her teenage years into full blown womanhood. In her kitchenette she prepared some slices of tomato paste and avocado toast (or <i>Pa amb tom\u00e0quet</i> in the case of the former). Each was doused generously with olive oil before Jafit bit into a crisp slice, letting the tomato and oil play across her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her apparent fullness, she had two slices of each for tomato and avocado. Clearing up the crumbs and remaining rubbish, the chef next had to sort out her wardrobe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as she was surprised at her recent weight gain, Jafit's increase in mass worried her less than the potential shrinkage of her wardrobe. Jafit was paid well at Buttercombe, of course, but she put most of her funds out of pocket for the cost of importing her favorite ingredients. Jafit favored as authentic of foods as possible. When she first came to Buttercombe as part of a culinary-cultural exchange back in her junior year she had been very shrewd on getting the tastes of home past customs. Jafit liked to dress well but didn't want to shell out for a new wardrobe just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTry as she might, she was starting to feel the effects of those extra nine pounds. While her undersized gym clothes had split her regular outfits were feeling a bit too snug. Two of her favorite skirts felt more like sausage casings so she instead opted for a pair of slimming slacks. Jafit was one of the rare Buttercombe teachers to wear belts, given her pinched waist, although she had to slacken the alligator leather by a few notches. Finding a blouse turned out to be a different issue as Jafit had forgotten to do laundry. There wouldn't be any time to clean her shirts so she was forced to wear a purple and black pinstripe shirt she didn't wear that often as it usually clashed with most of her other clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMind you, Jafit should have invested in an undershirt in order to keep the blouse presentable. Given how rarely she wore this shirt, every occasion when Jafit did button it up there would be another button to stubborn to remain closed as her immense breasts refused to be restrained. Luckily, the shirt had been off the rack of a plus sized display specifically designed for the top heavy, so Jafit soon found a means to achieve modesty after several minutes of adjustments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some gussying up, Jafit found that she had just enough time for another avocado toast before she went out for her Hebrew class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tzohorayeem toveem!\" Jafit eagerly greeted her afternoon class, after marking down the script (\u05e6\u05d4\u05e8\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd \u05d8\u05d5\u05d1\u05d9\u05dd \u05db\u05d9\u05ea\u05d4) on the chalkboard. A few of the girls repeated the greeting, rather crudely, although most were taken aback by the appearance of their teacher. Plenty had heard of the rumored smoking hot chef and her multicultural roots but the rumors did little to show how knockout of a bod the Mediterranean and Hebrew professor had compared to most of Buttercombe's faculty. Let alone the obliviousness of Jafit's great knockers having smudged her writing on the board, the chalk dust clinging to her pinstriped blouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I trust you all have your proper textbooks,\" Jafit clarified. \"Good. Open to page ten and we'll begin working through translating articles...\" Jafit paused to stretch out a trick in her back. All but the most studious of her young charges were focused on the strain of the Isreali-Spainard's bosom against the blouse buttons clinging together for dear life. For a long moment they sat in disbelief, yet nothing popped, and the thickly accented teacher launched into her lecture leaving many of the girls to scramble to catch up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJafit retired to her apartment after the tutor session, mostly aware of the attention she was getting from the student body. Jafit had always commanded attention through her cooking but she was beginning to relish the attention she got from her looks. Yet her students wouldn't be fawning over her for long if they didn't improve in the classroom. Eschewing the cafeteria, the chef returned home to prepare her cooking classes for the next day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJafit toured the full Mediterranean sea over her cooking semester. She would start in the northwest, having the students sample Spain's rich culinary history. Andalucia, Asturias, Basque, Catalonia and Valencia were just some of the regional cuisines they would have to master to get good marks in her class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jafit worked through her lesson plan she of course cooked. She had a hearty appetite, growing steadily heartier without her knowledge, as she prepared some traditional dishes for her class to sample the next day. Yet this was also her dinner, as Jafit continued to taste as she worked the skillet, the motion causing her breast to bob and sway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFavorites of hers included some fabada, or bean stew, bouillabaisse and pintxos which were like snack sandwiches. Only Jafit preferred to make the spiked pintxos with lamb owing to her israeli heritage. With several stew pots boiling and the skillet yet again sizzling it was starting to get steamy in Jafit's apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother Tuesday night, in other words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJafit had unhooked her bra and left all but the last two buttons of her purple blouse open as perspiration began to stick to her skin. The moisture moved down to her waist and juicy thighs as well, beginning to form damp patches underneath every curve of her breasts and plump ass cheeks. Rather than making her hot and bothered, Jafit was soon consumed by her appetite as she gave way to eating, setting the hot dishes on hotpads at the little dining table she could eat at the moment it came off the stove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belt had already been removed as Jafit tucked into the first stew. Her stew book had been her first hot selling cookbook when she had made a name for herself in international fusion cuisine. There was always room for stew in Jafit's eyes be it at the start or end of the meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fact that she intended these dishes to be shared with her class was forgotten as Jafit's hunger returned in full force. Food was best enjoyed when it was freshly prepared, and Jafit's body was a testament to how she enjoyed good cooking. She didn't consider her considerable poundage a crime, unlike some other celebrities. Jafit's debut had once been compared to english chef Nigella Lawson, only growing more zaftig with her hourglass curves unlike Nigella who had started slimming over the course of her career.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving put a mighty dent into the dishes, Jafit paused as she stroked her tender tummy, looking back to the cache of supplement Dr Hinamizawa had wanted her to test. Come to think of it, Jafit had felt far livelier and healthier after having tried the supplement, even before her positive diagnosis from Shiro Fukiyama. After all, Jafit ate healthily (if heavily in portions) so a nutritional supplement would only work more wonders for someone with a balanced diet. Right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJafit would have to think of a way to work the supplement into her classes tomorrow. So many of the girls at the academy were worried about their bodies, health and schooling. Far too much stress in their lives. If Jafit could help them by giving in this once with an additive to her recipes then so be it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Israeli-Spainard hoisted herself into a better sitting posture, ignorant of the hang of her rear over either side of her narrowing chair, as she got a second wind after adding some nearby supplement to another glass of milk. Amongst her many loves was her own cooking, as Jafit forgot about the intention of this feast as she enjoyed it herself into the night...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJafit awoke both impossibly full and hungry, yet she didn't find the juxtaposition disturbing. She was tingling with energy and sensual heat blossoming through her hefty assets. Surely this supplement was working wonders. Jafit never met a dish that wasn't calorie laden in her repertoire, such as her choice of breakfast that included at least a half dozen eggs at minimum. She also tried to remake some of the dishes she had intended to showcase during her classes, although tasting soon gave way to snacking even on top of her morning breakfast portions.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Jafit strolled into class a few minutes later than usual. There were a few reasons for this:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a01. Once again, she had slacked off on her laundry the previous night, electing to stuff herself instead. It took her a little bit to settle on an appropriate outfit, which ended up being more casual than she usually liked to present herself. She wore an old pair of khaki pants with a belt and a t-shirt she had bought on her summer trip to Japan from a couple years ago. Needless to say, these were a bit too small and left little to the imagination, hugging every curve tightly. She felt like a sausage, but a sexy sausage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a02. She ran into a former student, a girl named Alexis. She had a quick question for Jafit about cooking chili con carne, which she was happy to answer; in grad school she had taken an entire class on Tex-Mex cuisine and could practically cook chili with her eyes closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0and the most dramatic use of time, 3. She was extremely hungry. Despite having a rather large breakfast even for her, Jafit's stomach quickly receded in size and protested all the way to campus, growling and gurgling like a dog with rabies. Since she didn't have time to go home and cook some more, she took a rare trip to the school's robust cafeteria and picked up a thick double bacon cheeseburger, a side of fries, and a coke. Not as sophisticated as she would have liked, but oh well. Sometimes food is food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a010 minutes late, Jafit greeted the class, who were talking amongst themselves, and apologized for her lateness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I had a meeting that went a little over and I had to grab a bite. Take out your textbooks and open to page 28. We'll be starting on Spain today, a country with a very rich food culture.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After a rushed primer on the Andalusian region and introduction to this week's dish, gazpacho, Jafit sat down at her desk at the front of the room and let the class work on the recipe. In the meantime, she would finally be able to chow down on her burger and fries. She ate like a woman possessed, practically inhaling the greasy sandwich in a matter of minutes. And, oh my god, was that burger delicious. On first bite, it was like she saw heaven. A higher power had revealed itself to her in the form of a cheeseburger. How had she been sleeping on this for so long? All that time and effort spent at home making stews and sushi and fancy lemon chicken when right under her nose was the nectar of the gods in this cafeteria. She had to have more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Jafit called down one her students who seemed trustworthy to her desk, a rather chubby girl named Judy. She handed her her meal card. She whispered, \"Judy, dear, can you go down to the cafeteria and get me four double bacon cheeseburgers? It's for class research. I'm thinking about adding a unit on them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Judy, of course, obliged. In those tense few minutes, Jafit absentmindedly chowed down on french fries and sipped her coke, unable to shake the taste of that absolutely heavenly burger. She licked her lips and placed a hand on her slightly taut stomach, amazed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Soon, Judy returned, burgers in tow. She placed the bag and card on the desk and informed the hungry woman that they threw another burger and a large order of fries in for free. Judy saw Jafit's pupils expand briefly when she said that, like she just saw someone she loved. Jafit sweetly thanked Judy and began round two of her lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Three and a half burgers and half the fries later, the bell sounded and class ended. Jafit quickly stood from her chair, mouth covered in barbecue sauce, and began an announcement:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'll see you all *uurrrp* tomorro- er, Friday. Be sure to bring your A-game, we'll be go-*gwurrrrrrp* going over more of *urp* Spain\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Jafit sat back down once the students had left, unfazed by that embarrassing series of belches (though teachers burping mid-sentence was not something Buttercombe's students weren't used to) and the fact that her shirt was riding up pretty much the entire time she was standing. She was more focused on her food, which she could now enjoy in peace. She unbuckled her belt, unzipped her pants, let out a loud, deep belch, and dug back in, moaning and groaning as she inhaled all her food in record time.</span></div></div>",

A tiny, lithe thing, Angela had been working for the school for a good 15 years now, and she was exceedingly good at her job. She made sure the food got made and put out for everyone to enjoy, but also kept the students in line if they got a little... rowdy.

Angela exited the cloaked back room of the kitchen into its buffet-style front with a restock of bacon to discover something that she had absolutely seen before: a tall woman with a large ass bent over the mac and cheese bin, shoveling handfuls into her mouth. She must have just wandered in, staff was practically non-existent at this hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Angela loudly cleared her throat and the woman quickly swiveled around, revealing a stuffed pot belly hanging out of unzipped, unbuckled pants and an embarrassed face with cheese and slight barbeque sauce residue around the mouth. However, to Angela's surprise, this was not a student. She was clearly a faculty member.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Angela, sternly with her hands on her hips asked, \"Who are you, and what are you doing eating my macaroni and cheese?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Clearly flustered, the woman responded, \"Hi! Uh, I'm Jafit Gamor, I'm the, uh, cooking teacher. I'm surprised we haven't met before, are you the chef here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"My official title is 'head of kitchen' but I guess. Again, why are you eating my macaroni and cheese?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I'm really really sorry, uh, I didn't catch your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Angela.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Angela. I'm sorry Angela. I came down here because I... er, one of my students had the most HEAVENLY burger they've ever eaten and they wanted me to come ask for a recipe, but the macaroni just looked so delicious! Ha. I apologise again. If there's anything I can do to make it right I'll do it.\" Nice save Jafit. Wouldn't want the nice kitchen lady to think you're anything less than a sophisticated, independent woman, huh?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Angela took her hands off her hips and sighed. \"Don't worry about it. It would have been a problem if you were a student but since you're faculty I'll let it slide this time. But if I see you back here again with your face in my food like a pig with a trough, I'm talking to Polluck. Is that clear, Miss Gamor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Crystal clear. And call me Jafit, please. Miss Gamor always makes me think of my stud-BWOOOOORP.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0There was an awkward silence in the kitchen. Jafit put a hand on her bulging stomach and looked at Angela like a deer in headlights. So much for sophistication, I guess. She muttered a breathy \"excuse me\", eyes darting away from Angela's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Angela broke the silence, preferring to overlook the outburst. \"Well Jafit, as to your student's question about the burger recipe, I'm afraid I won't be able to answer it. Actually, nothing on the menu here is my own. They're all trade secrets of the Yeng Corporation. I'm sure you understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh, uh, okay then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah. I'm sorry, if I was able to tell you I would but they have this stuff locked down tight. I need a fingerprint just to get in the prep room, see?\" She gestures without looking toward the door to the back room. \"Now, if you excuse me, I have to get back to work. If you have any other questions don't just come in here. Find me or ask to see me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Okay, thanks for talking to me, Angela. It was nice meeting you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Angela had already begun to walk away. \"Yeah, you too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0On her walk back to her room, questions swirled in Jafit's mind. Why does Yeng own the recipes for the greasy cafeteria food? Why do they keep it so under wraps? Why is it so goddamn good? Why couldn't she help herself around that macaroni and cheese? Why did that burp make her feel so... hot and tingly? And why was she craving aerosol can cheese right then?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As Jafit continued on Dr. Hinamizawa's supplement, she found herself falling into a routine on weekdays. She would wake up in the morning and prepare herself something \"healthy\" to start her day: perhaps a smorgasbord of eggs or a big savory bowl of oatmeal along with her supplement pill. Then she'd go in to work. She had three periods of class every day: cooking on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays or Hebrew and Study Hall on Tuesdays and Thursdays.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0In between the first two periods and the last two periods was lunch. Not having enough time to prepare herself a true dish and almost always being extremely hungry by then, Jafit would often elect to visit the cafeteria, pile the greasy food onto a plate and go up to her office to eat. Despite her always positive demeanor and beautiful exterior, she was a true introvert, not being particularly close with any of her colleagues and preferring to have a bit of alone time for her lunch hour. And what an hour it was! The cafeteria food was becoming the guiltiest of pleasures for Jafit, her oncoming lunchtime feast occupying her mind every minute of the morning. The pulled pork, the french fries, the macaroni and cheese, the fried chicken, the pizza, and oh GOD the burgers were some of the best food she had in her entire life. From someone who had toured the world multiple times, sampling the best dishes from the greatest chefs of her generation, this was extremely high praise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After lunch, Jafit would change her clothes (What? Jafit gets very sweaty when she eats this kind of food. It's not that weird... Right?) and go to third period. Afterwards, she'd go back to her office for office hours, grade some papers, pop another supplement, and go home to wind down. She'd proceed to put on the TV, flop on the couch and decide what to do for dinner, the choice of which depended on how lazy she wanted to be. Before getting on the supplement Jafit almost always cooked herself something new for dinner, either an new spin on an old dish or something completely fresh. Post-suppliment, however, Jafit found herself less adventurous in her food choices. The more food she could make with less effort was the best. Often she elected to order delivery, getting large amounts of pizza or fast food from UberEats to her door and devouring every scrap before ordering more. Every night she'd down a whole box of wine and a tub of ice cream for dessert, then pass out hopefully in her bed, sometimes on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0This is how it was. This lifestyle obviously was having consequences, but not really on her waistline. Sure, Jafit had gained a bit of belly pudge, but her tum was never close to how big it gets during a binge. No, the damage was almost exclusively on her T&amp;A. Her breasts were noticably bigger and fuller than they were before, spilling uncomfortably out of the tops of all her bras like over-raised muffins. Her shirts would get stuck covering her boobs, uncovering another kind of jiggly muffin top around her waist, and her blouses would outright require for cleavage to be shown as it was a pain to get all of her buttons buttoned, not that Jafit had any problem with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But her butt... Oh Lord, her butt. Jafit had ripped three pairs of jeans, two pencil skirts, and four sets of panties in the past two weeks. She thought this was the work of the new dryers that had been installed in her dormitory's laundry closet. This was not the case. Obviously. Jafit's ass, once a booty that demanded attention, was now a black hole that sucked any innocent bystander's gaze directly to its perfectly round form. Any bottom clung mercilessly to every contour and curve of her butt, leaving absolutely nothing to imagination. To call it a bubble butt would be an understatement, it stuck out behind her like a taut, overfilled, oversized water balloon. Her thighs became much thicker as well, her fat but somehow still toned legs being her third-best feature. Even with the extra pounds, though, Jafit didn't have a single hint of cellulite. This was one of the big reasons Jafit didn't realize the gravity of her weight gain, but I digress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The day Jafit realized how fat she had gotten was a Thursday. It was the day of the first exam for Hebrew class, so she was ready for a more relaxed day of work. After study hall and her first Hebrew period, Jafit enjoyed a typically big lunch, today a huuuuge helping of spaghetti and meatballs along with 7 big pieces of garlic bread and a couple regular sized bottles of root beer. Sweaty and bloated, but nearly always dressed to impress, she went to change into a grey pantsuit from her office closet. The deep v-neck undershirt and coat came on easy enough, just gotta leave some buttons unbuttoned of course. But then the slacks. These slacks had been giving Jafit trouble recently, especially around her bountiful booty, but she managed to get them on after a little bit of jumping and pulling. After a quick belly rub and some unladylike belches, she could even get them zipped and buttoned too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Jafit did some model poses in front of her newly installed office mirror. She thought something like, \"God, what a sexy beast you are, Jafit. Your co-workers are so damn jealous of your figure.\" Then, she realized it. She forgot the belt! Ugh, so glad she caught that. What would my reputation as this school's sophisticated fashionista be if she forgot the belt? Oh, and there it was, on the floor of the closet. Gotta just bend over and-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0*SHRRIP*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Oh no. Not again. Jafit rushed back over to the mirror to discover that her pants had a giant rip in their seat, exposing her little pink panties wedged up her crack, as they usually were. Shit. She couldn't wear this. Not at all. And she didn't have anything nearly as snazzy as that pantsuit in the closet, all of the clothes were either dirty and sweated through, as today was laundry day, or way too casual for... wait. Just then, Jafit saw some workout clothes in the closet and got an absolutely brilliant idea. She quickly put them on and rushed down to the cafeteria for a quick bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Good afternoon, everyone!\", Jafit greeted the class, striding into the room 5 minutes late in a sweat-stained wife-beater, a visible, straining sports bra, and little grey shorts that only covered 2/3rds of her ginormous ass. \"I apologise for my attire today. Instead of having lunch I elected to take a run instead. Gotta stay healthy if you want to be a chef!\" Her vastly bloated belly fooled no one, but nobody spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Then, she remembered something. Some of the students had bakery items on their desks. Shit. A few days ago, Jafit had told her class a fun exercise she had planned: since she was the cooking teacher, if you brought in a dessert you baked, you'd get 5-10 points of extra credit on your test based on how good of a job you did. And there they were, about half the class had taken her up on this offer. Cookies, brownies, cupcakes, one student who had been struggling baked a damn pumpkin pie. Great. And she had to eat these to grade them. She could do that at home tonight but... they look... really good. Shit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Jafit passed out the tests and the students passed up their baking. She wedged herself into her swivel desk chair. The room was quiet. The food smelled SO good. Well, she guessed it was time to dig in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a030 minutes later, Jafit's belly was roaring for mercy, stretched against the elastic of her shorts. Only a few brownies were left, the rest of the food demolished in record time. Sweatier than she was when she entered the room, Jafit slumped down in her chair, defeated. This was the most full she ever was, and a little voice in the back of her head told her that all of those calories would be going STRAIGHT to her ass and thighs. God, that's... hot? Jafit's pupils dielated. She thought about her bulbous butt. She thought about a man kissing her behind while another one fed her the last few brownies. Oh no. She thought about ripping her pants earlier. She couldn't be doing this now, she's in class! But she can't stop. She has to go the bathroom. She needed to get it out of her system<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Jafit stands up, but her bottom is wedged tight in the chair. There's a silence as every pair of eyes in the room go straight for the scene in front of them. Here was the thought process:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0First, panic. \"Oh my God this is embarrassing, I can't believe this is happening to me, how am I gonna get my butt out of this? Do I need to ask for help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Then, realization. \"Wait. My ass fit perfectly in this chair a couple weeks ago. My clothes haven't been shrinking. I got FAT. Holy shit I need to work this off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Then... \"God, my butt is huge. Imagine what they'd think at the gym. Some cute guy might come up to me and... ask me out cause he thinks I'm cute... and touch me and feed me and... wait... shit. I need to talk to someone once I get out of this. Shit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0What does Jafit do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Okay. I'm going to need you to grab the desk as hard as you possibly can, Jafit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJafit had never dreamed she'd be in this situation. Cold baby oil on her rump and thighs, leaning over a desk while a skinny Japanese woman was about to rip a chair off her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Read-URP!\" The way she was standing, her belly was squished, making it hard to hold in the gas she had been holding in all of third period.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One... Two... THREE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiro yanked hard on the chair, only freeing Jafit's booty a little bit from it's hard plastic prison. Shiro wiped some sweat from her brow and stepped back. \"Are you doing okay? I'm going to have to pull again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do it quick!\" Jafit bit her lip. She never did get to go to the bathroom. She belched again, this one smaller than the last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiro gripped the chair once more, steadying her legs and cracking her neck. \"One... Two... THREE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chair came right off this time. Shiro stumbled back, letting go of the surprisingly heavy chair which fell to the ground with a loud crash. Jafit uttered a moan of relief, standing upright for the first time in something like 80 minutes, stretching her back and raising her arms to the ceiling. Shiro, concerned if someone had heard the chair's fall, quickly poked her head out of her office door. Nobody around. Good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiro sighed, letting her hands drop to her side. \"Are you okay, Jafit? Was that rough?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm okay. The sides of my butt are a little... raw but the oil helped. Thank you so much.\" Jafit, now facing Shiro, rubbed her hips for a second and went in for a big hug, sports bra-clad breasts and now much smaller tummy enveloping Shiro's stick-thin body. She was happy to help a friend, especially one that gives such great hugs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey pulled away from each other. Shiro smiled a toothy smile, her perfectly white teeth glistening. \"So, now that THAT'S over with, why don't you have a seat? Let me tidy up a little bit and we can chat, okay?\" Jafit nodded and smiled back as Shiro moved the collapsed swivel chair to the side, replacing it with the chair she typically had in front of her desk. Even though it had no arms or sides on it, Jafit was still apprehensive to sit down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiro moved some of things that had been on her desk before Jafit's interruption back, and opened her blinds once more, letting some natural light back into the fluorescent-lit office. She sat down behind the desk, looking back briefly on her view through the second-story window of the underutilized athletic field. \"Gosh, it's a nice day. I wish I was out there today instead of in here!\" Shiro chuckled. \"Now, what did you want to talk about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Jafit swallowed, \"I think I've gained a lot of weight in a pretty short amount of time, and I'm not sure why.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurse looked her over. \"Yeah, you are looking a little bigger. Do you know how much you've put on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I haven't weighed myself in a couple weeks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, why don't you go ahead and step on the scale over there and we'll weigh you.\" Jafit and Shiro went over to the big scale on the other side of the office, Shiro stopping briefly to retrieve Jafit's file from the cabinet. The buxom teacher stood nervously on the scale as Shiro adjusted the weights on the top. After reading the result, she stopped, looked at Jafit's file, and back at the result again. \"This can't be right. Can you step off and step back on again?\" Gulp. The process was repeated, the same result given. Shiro exhaled. \"...Okay. Come over and have a seat again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the desk, Shiro scrutinized the file before her. Jafit could feel her pulse pounding in her neck. \"Well Jafit, when I last weighed you at the start of the semester for your check-up you weeeeere... 199 pounds. Now you're 248.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe eyes nearly shot out of Jafit's skull. Her jaw dropped. \"Two hundred... forty...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eight, yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God.\" That's AWFUL... and sexy. No! It's awful, Jafit! Awful!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, there could be a few causes for this. Do you mind if we do another check-up, to rule out anything... malignant?\" Shiro gestured to the thin-paper covered exam table in the back corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a good rigamarole and lots of testing with both high-tech Yeng gadgetry and good old-fashioned nursing instruments, the two women were back at the desk. Once again, Shiro studied the results. \"You're still in perfect health, Jafit, despite your weight gain. Uhh, the only thing I noticed is that you've actually gained an inch of height. You're five foot eleven now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJafit, still slack-jawed from that number reveal, became even more confused. \"Am I having a growth spurt, then? Second puberty?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I... I don't think so. People only have puberty once. While I can't explain your new inch, I think your problem might be more psychological than physical. How is your diet? Has it changed at all? Are you on any new medications you haven't disclosed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJafit licked her lips. Oops. Here's the problem, right there. \"Wellll, I,\" she cleared her throat, \"I've been eating a lot more than usual lately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh.\" She scribbled on a pad of paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it's because I've been REALLY hungry, Shiro! It's really weird! I used to be good with, like, 2 full meals a day and a small breakfast. Now I have to eat 4 meals a day, sometimes 5 on the weekend, to keep my stomach from growling like a monstruo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiro took Jafit's hand. \"Calm down, I understand. I'm here to help, as a nurse and as a friend, not to judge. Are you on any new medications?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, just a supplement that Dr. Hinamizawa gave to me.\" Jafit's eyes narrowed in suspicion. \"She said it was some kind of new healthy vitamin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. I'm going to get on the phone and speak to the vice principal right now, just to be sure if there are any side effects, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJafit nodded. Shiro picked up the receiver and dialed. \"Yes, this is Shiro Fukiyama. I'd like to speak with Dr. Hinamizawa please. Arigatou.\" Shiro began a conversation in Japanese on the phone. Unfortunately, the always curious cook could barely understand a lick of the language, much to her chagrin. Her thoughts drifted off. Two hundred. Forty. Eight. DAMN she had let herself go. It must be all the cafeteria food. All those fries and onion rings and... cheeseburgers... Or maybe it's all the pizzas she's been ordering. Wonder what the pizza delivery guy thinks when he brings three large pizzas and some breadsticks and some... mmm... cookie cake... Does he look forward to seeing her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiro snapped her fingers at the drooling woman in front of her. \"Jafit! Snap out of it! Are you listening?\" Her trance was broken. She looked the nurse in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, what, dear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said I just talked to Dr. Hinamizawa and she told me that it couldn't possibly be her supplements. She said that you're not nearly the only one who has been using it and you're the only one showing these kinds of side effects. You're taking them twice a day, correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, correct. I've been taking them as capsules with water though instead of in food, would that cause, uh, this?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I don't think so. Fukuda also told me that she's going to be sending a new batch for you with a courier as you should be running out by now and not to forget to incorporate them in your dishes in class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, can you tell her as much as I tried, the supplement doesn't really work in anything. I've tried, the texture is really weird. That's why I take them in dissolvable capsules.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'll tell her that next time I see her. Now,\" Shiro firmly smacked the wooden desk and leaned in, \"here's my idea. I'm putting you on an exercise plan. Since your body is intaking so many calories, you're going to have to work them off. You don't get much exercise, no?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, no. Work gets in the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Work doesn't get in the way,\" Shiro smiles real big and points at her friend, \"YOU get in the way. Your attitude. Here's what I'm gonna do.\" She scribbles an address on a Post-It note, removes it from the stack and gives it to Jafit. \"This is my apartment. It's off-campus. There's a gym there for residents and I can bring a guest. This weekend go buy some gym clothes that fit and meet me there after work on Monday. I can request private time at the front desk and they won't let anybody else in. It'll be a safe space, just the two of us. I'll show you a routine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJafit's excitement was through the roof. \"Really? That sounds fantastic! I'd love to!\" She popped out of her chair, ran around the desk, and gave the seated Shiro another massive hug, not realizing her oversized breasts were squishing against her face. \"Thank you so much, I mean it.\" Shiro uttered a muffled \"you're welcome\" and the enthusiastic woman released her. \"Oops. Heh heh. Gave you a little boob there\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiro was unimpressed. \"Yeah. I'll see you Monday. This will be fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJafit began walking out of the office. \"Can't wait to work this ass off!\" She playfully gave it a smack, directly followed by a barely-audible, instinctive moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking down the hall to the stairs, the only thing Jafit was thinking about was when she slapped her ass a few moments ago. She looked behind her. No one. She looked back in front of her. Nobody. Well, here goes nothing. Jafit smacked her booty again, harder this time. She felt the waves of her fat's jiggle, heard the noise reverberate down the empty hall. She thought about the delivery boy doing it, carrying a stack of large pepperoni pizzas through her apartment door. She thought of her tongue in his mouth, him fondling the baby fat on her sides. She thought of her voluptuous body on top of his, pizza in one hand while she grinded her hips... Oh no. Jafit ran to the bathroom. She couldn't take it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jafit heaved herself out of her Toyota Prius, taking in the sight of the luxury apartment complex that Shiro pointed her to. It had to be one of the newest and fanciest in the greater Wellington area, a shining, modernist, five story monument to wealth, decadence, and around-the-clock exterior maintenance. Seriously, it seemed like the building's white facade had nary a speck of dirt on it and every window glimmered in the sun. How much was Shiro making at Buttercombe, anyway?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJafit had left campus early today to prepare for this big day. Even though the gym was a staple of many people's lives, Jafit had never actually gone to one before. Back when she lived with her family in Barcelona, she would often go on jogs by the sea in the early morning and watch the sunrise over the water, eliminating the need for a real gym habit. However, upon moving to America she fell out of this routine. With work taking up her time and the fact that Wellington wasn't nearly as beautiful as her home city, it was quite an easy fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJafit made two stops on her way to the apartment, which she now stepped inside through its automatic revolving door. The first stop was to her own apartment to change. She had gone on a shopping spree on Saturday, picking up all sorts of new garments for her fuller form. One of these, which she was currently wearing, was a two-piece late-80s or early 90s inspired gym outfit, black with hot pink accents and tights. It was a size too small maybe, but it was just too cute to pass up. The only thing that mattered was that the top restrained her tits, which had proven to have a mind of their own lately. While the bottom fabric clung tightly to her butt, as most things did, and the midriff gap between the two pieces let out a decent roll of chub, she thought it looked great on her, and it really really did. Pink was a surprisingly great color for Jafit and it contrasted nicely with her barely-brown skin. With it she had tied her short-ish hair up into a little ponytail with a matching pink scrunchie and around her waist was a fanny pack which she had filled liberally with Hershey's kisses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJafit's second stop was to McDonald's for some drive-thru fast food. Entering the gym, in her hand was a classic paper bag containing her typical order: twenty nuggets, two cheeseburgers, two Quarter Pounders with cheese, a Big Mac, three large fries, and four apple pies. In her other hand was a drink carrier holding a large Sprite, Coke, and Dr. Pepper. Jafit was always embarrassed by her large fast food orders, so she'd try to make it look like she was ordering for a few different people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gym was robust and, as Shiro had assured, totally empty, with a sign on the door saying it had been reserved. It contained all manner of equipment: treadmills, benches with weights, a rowing machine, exercise balls of various sizes, you get the picture. Balancing on top of one of these exercise balls was Shiro, patiently waiting. In contrast to Jafit's shocking curves and soft... everything, Shiro was a total hardbody. She sported a robust six pack, most of the muscles on her body clearly defined. While her chest sported barely anything to speak of, Shiro had a firm, round butt, clearly the result of a strict regiment of squats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the two of them recognized each other, Shiro's happiness to see her friend outside of work was slightly dampened by the McDonald's. The first thing that came out of her mouth was a playful but disappointed \"Jafiiiit! You seriously brought fast food to the gym?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girl's gotta eat, Shiro!\" She patted her lightly padded middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two embraced briefly, after which Shiro glanced at the food Jafit had placed on a lifting bench. \"Well just remember you're here to LOSE weight, not gain it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay, I know. What are we doing today, then? Is it leg day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we'll start with cardio. It's self-explanatory, I won't have to teach you anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a fast learner!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiro strode past Jafit, lightly tapping her on the shoulder. \"I know you are. Let's do some running.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the sake of time, let's run through some of the highlights of the workout:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-The two started on the treadmills. Jafit was a natural, booty bouncing in her tight leggings like a jello pillow tumbling down a staircase. She tired out quickly, though, and took a food break to wolf down her quarter pounders and chug the Sprite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-They moved to the bikes. The small seat was uncomfortable for Jafit, for obvious reasons. They decided to skip them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-On the stair climber, Shiro noticed that Jafit had been removing and subsequently eating chocolates from her fanny pack. Upon question from Shiro, Jafit burped and changed the subject to Shiro's apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-While waiting for Shiro to be done on the gym's singular rowing machine, Jafit downed an entire 10 piece McNugget in one mouthful. This was very impressive and kind of weirdly turned her on, but nobody else saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Shiro tried to get Jafit to jump rope. She was unsuccessful. Jafit went to jog on the treadmill instead, taking some fries with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, by the end of the workout, Shiro was revitalized and pumped and Jafit was totally pooped and full of greasy fast food. She had eaten her whole double family-sized order over the course of the 90 minutes, her stuffed belly squashing uncomfortably over the elastic of her tights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiro wiped sweat off her forehead. \"Whew! Well, that was a start, wasn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah-*bwuuurp* yeah it was. I wanna... relax.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you wanna hit the sauna, sweat it out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so they hit the sauna, which the apartment gym somehow had. Jafit resembled a cavewoman who had been feeding on mammoth, having to use two towels as a makeshift bikini. She sat down the bench from Shiro, massaging her overtaxed stomach, unstifled belches erupting from her mouth as it went down in size. Shiro was fascinated by the way her belly receded so quickly after such a huge meal, but she didn't say anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJafit broke the relative silence. \"Shiro?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Jafit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think I'm sexy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question caught Shiro off guard. \"I, uh, I'm sorry Jafit, I... I don't swing that way. I thought you knew that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJafit was surprised at her response. \"Oh, no, no, no! I don't mean it THAT way! I just... It's just... I've been having a lot of thoughts lately. About my body. And I'm not sure if I'm actually sexy or... not. Do you know what I mean? You know I put on a lot of weight recently. Like, am I still hot?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... Jafit, if you think you're sexy, then you're sexy. It doesn't matter what other people think. Do you think you're sexy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJafit thought for a minute, even though she knew the answer deep down. \"Yeah. I think I'm sexy. I think I'm really, really sexy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good! That's a great attitude to have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a pause in the air. It seemed like the steam had stopped and the sweat had gone dry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jafit, I'm gonna ask you a personal question. Is that okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, go ahead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When was the last time you went out with a guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow. Uh, it was in Barcelona. That was... a while ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you guys... you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're asking if we fucked?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJafit laughed. \"All the time. God, he was great. I miss him a lot. We broke up... a year or so before I came to America.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you given any thought in getting back into dating?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, a lot. It's just, finding the time for a relationship is really hard for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't have to be a relationship!\" Shiro scooched closer to Jafit on the bench. She could feel the heat radiating from her body. Gosh, that's a warm girl. \"When I came here to Wellington from San Francisco, I was really lonely and had a weird relationship with my body. Seeing all the fat, er, curvy girls at Buttercombe was so strange to me. All my family and my friends were so thin out West, and here it just made me feel inadequate, y'know? Like, my flat chest wasn't enough, really. But, you know what I did?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I started putting myself out there. I got on dating apps and stuff, went out to clubs, had a lot of short flings. All my adolescent life my, you know, traditional parents told me that I shouldn't be promiscuous, stick with a boyfriend for a while, be back home by 11, prepare for marriage, that kinda stuff. But, having casual sex, it boosted my self esteem a lot! Most of these men were so great, they made me feel great, sometimes made me feel POWERFUL. You should try it, really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, I'll consider it. Thank you, Shiro. I really appreciate it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem Jafit. You can come to me whenever you need advice or... anything! I'm here for you. Really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night, Jafit laid on the couch in her brand new underwear, half-eaten ice cream sandwich in her hand. She had been daydreaming for the past hour about what Shiro told her, just getting together with a guy for a date or two, sleeping together... and shoving ice cream sandwiches down her throat and fondling her tits... Yeah. She took a big bite. She'll prove she's sexy. Without a doubt.</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Luigi's Pizza was not the most popular pizzeria in Wellington. The establishment had stiff competition: the big chains like Pizza Hut, Domino's, and Papa John's, Yeng's venture into the pizza market fittingly titled Yeng Pizza and Subs, and other local locations such as Tommy's and Mama Maria's. But, it was the best. Still sticking with the recipes used by genuine pizza master Luigi Capritti when he hopped off a boat from Italy and created the restaurant all the way back in 1917. It was for sure the foodie's choice, and there wasn't a bigger foodie in the Wellington area than Jafit Gamor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, it wasn't just the prospect of excellent pizza that kept Jafit's business. She had her eye on her frequent delivery boy whose name she didn't even know. She didn't even know why she was so attracted to him. Maybe it was the shape of his head subconsciously reminding her of her father and those days she spent with him in Israel as a little girl. Maybe it was his facial hair, so perfectly groomed to accentuate his jawline. Or maybe it was the way his body looked in his uniform. But, between you and me, it was probably Jafit's association with him and all those delicious pizzas she had shoved so eagerly down her gullet, like one of Pavlov's dogs. In any case, Jafit was head-over-heels for the dude, and she'd be ashamed to confess his regular apparences in her most shameful sexual fantasies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis Thursday, Graham Wilson, the pizza guy in question, was working his standard late shift at Luigi's as their sole delivery driver. Graham had been working there for not that long now and quite enjoyed it for what it was. An aspiring novelist, he had been using Luigi's as a flow of income while he lived with his parents and tried to get his writing career going. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a typically slow night and Graham was shooting the shit with his co-workers when a familiar, classic ticket showed up for delivery. 4 large pizzas: one plain, one pepperoni, one buffalo chicken, and one veggie lover's, all with extra cheese and extra sauce. 3 bags of breadsticks. An order of cinnamon sticks. A small cookie cake. Two 2 liters of Coke. All to be delivered to that private school up the hill, to one Jafit Gamor. These orders were typically bi-weekly for Luigi's, and some of the oddest for Graham. Despite the huge quantities of food, he knew for a fact that this lady was DEFINITELY eating all of it. He didn't judge, though. She was nice enough, always tipped well, and to say she was a sight for sore eyes would be an understatement. She always showed up to the door scantily clad in some way, letting Graham take a quick peek at her almost inhuman body. He looked forward to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter approaching the door of the address with the mountain of food, Graham somehow rung the doorbell with his elbow. He heard stomping from behind the door, and it swung open to reveal an eager Jafit, clad in a low-cut tank top showing off a tight canyon of soft cleavage, a blue flannel, and some worn-out blue jeans that had definitely seen better days. She happily greeted him with an accent he couldn't place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi! Are these for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure are!\" He groaned, all this stuff was getting pretty heavy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay! Come in, you can set them on the table here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGraham followed behind Jafit, eyes practically glued to her wide hips, shifting as she walked, bouncing her buttocks within the tight denim. Suddenly, his nose was permeated by an incredible scent from the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that smell?\" He just had to ask as he placed the pizzas etc. down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" Jafit laughed, slightly nervously. The words spilled out her mouth like an open hydrant. \"I'm, like, a, uhm, cooking teacher! I'm trying out some new dishes tonight with a new ingredient or supplement that I haven't been able to get really right. I've got chicken marsala, some spaghetti, salmon, and some lamb chops cooking, lots of new seasoning, too! Want a bite, once it's done?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile curious why someone would want to order so much pizza with all that delicious smelling food already on the stove, Graham didn't press. He had to be on his way. \"I'm sorry, I'd love to but I've gotta get back to the store. Maybe another time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mood undampened, Jafit replied \"Oh, no worries! Do I have to, uh, sign anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so the transaction was completed and Graham was back on his way with a tip almost as generous as Jafit's portions seemed to be. And yet, she wasn't quite done with him yet.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Hi, Jafit? Yeah, this is Alex at Luigi's. We just got a repeat order from you, the exact thing you ordered about an hour ago. We were just checking if you meant to submit it or if it was a mistake. Ah, okay. Yeah, we were just checking. It's okay. We'll have it out for you as soon as we can. Okay, thanks. Bye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex, the night manager, hung up the phone. Large orders weren't unusual at Luigi's, but this was highly unusual. And the woman on the phone sounded like she had food in her mouth the whole time, too. Weird. Whatever. It was a slow night and business was business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGraham once again arrived at Jafit's door with a payload of food, once again contorting himself to ring the doorbell with his elbow, and once again the door swung open to reveal Jafit in all her glory. But, this time it was different. The first, most obvious thing Graham noticed was that she had removed her flannel and tank top, leaving her in just an overtaxed, frilly, red bra and the jeans, still holding out, though they had been unbuttoned and unzipped. This, of course, was to make room for the second thing Graham noticed: her belly. While an hour ago Jafit's midsection was nothing to write home about, a simple bridge between her upper spheres and lower spheres, it had now become a sphere of its own. It looked like she had swallowed an oversized bowling ball and washed it down with a couple gallons of milk, jutting forth like a car crashed through an electronics store window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiiiiii!\" She sounded a little drunk. \"Is this for... little old me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGraham was surprised and slightly confused. \"Uh, yep, it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a hand out from behind her back to reveal a slice of the pepperoni pizza, half-eaten. She said \"hang on a sec\" and proceeded to stuff the food into her mouth, chewing and swallowing in that single bite. She gently put a hand to her engorged stomach. \"You're just on time. I'm all finished with the last batch you sent me.\" She giggled and showed Graham in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe apartment looked like a tornado hit it. While just an hour ago it had been positively spotless, now pizza boxes and empty soda bottles littered the couch and chairs, various soiled plates and silverware adorned the coffee table, and some fast food bags and takeout containers sat on the floor. From the kitchen, the smell was still present, food continuing to sizzle in pots and pans. Following her once again, Graham's eyes were now tied to her back at the fat cutting into her bra straps and clasp. He also noticed she was positively pouring with sweat, even though the temperature outside was a bit chilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGraham tried to make light small talk as he placed the pizza on the table. \"I'm surprised you're still cooking in there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeaaaaaah.\" She laughed with a snort. \"All these recipes, they aren't working! I've tried so many tonight but the texture... So weiiird!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJafit's belly grumbled like a steel door opening. She help up a finger in the air. \"Oh. Listen to this.\" She closed her eyes and emitted one of the loudest belches Graham had ever heard in his life. The bass practically rattled the plates on the coffee table behind them. Then she leaned in and said, sultrily, \"Ahhhhhhh. Excuuuuse me. I've been doing those all night, baby. OUURP. Wish I had someone here to... coax those out of this...\" She rubbed her belly and laughed again, leaning back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGraham was, if anything, incredibly confused. Not particularly aroused, but very, very confused. She was obviously hitting on him, which any other day would have been the time of his life, but this food stuff was... weird. Not entirely unexpected in hindsight, but still. He still was at a loss for words when Jafit pulled a breadstick from a bag and sensually chomped in. Then, realization hit her, mouth still full of bread. \"Ohm! You need me to sign the thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, yeah!\" He grabbed the receipt but when he went to take his pen out of his pocket he couldn't find it. He somewhat frantically searched his other pocket, coming up empty handed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looking for this?\" And there was the pen, sticking up vertically out of Jafit's cleavage. She chuckled. \"You left this- URRRP! here last time. Go on, take it.\" She leaned down gently for easy access, pressing her tits together with her hands. It was like a holy sword on a pillow being presented to a famous knight. NOW Graham was aroused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith some fleshy resistance, the pen came out of  its prison easily, slightly lubed up from the big girl's sweat. Oh, wait. He handed the pen back to Jafit along with the receipt. She laughed dumbly and signed. Then, signaling Graham to wait again, she dredged up a damp 50 dollar bill from her cleavage. God, what else did she have in there? She handed the receipt back to him, along with the 50. He noticed that in place of a signature, there was a phone number. \"That money's for you, but only if you call me! OUUUUUURRP! Ahhh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. Have a good night!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm GONNA, honey.\" She took another massive bite of breadstick as Graham shut the cabin door. She shoots, she scores.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next night, around 6, a lounging Jafit, hand in a bag of salt and vinegar potato chips, received a phone call from a number she didn't recognize. She answered it. \"Hello, Jafit Gamor speaking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Jafit, this is Graham. I, uh, delivered your pizza last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shot up. FUCK yes. \"Hi Graham! I'm so glad you called! What's up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just chilling right now. What's up with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm the same. Just chilling. Classes are all done for the week! I was wondering if you, I'm, wanted to go on a date? Dinner and a movie? Next Saturday?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Yeah. Sure. I'd love to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, great! Great! You pick me up! 4:00? 4:30?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good. I'll see you then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was practically out of her seat. \"Okay! I won't order pizza next week so it'll be special!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed. \"Okay, whatever you want. You do the planning, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay! Bye bye!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See ya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGraham hung up. Had he made a mistake? She seemed totally out of it the night prior. Was that how she was all the time? And that binge eating and burping and stuff were still really weird... But that ASS though. God, he'd love a chance at that. And she seemed super nice, too, like someone he could totally get along with. Nah, this couldn't possibly be a mistake. Not at all.</span></div></div>",

Like Shiro told you, the supplement's texture is just way too overwhelming and it doesn't dissolve well in liquid. I really don't think I'll be able to include this any dishes in its current form.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Hinamizawa crossed her legs, leaned back in her chair, studying Jafit with slight disappointment. \"That's okay. At least you're using it. You're looking quite healthy, Miss Gamor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah, and I'm feeling excellent too, ma'am.

URP.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJafit stared at the ceiling of her living room, totally wiped out from the 3 bags of Flamin Hot Cheetos she had just devoured. Her matching white bra and panties were stained with red snack dust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should do competitive eating. Think of the posse I could gather. Could I have... groupies? To train me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe licked her fingers off, one by one. She wasn't sure why she was talking to herself, but she had been doing it a lot lately, especially when she was full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BWUUUUURP. Fuck. That was hot. Hey, body, will these calories go to my tits or my ass? How abooooout... both. I want... mountain dew.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>WEDNESDAY</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJafit yawned. Cooking class was boring. Not that the material was boring to her, no way. But her students were just... great. They all had A's. This had been statistically her best class in years and while she was proud of her students she also was sad that she didn't get to tutor them, really. They were all such fast learners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she stood up from her seat to stretch, though, something absolutely happened. She cracked her back, thrusting her chest forward, and popped a button on her straining blouse. The button rocketed forward from its home and managed to hit one of her students in the front row, a girl named Jill, lightly on the forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oopsie! Uh, I'm gonna go change. Excuse me.\" Her high heels clacked along the ground of the hallway, breasts quaking with every step, butt wiggling tightly in her skirt, threatening to burst from its confines. Jafit felt like she was uncontainable, truly one of the most powerful beings on the planet. She was incredibly horny. Why did she always have to get so wound up at work? She hoped she could pop a button for Graham, while he fed her grapes like the Spanish goddess she was, lounging in her Acropolis of greasy food and butt touches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>THURSDAY</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm really surprised to be saying this, Jafit, but you weigh 337 pounds, now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you've grown again. You're 6 foot 2 inches.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, I'm massive. I guess the workouts aren't really working out!\" She laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess you're just destined to be fat. At least you get it in the right places, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, yeah. Yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's that dude who you have a date with, the pizza guy? George?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Graham.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Graham. You're gonna crush it, babe. I know you will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Shiro. That date's not the only thing I'm gonna crush, if you know what I mean.\" She winked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... I know what you mean. He's gonna love you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He'll love my butt, at least. I'll make him. Once we get into that bedroom-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me about it AFTER it happens. You don't know how it'll go or if you'll get that far.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suuuure. I'll charm him. There's no way my feminine wiles won't be able to get him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Jafit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfft. Okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>FRIDAY</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFriday was boring. Jafit ate a big hot dog.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Graham's mid-2000s Corolla idled in the driveway outside of Jafit's apartment. It was 4:00 on the dot, the time he had been half looking forward to and half dreading for the past week. He was still a little weirded out by Jafit's odd display of affection for him that night, but he had to take the chance. He didn't know what he was in for tonight as she had told him absolutely nothing except for a scant \"dress casual. bring condom :)))\" that she had texted him. Oh well. At least he was getting some. If things got weird he could brag that he pleasured the most stacked woman he'd ever seen while she ate a bunch of gummy worms or some shit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd out of the door she came. God, she looked... even bigger than two weeks ago. Graham's eyes scanned her from head to toe. She had gotten a haircut, a short little pixie swooped to the side. Her make-up was minimal, just a bit of eyeliner and bright red lipstick that was sure to smear by the end of the night. She was beginning to form a double chin, but her face was still defined and statuesque, much like a fashion model. She wore a tight black tee with a button-up collar completely unbuttoned, showing off the upward thrust of her mountainous breasts. They were scarcely contained by her form-fitting shirt and he could see a slight outline of her bra through it. Another thing he could see outlined was her belly button. Her flabby, currently empty gut was clearly not taken into account when she got this shirt. She had on a black bomber jacket as well, but it clearly would not be able to zip up over her boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurther down, her hips flared out, generating the most glorious lower body that Graham had ever laid eyes on. This evening she had on a very tight pair of bright red, leather, buttoned and belted shorts that seemed to ache with every step, clinging to her waist just below her navel. Talk about attracting attention, even the most puritanical of people would be unable to avert their eyes from that monstrous thing. Though he couldn't see her back, Graham assumed that her cheeks were straining within, clamoring to break out and jiggle freely. Her massively thick thighs were coated in black fishnet stockings which hugged her legs just enough to create subtle bulges of fat at every intersection of the material. Finally, she wore a pair of black heeled boots, boosting her already tall form up slightly more. Even without the boots, Jafit seemed to have grown taller since he last saw her. A slightly short man of 5'6\", there would be a serious case of size difference tonight for the two potential lovers, which Graham didn't see much of an issue with, being into taller women already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finally reached the car, opened the passenger door, and entered, thumping herself down onto the poor, poor seat. She quickly tossed her purse in the backseat and looked Graham straight in the eyes wordlessly, smiling really big. After a quiet second she said \"Hey,\" and Graham said \"Hey\" back with enthusiasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJafit looked around the vehicle and broke the conversational silence. \"So this is where the magic happens, huh? All the pizza?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, haha, yeah. This is my car. You're in the pizza's seat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I'm like the pizza right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I guess you are what you eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly began to form a big smile. \"I think this night's gonna be great. I like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know you very well yet, but I like you too, Jafit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, where are we going? Dinner first, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a surprise. I'll direct you there.\" She went to strap in, but couldn't find the seatbelt buckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGraham saw her struggle. \"I think you're sitting on it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at Graham and made a thankful face. \"Great idea.\" She shifted in her seat, lifting up her left hip slightly, and found it had been beneath her. She strapped in, belt now pressing against her chest. \"Car seats are difficult for me. Most seats, really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could imagine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGraham began driving, Jafit directing him at every stop with a \"go straight\" or \"left up here\" or something. A little bit into the ride, she asked him a question out of the blue. \"Do you like my butt Graham?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want honesty?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like it a lot, Jafit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rested back in her chair. \"I knew that. Just wanted to make sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we wouldn't be going out if you didn't, right? ...and sometimes I see you checking me out when you deliver me food. Don't deny it, it's cute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more minutes, the two reached their dinner destination:</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Here we are!\" Jafit cheered excitedly, looking like she was considering squeezing out the window and barrelling towards the all-you-can-eat while the car was still in motion. Ah, The Fuji Buffet, Wellington's premium pan-Asian bellystuffing destination. Graham should have known. While he had never been to this fine establishment, he was very much aware of its reputation as the best place in town to pick up a fat chick, as his crass high school friends would joke. Jafit was totally silent pulling into the parking space, saliva beginning to pool in her mouth. Graham could practically hear her belt screaming in agony like a prisoner on death row. This would be an... interesting night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter chivilrously heaving his date's bulk from her seat, the duo began the walk to the restaurant's front door. Jafit put her chubby arm around Graham, their more than half-foot difference in height being incredibly apparent to the both of them side by side. Close to the door, Jafit's belly grumbled like a torpedo had just exploded in her gut. As Graham opened the door for her, Jafit put her hand to her middle and teased, \"Oops, tummy's hungry. My apologies in advance, I'm not particularly... ladylike at buffets. Brings out the animal. Rawr!\" She did a little claw in the air and bared her teeth. Rawr indeed. Graham wasn't sure what unladylike was for Jafit, but he was presumably about to find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little Asian woman at the counter looked at the couple like Graham was a fisherman who had just caught a shark. Yeah, here we go again. She asked \"How many?\" and Jafit replied \"Oh, we're the private party. Should be under Gamor?\" The woman checked the reservation book, grabbed two straws, and said \"Follow me.\" As the trio walked through the somewhat busy dining room towards the back of the restaurant, Graham spied for the first time the glorious, decadent, delicious looking buffet bar. So much food steaming: from various types of Chinese style chicken and beef to rice and noodles to shrimp and crab legs to all different kinds of sushi to dumplings and rangoons to pastries, puddings, and ice cream for dessert, this place had it all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Graham it was a typical buffet with higher quality food than most. To Jafit it was a challenge brewing. See, Jafit came here every weekend and simply adored the place. It wasn't really a special place for a date. What was special, however, was the prospect of being able to beat her record. 10 fully loaded plates was currently the most amount of food she had been able to eat at this establishment, and she intended to break this. She had a trick up her sleeve, too. Not the stupidest person in the world, Jafit had caught on that the supplement was boosting her appetite after her gigantic binge where she actually gave Graham her number, but she was past the point of caring. So, before she left her apartment, Jafit had taken three whole pills of supplement in addition to her morning dosage. She was absolutely STARVING by now. And she had cute little Graham as her unwitting helper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waitress pulled back the bamboo styled screen to a private back room meant for large parties. There were some tables and booths, and after seeing them Jafit dragged Graham to a booth, remarking that they were more \"butt friendly\". They sat down and the waitress asked for a drink order to which Jafit quickly responded \"Get me a pitcher of Mountain Dew and a pitcher of Pepsi, please.\" Graham figured out truly what he was in for and ordered a water. The waitress told the couple that they could go up and get some food and promptly walked away. Jafit put her elbows on the table and her head in her hands, leaned forward and cooed in a sing-song voice, \"Oh Graaaaaham my sweet~. Could you be a dear and get me a plate of food or two... or three? Pretty please?\" She fluttered her eyelids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGraham sighed. \"Sure. What should I get?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer voice hardened. \"Literally. Anything. It's all amazing and I want it all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Graham wordlessly stood up and made his way to the buffet. Jafit blew him a kiss. So weird... but he was kinda okay with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGraham returned with a tray upon which his offerings to the food goddess laid: a plate loaded with honey chicken and General Tso's chicken, a plate filled with fried rice and chow mein, and a plate absolutely covered in sushi with a little bowl of soy sauce. He also had his own meager plate, the contents of which you the reader probably don't give a shit about. Jafit gave him a happy golf clap and they dug in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Jafit, tell me a little about yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mouth was full of chow mein but she answered anyway, muffled by noodles. \"Hwat do oo wan kno?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno, anything I guess. Okay, here's something. Ahem. I love your accent! Where are you from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe swallowed her mouthful, continuing to eat while she answered. \"Oh, thank you! My accent is kind of a mix, haha. I spent my earliest years in Tel Aviv, Israel. My dad was half Palestinian half Israeli so I grew up speaking both Arabic and Hebrew. But when he passed away when I was... 7? I moved to Barcelona to be with my mother and my siblings so then I started speaking mostly Spanish. So then when I went to school here in America everyone told me my accent was weird and they didn't know what it was.\" She laughed again, mouth full of chicken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need more, Graham. Bring me more.\" The plates were all conquered, but Jafit certainly wasn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe responded:</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>And so that's how it continued. Graham would begrudgingly bring Jafit more food for her gaping maw, they'd chat for a little while about their lives which amounted to a manic Jafit telling Graham about her students and her lesson plan and all the delicious foods that she had to eat for grading (\"It's like a free dinner!\" she said as she inhaled shrimp at a frightening pace) and even about her lunch and dinner feasts which she hoped would titillate him. It didn't, really. He wasn't grossed out or anything, no. He just felt like he had stumbled upon some bizarre alternate universe where the women were both incredibly voluptuous and incredibly horny for food. Seriously, with the way she was moaning you'd be surprised that they weren't fucking in there. Graham, not being able to see under the table past her enormous tits had to assume that she wasn't pleasuring herself under there. It was surreal. And so Jafit would reach the end of her spread, demand more food in a sultry way (\"Graham, my dear? Could you bring this VERY hungry girl some more food, please?\"), release a table-shaking belch, and chug some soda before the cycle began anew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was around plate number 23 when Jafit decided to call it quits. She could have kept going, mind you, but she figured that it was a good stopping point. This was because while she was enjoying round 5 of the absolutely heavenly orange chicken, they heard a loud *SNAP* from below the table. Knowing exactly what that sound and sensation was, Jafit moved her hand down to her belly and cooed playfully in mock surprise, \"Oh no!! My belt broke! How could this happen, Graham? It just fit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe responded, \"Maybe it's because you've been eating. A lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nonsense. A petite girl like me could eat much more than this! HUOOOOOORRRP! Ahh, excuse me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you wanna go home and change before the movie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I honestly didn't need this belt for my outfit. I just wanted to snap it for you as a display of power. Do you think I'm powerful, Graham?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I guess so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll know so by the end of the night.\" She winked at him. \"Well, I'm done I guess. Help me up, let's go to the movies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Jafit scooted herself over, reached for Graham's hands to get herself to her feet, and stumbled a bit on her heels, what was once concealed under the table was now completely visible: her massive food baby. She looked like she were 12 months pregnant with some very fat triplets. Her tight shirt had ridden up completely, exposing her tan-skinned extra-large beach ball to the world. Her belt hung in three pieces around her leather shorts which had been unbuttoned, unzipped, and slightly pulled down to make room for the planet that was her midsection. She noticed her date's stare at the unsightly bulge, slapping her hand onto it and asking \"You like what you see?\" before closing her eyes and letting loose yet another monster burp. Graham swore he could see it recede slightly. He responded with an unsure \"Sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, admire it while you can. This thing gets small quick.\" She slapped it twice, eliciting another, smaller burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter paying and tipping generously, the two made their way back to the car, this time with Graham's hand around Jafit, struggling to keep her balance with her altered center of gravity. She belched a few times into the open air and asked, \"You mind if I lay on the back seat? I really wanna be horizontal right now.\" Graham agreed and Jafit broke from his steadying grasp, hobbled to the car and proceeded to strike a pose against it, fishnet clad left leg up, tits on the roof, belly squished against the window, ass jutting out with her shorts riding low to reveal a little black thing wedged between her lovely cheeks. She playfully smacked her leather booty, tiny waves forming on the uncovered top. She gave him the fuck me eyes. Man, this would have been the perfect woman to Graham had it not been for that display in the restaurant, but to Jafit, it was all for the better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJafit laid supine in Graham's back seat, her noticably smaller but still gigantic belly taut in the air like a dome. She had her eyes shut, rubbing it, occasionally belching and moaning in the erotic pleasure of what she just did in hindsight. Graham, still completely unsure what to make of all this, drove down to the movie theater. He asked after a silence, \"So, what are we seeing tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever's in the IMAX theater. They have those recliners in there and my enormous butt doesn't like those regular seats. Hey Graham?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you like my butt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You already asked me this, Jafit. I do like your butt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I just wanted to ask again. I like when you say it. UUURRRROP. Excuse me. I'm so gassy, gosh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, I love my ass. I really do. I want it bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bigger? It's already pretty big.\" Graham with the understatement of the year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not big enough. Don't get me wrong, I love my boobies too, but if I could I would distribute all that boob fat into my ass and thighs. I'd be the BWOOORP goddess of booty. Mmm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you like my butt, Graham. It likes you. It wants you so fucking bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, he was weirdly aroused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGraham threw away the four empty family sized tubs of popcorn and two empty large drinks that Jafit had burned through during the showing of Sausage Party 3: The Reckoning that they had just suffered through. It was a bad movie for sure, but the two of them enjoyed each other's company quite a lot. Seated in the back of the almost empty theater, Jafit may have started whispering dirty things into Graham's ear like, say for example, \"God, I wanna sit on your face and smother you while I jack your huge cock off.\" or perhaps \"I want you to worship my big thick asscheeks and then suck on my nipples.\" or maybe \"I want you to feed me until I explode.\" which probably would have been weird for Graham but it maybe possibly might have been said. Then, hypothetically, they may have started making out, Graham tasting popcorn and Chinese food and lipstick and not even caring because she was so good with her tongue. And then they might have gotten gropy, Graham sticking his eager hands into Jafit's shirt to feel her abundant titflesh, while she may have felt his hard bulge in his jeans. He might have even tried to touch the butt, but if he did he would have been rejected, as he wasn't allowed to touch the sacred booty without permission from its incredibly horny owner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut this was all hypothetical, of course. Who's to say it happened? Sure, their clothes may have been a LITTLE disheveled by the end of the show and Graham may have had a little bit of lipstick on his face and neck, but that proves nothing. Nothing! But it was common knowledge that the two shared a sloppy, passionate kiss in the car before they peeled out of the space, Jafit yelling \"Oh God! Go to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jafit unlocked her door and strolled on in, followed by Graham, her pack mule, carrying a brown paper bag filled with expensive vodka and wine and rum and mixers. You could cut the sexual tension between the two with a knife, especially from Graham, who seemed just about ready to rip off his clothes and go to town. Jafit, however, still wanted to have some fun with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pour me a drink, I need to change out of these fuckin... shorts. Leather was a mistake.\" Jafit jogged down the hall to her room, wide hips jostling, Graham's eyes glued to the sight from the couch until she disappeared into the door. He poured Jafit a tall rum and coke and himself a glass of white wine, took a sip, and absorbed his surroundings. Man, they really gave the teachers here some good lodgings. He'd been here before many times on the job but it never really occurred to him how nice of a place it was. He wondered what Jafit's salary was. It had to be pretty big, given the way she spends on food and... food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple minutes Jafit emerged from her room with some small changes to her wardrobe. She had gotten rid of her tight leather shorts and replaced them with a pair of grey shorts made of thin fabric that hung loosely on her elephantine bottom. She had ditched her jacket and heeled boots as well, her fishnetted feet plodding unimpeded across the carpet. She had also replaced her previous shirt with an ill-fitting dark blue crop top which showed off ample cleavage, part of her mandatory oversized bra, and all of her plump tummy which had almost completely receded in size to its original cute flab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJafit approached Graham at the sofa slowly, emphasizing every step with a purposeful jiggle of her chest and belly, big grin on her face. When Graham got up from his seat with the intention of going over and finishing what they had started at the movie theater, she playfully pushed him back down, teasing him with an \"Ah-ah-ah! Not so fast, cutie! We're gonna play a game first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of game?\" Graham was impatient, but he was willing to humor her. At least he knew sex was his prize for winning. He took a sip of wine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJafit made her way into the kitchen and looked through the fridge, bending over and jiggling her now barely impeded butt for Graham's curious eye. She pulled out a bottle of beer, which she promptly opened and chugged in one solid breath. Graham inquired \"Spin the bottle?\" to which Jafit answered \"BURRRP. Truth or dare. Drinking game. URP.\" She patted her stomach and took a seat on the floor in front of the TV, thick legs crossed like a schoolchild ready for reading time. She put the bottle in front of her and motioned Graham to sit with her eyes, adding \"Bring my drink, peasant!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGraham sat across from Jafit, bringing both drinks. As he sat down, Jafit asked \"You know how this game works, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess, but I don't know the drinking game version.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. So we're gonna spin the bottle. Whoever it lands on has to choose truth or dare and whoever it doesn't land on has to take a big swig and give the other person a sexy, kinky question or thing to do. If you don't wanna do the thing or answer the question, you can switch by pouring another drink and finishing that one. But you can't switch back! You have to do it or else there will be consequences! Any questions before we begin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kinda consequences?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll sit on you. I'm very heavy. You can make me chug straight vodka. Anything else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if it lands in the middle?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we kiss and we both drink. Anything else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, we can start.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I drank the bottle so I get to spin first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJafit spun, the bottle whizzing across the carpeted floor, eventually landing on...</span></div></div>",

There was a quiet confusion, the silence broken by Graham, asking \"What did you say we were supposed to do if this happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh...\" Jafit sucked down her second to last beer, quickly cracking open the last one. They were both quite drunk by this point, now just drinking to drink. \"Well, we gotta both drink, which we're doing... Oh! Kissy!\" She lunged forward, grabbing Graham's feeble head, and pulling him into a big, sloppy, beer tasting kiss, right on his lips. \"There.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a good kisser.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, babe. Want another?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FUCK yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on, lemme burp. OUUUUUUURRRRRRRP! Okay. Kiss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir next kiss was quite an intense one, the sexual charge of their spit and the power of both their tongues uniting their mouths in bliss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJafit pulled away to burp again, chug the rest of her beer, and pat her once again bloated stomach. \"Can I give you a- BWORP! dare, Graham?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, anything.\" He put down his empty drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. I dare youuuu to stand motionless against that wall over there.\" She pointed in a swoopy, drunken motion first to Graham, then to the bare wall across the room. \"One last game. You're gonna stand by that wall with your fuckin... big hands against it and I'm gonna come- BWUUUURP! I'm gonna come get you. HUUUORP! If you make a sound or touch me or move your body in any, uhhh, intentional way, I get to be on top. UUURP. Any questions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... I'll do it. Fuck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so he did it. Against the wall he was, the much bigger woman hungrily staring him down like a plate of food at the buffet earlier. She licked her lips. \"Alright, my little toy. I really don't think you're gonna be on top tonight.\" She removed her top, exposing her colossal breasts, housed comfortably within a perfectly fitted, black, minimally decorated bra. She licked her lips once again and unhooked the bra, letting her boobs escape freely for the first time that Graham had seen. Despite their weight and size, they were still miraculously perky outside of their confines, her large, brown nipples staring at him like another pair of eyes. She then began to walk slowly towards the guy at the wall, exaggerating her steps to wobble her expansive chest seductively. She cupped her breasts and whispered, \"I get to enjoy these fat things every day. Now you get to.\" Reaching the wall, she leaned in and plunged Graham's head between her cleavage, squeezing herself closely against the heavily breathing man, groping the bulge in his pants and giggling. She wiggled her chest gently, enjoying the warm feeling of his forehead sweat and breath against her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where'd Graham go?\" she asked rhetorically, pulling away so he could catch his breath. \"He was just here a- UUUURRRP! minute ago!\" She brought her hand to his swollen crotch again. \"Maybe my humongous tits scared him away. But I thought he wanted his big dick between these pillows!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked backwards a little, keeping eye contact on the struggling Graham. God, he wanted her, and she felt incredible. She HAD to do this more often. She turned around 90 degrees, giving him a side view of her uber-curvy form, putting a hand to her chin and uttering \"Hmm... I know!\" She turned another 90 degrees, showing off her bulging booty. \"Maybe if I take my pants off, he'll come out!\" She looked back at Graham and made eye contact while she spanked her right cheek from the bottom, jiggling it around in her shorts. Then she proceeded to pull them down, revealing her huge, round cheeks to Graham for the first time. She was essentially naked now, the only thing left was her little black thong covering her naughty bits which was barely visible in the expansive, soft canyon that was her crack. She walked backwards toward Graham, quietly mumbling \"beep, beep, beep...\" like a truck backing up. Then, about a foot away from the wall, she thrust herself back, shoving her overinflated ass directly into Graham, pinning him. He was just about close to ecstacy, barely managing to not break from that forceful attack. She held him there, wiggling her hips, laughing like a mad queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens?</span></div></div>",

For a moment, he had no idea where he was, catapulted from a sweet dream into a hungover, terribly sleepy and sore state. The beam of light from the half-open blinds bothered him, as did the clattering and thumping from behind the closed bedroom door. Oh! Jafit! He must have been in her bed. But the question remained: what happened last night? The last he remembered he was awfully drunk and horny, restrained against the wall by an awfully drunk and horny woman with a titanic ass. Jeez, did he get to have sex with her? He just couldn't remember. He was in her bed and he was only in his underwear and he was a bit sweaty... He probably scored. He had to have scored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFootsteps approached the bedroom door, and Jafit entered, slightly groggy with a blender jar filled with some kind of sand-colored smoothie. She was draped in a large white undershirt, protruding breasts causing it to drape in front of her like a tablecloth. He could see her dark nipples through the thin fabric. She also had on a pair of cotton pajama pants which had been cut off midway down the thigh, clinging tightly to her generous lower body. She was chugging some of her smoothie as she walked through the door, bringing it down when she noticed Graham was awake. \"Good morning loverboy,\" she crooned, \"did you sleep well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grunted, still half asleep and in slight pain. \"Well enough. I don't think I got enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah. We were up pretty late, huh?\" She chuckled, sitting down on her side of the bed, causing the mattress to buckle under her weight, cheeks spreading beneath her. \"You can take a nap when you get home. You don't have work today, do you?\" She sipped again from her jar, thick liquid slipping down her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe yawned. \"No...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. You'll need a day to recover. You were amazing last night! Best sex I've had in a long time, maybe ever!\" Bam, there's confirmation. Hell yeah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, thanks. I don't remember any of it, though.\" He rubbed his eyes and Jafit laid down on her back, trapping his legs under her torso. Her bare breasts within her shirt flattened out, spilling to the sides, causing her shirt to ride up, exposing part of her chunky belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww. We were both pretty drunk, I'm surprised I remember it so well, haha. Do you want a recap?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the last thing you remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You had me against the wall with your butt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJafit started laughing. \"Oh God, I can't believe I put you through that! I was surprised you didn't explode then and there! It was hot though, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it was hot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, good. I know how Drunk Jafit can get. She's a charmer! So, anyway, you, like, couldn't take it anymore and grabbed my boobs and kissed my neck,\" she recounted as she squeezed her boobs together for emphasis, \"and you were like, 'take me now' or something silly. But we were playing a game and the rules were I got to be on top if you touched me and you did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That must be why I'm so sore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, absolutely! I'm fat! And Drunk Jafit takes prisoners!\" She sat up, taking another drink from her smoothie, and laid back down. \"Anyway, I dragged you to the bedroom and took your clothes off and we humped. Reverse cowgirl. You were REALLY into it, smacking my ass, moaning, telling me how sexy and beautiful I was, et cetera. You took all of me like a champ! Then you came! You lasted a pretty good amount of time, too. Cleaned up a bit, cuddled a bit, and fell asleep together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed in a sleepy tone. \"That sounds great... Wish I could remember.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJafit switched positions to be parallel with Graham. She squeezed her boobs together with her elbows, reaching forward to touch his hair. \"I couldn't have asked for a better night. Thank you, you cutie, you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed again, this time less sleepy-like. \"Well, you're welcome. I'd love to do this again. I think I promised I'd feed you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, you did! I'm looking forward to that. It's gonna be so sexy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you say. I'm just doing it cause I like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suuuure. Gotcha. I know deep down you love seeing me all... bloated and burpy and fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever. As long as I get something in return.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed. \"No guarantees, babe.\" Without warning, Jafit rolled over onto Graham's delicate body, getting a big \"OOF\" from him. She sat up atop his crotch, smiling face towering above, booty smothering him as she grinded herself a little bit. Then she leaned all the way forward, dangling breasts smooshing briefly on his face until she moved herself backward so her head was aligned with his, round ass bulging out into the air. She chuckled once again. \"Can you reach my butt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGraham lifted his hand and quickly brushed it against her asscheek. \"Yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put both hands there. Don't squeeze, just touch. If you squeeze you'll be punished.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGraham did as she ordered, placing both hands onto her impossibly soft, fabric coated flesh. The urge to squeeze was very much there, but he knew from her tone of voice that he would not wanna be punished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled. \"Good. Now, I wanna make something clear to you. It's nothing super duper serious, but now that we've fucked I need you to understand something about our relationship. Mainly, we are not in one. I don't have time for an actual relationship right now. I have to work, I have to deal with health stuff, and I'm fat and lazy. I'm only looking to go on dates and fool around. In addition, we're not exclusive. Don't be surprised if I find another guy to take me out if you're not available or I wanna try something new. Do you understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGraham had no objections. He didn't intend to make this something serious, either. \"Yeah, understood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe jiggled with glee, butt quaking beneath his palms. \"Good. Now, here are the benefits. I am a very horny girl, so I'll probably text you to see if you wanna come over and have some fun a lot. If you don't wanna, that's fine! Don't feel obligated! Like I said, we are not in a relationship. Same goes for you. If you wanna text me and see what's up, you totally can. I'll probably say yes unless I'm grading papers or I'm tired or something. But I'll seriously do, like, anything with you. Like, if you wanna come over and just sleep in my bed if I'm too tired to fool around, that's fine! I'm also open to phone sex or sexting or whatever, so, yeah. Any questions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you still gonna order pizza?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES. Of course I'm gonna order pizza. We can smooch or something when you drop them off but I don't expect you to fuck me on the clock, if that's what you're worried about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, uh, when can I see you again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whenever you want! Just not tonight. I gotta do work. Don't be surprised if I call you pretty soon, though. You really were amazing last night.\" She leaned down for a kiss, scooched forward to his crotch again, and sat back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you make me put my hands on your butt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted you to know what power you had at your disposal. Best ass in the world, all for you, babe.\" She winked and got off of Graham and the bed, grabbing her blender jug and guzzling some smoothie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to walk out of the room, picking a wedgie out of her crack. She remembered something and spun around. \"Oh, two things. One, don't be surprised if I get fatter. I gained a lot of weight in a very short time thanks to this weird powder somebody gave me. They lied to me and I didn't know it was doing it till recently. But I wanna get fatter so I'm gonna keep using it for a little while. I won't be a bedridden behemoth, I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, uh, okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My weight goes to the right places. There'll just be more to love.\" She pointed her finger at Graham intensely. \"I NEED a bigger butt, Graham. I need it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh and, number 2, I made blueberry pancakes. You can have a couple but they're mostly for me. I'm hungry and I'm bulking. Get dressed and come eat, then you gotta leave. I have errands to run.\" She finished off her smoothie in the doorway, giving off a satisfied \"Ahhhh.\" as she walked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was a lot for Graham to take in as he lay in the bed, hard as a rock. God, he wished he could remember last night, but he'll have other chances for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA fully dressed Graham and a stuffed Jafit stood by the doorway, deep in a warm hug. She loved the way she enveloped him when she hugged him, a testament to her size. She had just shoved a massive stack of 9 blueberry pancakes coated in syrup into her gullet, along with half a gallon of whole milk and a bunch of sausages. He sat there and took it, the hungry girl idly telling him about whatever came to mind. They were both content with their new arrangement, Graham getting a free pass to bang one of the hottest chicks he's ever seen and Jafit getting someone to validate her plumped up body and tend to her kinky desires. It was a win/win, but Graham felt something was missing when he was about to leave, and he knew what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled himself from her plush rack. \"Hey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, cutie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I squeeze? Your butt? I didn't get to and I don't remember doing it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJafit laughed harder than she'd laughed all morning. \"Yes, you may squeeze.\" She took his arm and put his hand on her bottom for him. \"Go ahead, it's all yours for being so good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put his other hand down there, pulled her wide hips close to his, and squeezed as hard as he could, pulling her bulbous butt upwards. It must have been what heaven felt like. Jafit loved the sensation, it made her feel amazing to provide such joy with her fat ass. It made her wanna go out and binge some more, to make it bigger and wider, to have the most voluptuous and sexy body in the entire world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them kissed goodbye, Graham walking out of the little cabin on clouds. She thought this was the beginning of a beautiful friendship.</span></div></div>",

She leaned back in her wheeled office chair, sizing up her friend who sat before her. Jafit was dressed pretty casually this Monday in a white flowered blouse, a knee length, black pencil skirt, dark brown stockings, and a pair of black high-heeled shoes. She had gone on a clothes shopping trip yesterday, so all her clothes fit her perfectly, though she still let out an unusual amount of cleavage. The only person she was trying to impress was herself, and she felt pretty impressed by her appearance today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJafit had been making her way down to Shiro's office during the latter half of her office hours lately, just to hang out. They spent a significant amount of time together between these meetings, their bi-weekly workout sessions that barely counted as a workout for Jafit (more on those later), and their frequent text and phone conversations. They clearly both considered each other great friends and confidants and very much valued their relationships with one another. However, Jafit was keeping a big secret from her: she was getting fat on purpose. Jafit had been pretending to have NO IDEA why she was eating so much all of a sudden and gaining so much weight, and this was true up until the time she had asked Graham out. After testing all those dishes with the supplement in it and only getting hungrier and hungrier, she put two and two together. She didn't think it was malicious on the part of Dr. Hinamizawa's giving her the supplement (it in fact was) but that her body was just reacting to it in a strange way: maybe she was allergic or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, she knew what the problem was and she knew there was an easy solution: stop taking the supplement. She knew if she told this to Shiro, she would respond with that easy solution and try to get Jafit to sue the school or something. She didn't intend to do that. For all she was concerned, this supplement was a miracle drug that she did not want to give up. She didn't know how to tell this to her, but she knew she had to at some point. She decided today was the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, Shiro sucked her breath mint expectantly and excitedly. \"How did it go, Jafit? I need to know! Gimme the deets!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJafit was slightly embarrassed to talk about her amazing night last night, but she knew she had to. She inhaled through her teeth, throwing her head back over the back of the chair. \"Wellllll... we went out to dinner...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did you go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuji.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on, you took him to the buffet?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a damn good buffet, Shiro! You know this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know. Go on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we ate and then we went to the movies and we kinda... got freaky in the back of the theater.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiro hollered and slapped her desk. \"OHHH SHIT! How freaky?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJafit leaned forward to calm her down. \"Not THAT freaky. Yet. We were just kissing and touching and stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaned her head on her hand in anticipation. \"Go on, go on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that really got us going so we uh...\" She laughed. \"We went to the liquor store and then to my place and we got hammered and we got sweaty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got sweaty? That's an interesting euphemism.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've never heard that one before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's accurate for me I am a,\" she wiped a hand across her forehead for emphasis, \"WHEW, hot, sweaty creature... But yeah. It was. Amazing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww. I'm so proud of you, girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you were so right! I'm feeling so fuckin confident, you don't even know. I could go kiss some random guy on the street and not feel weird about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See! I told you! We insecure people just need some sexual reassuring sometimes. We just need to figure out your whole weight issue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpe. This was the perfect time to tell her. Jafit took the opportunity. \"Well, Shiro, there's something you gotta know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like myself at this weight and I, uh, wanna get fatter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a silence. The health-nut nurse looked at the woman in front of her like she had just spoken in an ancient language. \"You wanna get fatter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeaaaah. I, uh, I figured out what was causing me to be so hungry and killing my metabolism and whatever. It's that supplement Dr. Hinamizawa gave me. It's giving me an allergic reaction or something. But I'm not gonna stop taking it, that's what I'm telling you. I want to be fatter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, uh...\" She started laughing in disbelief. \"I support you Jafit, you know that. But why would you wanna be fatter? Like, you're aware there are serious health risks at your size, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm in perfect condition! You've said it yourself! If I were to develop these health risks I'd stop using the supplement and, like, lose all the weight, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiro was serious, but reassuring. She reached forward and motioned for Jafit's hand, which she took. \"It's okay, Jafit. I understand. You still haven't answered my question though. Then you're off the hook.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was embarrassed again, very much so. \"Well... I... uh... I think it's... erotic.\" Her face was red as the shorts she wore on her date. \"I dunno, ever since I've gotten fatter I've been, like, really into it. Sexually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiro understood. A lot. \"Awww! It's okay! I'm sorry for pressing you like that, you must be so embarrassed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, it's okay. It's good to have it, y'know, off my chest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you wanna talk about it? I have kinks too, they're nothing to be ashamed of!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, uh, maybe a little bit.\" She laughed. That was a serious weight off her back. \"So, when I went out with Graham to the buffet-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiro chortled, cutting her off. \"So that's why you went to the buffet! You're adorable Jafit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned red again. \"Uh, haha, yeah. So I got him to like, bring me a whole bunch of food and I like... just stuffed my face in front of him. Not really any table manners or whatever, biiiiig trucker burps, all that. I actually got so stuffed I broke my belt. That was like, so hot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you think you like it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno. I guess it makes me feel powerful. I eat everything, rip all my clothes, like, disregard all the rules of polite society. I feel like fat Hulk. And then it's like... I know all that food is gonna go straight to my butt. And my butt is probably the most sexual part of my body for me. The thought of it getting bigger and ripping my pants and stuff just fuckin kills me, Shiro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was Graham into this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! But I like that he isn't! He, like, puts up with my fetish shit for me. It's so cute when he has to watch me turn myself on with popcorn.\" She started laughing at the ridiculousness of what she just said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I accept you and support you, Jafit, no matter what size you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. I really love you. I'm so glad you're my friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey got out of their seats and embraced, both of them a little teary-eyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGraham was at work when he felt his phone buzz in his pocket. It was a text from Jafit. Oh, thank God. He was crossing his fingers she'd hit him up. He needed to see her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"hey\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"hey what's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"need u tonite cant stop thinking about saturday\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"should i come after work? i get off at 8\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"yes\"<br>\r\n\"tummy grumblin\"<br>\r\n\"if i place an order can u bring it to me when you get off\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh jeez, here we go. \"yeah, i can. place it as a pickup and pay with card and ill pick it up for you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"good\"<br>\r\n\"dont stop at home or anything i want you in that cute uniform\"<br>\r\n\"were gonna do sexy rp youll be the flustered pizza guy and ill be the fatty with the big butt that he promised to feed\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"arent you always the fatty with the big butt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ya\"<br>\r\n\"this is why i like you you should call me fatty more often\"<br>\r\n\"i wanna smoosh\"<br>\r\n\"im so hungry graham i could just eat you up :)\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"im at work. bother me later\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"okkkkkk dont forget condom\"<br>\r\n\"see ya soon babe\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGraham pulled up to Jafit's little on-campus house. She had ordered her usual: 4 pizzas, 3 breadsticks, 2 big bottles of Coke, a cookie cake and a cinnamon sticks. He was almost in work mode delivering this, even though he knew what was in store for him. He rung the doorbell and heard Jafit yell \"It's open! Remember we're roleplaying so once you get in here you gotta stay in character!\" Fine, whatever. He opened the door to find Jafit...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Oh, finally! My food! Come in, come in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Graham stepped into the living room, he watched a lounging Jafit get up from her luxurious position on the couch and step towards him, money in one hand, an open beer in the other. She looked uncomfortably crammed into her clothes, tonight a short, white tank top through which it could be seen that she was practically bursting out of her white bra and a pair of horozontally striped, high waisted pants that  dug into the top of her belly, squeezing out an epic muffin top like a tube of toothpaste. Graham could see a look of pain on her face as she crossed the room, her soft, ample skin not being prepared to move within such tight material.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Graham put the pizza down on the dining table, Jafit approached him in poorly acted mock anger. \"Wow. You were so. late. with my food. I'm STARVING, pizza boy! Famished!\" She put both hands on her pooching belly, grabbing her muffin top. \"Does this look like a full belly to you, pizza boy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGraham stood in silence, not sure how to respond. He had never thought he'd be doing any kinky feeding roleplay with a girl before, and he had very little idea where to take it. Jafit could sense he was floundering and whispered through her teeth, \"Tease me about my weight, Graham!\" More silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then reiterated, \"I saiiiiid, does this look like a full belly to you, pizza boy?\", to which Graham quickly replied, as if reading from a script he had never seen before, \"Oh, uh, it certainly looks like a fat belly, uh, Jafi-, uh, miss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJafit broke character again and entered teacher mode, giving Graham a quick \"Gooood!\" that she might give one of her students after she made an excellent baklava. On a dime she returned to her unhappy customer, retorting with \"Well, I didn't get fat eating LATE pizza, did I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it looks like you just ate any pizza you could find.\" Jafit shot him a quick look of approval so as to tell him he's a natural.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I mean, yeah. I'm not that picky.\" A silence. Jafit seemed to have forgotten where she was even going with this. \"Anyway, this pizza. is. late. Your flyer says 20 minutes or less or it's free. I'm not giving you ANY of this money!\" She dramatically shoved the prop 20 dollar bill she was holding into her cleavage, disappearing into the crevice. She brought her voice down to a sexy murmur. \"Unless... You wanna do me a favor. And I'll pay you. Plus a... GENEROUS tip.\" She rubbed the curve of her hip with her free hand, taking a sip of beer with the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do anything for my, uh, money. You know how they'd punish me at work if I came back without all the money for such a big order.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm so pooped after my big day at work today and I really just wanna veg out in front of the TV. Soooo... How about I just lay back and let you feed all this stuff to me? I'm sooooo hungryyyy pizza boy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Fine. I'll do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will? Oh thank you!\" She grabbed Graham in for a big smooch, having to lean down to meet his lips from her tall stature. \"There's more where that came from if you do a good job, but I think you will. You're gonna have to endure my pizza breath, though.\" She giggled, taking him by the hand and dragging him across the room to the couch. On the way, she smacked her beer-holding hand to her ass, drawing his attention downwards as a spurt of alcohol wet the top of her buttocks. Despite their high waist, the pants were unable to fully contain the sheer volume of junk in Jafit's trunk. A little bit of tan flesh tightly spilled out of the top of the pants' waist, jiggling subtlely with every step, while their striped pattern distorted as her booty moved, emphasizing every wobble and bit of life her pride and joy had. They made her look enormous, which Jafit absolutely loved. She had actually written down \"BUY MORE STRIPED PANTS\" onto a note on her phone. But anyway, as she smacked her ass, she said, \"You know, my butt was pretty slim before I started eating like such a fatass every night. But all those pizza calories just go straight there! I wonder how much BIGGER it's gonna get after tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled again, flopping down on the couch and bringing Graham in for another, sloppier kiss. She let go of his hand and ordered, \"Bring my food pizza boy! And quick! Can't you hear my stomach?\" On cue, her belly rumbled like a lion. Jafit was VERY impressed with herself, breaking character to mutter in wonderment, \"I'm magic...\" before shooting Graham a look of false displeasure. \"Well? This girl ain't gonna feed herself!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Graham had organized a spread for Jafit at her request. All four pizza boxes sat open on the wide coffee table before the couch, wafting the delightful smell of warm cheese, pepperoni, veggies, and buffalo sauce through the room, hitting her nostrils like a ton of bricks. She was starving and was regretting having Graham over to feed her. Like, if it was just her, she would have been a pizza in by now! But whatever. She had a long night ahead of her, longer than Graham might have been anticipating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was emptying the breadsticks onto a plate from the kitchen when Jafit decided to whip out her secret weapon. She yelled from the couch, not intending to be on her feet for quite a while. \"Hey, Gra-, I mean, my sweet pizza boy? Can you be a doll and grab my special spice from the cabinet? Furthest one on the right.\" Graham complied and opened up the cabinet to reveal one of the largest, most comprehensive spice racks he had ever seen. It's a miracle all of it fit in that one space. In front of the rack was a mix in a shaker you might see on the tables at a pizza parlor. It looked like a mix of red pepper flakes, parmesan cheese, and some other various things procured from the rack. However, if you know how these things go, you'll know that there was a secret ingredient to her special mix: the supplement. Jafit had found from her experimentation that it worked best in hot and spicy dishes, as the strong flavor covered up its slightly off flavor and it already resembled parmesan, so this was perfect. As Graham sprinkled it liberally across the pizzas, her mouth began to water. God, she was gonna have fun tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MMMM! Ugh, this is so good. Fuck!\" Graham pushed another piece of the cheese pizza toward her mouth from his spot on the other side of the couch which she bit into with glee, relishing the taste and the feeling. Any regrets she may have been feeling toward bringing Graham tonight had gone out the window as the experience of being fed was beyond her wildest wet dreams. Graham looked less than thrilled, but she didn't care one bit. She had him curled around her pinky toe, and she knew it. If he ever got fed up with her kinky antics, she could just shove her butt in his face and tell him he can touch once she finishes dinner. God, she felt strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter munching down the piece, she with full mouth pointed at the unopened bottles of soda on the floor, grunting a neanderthalic \"Drink.\" Graham, who had been quite quiet for a time, silently obeyed. He lugged one of the two liter bottles into his arms like a baby, twisting the cap, creating a gentle hiss of fizz that made Jafit's heart rate spike. Fuck, she was in heaven. Graham asked, \"Should I pour this in a cup, or?\" to which Jafit replied, \"No. Just pour it in my mouth.\" She was ready. He scooted forward holding the bottle with both hands like a trophy and told her \"Tell me when.\" She didn't intend to tell him anything, tilting her head back and opening her mouth. He brought it to her lips and turned it. The sugary drink began to glug down her throat, rushing into her stomach like a mudslide. Halfway through the bottle and testing Graham's patience, she gave him a flutter of the eyelids so as to say, \"I'm pretty sexy, right? Keep going.\" Soon, the entire Coke bottle had disappeared into her belly, gulped down in one breath. When Graham removed the bottle from her lips, she exhaled loudly, looking a little sick and pretty out of it. She had never done that before, and it was amazing. Lewdly rubbing her still contained stomach, she erupted with a massive \"URRRRRRRRRRUUUP! BWOOORP! Ahhh...\" and then a \"Gimme more food. We'll probably need more- OOOOOOOUUHRP! more soda before the end of the night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the halfway point, Jafit was sweating like a drink. All that grease made her so hot and soggy, and Graham could feel it. It was like being near her was 20 degrees hotter than the other side of the couch. Jafit started out chatty, but by now she was entirely consumed by her eating. The only full word he had heard in a long time was \"more\", her vocalizations consisting mostly of chewing, groaning, orgasmic moans, and violent, unstifiled belches. Jafit reveled in her status as a burp queen, which she saw as a testament to her status as a sex symbol. The way she saw it, if she could burp like that, imagine how she could fuck!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had just finished her last piece of buffalo chicken pizza when it finally happened. Graham watched as the snap on her pants finally blew, releasing her gigantic, stuffed stomach to the world like a bowling ball crashing through a piece of plywood. When she realized, she turned as red as the mark on her belly where her fly once was, slapped her hand to it and belched long and deep, before moaning like someone was fondling her breast. Then she yelled \"I AM THE GODDESS JAFIT, DESTROYER OF CLOTHES AND FOOD!\" She looked over the feast before her. She was still starving. She still had work to do.</span></div></div>",

OURRRP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no more food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJafit was laying face up with her head in Graham's lap, pushing him into the corner of the couch. Her long, thick legs draped across the other arm of the sofa and her belly which had become swollen with food and drink to almost an unearthly size rose proudly from her midsection. The knowledge that there was no more food left was like a bullet exploding in Jafit's brain. She looked up at Graham in horror, but was too lazy to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began panicking. \"Well, we gotta go do something about that then! I'm starving, Graham!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't look like you're starving.\" Graham put a hand to her gut, feeling its tautness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel like I'm starving! You know how quick it takes me to digest!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what do you wanna do, then? Do you wanna order more delivery?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJafit's panic very quickly turned to smug content.

She was quaking in her shoes the whole time she took her order, trying to avoid staring at her cleavage or rounded tummy. She thought the girl might drop the donuts, the way she was trembling. And now she was affixed to her as the increasingly bored Graham shoveled food down her gullet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, haha, what did you say?\" The nervous girl tried to play it off unsuccessfully. She was like putty. Jafit didn't normally go for people of her own gender, but she thought this girl was a cutie. She was a bit younger than her, probably early 20s. Her shoulder length black hair outlined her face nicely, bangs covering up the pasty skin of her forehead. Thick, black-framed glasses sat on her nose, complimenting her little black earrings. She was a short woman, Jafit estimated around 5 foot 2, and what little weight she had settled in the unmistakable round curve of her rump. Cute. Just enough to squeeze. She thought she'd pursue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJafit put her hand on her belly, still chewing on a jelly donut. Her words came out muffled. \"What's your name? I'm Jafit. I teach at the school.\" She turned to Graham. \"Keep feeding. I'm hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh fuck. She clearly wasn't expecting this. \"Uh... I'm A-Alexa! I, uh, work here! Haha! Donuts!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm a cooking teacher and let me tell you, these donuts are HEAVENLY!\" Crumbs fell out of her mouth as she gushed. \"They're always so, so good, perfectly cooked and flavored, filled to the BRIM with such amazing jelly and cream... Hang on. Gotta burp. HOUUUUURRRRRRP! Ahhh... Am I good at burping Alexa?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlustered wouldn't even begin to describe Alexa right then. \"Haha, uh, I... I dunno! Sure!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. HUUURP. I'm glad you agree. Oh, this is Graham. He's feeding me all these wonderful donuts because I told him I'd let him fuck my brains out once I'm full. And if he doesn't I'll sit on him until he agrees to. We've worked this out, it's okay.\" She leaned in for a hissing, non-whisper. \"Don't worry! We're not dating!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sounds like fun!\" Dammit, that was weird. She was letting it slip. Shit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which part?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uhhhhh... being fed! Yeah.\" Saved?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJafit laughed. \"Okay. Sure.\" Saved????<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAR: so then she's like<br>\r\nAR: you know like i said im a cooking teacher i make a mean dish why dont you come over sometime and i can feed you<br>\r\nAR: or maybe youd rather feed me????<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPO: holy shit you hit it big<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAR: literally! lmao<br>\r\nAR: but yeah she gets the guy to give me her number because shes fat and doesnt wanna get up and tells me to text her<br>\r\nAR: and then she says nothing to me the rest of the night<br>\r\nAR: but paula she was definitely giving me the eyes the whole time she ate rhose donuts<br>\r\nAR: she ate ALL of them btw<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPO: what the fuck<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAR: i know right<br>\r\nAR: it was crazy<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPO: did you text her yet?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAR: not yet<br>\r\nAR: im aftaid<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPO: dude Alexa she wants some fuck<br>\r\nPO: text her immediately<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAR: but im not over emma! i dont wannastart some other relationship right now<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPO: Emma was wack<br>\r\nPO: she wasn't even fat Alexa<br>\r\nPO: imagine the kinky fun you could have with this lady<br>\r\nPO: you can finally scratch that fatty itch<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAR: ugh i guess ill text her<br>\r\nAR: but if it goes wrong and i suffocate in her ass youre responsible<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPO: lol okay<br>\r\nPO: btw you'd love to suffocate in her ass and you know it<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAR: fhhvujjjbg shut up!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPO: lol<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"hey this is alexa from the donut shop! you told me to text you so im texting you! whats up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"hey i just got off the phone with the cutie police and hang on lemme call them back i think they got a warrant out for you\"<br>\r\n\"jk im eating pizza whats up with you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"oh im just chilling! i had a long day at work today so im taking a load off\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"cool thats awesome\"<br>\r\n\"so im just gonna come out and say it i think youre hot and i wanna hang out with you if you know what i mean\"<br>\r\n\"sorry if thats too forward of me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"well im flattered but what about that guy you were with last night? arent you a thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"no hes just a good fuck i like teasing him its fun\"<br>\r\n\"he doesnt share my fetishy interests but based on the way you were looking at me you do\"<br>\r\n\"do you like girls who can eat their weight in donuts\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ugh god yes\"<br>\r\n\"im just gonna be forward and say youre the sexiest person ive ever seen\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"what do you wanna do to me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"i wanna stuff your face till you cant move and then rub your belly and make out\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"perfect ill make us dinner tomorrow night and we can do that\"<br>\r\n\"does that work for you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"absolutely!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"good see you then\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexa was on another planet.

A.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJafit was grading her cooking class tonight. One of her least favorite activities. She loved teaching, sure, and of COURSE she loved eating, but grading just got on her nerves sometimes. Recently, though, she had figured out some ways to soften the blow. Firstly, a few weeks ago she threw out her entire lesson plan. One of the biggest frustrations with grading was the food. As you may recall, Jafit typically taught her class as a sort of journey around the Mediterranean and Adriatic seas. In previous years, this didn't bother her a bit. She could flex her knowledge of the cuisine of Europe and northern Africa and expose her students to dishes that they probably haven't even heard about before. This became a problem with her new... diet, though. Jafit more often than not craved food that was fattier, greasier, and more Americanized. As a result, when she came home after school and plopped her fat ass on the couch, she would rather order a pizza or three and get her butt caressed by a lover instead of grading fifteen to twenty bowls of Tunisian kamounia stew and then passing out in a food coma without pizza or butt touches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, she rearranged the class's schedule to be more... pleasing to her proclivities. There were now two units of the class, large and in depth inquiries: Desserts of America and Italian Cuisine. They were currently nearing the end of the dessert unit, but Jafit still found herself tired of eating for business rather than pleasure. The solution? She hired an assistant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexa and Jafit hit it off rather perfectly on their dinner date. They had a lot in common despite their age difference and quite enjoyed each other's company in a non-sexual way... but also in a sexual way. While she still loved getting dick from Graham every once and a while, Alexa's kinky nature pressed her buttons so well she would be practically in a trance every time they made love. Under her shy exterior was a fat girl fiend who went absolutely crazy for Jafit's flabby gut and tree-trunk thighs and oh-so-huge jugs. Her teasing was non-stop and she could barely keep her greedy hands to herself when Jafit was around. This made her perfect as a teaching assistant and absolutely spiced up grading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a snag, though. How could she hire an assistant on her salary? Sure, it was generous. She wasn't a teacher at any old school, this was BUTTERCOMBE. But it wasn't THAT generous. So, she paid Alexa the best way she knew how: with food. Lots of food. They'd share the leftovers from the class's work and every night of grading Jafit would prepare Alexa a decadent, fancy dinner with all her finesse and expertise. This was having consequences. Alexa had put on some weight. But how much?</span></div></div>",

I think I'm all brownied out...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, shush. I got the students to make extra just so I could have something substantial to pay you with. And they're GREAT brownies. So eat. Don't want these to go to waste!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, whatever. Don't be surprised if I end up as fat as you. All these leftover desserts have been getting me so big.\" She was right. Alexa's weight had ballooned since she started regularly seeing Jafit, and a lot of that had to do with her payment. Jafit, the dominant personality she was, outright refused to let her go without first cleaning her plate. She considered it rude for a dish to go unfinished, and her house, her rules. This rule applied not only to the abundant dinners she would cook for her, but also to the homework food portions that she was given and the lavish breakfasts she'd prepare if Alexa stayed the night, which she almost always did. Jafit wasn't trying to get Alexa fatter, oh no. In fact, she didn't quite care about her weight at all. She just had high expectations when it came to dining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis resulted in the version of Alexa that was sitting at the dining table in Jafit's apartment. She had previously weighed about 134 pounds. Now she weighed 187. Given how short she was, that extra weight really showed. Alexa had quickly grown into a ripe pear, her belly and booty carrying the brunt of her new weight. Her new gut oozed out of the bottom of her band tee, bunching up into a roll or two gently on her lap. The fat on her chubby biceps was squeezed tightly into her shirt sleeves, bulging out like little cupcakes. Her butt, previously her biggest and best asset, had only become bigger and better, holding onto its throne. It was a true badonkadonk, swelling out behind her with vigor. Unlike Jafit who still somehow had very little cellulite, Alexa's pale ass and fat thighs were aligned with the stuff. Jafit thought it looked like an especially delicious and jiggly portion of tapioca pudding. Today her cheeks were stuffed in a too small pair of leggings at Jafit's request. She loved looking at other day butts as much as she loved looking at her own fat butt, which she did often and with relish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of Jafit's fat butt, how much did the boobie/booty goddess weigh now?</span></div></div>",

Ever since she embraced her fatty kink she'd been riding high. Her weight had grown to a quite obese 485 pounds and she absolutely loved it. She loved the way her ginormous breasts hung heavily on her fat frame, the way all her bras cut into her many rolls of backfat, the way her now always bulging belly squished and jiggled against the tops of her thighs, the way her impossibly huge ass could barely be contained in even the largest pair of leggings she owned. She loved how she had to turn to fit through most of the doors in her apartment, as her hips were too wide and just too fucking fat to fit through normally anymore. She loved the way she jiggled when she walked up the stairs, the way she struggled to fit herself into the shower, the way her body completely engulfed her sexual partners and the way they lustfully touched and groped and felt every inch of her massive body while she moaned and moved her hips in ecstasy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut... She thought she was nearing the end. While she absolutely adored being fat and eating so much and her whole lifestyle, she thought it was about time to put a cap on her growth. Like was stated previously, Jafit had little interest in being immobile. She'd roleplay it, sure, but she didn't want to actually BE it. She really valued her ability to walk, thank you very much. How would she be able to clap her ass for her lovers and pin them up against the wall with her bulk if she couldn't get up without help?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, there was a big problem with this. While she didn't want to grow that much bigger, Jafit had little intention of giving up her diet or the supplement, the things that facilitated her massive growth in the first place. Jafit figured she'd be able to maintain her weight without the supplement and a regular diet, but eating normal portions didn't make her horny. Eating 48 glazed donuts in one sitting sure as hell did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, what to do? It seemed like she had two options: give up her lavish lifestyle and maintain her weight OR keep using the supplement and grow as big as a house. However, there was a third option. One Jafit had been planning for a month now. One that would solve all her problems, even the ones not related to her weight. Her plan was...</span></div></div>",

Jafit's wide girth required her to sit across from the other two women, which she looked at straight in the eyes. Alexa and Shiro really didn't know what to expect: the three of them had gone out for girl's nights a few times over the past month, never with an implied ulterior motive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJafit put her hand on her belly, which hung proudly out of her tight red tank top. \"Well... That too.\" She paused briefly, mind wandering to pancakes and then back again to the task at hand. \"I need your help, girls. I have a plan. It's a little bit illegal but you both stand to benefit greatly from it if we pull it off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the plump waitress returned with the drink orders. For Jafit a large strawberry milkshake, a large chocolate milkshake, and a glass of root beer. For Alexa, a Pepsi. For Shiro, ice water. Then, they quickly placed their orders. Alexa ordered a Belgian waffle with bacon and scrambled eggs, Shiro got a grilled chicken salad, and Jafit got... five full stacks of pancakes, three waffles, an order of the French toast (just because she was curious), and a late addition of the \"cupcake pancakes\" because she didn't notice them on the menu at first glance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied with her big order, Jafit was back to business. She sipped one of her milkshakes. \"So, we're gonna do a heist. Of Buttercombe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiro was confused. \"What are we gonna steal from work? Is there anything to steal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Jafit sucked her straw again, giving Alexa the \"fuck me in the bathroom once I'm done eating my mountain of breakfast food\" eyes. \"I'm gonna blackmail the big lady in charge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Polluck? All you need to bribe her is a bucket of nacho cheese. Hell, one of my colleagues got a raise cause she brought her a donut.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, no. I'm talking about Hinamizawa. She's got all the power, Polluck's obviously just a figurehead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiro looked at the quiet Alexa. Neither of them really knew what to say. Alexa broke the silence. \"So, what are we stealing then? Like, are we gonna break into this lady's office and take her files?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, here's the thing. Dr. Hinamizawa is with Yeng. They've got their tentacles all wrapped around Buttercombe now, including around the cafeteria. During my... many~ trips down there I've noticed that they don't prepare the food out in the open. It's all in some secret back room. That food is IMPOSSIBLY good, guys. There's no way they're making such orgasmic mac and cheese with some regular recipe. It's gotta be some weird trade secret they don't want getting out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJafit dumped the rest of her strawberry milkshake down her throat in a quick gulp. \"Ahhh... So, here's the plan. Halloween is in a couple days, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, every year they close campus to keep drunk partiers or whoever from seeping in, but they don't hire more security, meaning the guards that are normally in the building will be outside, way out at the gates. That means security in the building will be at a skeleton crew. So all we have to do is disable the security system and we'll be able to get in, get pictures of whatever's going on in the back room, and get out hopefully without being noticed. Questions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexa rose her hand and Jafit, sipping her second milkshake, called on her. \"How are we gonna, uh, disable the security system? I think that stuff is usually pretty guarded.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've done my research. The controls for the security system are running from a single computer in the IT office. It's a really really old system, for some reason they haven't bothered updating it. I think it's the same version they had when I went to school there, and it was very much outdated then. If we break that computer the day before and make it look like an accident, they won't have enough time to replace it, so the alarms and cameras will all be down for the heist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiro raised her hand. \"So, two questions. One, why do you need me for this? and two, why should I risk my job and prospects and everything for this? What's in it for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so, it's no secret that me and Alexa are both big-butted lazy fatties-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! I'm not that fat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want me to feed you tonight until you are? Shush, cutie. Love you. Anyway, we might need to be fitting through some small passages or lifting heavy things on the optimal route to the cafeteria. You're way smaller and maybe stronger than us, so we need you for that. And as for the second thing, how would you like to go to a REAL med school? With a generous stipend? Instead of micromanaging all the fatasses at Buttercombe? If this works, you won't even need your job anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...\" Shiro was interested, but being caught would spell the death of her. Hmm indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJafit perked up. \"Oh God, I think I see our food. Any more questions before I eat myself into a coma? No? Oh shit I can smell it. Urgh...\"</span></div></div>",

Shiro had gone home to mull it all over, leaving Jafit and Alexa alone in the dorm. Jafit sat back on the couch, idly playing with her deflated, flabby belly which had surged forth from her unzipped khaki shorts long ago. Alexa sat on the armchair next to her, as always mesmerized by Jafit's body, sipping a glass of red wine. Jafit put her finger in her now deep belly button, lifted up her gut and dropped it, letting it hit against her soft thighs with a wet thud. Still looking down at her belly, she responded, \"Yeah, of course I am. How else am I gonna be able to get them to hire you as my personal assistant? 'Uh, yeah hi, I was just wondering if you would add my kinky lesbian lover to the payroll...' No way. Gotta blackmail them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a silence. Both girls were still enraptured by the belly. Jafit just couldn't keep her hands off it. Finally, she broke her stare at her own fat and locked eyes with the girl beside her. She whined in a pouty voice, \"Alexaaaa, I'm booooored.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexa finished off her wine. \"Well, then let's do something. This is the first time you've been bored on a Friday night in a while. Why don't you call up Graham? Mess with him for old times sake?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm tired of Graham. He's basically just a walking penis to me now. Like, if I wanted dick I'd call him, but I don't want dick tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexa chuckled. \"That's harsh, Jafit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's true! Like, all he wants is his cock in my ass. Now, you know I like me some of that, but not every night! I like you better. Sex with you is much less rough on my holes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you wanna fuck then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehhhh... Later. I'm not drunk enough. Let's do something else.\" Jafit lifted herself from the couch, put a hand on her expansive hip, and looked down at Alexa. She noticed she had a look on her face, raising her eyebrows to ask what was up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh... You're just so tall. Like, you're taller than when we met.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! You haven't noticed? Yeah, the supplement makes me grow vertically too, not just horizontally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's hot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled an evil smile. \"You think so? How tall are you, Alexa?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexa knew that smile. Uh oh. \"I'm, uh, 5'1\"\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJafit was excited. \"Ahh!! You're tiny! You're smaller than I thought you were!\" She took a few heavy steps forward, her wide shadow looming over the chair. \"How tall do you think I am?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulp. \"I know this game. What do I have to do if I get it wrong?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wellllllll...\" She put her hand to get chin, pretending to think. She already knew the answer. \"How about if you get it wrong, you're gonna be my little servant for the night. Everything I want, I get. No questions.\" The last time the two of them played this game, Alexa had to feed her Oreo cookies for HOURS. It was incredibly arousing at first, but after a while it just got monotonous. She also ended up getting sat on, which was also arousing at first, but she didn't have the endurance to hold almost 500 pounds of woman indefinitely. Who knows what Queen Jafit will require this time?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexa fires back, \"What if I guess right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJafit thinks for a second, genuinely this time. She comes up short. \"What would you want if you guess right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew what she wanted. \"The same thing, but flipped. YOU be MY servant. I wanna be the dom for once, dammit! Just cause you're bigger than me doesn't mean you get to boss me around all the time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You love it, though!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Yeah I do. I really do. But, like, I want a try!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fineeeee. But you better be kinky if you win! Don't make me do dumb stuff!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I intend to be very kinky. Don't worry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJafit stood up as straight as possible, putting her hands on her sides and puffing out her puffy chest. \"Okay, go! Guess!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexa stood up, taking in the much fatter girl before her in her entirety. Shit, this was harder than it seemed. Might as well blurt something out without thinking. \"I'm gonna say six feet seven inches.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJafit looked like she got the wind knocked out of her. \"You're right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexa jumped into the air, waving her flabby arms around. \"YES!!! YES!!!\" She hopped over to Jafit, pulling her in for a hug, laughing. Jafit looked less than enthused that the power was being taken away from her tonight as Alexa slapped her ass with both hands. \"First you're gonna need to change your clothes. Something...</span></div></div>",

No, she wasn't being beaten with a chair or slapped around. She was doing jumping jacks. With every heavy hop into the air, Jafit's empty belly would jump up and back down, hitting her thighs and wobbling like mad. This was very thrilling for Alexa, who stood opposite of her, marveling at the way her sports bra and booty shorts combo constricted her burgeoning, oversized curves. She licked her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJafit stopped to catch her breath, huffing and puffing heavily. \"Holy shit... How... much longer... am I gonna have... to do these...\" she wheezed as she leaned over, hands on her knees. Alexa wished she wasn't wearing a sports bra so she could see her tits hanging down, but she knew how uncomfortable that would be with them jiggling around so she didn't bother requesting it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not done till you're back down to your original weight, tubby!\" she teased, taking a seat on the rarely-used stool at the kitchen island. Her butt fat spilled from the sides. \"You've gained a loooooot of weight these couple months, Jafit, and you're gonna lose it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm... so... faaaaat... and lazy...\" she managed to eke out between labored breaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexa hopped from her stool and made her way towards the much larger woman. \"Laziness is just attitude, fatty!

Still bent over, she wiggled her vast hips, invitingly jiggling her glorious ass for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexa didn't break. She scowled. \"Those both have very high caloric content.

Not being that familiar with the menu, Alexa bought what she thought Jafit would appreciate: the largest meal on the menu. 16 pieces of golden brown fried chicken, 4 large sides of mac and cheese (Alexa knew of Jafit's addiction to the Buttercombe cafeteria's macaroni. Hopefully the Colonel's would hold a candle.), and eight fluffy, crumbly biscuits. She also got a 2 liter of Mountain Dew but since Jafit wanted beer she figured she'd stash it in the fridge just in case. Jafit laid face-up like a starfish on the carpet, sweat dripping from her overtaxed, out of shape body like a cold drink on a hot day. Though typically her darker complexion hid it, the redness of her somewhat chubby face couldn't be denied. She was pooped, but Alexa wasn't nearly satisfied with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexa sat her tubby butt down onto Jafit's belly, eliciting a tired \"oof\" from the sweaty girl as she placed the food beside her. She leaned forward over her mountainous breasts, kept in form by their bra, and planted a sensuous kiss onto her lips, then another. She pulled back from Jafit's mouth which clearly was expecting more and put a finger to it, shushing her. \"From now on you're not allowed to speak unless I give you permission. Talking privileges are for girls who DON'T make a comfortable seat.\" She grinded her hips a little bit against her gut to hammer home just how nice it felt for her. She opened the top of the KFC bucket, letting its delightful scent waft through the room and continued, \"I got you this food as a reward. Do you smell it?\" Jafit nodded, her double chin bunching against her neck. \"Good. You're gonna do sit-ups now. Every time you do a sit-up, you get a bite of chicken. Every piece you manage to fit in your fat stomach will get you beer and maccy cheese, force fed sweetly and lovingly into your gullet. You can burp, you can moan, you can orgasm. But if I hear one actual word from that mouth of yours I'm gonna sit my chubby ass back down on this belly. I don't know what'll happen if I do that but I'm sure it won't be pretty. Oh, and none of that supplement this time. I don't think I've ever seen you ACTUALLY full to your limit and that's gonna change tonight. You need to eat calories to burn them, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe removed herself from her seat and helped the eerily silent big girl into sit-up position. She then picked the first drumstick from there bucket and waved it in the air. She gave an impatient \"Go ahead!\" and Jafit began the routine...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the new term at Buttercombe continued, Jafit quickly felt herself settling back into the usual routine that she had built for herself at the academy.<br>\r\nA good chunk of her time consisted of teaching, be it her cookery classes or the Israeli language classes she also conducted. Following that, she spent some time hanging out with other teachers and members of staff. In her five years teaching, Jafit had not spent a significant amount of time socialising with her colleagues but this year seemed to be different. She was often invited to meals with other teachers and on a few occasions she had also been invited over to visit friends after hours in their private flats where, unsurprisingly, food also played a part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for the rest of her time, of which she set aside as much as possible, Jafit spent hours in her own home in various states of undress and gorging on all manner of foods whilst continuously adding her 'supplement' wherever possible. In the few short weeks since Dr Hinamizawa had supplied her with the wonder chemical that faithful day at the start of term, Jafit had become completely and hopelessly addicted to the stuff. Finding arousal in being stuffed completely and blindly infatuated by her body there was rarely a time where the Israeli-Spaniard did not ingest some of the powder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now we come to this particular day, about a month since Hinamizawa had been to see Miss Gamor.<br>\r\nThere was a click as Jafit turned the key in her door, allowing her to bump it with her hip to grant herself access to her flat. Her hip had to do the work as, once the tanned beauty had entered the room, it became clear she was carrying something in each arm, more specifically two bulging bags of takeaway from the canteen consisting of burgers, fried chicken and fries to boot.<br>\r\nWithout hesitation, Jafit dropped her spoils onto a work surface before turning to her fridge in one swift movement. With a hand placed on the handle to the fridge, Jafit hesitated before taking her hand away and grabbing hold of her white sun dress and pulling it clear over her head, tussling her hair slightly as she did. Now only clad in underwear, the passage of time became clear after looking at the cook's profile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResuming her notion towards the fridge, Jafit's already immense arse wobbled like jelly with each cheek fighting for dominance as she stepped with the bulging assets gently slapping against each other. Unable to convincingly assert dominance over each other, her bulging arse cheeks had successfully overruled her poor thong as it disappeared between the plump mounds at her back. Although her thighs were getting thicker, her back was forming cute rolls of fat under her bra strap and her hips were competing with the girth of her arse whilst still trailing behind slightly, nothing compared to the shelf forming between the small of the Spaniard's back and her ever swelling cheeks.<br>\r\nAt this point, the renowned chef bent over to rummage in the fridge only enhancing her bulging behind even more before shooting up straight and turning on her heels, giving an impressive display of her ever increasing front.<br>\r\nJafit's natural hourglass enhanced chest had swelled up in the past month, forcing her to go up an extra cup size and, when left unsupported, the outward swell of each boob was visible when looking at Jafit from behind, particularly when she was on the move as the jiggled.<br>\r\nSurprisingly though, her boobs were not the most remarkable thing about her front side as, for the first time in her life, Jafit was developing a belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time passed and as Jafit ate more and more her stomach had stretched and swelled which, combined with her supplement addiction, eventually resulted in her stomach starting to accumulate fat. In turn, a belly soon formed and her fertility goddess figure continued to expand. At first the appearance of a belly surprised Jafit having only had fat hips and boobs to that point but, within a few days, the dark haired beauty accepted it and seemed to indulge further in her continued growth.<br>\r\nThat had been a couple of weeks ago and now, with her enhanced appetite combined with the supplement working behind the scenes to distribute fat quicker than average, Jafit sported something of a soft pot belly. Were it not for her huge bosom, her belly would stand out ahead of her by quite some distance but her ample chest still overshadows the bulging middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, stood before her fridge with a large pitcher of supplement infused whole milk, Jafit brought the container to her lips and started to drink fast and deeply. With a new found proficiency the entire pitcher disappeared in a small amount of time without a single spill before being tossed to one side as the hunger built inside her. With a lustfull glance towards her food, Jafit clambered up on the worktop and, from her knees with her huge arse rested on her feet, tore into the first bag.<br>\r\nWith a burger in each hand, Jafit hungrily bit into each one with grease dribbling down her chin into her cleavage as she continued to practically inhaling the thick burgers as she chewed. Moaning in ecstasy, the Spaniard loaded more and more food into her hungry mouth throwing in the occasional belly rub or groping of a massive boob.<br>\r\nIn no time, Jafit's takeaway food was consumed leaving the woman with a glazed look as her stomach growled more, still desperately hungry.<br>\r\nIn autopilot Jafit reached over the counter to the fridge, pulled the door open and discovered a boxed cheesecake in there for the taking. Without hesitation, the cheesecake was dropped on the surface before the blossoming chef as she dropped onto all fours pushing her face into the dense creamy dessert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn mere moments the cheesecake was practically gone, and in an hungry frenzy, Jafit reached into her fridge once again which, to her surprise, provided another cheesecake. First, she hungrily licked the box of the first clean before tossing that away, tearing open the second fresh cake and plunging her face into the smooth surface.<br>\r\nIn reality, this binge carried on extensively with the Spaniard devouring two tubs of ice cream, a dozen doughnuts and a dense chocolate cake that had been baked in one of her classes earlier that day. The end result was impressive. Sat panting on top of the worktop whilst licking the cake plate clean, Jafit could feel her heavy belly resting on her lap prompting her to start to rub it quite forcefully for her own entertainment. Discarding the cake plate, the overstuffed teacher noticed a rogue doughnut a good arms reach away. Eyes burning with hungry desire, Jafit leaned forward, feeling her stomach slap against the work surface as she reached for the pastry. Still unable to reach she pushed forward, rolling on her immense belly, which forced out a loud moan of pleasure before finally clutching onto the sweet delight before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling triumphant, Jafit bit into the doughnut and allowed her hand to wander down, past her belly and between her thick juicy thighs...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartled out of her moment of self gratification, Jafit glanced at her door cautiously.<br>\r\n\"Come in?\" she called out, not entirely sure if someone had actually knocked.<br>\r\nSomeone had. Dr Hinamizawa specifically.<br>\r\n\"Good afternoon dear\" called out the senior member of staff, turning the corner through the door suddenly seeing the enogrged chef perched on top of her worktop, covered in remnants of her feast with little clothing on her body.<br>\r\n\"Oh...sorry, I can come back later?\" suggested Hinamizawa, subtly making mental notes of the bloated Spaniard's state.<br>\r\n\"Oh no, please come in. How may I help you doctor?\" asked Jafit, finishing her doughnut and then gently holding her belly<br>\r\n\"Well I won't be long, I just wanted to see how you're doing with our little project AND had something to offer you\" replied Hinamizawa, dropping a box onto the worktop before Jafit.<br>\r\nInterest piqued now, Jafit shuffled slightly closer on her immense bum but remaining sat on the worktop, albeit on the edge now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I assume you have been testing out the supplement I brought you a month ago?\" inquired the doctor, obviously aware Jafit had but felt the need to be subtle about it.<br>\r\nJafit simply nodded, trying to gain a look into the box that had been delivered.<br>\r\n\"Well, after some internal testing our scientists have done some refining with the formula and we wanted you to test it for us. Feel free to finish the old stock but we would like you to start working with this new batch as soon as possible\". Hinamizawa smiled warmly and reassuringly at the bloated chef, nudging the box closer to her to look.<br>\r\n\"Oh sure, I would be happy to help out with that\" Jafit mused softly, not entirely concentrating on the conversation as her mind wandered at the possibilities with a new formula.<br>\r\n\"Wonderful! I hope you enjoy it\" cooed the doctor, starting to turn to leave.<br>\r\n\"Oh before I go, Nurse Fukiyama said she'd noticed you'd gained some weight and wondered if you knew how much you weighed now? Just to keep your record up to date\" Hinamizawa asked innocently.<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, this morning I was...237lbs\" answered Jafit, cradling her belly fondly.<br>\r\n\"Great, I'll be sure to pass on the information\" smiled Hinamizawa, turning to leave again \"might I say, you are looking stunning Miss Gamor, colleague to colleague that is\"<br>\r\nJafit didn't even blush as she felt well aware of her physical attractiveness.<br>\r\n\"Why thank you, enjoy the rest of the day\" said the bloated chef, yearning to try the new supplement in peace.<br>\r\n\"You too Miss Gamor\" called Hinamizawa, closing the apartment door as she left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, she's got the new batch\" muttered Hinamizawa into her phone \"she's definitely using it on herself, not sure about others yet but time will tell\"<br>\r\nLent against a wall as she talked, the doctor glanced at passers by with a wry smile<br>\r\n\"Uh huh, yeah I think we need to start thinking about a public release for this stuff soon\" said Hinamizawa, an almost wicked glimmer flashing through her eyes.</span></div></div>",

Extremely reliable and prone to excelling at everything thrown her way, she was a people pleaser through and through. With never a grumble or complain, the young assistant had doted upon her many superiors in her time at Buttercombe with nothing but praise been thrown at her and about her.<br>\r\nSuch acclamation had caught Hinamizawa's attention giving Felicity a special place in the doctor's approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, it had not gone unnoticed that her attention to detail within her role had also proven consequential in accelerating her necessity.<br>\r\nWith wholly innocent intentions and only a well meaning duty of care, Felicity had garnered something of a reputation as an accidental feeder...in the overseeing eyes of Dr Hinamizawa at least who had watched the young girl doing her job whilst relishing in the expansion her do-gooder attitude reaped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer case was also helped by her stature allowing her to GIVE assistance rather than needing to RECEIVE it, much unlike most of the other T/PA girls who had ballooned in the role.<br>\r\nDespite the length of her tenure, Felicity had, remarkably, maintained her svelte slender physique.<br>\r\nNever one to exercise excessively, the T/PA had miraciously stayed put at a tiny 117lbs which, combined with her 5'8 height, made for something of an anomaly within the academy and one of the lightest residents, even amongst fresh faced freshers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway...<br>\r\nWith burning auburn locks cascading between her shoulders and a swing in her step, it was taking all her will power to not run as fast as she could to pound on Jafit Gamor's apartment door.<br>\r\nShe had been instructed to meet the cookery tutor at her apartment so that the pair could get to know each other outside of the classroom and start to develop a plan of how best Felicity would be able to serve the tutor in her daily routines.<br>\r\nThe professional aspect of the trip was struggling to cling on desperately as the red head's mind was racing with all the things she wanted to talk about with the renowned chef.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs something of an amatuer cook, Felicity had long aspired to meet the famous Israeli Spaniard.<br>\r\nHaving once idolised the likes of Nigella, Felicity's focus had switched to Jafit whilst she was at college and the young girl soon found herself in awe of the exotic woman's ability and flair.<br>\r\nSince then, she had collected every single one of Jafit's books and had been dying to meet her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWords could not describe the happy coincidence of Felicity discovering that Jafit had taken up tenure at Buttercombe and had made it her personal goal to be granted the chance to work by her side.<br>\r\nAlthough they had crossed paths on occasion, these meetings were only chance, fleeting and non-vocal as the red head was overcome with nerves in light of her hero and never took the chance to speak to the chef.<br>\r\nNow though, she had been delivered her idol on a plate and they would be spending ALOT of time together.<br>\r\nHopefully...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarting and weaving between the crowds of people in the corridors, Felicity carefully navigated herself towards her new target, lost in her own world still as she meandered the sea of people.<br>\r\nA couple of previously assigned tutors called to the red head as she walked but, so lazer focused, the T/PA soldiered on through without breaking her gaze from her path.<br>\r\nFinally, as she crossed the glaringly obvious division from the school's original architecture and into the much newer living quarters that had been built alongside the original structure, Felicity found herself sweeping side to side on the hunt for one very particular door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I wonder if she'll recognise me?' mused the red head to herself as she scanned door after door.<br>\r\nShaking her head to answer her own question, Felicity powered on, realising she was on the wrong floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, I wonder if she'll sign a book at least...or maybe all of them...'. Still lost in thought, the young assistant bit her lip in cautious contemplation as her nerves started to build, her feet pounding against the marble stairs as she ascended to the right floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing the door open with the palm of her hand, Felicity stepped out onto the right floor before taking a gentle deep breath. This was it.<br>\r\nAs she slowly wandered down the corridor, the thoughts continued to pour in.<br>\r\n'Surely we'll at least be able to talk recipes and cooking, right?' pondered the red head as she found herself outside of the door<br>\r\n\"Here goes nothing\" whispered Felicity, to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in!\" came the silky accented voice from within in response to the knock at the door.<br>\r\nWith as little hesitation as she could muster, Felicity proceeded to allow herself into the apartment only to find herself halting again after crossing the threshold.<br>\r\nEyes fixed wide, Felicity found herself unable to even blink as Jafit stood up from her sofa and THEN proceeded to grab a delicate velvet robe from the arm of another chair and put it on.<br>\r\nNot before giving the young assistant an absolute eye full of her naked ripened figure, mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompletely stunned on the spot, Felicity was unable to move as Jafit approached her before turning sharply into the kitchen, everything bouncing or jiggling as she went.<br>\r\n\"Please, sit down whilst I get us some refreshments\" purred Jafit from inside the fridge, long tanned fingers clasping the door whilst her sizeable rear arched into the air, a telling line of an undergarment struggling for dear life encasing the immense wobbling cheeks.<br>\r\n'Wowsers, that never happened on TV' internally gasped Felicity as she awkwardly and rigidly trotted to the sofa, scared that too brisk a movement would cause a through draft and blow her idol's robe clean off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before the celebrity chef returned to the sofa though, a large glass in each hand along with distinct evidence that Miss Gamor was not a believer in robe ties, allowing for her rounded stomach to distend past the limits of the thin material in an almost elegant sunkissed curve.<br>\r\nGod only knows what miracle was implored to prevent the chef from exposing herself more as the flimsy gown clung to her breasts, each boob, Felicity noted, appeared to be bigger than her own head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now darling, I know you're here to work but I'm relaxing so let's not be too serious, ok?\" cooed Jafit, an air of arousal radiating from the exotic kitchen maestro.<br>\r\n\"S...Su...Sure\" stumbled Felicity, trying not to stare too intently or directly as she spoke.<br>\r\n\"Excellent!\" cheered Jafit before thrusting one of the glasses into Felicity's hands \"So, drink that and get us something to eat yes?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure\" nodded the red head, confidence growing again slightly as her professional head started to take over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout hesitating, the moxy assistant strode to the kitchen, glass in hand before calling over her shoulder \"What can I get you Miss Gamor?\"<br>\r\n\"Please no 'Miss', we're going to be friends yeah? Call me Jafit\" interjected Jafit from her seat on the sofa, half of the contents of her glass already gone with a slither of it remaining around her lips \"and just bring everything\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Everything?' asked Felicity to herself 'surely not'<br>\r\nAs she continued to muse, the red head took a tentative drink from her glass.<br>\r\nAs she poured over the many cupboards, finding shelves and shelves of food, Felicity couldn't help but think her new senior was exagerating about bringing 'everything'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, you wanted...everything?\" asked the assistant, searching for confirmation whilst taking another sip from her glass<br>\r\n\"Absolutely, you don't have to bring it all now though\" smiled Jafit, gently rubbing her stomach as she spoke<br>\r\n\"M'kay...\" muttered Felicity as she grabbed a dense square ginger cake from one shelf, taking a much larger sip from her glass as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ok in there Fiona?\" asked Jafit, a little concerned, mostly due to her growing hunger which had not be sated yet.<br>\r\n\"Absolutely fine\" bubbled the red head as she marched back to the living room, arms laden with a multitude of food items \"and its, erm...Felicity by the way...\" corrected the younger girl as she dumped the items on the middle cushion that would be between the two women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sorry dear, I do get confused when I'm hungry\" replied Jafit, with a small smile \"do sit down\"<br>\r\n\"Just a moment\" responded Felicity, rocking on her feet slightly \"I was just going to top up my glass, this stuff is delicious\" she smiled as she showed off her drained glass<br>\r\n\"Isn't it?\" smiled Jafit, knowing all too well why \"Do get me one also whilst you're there?\"<br>\r\n\"Will do, Jafit\" smiled Felicity as she took the tutors glass from her and pranced back to the kitchen.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The past couple of weeks had been rather intense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a fairly seasoned T/PA, Felicity was more than accustomed to the hearty appetites of the corpulent staff and the obscene quantities of food that came with that territory.<br>\r\nJafit Gamor was proving to be a whole different experience though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow is it going in there Felicity?\u201d called Jafit from her plush sofa perch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNearly there...Jafit\u201d replied the young assistant as she peered into the oven, looking over her creations.<br>\r\nThe redhead\u2019s professionalism had jarred at the prospect of calling her superior by her first name but, not one to decline a request, Felicity found herself unable to stop referring to the plumpening teacher as such.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny ill feelings were quashed swiftly in light of their arrangement though as the two settled in to each other\u2019s rhythm.<br>\r\nFelicity\u2019s nerves were also settled after her first successful offering of food as prepared by herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dream was truly coming together, working alongside her idol and THEN getting to cook for her...Felicity had never enjoyed her job so much as she did right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThose smells are quite...delightful\u201d purred the Israeli Spaniard from her seat, a gentle movement causing the furnishing to creak softly beneath her bulk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you approve Mis...Jafit, I hope it tastes as well as it smells\u201d smiled Felicity, thinking back to that first meal.<br>\r\nThe poor girl had tentatively set the plate before her senior and then stood back like any nervous waitress at a Michelin restaurant.<br>\r\nHer nerves were misplaced though as Jafit had not only devoured the offering but also requested more...multiple times over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had all fallen into place from there really.<br>\r\nFelicity had taken to cooking and baking for Jafit everyday as part of her assistance duties and Jafit had continued to slobber over said cooking, literally and figuratively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, I hope you\u2019re ready\u201d called Felicity, bobbing up from the oven as she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlways, my dear\u201d cooed the ever silky Jafit as she delicately swing her legs from the sofa and placed her feet gently onto the hardwood floor beneath, awaiting her feast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell here it comes\u201d returned Felicity, arms laden with an array of foods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJafit hungrily licked her lips as plates were placed before her, filling her nostrils even more so with the beautiful aromas she had already tapped into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicity wandered back and forth more than once with additional plates as the food piled up before her superior.<br>\r\nMeats<br>\r\nSausages<br>\r\nThree types of potato<br>\r\nCauliflower cheese that was more cheese than cauliflower<br>\r\nAnd, of course, the obligatory pitcher of Jafit\u2019s supplement infused full fat milk<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh you have outdone yourself today, my dear\u201d purred Jafit, hungrily leaning over the table before her and inhaling deeply<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicity smiled to herself whilst holding her hands behind her back<br>\r\n\u201cWell I am here to assist\u201d prattled the redhead automatically \u201cplease tuck in before it gets cold\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun kissed tutor did not need telling twice as she immediately dove in, tearing bites from as much as she could fit into her mouth at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Felicity looked over her, inadvertently acquired, friend, she couldn\u2019t help but notice the tanned woman before her was ever more present, even compared to their first meeting but a couple of weeks before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true, Jafit Gamor was still expanding at a steady rate, undoubtedly assisted by Felicity\u2019s near constant attention.<br>\r\nWith Felicity on beck and call, Jafit had found little reason to over exert herself whenever possible which only continued to influence her growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Felicity able to cover her classes, provide her with food and collect anything she may require, the Israeli Spaniard was living like a Roman empress, reclined seating and skimpy robes to boot.<br>\r\nSkimpy was proving more and more apparent as the days rolled by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe uncontrollable combination of her swelling backside, enormous breasts and rapidly catching up belly had meant that not a single piece of Jafit\u2019s wardrobe fit her properly, least of all her favourite silk robes which rarely found themselves tied, never mind held around the buxom woman\u2019s figure.<br>\r\nAs such, her exhibitionist tendencies had only increased as Felicty became more ingrained in her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, Felicty had become accustomed to seeing bulges of flesh usually left covered even by the largest of her clients, and the more intimate features of Jafit\u2019s body but found she was able to gloss over most occurrences.<br>\r\nAll the while, Jafit wasn\u2019t phased at all and, to a more suspicious eye, may have even taken enjoyment from her flashes of exhibition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo say Jafit was the only one to expand since their partnership began would be a little cruel though and, for the first time in her extensive career at Buttercombe, Felicity had gained weight.<br>\r\nIn the grand scheme of things, most people wouldn\u2019t notice and, given the general audience of the institute, Felicity\u2019s measly 15lbs was hardly cause for concern.<br>\r\nFelicity, however, had noticed and was feeling a little more shy about it than her employ.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe younger girl did find the sudden swell rather strange having never gained weight before, but she knew that Jafit\u2019s influence was not a limited one and she only had her own will power to blame for the extra weight that had settled around her middle quite comfortably.<br>\r\nShe couldn\u2019t help but notice that she was most hungry after drinking some of that peculiar milk that her assigned tutor was so fond of though...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease do help yourself Felicity, you\u2019ve worked so hard\u201d purred Jafit between mouthfuls, glancing over her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I shouldn\u2019t, this is only lunch after all and I have other teachers to see this afternoon\u201d nervously responded Felicity, hoping to avoid another serious binge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh nonsense, you must eat otherwise you\u2019re no help to anyone\u201d replied Jafit, rather sternly \u201csit\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh fine\u201d conceded Felicity with a smile as she circled the sofa and plonking next to Jafit, noticing a rather prominent caramel coloured muffin top engulfing the teachers hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood\u201d smiled Jafit as she returned to her own gorging, the aforementioned muffin top swelling outwardly as the owner of said feature lent forward \u201cI did prepare some eclairs for us to enjoy after as well\u201d continued the culinary teacher with a gentle stroke to Felicity\u2019s arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds lovely\u201d responded Felicity, a touch of nerves still niggling in her mind as she automatically took to pouring herself a glass of milk without thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Oh boy\u2019 thought the young assistant as the milk passed her lips and her hunger kicked in from nowhere just moments before her hands were reaching for various morsels of food laid out before her.</span></div></div>",

her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh but we were having such a good time were we not?\" asked Jafit, her smooth accent flowing warmly through Felicity's ears in a way she wished it wouldn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, we were, but unfortunately I have to do my job otherwise I'll be kicked out of the academy\" sighed the redheaded assistant as she glanced down at her feet, not wanting to make eye contact with Miss Gamor.<br>\r\nThings HAD been going incredibly well and the friendship forming between teacher and assistant was more than Felicity had ever dreamed of when it came to her culinary idol, but unfortunately the decision was not hers to make.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I suppose I can not ask you to risk your career\" nodded Jafit slowly \"you would always be welcome to visit me though, especially if you brought some food along\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicity couldn't help but smile at this point as her mind played a memory reel of their times eating and laughing together.<br>\r\nA casual hand grazed the younger girl's stomach as she reminisced, memories were not the only thing she took away from this experience after all.<br>\r\nWith her figure looking slightly fuller still, a moment of realisation had allowed Felicity to reign in her habits marginally and only add a further 5 pounds to her svelte frame but that was plenty more for the redhead's liking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, however, her superior had certainly not held back in the same time and, if anything, seemed to gain even faster.<br>\r\n\"274\" the Mediterranean beauty had proudly declared only the day before to a vaguely listening Felicity who was far more occupied with a large slice of chocolate cake.<br>\r\nIn a strange way, Felicity actually envied Jafit's apparent ease of mind when it came to her weight, hell, she even seemed to enjoy getting bigger as the days rolled by.<br>\r\nAs the pounds kept coming though, so did the inches and, as such, Jafit's ample body just kept growing outwards in outrageous bulging curves that she was not afraid to display at every opportunity in the name of staying comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealising a gap had formed in the conversation as she wandered with her thoughts, Felicity hurriedly responded the the kind offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would like that alot, I'd hate for our friendship to suffer from me not seeing you every day\" smiled the assistant, feeling slightly more at ease at revealing her reallocation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely not!\" beamed Jafit \"please do not be a stranger, particularly with those cooking skills of yours\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok then, I won't\" replied Felicity, truly at ease now knowing she hadn't ruined her chances with staying in contact with the celebrity chef before her.<br>\r\n\"Well, I really must be off now, new clients to get accustomed to and all that\" announced Felicity in a jokey manner so as not to sound rude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, don't let me keep you, can't have you getting fired now\" nodded Jafit as she sashayed towards the redhead, wrapping her in a warm and exceptionally soft embrace<br>\r\nFelicity took a moment to enjoy the contact, intoxicated by how curvy Jafit really was before allowing herself to be released to head for the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, before I go\" started Felicity, turning away from the door \"you have a class at 3pm but you won't have any preparation as the girls are just practicing desserts and sweets for you to assess\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds lovely\" smiled Jafit, an easy class to get back into things sounded perfect<br>\r\nFelicity nervously smiled as she turned to the door again, promptly opening it and departing down the hallway before the door even clicked shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such a sweet girl\" mused Jafit to herself as she turned away from the spot that her former assistant had been stood and made a beeline for her plush sofa.<br>\r\nAs the zaftig woman plopped herself down quite heavily she glanced at the clock mounted on the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'11:30, I have some time' smiled the teacher as she slowly returned to her feet and made her way into the kitchen.<br>\r\nAlthough the prospect of having to work without Felicity's aid, Jafit felt rather content with the situation as she automatically prepared herself something to eat and, of course, something to drink.<br>\r\nAs the buxom chef made her way back to her seat she couldn't help but smile to herself...<br>\r\n'Besides, three hours seems like a fitting send off feast for such a good friend'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***********<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhilst working for Jafit, part of Felicity's role had included keeping on top of the teacher's wardrobe requirements for the few occasions when she had left her apartment and, although a tricky task to gauge, the redhead had done as good a job as anybody could.<br>\r\nWith careful monitoring and adherement to Jafit's particular styles, her assistant had done a fine job in keeping her clothed and rather sexy if the chef dared add herself, even if her current run of clothing was starting to pinch a little bit in places.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWere she less amorous about her weight at this point though, Jafit might have been more concerned about the skimpiness of her outfit rather than its actual appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn this particular day, Jafit had chosen (read: struggled to fit into anything other than) an obscenely tight pair of black jeans that hugged her thickening legs and enormous rear so closely they looked painted onto her olive skin.<br>\r\nAlthough partly concealed by a full length cardigan draped over her shoulders, Jafit's upper half was barely more decent as she donned a navy blue cropped satin shirt which only served to draw any wandering eyes to her chest which was accented by the material crossing over her hulking breasts, whilst cavernous cleavage bounced with each thigh rubbing step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cropped element of her shirt did nothing to conceal the thick roll of tanned belly fat that was currently spilling out of her outfit.<br>\r\nIn keeping with her natural figure, her middle did still taper inwards at her waist to maintain her hourglass figure but this simply accentuated the size of her muffin top and belly as they jiggled above her denim waistband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless of any onlookers opinions of her, Jafit Gamor still felt like a queen as she strode into her culinary class, swiftly pushing the last bite of doughnut between her plump lips as she crossed the threshold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good afternoon girls, I'm sorry I've not been with you much as of late\" apologised Jafit as she swallowed her breakroom doughtnut behind her slender fingers, heading towards her desk at the front of the class as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez, she might not be as big as Walker but she's piling it on don't you think?\" whispered an all too familiar girl to her friend next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're one to talk Tabs\" smirked the other girl, jabbing the first gently in the hip<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh piss off Sapphire\" hissed Tabitha, not too impressed at having her hypocrisy called out like that \"You're hardly a beanpole these days\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough true, Sapphire was, in comparison to Tabitha, much more shapely and akin to Jafit herself in her weight gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I disturbing you ladies at the back?\" called Jafit, having noticed the two girls bickering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Miss!\" chimed the pair in well practiced unison, having often caught the wrong eye of their teachers in the past<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well see me after class all the same\" retorted Jafit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly silenced, the two girls scowled their discontent straight forward with no response from their disciplining teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, as I was saying, I understand you are all practice desserts and other such sweet treats so please just get on with your tasks and don't forget to enjoy your baking!\" smiled Jafit as she ushered her class to their tasks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching carefully as the students took to their cooking, Jafit drew a insulated mug from her bag and placed it on her desk after taking a long drag from it.<br>\r\nTo any passer by, the mug was likely to contain coffee to help the Spaniard through her class although Felicity would be able to tell anyone that it actually contained the teacher's favourite milk concoction.<br>\r\nAn addict has to feed the habit after all, even if she has a job to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jafit lent back in her chair, she smiled softly, remembering how much she actually enjoyed teaching.<br>\r\nAs fun as binging day in day out had become to her, and still was for that matter, her true love was sharing her talent with others who were willing to learn.<br>\r\nBesides, she stood to get food aplenty out of the position anyway so two birds with one stone right?</span></div></div>",

Buttercombe tutelage together as close knit friends, the pair had settled into a very mundane routine of going to classes, passing said classes and indulging in their shared past time of the schools meal plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving met in the great hall during their welcome feast as lowly freshmen, the two girls had rarely found a time to be separated forming a deeply rooted friendship over the years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhilst proving to be a beneficial relationship when it came to muddling through class assignments, a rather unexpected (albeit predictable) side effect had been their combined self gratifying tendencies had seen the pair enjoy typical Buttercombe figures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTabitha was a near spitting image of her mother, raven black hair, piercing green eyes, slender sculpted facial features and exceptionally bottom heavy.<br>\r\nNaturally, her youth garnered a degree of perkiness and sprightly beauty her mother no longer possessed, not to mention the nose ring that her mother didn\u2019t approve of, but Tabitha was undoubtedly her mother\u2019s daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the pounds started to accumulate, Tabitha\u2019s rear ballooned into a matching pair of wobbling, cellulite dappled cheeks that outgrew every skirt she owned.<br>\r\nHer vast thunderous thighs saw to it that any remaining flow in her skirts was vanquished, leaving the material to cling to her lower half when the black haired girl stood still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side stood Sapphire who wasn\u2019t quite as straight laced as Tabitha was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ombr\u00e9 styled brunette senior also donned a nose ring but, in contrast, her mother supported it whole heartedly.<br>\r\nJust that afternoon before Miss Gamor\u2019s class, Sapphire had been telling Tabitha how her own mother had booked tickets to go to a music festival, just the two of them, after having such a good time this summer at one such event.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOddly for most parents, Sapphire\u2019s mum had also proven nothing but supportive of her daughter\u2019s...expansion at school which probably went a long way to enhance Sapphire\u2019s natural gluttony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat and her luck in the genes department certainly wouldn\u2019t slow a girl down at any rate.<br>\r\nIn contrast to the increasingly bottom heavy Tabitha, Sapphire had been fortunate enough to develop much more evenly giving her a very full senior class hourglass figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs well as being a notorious skirt stretcher alongside her best friend, Sapphire had a reputation as a sweater stretcher as well having given many a student and member of staff an eyeful when failing to stay ahead with her wardrobe sufficiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her natural curves however, Sapphire\u2019s great gluts had also gifted her quite the pot belly to round out her figure and sported a much fuller face than Tabitha, even if her roundness of cheeks and the hint of a double chin only enhanced her appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***********<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings were not always glitz and glamour for the two girls though and, with a penchant for gossiping, had found themselves staying after class with Jafit Gamor having being caught disrupting her lesson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, despite her earlier sternness on the matter, Jafit was now far too occupied with devouring the many delicacies the class had prepared for her to even notice the two girls stood before her desk.<br>\r\nBrazen as ever in her own self comfort, Jafit had even popped the button on her jeans to allow her bulging stomach to sit freely on her lap whilst her already limited shirt rose that bit higher over the bulge of fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhem, you wanted to see us miss?\u201d interjected Tabitha by means of clearing her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sudden sound seemed to nearly startle Jafit as she slowly tilted what appeared to be a trifle towards her lips.<br>\r\nSitting the container to one side for now and hungrily licking her lips, Jafit then cleared her own throat before proceeding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh yes, sorry to have you wait\u201d began the tanned chef, idly laying a hand across her bloated middle \u201cplease don\u2019t talk whilst I\u2019m trying to teach you, ok?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry miss\u201d chorused the two girls, sending a greater telling off was yet to come<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat\u201d purred Jafit before scooping up her trifle dish once more<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTabitha and Sapphire looked at each other, unsure of how to proceed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, do we not have detention or something?\u201d pried Sapphire, fiddling with her fingers as she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm?\u201d mutter Jafit as a line of custard escaped her mouth \u201coh no, you may go, no trouble today\u201d<br>\r\nThe culinary teacher offered a rather disarming smile to the two students before returning to her dessert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, confused and unsure, the two girls looked to each other before stepping away and heading for the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cErm, ok, we\u2019ll see you next week miss\u201d called Tabitha as she crossed the threshold of the classroom<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarely noticeable past the sizeable glass dish in front of her face, Jafit simply nodded, not wishing to break off her feast any more than she already had done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUrgh, what a crazy bitch\u201d declared Sapphire as she tussled her hair in the bathroom mirror over the sink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, at least we didn\u2019t get into trouble\u201d retorted Tabitha as she also looked at her reflection with her belly gently grazing the cool ceramic in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean, we were nearly late to dinner because we spent 10 minutes watching her gorge herself\u201d sighed Sapphire, turning to face the room as a whole with her shapely rear perched on the sink behind her as a faint gurgle of hunger rang from her own swollen middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know! The irony\u201d muttered Tabitha as she slowly reapplied her eyeline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we did get something out of all this\u201d chirped Sapphire as a grin adorned her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah, what\u2019s that then?\u201d asked the raven haired girl as she turned to face her friend, seeing a shiny silver insulated mug in her friends hand \u201coh Saph, you didn\u2019t steal Miss Gamor\u2019s mug now did you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTotally\u201d beamed the spunky brunette \u201cI mean, the way she honks down on this thing it\u2019s got to be booze or something right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know...\u201d Tabitha faltered. Although she got into trouble semi frequently, she didn\u2019t enjoy it and much preferred to stay on teacher\u2019s good sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh come on, let\u2019s give it a go\u201d goaded Sapphire, shaking the mug in front of her friend as she did \u201ccall it retribution\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cErm...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk look, I\u2019ll drink half, then you finish it off and THEN we\u2019ll go for dinner, ok?\u201d<br>\r\nSapphire knew that Tabitha could be a little flakey when it came to rule breaking so figured a little incentive would go a long way to helping her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelenting to the offer, Tabitha modded \u201cfine, but you go first\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDeal\u201d smiled Sapphire before swiftly putting the mug to her lips and throwing her head back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment passed as the brunette chugged but it wasn\u2019t long before the vessel was being passed over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho knew Miss Gamor drank like a Russian, tastes like cream or milk or something\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather unclear on the reference, Tabitha found solace in knowing the liquid tasted of dairy product and followed suit, draining the mug in quick succession.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, that\u2019s really nice\u201d mused Tabitha as she set the mug down on one of the sinks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight? Now come on, I am absolutely starving\u201d purred Sapphire, swiping the mug back into her bag and grabbing Tabitha by the arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe too, swear I wasn\u2019t this hungry a moment ago...\u201d pondered the dark haired senior<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHurry up!\u201d shouted Sapphire, her zaftig figure already bee lining for the bathroom door<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Tabs!\" she hissed at her dark haired friend whilst jabbing her in her flabby arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What now?\" groaned Tabitha, enthusiasm the last thing on her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They've got steak AND that cheesy pasta they bring out every so often\" chirped the hourglass shaped girl with a great deal of insistence in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?!\" squawked Tabitha, suddenly more engaged in the conversation at the declaration of her favourite food being on offer for the first time in weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really!\" repeated Sapphire as she turned back to the face the queue again, accidently nudging her vast belly into the back of an unsuspecting Freshman<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, sorry kid\" purred Sapphire as the thin girl looked at her like a deer in the headlights \"its a special day today, you'll see\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Freshmen, they just don't get it\" joked Sapphire with a sly glance back to her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTabitha could only nod as the aroma of cheese filled her nostrils and her inflated hunger growled once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urgh finally\" sighed Sapphire as she heavily sat on one of the benches laid out, a deep groan radiating from the wood as it braced against her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know right\" mumbled Tabitha, insighting a similar reaction from the opposing seat as she sat to face her friend so that they could talk, little did they realise how little conversation would go on once they started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt started with a single forkful of cheese drenched pasta for both girls but it certainly didn't stop there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god, this is delicious\" cried out Tabitha between large mouthfuls of meat and pasta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphire could only nod her agreeance as she loaded her mouth up the second it emptied enough to fit her fork in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls gorged in unison, large mirrored mouthfuls disappearing between their opposing lips, punctuated with sides aplenty.<br>\r\nGarlic bread followed steak.<br>\r\nThick fluffy fries followed sauce drenched pasta.<br>\r\nOnion rings and creamy mash mopped up steak grease and pasta sauce alike before being deposited into the girls mouths bit by bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**********<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for their respective piled plates to empty but a familiar face soon joined the pair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey girls, Ja...Miss Gamor really worked you guys hard today huh?\" asked Felicity as she glided past their table, noticing the empty plates alongside the familiar students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, REALLY hard\" mused Sapphire, licking her lips whilst wondering how acceptable it would be to lick her plate clean as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely\" added Tabitha, mostly just to seem polite as she was more focused on her own plate, wiping sauce trails with her fingers before popping them in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad to hear it\" smiled Felicity as she went to move on \"Hey, do you two want a top up, you do look really hungry today\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphire and Tabitha looked at each other, almost confused at the offer.<br>\r\nAlthough they had heard of it, they themselves had never had TA's offering to get them more food before.<br>\r\nThe prospect of queuing again did not sound appealing though whilst the thought of more food certainly did pique their interests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, would that be a problem?\" asked Sapphire, playing her cards closely as she probed at the validity of the offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely not, I am here to assist after all\" smiled Felicity before shooting off towards the food counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's never happened before...\" mused Tabitha as she put her plate down on the table, wiping her mouth delicately with a napkin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't it great?!\" cheered Sapphire, gently pawing at her belly, feeling completely empty despite having just devoured a huge plate of heavy food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**********<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls didn't have to wait long, thankfully, before Felicity returned in a rather unexpected manner.<br>\r\nThe bouncy redheaded TA was strutting towards Sapphire and Tabitha with a tray trolley in each hand, each one stacked with three large plates of food.<br>\r\nThe girls glanced at each other almost cautiously as Felicity approached, wondering if the TA had been caught by another member of staff or student to bring a refill.<br>\r\nCaution proved to be unnecessary though as all became clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I wasn't sure exactly what you girls would want so I just got you plenty of everything\" purred Felicity, parking a trolley beside each girl \"not to worry if you don't finish it all, I'm sure somebody else will make use of it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTabitha looked almost fearful at her friend, hoping for some silent reassurance about what was going on but Sapphire was on another planet at that point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're so great Miss, thank you!\" cooed Sapphire as she unloaded her trolley, placing all three plates in front of herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you're welcome\" smiled Felicity with a small hostess bob as she spoke \"anything else whilst I'm here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I think we're fine thank you\" smiled Sapphire, wanting nothing more for Felicity to leave so she could tuck in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, see you soon girls\" smiled Felicity as she turned on her heels.<br>\r\nAs she started to walk away though, a flash of silver caught her eye under the table where Sapphire was sat.<br>\r\nA thermal flask.<br>\r\nHaving spent so much time doting on Jafit, Felicity was all too familiar with those particular vessels but was surprised to see a student with one.<br>\r\nNever too suspicious of people though, Felicity shrugged it off before wandering up the hall to see if anyone else required her assistance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's so nice\" mused Tabitha as she turned back to the table to talk to her friend again, although conversation was the last thing on the brunette's mind as she began to tear into the array of plates before her.<br>\r\nRolling her eyes, Tabitha delicately found herself putting together a fresh forkful of food before placing it into her mouth and feeling the deep hungry sensation rising again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, I don't think I've ever eaten so much in one sitting\" groaned Sapphire as she slowly lumbered across the shared living area within the flat that her and Tabitha shared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me neither\" groaned the black haired girl as she stumbled slightly, unintentionally pressing her firm and full belly against the doorframe which pushed a loud burp out of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Making room already?\" teased Sapphire as she lowered herself carefully onto the sofa in the middle of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTabitha could only shake her head as a rasping groan escaped her lips as she lowered herself next to her friend, the two girls taking up all of the three seater sofa between them.<br>\r\nSapphire chuckled as she parted her school cardigan before slowly opening the buttons on her greatly stretched shirt, bulges of belly fat slowly surging forward as each button released pressure around her immensely full gut.<br>\r\nTabitha only glanced at the brunette, having seen her friend expose herself regularly in the common areas of their flat to relax after a great feast, even if none had compared to the one they had just indulged in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls sat in silence as they massaged their respectively bloated bellies, neither girl able to make much more of a sound than the occasional groan or dislodged burp.<br>\r\nEventually though, after releasing a particularly large belch, Sapphire broke the silence.<br>\r\n\"Do you think that booze had something to do with this?\" she asked her friend, still massaging her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't...think so?\" replied Tabitha, not entirely sure why alcohol would make them pig out so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, I just wondered is all\" purred Sapphire, resuming her belly massage a little more firmly to dislodge yet more burps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTabitha could only giggle at her friend as she did the same, leaving the two girls in an unofficial burping contest in their living room as they nursed their bloated figures.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Ok class, you've all done a wonderful job today but we are now at the end of our time unfortunately\" called Jafit as she rose from her chair behind her desk.<br>\r\nA sea if eyes turned to look at the exotic teacher as she spoke, although most of the girls were tipped off as the chef's desk chair groaned a great creak of relief as her curvaceous bulk was lifted from within the confines of the wooden arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I will be assessing your work again today so be prepared for some feedback during our next classes\" purred Jafit to her avid audience as they set about finishing their dishes and slowly brought them towards the front of the class upon hearing they would be assessed...again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you think we get assessed A LOT in this class?\" muttered one girl to another as they carried a tray of peanut butter cookies and Mediterranean skewers respectively to the front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess? I don't know, they seem to take culinary arts really seriously here\" replied the girl as she laid down her skewers and scuttled back to her desk to grab her bag, just as Jafit loomed behind her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those cookies look delightful Cynthia\" purred Jafit as she reached over the girl's shoulder to grab three of the saucer sized biscuits before taking a large bite from one of them.<br>\r\n\"Mhm, you will be getting a wonderful grade for these\" moaned Jafit through a mouthful of sweet sticky crumbs before marching back to her desk, eating all the way there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for the entire class to file out and, as the heavy wooden door banged closed in its frame, Jafit sighed her content upon realising the teaching day was over.<br>\r\nSince returning back to her usual schedule after Felicity had been reassigned, Jafit had been kept busy more than she remembered but it was days like this where she had had four classes which all needed assessing that made the chaotic long days worth while.<br>\r\nScanning the entire length of the classroom worktop with dark sultry eyes, Jafit also recalled that the two large fridges were also packed with dishes that had been prepared that day and the chef knew she would be lying to herself if she didn't admit she found the task ahead rather exciting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a second thought, Jafit gradually ferried the peanut butter cookies, a large pot of chili, a smorgasbord of deep filled omelettes (a dish many of her students had taken a fancy to lately) and a family sized chicken pot pie.<br>\r\nPractically drooling as she looked over her first offerings, Jafit proceeded to hook her fingers into her stretchy jegging waistband and peel them from her concealed belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had taken a few jean mishaps to learn the lesson, but Jafit had come to realise the comfort and stretch of jeggings were the way forward for a stylish woman who loved to eat, especially on marking day.<br>\r\nIt had also dawned on the teacher that she was quite fond of the feeling of release as she let her ever growing stomach free of its stretchy confines.<br>\r\nToday was no different as her belly bulged free like melted caramel, pouring over her retreating waistband one heavy pound at a time before finally bouncing free and jiggling for a moment, exposed to the elements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe burgeoning chef moaned softly at this before squeezing her fattened hips into her chair once again and diving into the first of many meals that night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny observer would have been excused for thinking that Jafit was possessed as she tore into her food like a wild animal but, in truth, the chef was simply in euphoria with every mouthful, be it sweet or savoury, an absolute delight in her mouth.<br>\r\nA cacophony of cutlery clattering against dishes and mindless grunts could be heard from the teacher's desk as she mounted food into her mouth nearly faster than she could chew it so as to ensure the maximum amount of calories could be crammed into her stomach in as little time as possible.<br>\r\nDespite her feasting, Jafit was still a diligent teacher though and, as often as her appetite allowed her, she did make genuine remarks about her students dishes in her records...albeit most of them were unsurprisingly swung towards the higher end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her fork clattered into the bottom of a ceramic dish that had contained a sizable portion of hand made carbonara, Jafit leaned back heavily in her chair, browsing her options for her next course.<br>\r\nLicking her plump lips clean of cheese sauce, Jafit's eyes glazed ever so slightly as she massaged her belly out of arousal rather than discomfort before a wickedly pleasant thought had crossed her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina Cooper was a promising student in one of Jafit's many Sophomore classes and, despite her age, was constantly pushing herself to make all of her dishes bigger and better much to the joy of Jafit over the passing weeks and today had been no exception.<br>\r\nOver the course of the double period Tina had managed to construct a three tiered cheesecake, a cake which Jafit had been daydreaming about since laying eyes on it.<br>\r\nNow that her stomach was suitably lined and prepared for such a culinary delight, it felt like the right time to carry out Tina's latest assessment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLicking her lips again, this time hungrily, Jafit placed both hands on her chair and, with a mighty heave, released her bloated hips from the increasingly tighter seat.<br>\r\nWith her shoes long discarded, the tanned chef waddled barefoot to the fridge where her prize awaited her, thick bulging love handles jiggling with each step atop her seismic arse which was held tightly in place by her jeggings.<br>\r\nPanting slightly as she reached the chiller, Jafit whipped the door open, smirking as the cold rushed out and hugged her exposed belly before laying eyes on her quarry.<br>\r\nDrenched in chocolate and loaded with heavy cream, the huge dessert was Jafit's hunger embodied and there was no hesitation in her dragging the large cake out and placing it on the floor clear of the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment of contemplation washed over the chef as she closed the fridge door and, with a begrudging glance to her desk, resigned herself to her previous perch being too far away to carry her new feast.<br>\r\nWith a tired shrug Jafit instead placed her back against the fridge and slid down it, landing heavily in arms reach of the cheesecake she was about to devour.<br>\r\nHer landing had little grace in it as the growing chef dragged her food a little closer, thighs stretching her jeggings a little further and her belly sat heavily on the stretch denim. Her ever swelling boobs also settled heavily on top of her gut although her oversized bra did require a minor adjustment to keep its bulging contents secure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSufficiently comfortable, Jafit pounced once again into creamy decadence.<br>\r\n\"Oh god, this is so good!\" she moaned through full lips as her hands worked over time to keep the dessert coming as fast as she could eat it.<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for the culinary teacher to feel awkwardly twisted to her side as she ate and, mostly dragged by her own front weight, she ended up on her knees facing the cake straight on which only served to hasten her eating as the first tier disappeared into her gut.<br>\r\nArousal kicking in more as she ate more, one hand trailed off from feeding to knead the rolls of fat bunched at her side eliciting a deep moan from the chef, spurring her frenzy on even more like a jockey pushing an exceptionally fat horse.<br>\r\nWith time completely lost on her, Jafit was only aware of her eating and indulging blindly in the most amazing cheesecake she had ever eaten, or, at the very least, the most amazing cheesecake she had eaten that night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence had befallen the classroom.<br>\r\nNo more clattering of cutlery.<br>\r\nNo more animalistic grunting.<br>\r\nNo more...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BUUUURP!\"<br>\r\nThe gut wrenching belch was followed by a soft accented giggle as Jafit gently dropped the now empty cheesecake plate to her side, her back once again rested against the fridge which it had come from.<br>\r\nAlthough a now seasoned binger, Jafit had never eaten so much in one sitting and she felt a little drunk off the sensation.<br>\r\nShe had vague flashes of memory from eating the cheesecake now that it had gone.<br>\r\nAt one point she had taken to all fours to eat straight from the plate before reverting back to her current seated position to shovel the last remnants into her hungry mouth.<br>\r\nAll Jafit was truly sure of at this point though was that her belly as sat very heavily on her thighs and it felt so good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the bloated chef sat on the floor massaging her exposed gut, giggling and belching all the while in her stuffed euphoria, many things crossed her mind...<br>\r\nNone of which she got to fully consider as a sharp knocking rang through her classroom door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately shaken from her daze, Jafit realised she was sat on the floor, empty serving receptacles scattered around the room with her belly on full display and now likely too small shirt bunched up under her boobs.<br>\r\nAll of that was without drawing attention to the fact that her arse was completely exposed also as she'd had to roll her jeggings down as they were too tight for extensive periods of bending over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of that mattered though as the classroom door swung open to reveal...</span></div></div>",

She\u2019d never been to any kind of campus that had six stories and three wings and a courtyard and a <i>dome</i> at the top in the middle and creepy stained glass windows. They didn\u2019t have buildings like this back home. In her little beach town, this place would have gotten <i>destroyed</i>. It all looked so new and exciting\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut also 100% absolutely terrifying at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas that weird?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike, as a logical person she knew that she shouldn\u2019t be afraid of a building. Or intimidated by the size of the campus. It was just a bunch of land with a lot of bricks on it. But the cabins along the mountainside and the golf carts puttering up the gentle slopes of the unofficial road system that had been paved, catching the harsh morning sun against the bright gray pavement\u2026 it all looked so\u2026 so\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw geez, this place is <i>creepy</i>.\u201d her mother said with a little laugh as she touched her daughter by the shoulder, \u201cIt\u2019s like something out of a horror movie, right sweetie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom!\u201d Hunter whipped around, beet-red as she felt her mother\u2019s hand touch her shoulder, \u201cStop that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m just saying\u2014like, <i>you</i> are going to come home right?\u201d Mz.

She knew that\u2014and so did her mother, Harper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout her sister pulling these connections with her old boss, there wasn\u2019t a snowball\u2019s chance in hell of anyone from the Black family ever making it in this ritzy Academy. Even with her grades, good fortune rarely smiled on the often-bullied, hand-me-down-wearing, too-smart-for-her-own-good Hunter Black. She knew that\u2014and so did Harper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was just something of a Black family tradition to joke around in light of serious situations. It\u2019s how they dealt with things back home in their little mill house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was easier than admitting that this was going to be the first time that sweet baby Hunter Black had ever been away from home longer than a sleepover. Or that Harper was officially going to have an empty nest before 50. They were both scared, and that was okay. Not necessarily of the campus, but more of what it represented. \u201cChange and stuff\u201d as her mother had put it awkwardly during the 6-hour car ride. Multiple times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna miss you, kiddo.\u201d Harper said as she wrapped her arms around her daughter, \u201cYou make sure to call me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Hunter hugged her mom tightly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr unless this weird Stepford School has something against that.\u201d Harper snuggled tighter, \u201cThen you text me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Hunter grunted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cE-mail.

They would provide her with her uniform(s?) and all the other clothing she\u2019d need. She\u2019d brought along a few of her favorite shirts\u2014mostly hand-me-downs from her sister Piper. But for the most part, her suitcases were filled with whatever she could fit from her bedroom back home. Family photos, posters from her wall, some knick-knacks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust something to make all of this feel more\u2026 normal, somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter didn\u2019t really see that happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut if she wanted to go anywhere with her life, she would have to suck it up. She wasn\u2019t going to get into a good college by staying in Daven\u2019s Port. And this was a once in a lifetime opportunity that had literally been handed to her. A full ride to one of the most prestigious schools in America? How could she refuse?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo there was little Hunter, wheeling her suitcase behind her as she set foot onto this huge, foreboding fortress of higher learning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only question was\u2026 where the <i>heck</i> was she supposed to go?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But even her paltry suitcase filled with what she had chosen to bring along with her seemed at least twice as heavy after having to lug it up four floors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe <i>would</i> have taken the elevator, if there had been room. A flock of girls, each about the size of a tank, had decided to fill it up before she could make her way inside. There wouldn\u2019t have been enough room for little ol\u2019 <i>her</i> inside, let alone her suitcase, if she decided to squeeze next to that big blob of chocolate pudding or that redhead with the tits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the stairs it was\u2014looking at those girls was enough motivation to take the stairs anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut <i>God</i> if lugging her crap up all those stairs wasn\u2019t murder on her back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, slight correction. Her <i>breasts</i> had been the most murder on her back. The ol\u2019 Black Family Boobies hadn\u2019t left her much for vertebrae. Add into the fact that she was very much an \u201cindoor\u201d girl and voila\u2014you\u2019ve got an aching back and boob sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOy vey, she sounded like her mother\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNever mind. The point was that, after four flights of stairs, Hunter was finally right where she needed to be. 5th Floor, East Wing, in the Spencer Suites. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a newer part of the building, as were the two floors above it, with this floor\u2019s construction in particular financed by the backers at Boonliang International. The hardwood flooring was of a different grain than the floors below. The Vandergriff suites were above, and the Hammond were above that. This Academy could hold an army if it had to\u2014Hunter was just grateful that she only had to go up to the fifth floor. She didn\u2019t know who the fuck these Boonliang people were, but it wouldn\u2019t have killed them to have their suites a few flights lower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoom 114, 115\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least there was an elevator on either side of the hall. It must have started on the second floor, because Hunter certainly hadn\u2019t been presented with the option of <i>not</i> taking the stairs\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n116, 117\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLots of vending machines on this hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n122, 123\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoom 123! Just the one she was looking for. Easy to remember and relatively near the elevator. Awesome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter held her Student ID up to the iris on her dorm\u2019s security device and waited for the light to turn green. Wheeling her suitcase inside, Hunter was greeted with the sight of her lavish new dorm room\u2014a million times nicer than anything she had back home!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig couch, big TV (and no dumb sisters/Mom to crowd it!) and a full kitchen set. Bedrooms by the looks of it, each with their own closet and bathroom\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving towards the door on the right, Hunter touched the light switch. She had a Queen bed, all to herself, and a dresser, all to herself, a neat little desk, a closet and the cleanest bathroom that she had ever set foot inside\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter should have moved out a long time ago!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the kicker? On her bed was a great big welcome basket, full of snacks! Her older sister Piper used to work for Yeng so she\u2019d grown up on all the good stuff. It wasn\u2019t name brand, but it was better! Honey buns, apple pies, cupcakes and muffins\u2026 Hunter hadn\u2019t had some of these in years!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat <i>almost</i> makes the flight of stairs worth it.\u201d Hunter smacked her lips as she unwrapped a chocolate cupcake, \u201cAlmost.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout further adieu\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>...Hunter began digging through the welcome basket's content.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer taste buds were going crazy. The Black family has never been rich, and yet never managed to be short of food. However the lunches were, for the most part, either the usual five ingredients Harper cooked in different ways, or a fast-food takeaway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut these sweets, the cupcakes, the honey buns, the chocolate bars, were stuff the black-haired girl had eaten once every blue moon. Did this school have an infinite supply of these? She hoped so as she grabbed another of those soft treats. This time it was a chocolate with a milky cream inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being seized in the middle of the tasting, Hunter's ears pricked up as she heard the door opening, followed by some heavy steps. She got up from her seated position on the bed and peeked through the open door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl who had just entered had shoulder-length messy dirty-blonde hair on her round face with a piggish nose. She was breathing heavily, and Hunter wasn't surprised by it, this girl was fat. She was probably a good fifty pounds or likely more heavier than the dark haired girl. On top of it, Hunter noted with some discomfort that the blonde's chest couldn't rival hers; instead her bottom got the lion share of lard, along with a rotund belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new girl looked around with her small and sharp green eyes, and when she turned to Hunter's room, the freshman hid herself behind the door. Her chest shook from the movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter slapped her forehead. \"You idiot!\" She whispered to herself \"She's your roommate, you will share the year with her\". <br>\r\nThe girl remembered that the school has a \"big sister program\" where, save special requests, every freshmen is paired with an older student to help them getting acclimatized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glanced back at her \"big sister\", and big was indeed the right word, and saw the blonde dragging her suitcase in the other room; then she left the room and was going to the other one. <br>\r\nHunter panicked as she saw her roommate\u2019s large figure looming towards her with heavy steps. Then she closed her eyes, and took a deep breath as her roommate opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bottom heavy blonde looked at Hunter straight into the eyes. The dark haired girl remained quiet, and then slowly waved her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, my n-name is Hunter Black. You're my roommate, right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smug smile appeared on the blonde's face \"I knew you were already here\u201d while she was talking, she glanced at the welcome basket on the bed. \"My name's Lucy\" she said as she moved to the basket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucy what?\" Asked Hunter in an attempt to get to know her new roommate. Knowing the full name seemed the least, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucy notyourbusiness\" blurted the pear-shaped girl. Then she took a look at the basket; Hunter ate just a few treats, and there were still three quarter of the sweets left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good, chocolate brownie\" said Lucy licking her lips. Then she picked a small brownie and pressed it whole into her mouth, only to gulp it down in a couple of bites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! That is actually mine!\" Said Hunter pointing at the basket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy stared her down as she picked up a chocolate bare and gave it a large bite. <br>\r\nThen she went to Hunter, so close that her belly was squished against Hunter's flat one.<br>\r\nThe blonde was almost a head taller than the freshman, and larger all over (except in the chest). Hunter zipped her mouth as she felt her roommate\u2019s glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy took another bite of chocolate \"Ok, let's make some rules so we can live civilly. Rule number one, I'm older, so I make the rules\" she took the last bite of chocolate. \"Rule number two, the younger must obey the older\" she gulped down. \"Rule number three, everything in this dorm room is mine\" as she said the last line, she picked the basket and left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter leaned from the door \"Wait! That was for me. Don't you have one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I do, but two is better than one, don't you agree?\" Lucy then plopped onto the couch, her butt taking up almost half of it, and turned on the tv.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you can watch this movie with me if you want\" said Lucy from the sofa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter sighed. That wasn't the best way to start off a new year. She had already dealt with these kind of girls back at Daven\u2019s Port and knew that it was better to not reply or fight back, otherwise she would've probably received a punch in the face. Lucy was fat, but seemed to be quite strong too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Hunter sat next to her looking at a boring and generic action movie. The freshman looked at the blonde pushing a cupcake through her pillowy lips and started to salivate a bit. She would've really wanted another one of them but was afraid to even ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, pipsqueak, go to my dorm and get my second basket\" ordered Lucy once she finished the snacks, throwing the empty basket away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-can't you do it yourself?\" Asked Hunter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy frowned and patted her stuffed gut. \"I'm too full to get up\" she snarled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black-haired girl didn't reply back and got up. She knew Lucy could get up if she wanted, but also that she would've gotten punished if she disobeyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went into Lucy's room. It was just the same as hers: personal bathroom, desk, wardrobe and a queen sized bed. On the latter there was the welcome basket, still untouched. As she picked it, Hunter was really tempted to steal a snack, even only that little honey bun. But she was afraid that Lucy might notice it missing, so she resisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore leaving the room, her attention went to the case, still not emptied and simply abandoned next to the wall. As she got closer, Hunter could read a plate that said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucy Longbottom\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't help but giggle upon learning Lucy's surname. It was just too silly, and found it particularly fitting for a girl with a large butt like her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Why are you laughing?\" Asked the blonde from the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... I wasn't laughing\" replied Hunter as she left the room, and could see her roommate looking at her with suspicion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter had to remain next to Lucy for the entire movie, all while the latter was stuffing her face with delicious snacks. The blonde made some jokes once in a while and Hunter had to laugh if she didn't want to anger the sophomore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, after a while, the busty girl raised the nerve to speak up, and asked; \"Isn't there anything else we can do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy looked at the clock on her phone. \"Sure, dinner has begun half an hour ago, and I'm quite eager to fill my stomach\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't that all you've done until now?\" Thought Hunter gazing at Lucy's belly, which was protruding over the belt of the uniform, looking for taut than earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout any effort despite her size, Lucy raised herself from the couch and opened the dorm's door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Follow me if you want to know where the cafeteria is\" said the blonde in a tone that made it seem more like an order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Hunter intended to follow her anyway, hoping that a rich dinner could improve her first day of school.</span></div></div>",

With just one look she seemed to dare her to say it again. The bigger girl let out a small noise\u2014a petulant puff\u2014from her piggish nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve, uh\u2026 gotta pee.\u201d Hunter smiled sheepishly, hoping to abate her roommate<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSuit yourself.\u201d Lucy rolled her eyes and turned, her belly bobbing in front of her, \u201cDon\u2019t blame me when you get lost then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Hunter\u2019s roommate walked out the door and slammed it behind her\u2014what a bitch!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2018I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m going to have to live with that hog\u2026\u2019</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter relaxed for the first time since her night with Lucy began. She sank into her seat on the couch and leaned her head back. God what a pain\u2014she\u2019d had to deal with older sisters growing up, but she\u2019d never had to deal with someone so entitled as Little Miss Longbottom! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe halls of Buttercombe Academy were wide. Everything had this sort of wholesome pale-yellow, kind of creamy color to it. Like everything was put through an Instagram filter. The sconces on the wall gleamed against the tiled floors, freshly waxed for a new semester, and Hunter\u2019s footsteps echoed back at her from the end, there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Click-Clack, Click-Clack</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hard for her to believe that there weren\u2019t more girls around.

It was only Saturday\u2014should a school this size still be this empty?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least she wasn\u2019t trapped with Lucy Longbottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGod, what a bitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing alone was preferable to being trapped with someone who held you hostage. Even if it was in a new place. Full of new people. Away from her friends. Away from her Mom\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shiver ran up Hunter\u2019s spine\u2014she was suddenly aware of just how <i>stranded</i> she was in a place like this. It reminded her of being a little girl at a sleepover. The other girls would tell ghost stories and she\u2019d cry that she wanted to go home\u2026 except this sleepover lasted 4 years and she was graded on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2018Well that was depressing.\u2019</i> Hunter thought to herself, soured by her own inner monologue, <i>\u2018Maybe I should explore a little?

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><br>\r\nHunter felt completely alone in those wide and void halls. Alone in a place she didn't know, like an explorer lost in an old cave; a colorful one, but still empty. The only sounds were her steps that echoed on the walls. If only she could meet someone else nicer than that fat hog of her roomate - not that it was much - but it seemed all the students have disappeared. That couldn't be possible. Just an hour ago, there were dozens of girls literally filling the school with their fat bodies.<br>\r\nOf course, you didn't need to be as smart as Hunter to guess where all these fatties could have gone: to the cafeteria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought that maybe she was being stereotypical, but if she were a fat glutton like most students seemed to be, and Lucy was a perfect example, she would've gone there. Besides, she had just spent her time watching that hog of Longbottom eating snacks, her snacks, while she could only sample a few before having her basket confiscated. So, if the remote possibility of the cafeteria being empty is true, she could've at least had a nice dinner. Buttercombe's broshure said very clearly they provided a complete meal service with a wide and healthy variety of options and so far it has proven it has every kind of comfort. Heck, walking in the halls, she could see many vending machines, all of whom had \"YENG\" written in bold on the sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't that hard finding the cafeteria in such a large school thanks to the many sings in the halls, and she could guess the distance by the noises getting louder and louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe peeked through the glass windows of the wide double doors and saw many girls of different sizes, from among the fattest she had ever seen, to small and petite ones. All were wearing the school yellow uniform. Thankfully, there was no sight of Lucy's messy blonde head among the fat crowd, so she opened the door without fear. Although she felt unease among all these girls she didn't know. She was grateful her arrival was gone unnoticed <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could see a long line of booths, each serving a large (in both senses) variety of food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the school didn't lie about this\" thought Hunter as she licked her lips in anticipation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, there were more choices available she didn't know what to choose. They looked all inviting. Burgers, ice cream, noodles, soups, chicken wings, desserts she couldn't even name and many more. <br>\r\nThe dark haired girl moved back and forth along the serving tables to decide what to pick. She thought to try things she could rarely eat at home, narrowing the choices, and there were still many dishes to choose! She was tempted to pick a bit of everything, but that would've been too much, so in the end she went with spaghetti with meatballs and a couple of tacos. On a second thought, she also took some fries and some fried eggplants as side dish.<br>\r\nHunter thoght maybe she had still picked a tad too much at the sight of her tray's content, but then ignored that thoght with a shoulders scroll. She was hungry, and had an already shitty day, at least this will help her raise the mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked for a table, making sure to not spot a familiar messy blonde head, but still no trace of that fat bitch.<br>\r\nShe saw some tables with some friendly faces, one was full of young girls, and she guessed they were freshman like her, and maybe even future classmates. It was the right chance, but as soon as she attempted to join them, her legs didn't move while her cheeks became red. Hunter was just too shy to go, and now she was standing in the middle of the cafeteria like an idiot. With that thought, she felt more unease and wondered if someone noticed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, a voice called:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you're a freshman too, aren't you? Would you like to join me?\" Said a gentle voice behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter turned and saw the one who called her..</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hunter cooed with delight as she bit into her chocolate cupcake. <i>\"Oh my god, those are even better then I remembered!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a moment to drop her suitcase on her bed, Hunter grabbed her basket and took it to the sitting area. She placed it on the side table, and took off her hoodie, throwing it over a nearby chair. A little comfier, the raven haired teen plopped down on the couch and grabbed the absolutely monstrous remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"This thing has more buttons then my laptop. I feel like I could hack the Pentagon with this thing.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took her a moment, but pretty soon she had the TV humming along nicely. Hunter knew she should probably put her stuff away, but with her room mate currently MIA, she had the place all to herself, and she wasn't sure when she'd have such an opportunity again. Finding one of her favorite movies on the tube, Hunter leaned back and started digging into her epic stash of goodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing she found was another of those triple-chocolate, fudge-stuffed cupcakes. A few large bites saw the delectable morsel disappear into her small belly. Seeing her well-endowed bust had caught a number of crumbs, Hunter took a moment to pick them off and eat them, trying to avoid staining her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext was a trio of the cinnamon encrusted apple pies. The innards were sweet and creamy, the pastry beautifully flaky, and the sugar on the outside had been toasted to form a light, crispy shell. Honestly, they were simply divine. Hunter had originally planned only on eating one, but they'd simply been way too good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA box of strawberry champagne mini-muffins was next to go, and even with her advanced vocabulary, Hunter felt she lacked sufficient words to describe them. Light, airy, delicious beyond words. Then again, she'd always had a weakness for strawberries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter had nearly finished a bag of honey buns when she heard the door opening. Looking towards the entrance, she saw the clock and realized she'd been snacking for a little over an hour. Feeling a mite sheepish at losing track of time like that, she quickly licked the sticky goodness off her fingers as her room mate for the year came in. Though generally not the most confident girl in the world, Hunter tried hard to be polite. \"Hi, I'm Hunter Black! I'm guessing you're my roomie for the year?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new girl smiled, showing off her braces as she answered. \"Yep, that's me! Amber Smythe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter looked over the new girl as they shook hands. She was a tall, leggy blonde, with piercing green eyes and more freckles then you could shake a stick at. If Hunter had to guess, Amber was about 5'7\" or 5'8\". Her long hair ran straight to the middle of her back, and was currently tied in a ponytail. Unlike the other members of Buttercombe that Hunter had seen, Amber was built like a twig, and since any curves she might develop hadn't come in yet, she wound up looking very lanky and awkward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber, meanwhile, couldn't stop staring at Hunter's tits. The olive skinned girl had opened the top buttons of her shirt, and Amber found herself staring down into a massive valley of cleavage. Even the random crumbs on her bosom couldn't detract from the impressiveness of her well-endowed roomie's udders, and Amber felt a pang of inadequacy as she compared herself to the short, young woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter, meanwhile, was unaware of the thoughts currently going through her new room mate's head. The two girls promptly got to talking- where they were from, what they were excited about, etc. Amber came from California. Her Dad was a lawyer and her Mom was a lab tech with Yeng's west coast branch, and between the two managed to get their daughter a spot at Buttercombe academy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber seemed a very down to earth girl, much to Hunter's relief. She'd been worried she was going to wind up with a spoiled, preppy brat. <i>\"Or an angry, verbally abusive land-whale,\"</i> she thought, thinking back to the tubs of lard riding the elevator upon her arrival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber, having just dropped her suit case in her room, came back with her own welcome basket. \"Jesus, this thing is huge! Was yours this big?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah. They definitely don't skimp on the portions.\" Hunter looked over to her basket, a little taken aback by just how massive a dent she'd put into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm starting to see why there's so many big girls on this campus,\" Amber said as she dug through her basket. \"Hey, do you want any? There's no way I can eat all of this. Help yourself to whatever you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter was initially going to say no, but as she looked over at Amber's stash, she noticed that her welcome gift had several treats that hers didn't. Nanaimo bars, powdered doughnuts, coconut squares covered in chocolate, and many, many more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe really couldn't stop herself from reaching for a sample. \"Well, maybe just one or two...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One or two\" had quickly become three-quarters of Amber's basket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing too late what she'd done, Hunter apologized profusely. If Amber had been offended by her room mate's show of gluttony, she certainly hid it well, insisting that she didn't need to apologize. After all, she argued, she'd offered it freely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne and three-quarters of a monster amount of treats like that was a lot for anyone, and Hunter found herself with a stomach ache afterwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Well, no wonder,\"</i> she thought. <i>\"That's way too much junk food.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Amber, could you excuse me for a minute? I got to see if they have some pepto or something in this joint.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing. They said there'll be a few items in each person's medicine cabinet in their bathroom. Just don't take too long; we got to get to the Freshmen welcoming ceremony.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter mentally kicked herself for forgetting that. Seeing the clock, she saw they had 20 minutes to get there. \"K, I'll be quick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter went into her bathroom and opened the cabinet. There wasn't much inside. A box of band-aids, a carton of Q-tips, and a couple small bottles, each with only one or two pills in them. The note on the back of the cabinet read, <i>Please speak to our staff regarding any special requirements you may have.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter picked up and looked at each of the bottles. <i>\"Acetaminophen. Ibuprofen. Hydrogen peroxide. Oh, wait, what's this?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe latest bottle she picked up said <i>Yeng Brand Stomach Aid: Extra Strength Formula.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Oh, thank God,\"</i> Hunter thought as she opened the jar. She was a little surprised that this one was full to the brim, whereas most of the others were nearly empty. This mystery would have to wait, as she swallowed one of the tabs with a mouthful of water from the sink. Within a couple minutes, the busty teen was already feeling a little better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hunter, let's go! We're going to be late!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber's shout spurred the youngest Black into motion. \"Coming!\" she said as she left the bathroom as quickly as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad she more time, Hunter might have read the full description on the bottle:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Yeng Brand Stomach Aid: Extra Strength Formula<br>\r\nFor those <b>REALLY BIG</b> meals!</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><div align=\"left\"></div>Every year, Buttercombe Academy held its annual Orientation Ceremony in the cafeteria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreshmen scurried from their dorm rooms and into the main building, where they were greeted with the heady aromas and hearty ambiance that they would eventually learn could only come from a Buttercombe establishment. They had an entire culinary coalition working day and night to ensure that this graduating class was greeted with only the best that they had to offer, and not a morsel was going to waste. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut more on that later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter and Amber entered the great hall like two tiny fish leaving their stream and entering a pond for the first time, bug eyed in wonder at the vastness of something as simple as the eatery in what was to be their home for the next four years. Buttercombe had made it very clear in the short time that they had been enrolled that they spared no expense in the satisfaction of their students, but this defied expectations entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLong tables lined the rear wall, far <i>far</i> back underneath the ornate windows that overlooked the courtyard (Hunter recognized from the brochure) and a quarter-way through the room before stopping at a fashionable island partition. On the other side, smaller more personable tables dotted the area before giving way to more long ones along the back wall. An army of girls, none much older or younger than herself Hunter guessed, lined up to enter one side of a much smaller room while others exited out the opposite side with their trays piled high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurther along the other side of the cafeteria, there were more tables. That's where Hunter and Amber sat. Better to risk sitting there with some unfamiliar girls than being separated filling in empty spots on the long tables that gave a better view of the small stage that had been erected, along with a podium, along the partition. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies?\" a voice, thick and exhausted, plead into the microphone, \"Let's get everyone seated, now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter's mind boggled at the size of Ms. Polluck every time she saw her. This was the first time she'd seen her standing up, too. Her mountainous middle kept her a full foot and a half away from the comparatively dinky microphone that had been clipped onto the wood. Instead, a wireless model had been attached to her ear and wrapped around her tennis-ball cheeks. The podium was clearly for support, as the fat woman leaned into it and gripped it on either side with her feeble flabby grip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's <i>that</i>?\" Amber whispered into her roommate's ear, amazement and amusement evident in her voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's Ms. Polluck.\" Hunter answered, \"She's the headmistress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought the Asian lady was the headmistress?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith everyone still gathering their meals, finding their friends, and about half of them wondering the same thing as Amber, it was understandable that it took some time for the cafeteria to grow quiet. Even still, Ms. Polluck's puffy face grew red at the thought of standing for so long under her own power. The smell of food wafting in the air agitated her, beckoning her to come down and join her students for a little orientation snack. Never the less, somehow her great struggle went unabated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome, Freshmen.\" Ms. Polluck said in her huffy voice after everything had quieted down (enough) \"To Buttercombe Academy. Your home, and alma mater, for what will hopefully be the most memorable four years of your life.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Despite how much she'd already eaten, for whatever reason, she was feeling totally famished. The food smells were starting to drive her mad, and the Headmistress couldn't wrap it up fast enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... and your student cards will be credited appropriately. Room drop offs will occur between 8 and 10 o'clock during the week.

Thank you for your time, and good luck in your studies.\" With that, Shannon Polluck leaned back from the ominously creaking podium. Shannon stepped backwards, her massive frame visibly jiggling in her tight, form-fitting uniform. Though the students didn't know it, Shannon had just been fitted for this outfit the previous week. Her consumption had hit a new high over the last couple years, and her already bloated body was growing by leaps and bounds. A few short, shuddering steps brought the heavy headmistress to an overbuilt loveseat. Collapsing into it with a massive sigh of relief, a loud groan echoed from the distressed piece of furniture. With the seat successfully holding up her considerable bulk (for now, at least), a couple of attendants brought out a table and cartload of food which Miss Polluck dug into with hoggish gusto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter didn't see any of this, having got up from her seat at the tail end of Polluck's speech. Amber had been left in the dust, and the blonde found herself having to motor to keep up with her olive-skinned roomie. Taking only the barest moment to scan her student card, Hunter grabbed a tray and began to ransack the shockingly vast spread arrayed before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Spaghetti and meatballs would be good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarlic bread, definitely want.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOoh, they have lasagna. Maybe a small slice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTacos? Just a taste should be fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat chicken con pollo smells so good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe a piece of cherry pie for dessert. Or do I want lemon meringue? Oh, but those brownies smell so, so good.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rumbling, hollow feeling coming from her stomach made up her mind for her, and Hunter absolutely heaped her tray with food, heavily favoring pasta dishes and desserts. Amber's eyes nearly bugged out of her head at the sheer quantity Miss Black had taken. Far more self-conscious after all she'd thus far witnessed, Amber's plate was considerably lighter, consisting predominantly of salad and vegetables. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls sat down, Hunter with a noticeable bounce from her enhanced bust. She started devouring her food without preamble, swallowing it as fast as she could move it into her mouth. Other girls nearby stared at her display of gluttony, and there was a lot of pointing and whispering. The raven-haired teen failed to notice the spectacle she was making of herself, far too engrossed into her massive meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Holy hell, why am I so hungry!?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy does it, girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh,\" Hunter groaned. Hunter hadn't managed to finish her gigantic platter of food, her eyes far, far too big for her stomach in this instance. She'd eaten until she felt bloated, rested a few minutes, then tried stuffing even more down her throat. Hunter had made a huge dent in her pile, but now felt terribly ill and could barely move from the pain in her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had arm over Amber's shoulder, the blonde helping the overstuffed girl back to their dorm. She blushed slightly, both from the proximity of Hunter's oversized breasts and from the large amount of attention the girl had garnered her way. Looks of incredulity and disgust from the Freshmen contrasted with the looks of empathy and understanding from the Upperclassmen; the latter were slightly worrying, Amber felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber hadn't missed just how large the average girl at Buttercombe was. The frosh students were mostly normal weights with a few more overweight individuals then standard, but the bulk of the upperclassmen ran the gamut from chubby to fat to unbelievably huge. And even among that heavy weight crowd, Hunter had held her own consumption wise, limited only by her smaller gastric capacity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber helped her lay down on her bed. Hunter's belly was rock hard and left her looking nine months pregnant with triplets. The zipper on her uniform's skirt had popped during the meal, and only a safety pin had kept her decent during the long walk back to their rooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGranted, it was actually a really short walk, but it certainly felt long with how slow they had to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Hunter lay there groaning, Amber asked, \"You going to be okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I- URRRPPPP!\" Hunter blushed as she let out a loud burp. \"Er, excuse me. Yeah, I'll be fine. I swear I don't know what came over me. I never eat that much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it. Seriously, it's not like you stood out in that crowd. You sure you'll be fine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It hurts, but I just need sleep, then I'll be good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, sleep well, then. I'll grab you early tomorrow so we can get that skirt fixed before classes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, sounds good. Good night,\" Hunter yawned as Amber turned off the light and left the room. As Miss Smythe closed the door, Hunter grabbed the last of her triple chocolate and fudge cupcakes from her night stand. Her belly hurt so much, but she couldn't just let it sit there uneaten. Hunter was many things, but she was certainly no fool, and the young woman had a fairly strong hunch what the culprit was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"What the heck is <b>IN</b> those stomach pills!?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough she thought she'd waited a sufficient amount of time, Amber heard Hunter unwrapping the cupcake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"How can she still be hungry!?\"</i> Amber thought, shaking her head incredulously. <i>\"If she keeps eating like that, she'll be the fattest hog on campus.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber's mind went to the 500+ pound Shannon Polluck, stuffing herself on stage until she burst the buttons on her jacket. She thought about those two blubbery land whales, slowly waddling down the path as she helped Hunter walk. Then there was that one girl on the scooter, who filled the oversized elevator by herself, forcing the two to wait for the next one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"And in this place, that would be one HELL of an accomplishment.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber's blushing thoughts of Hunter's gluttony and just what she'd look like at the Headmistress' weight were interrupted by a knock at their door. She jumped a bit at the sound before wondering, <i>\"Who could that be?\"</i></span></div></div>",

Built like a barrel and already testing the capacity of her new uniform, Amber could see that girl's belly hung so low that she'd tucked it underneath her long pleated skirt. She leaned her weight against a trolley, its three rows stacked efficiently with cardboard boxes and most of them opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi! Room 123?\" the belly-heavy girl blocking their doorway asked in a breathy sort of voice, \"Black and Hadley?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y...yeah?\" Amber opened the door a little bit further, allowing more of her gigantic guest's frame to come into view, \"I'm Amber Hadley.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, I've got your uniforms for you right here.\" the older girl smiled, her thick face folding into deep dimples, \"Here, lemme just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBending over was a struggle for the older girl. Heavy grunts of exertion followed a slow descent downwards, her belly rolls folding in on each other obstructively. The poor girl's whole body seemed to quiver in disdain of such a minor activity, with her round face growing pig pink and her pillowy arms jiggling. Finally she came to a box at the bottom row, rummaged through with the distinct sound of crinkling plastic, before coming up for air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew!\" she panted, her forehead coated in a thin film of sweat, \"Y'all just had to be on the bottom, didn't ya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sorry to make you...\" Amber smiled awkwardly as she searched for the right words to describe what she'd just witnessed, \"...bend over so hard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright. Lots of rooms to hit, might as well get used to it.\" the older girl said with an appreciative chuckle that rippled throughout her face, lifting one meaty arm to wipe at her forehead, \"If they don't fit right, you can take them to Mrs. Banks in the Vandergriff building.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber was given two sets of uniforms wrapped tightly in plastic wrapping and went inside. Each set had the basic essentials that made up the Buttercombe Academy uniform. An ugly yellow blazer, a blouse with a small bee emblazoned on it, a dumb little tie, an ugly yellow plaid skirt, some knee socks, and clunky black mary janes. Amber had opted for a little more customization, so her package also included a gray sweater vest that she could wear in lieu of the jacket. And Hunter's...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh boy...\" Amber snorted, examining Hunter's uniform, \"This is gonna be fun in the morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter hadn't slept well. It was her first night at home, away from her mom, away from Daven's Port, and in a weird new school after eating what felt like her body weight in dinner last night. It was normal to be a little restless. So she was already off to a bad start. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can imagine how that only got worse when she tumbled out of bed, her belly still squelching from last night's epic feat of gastronomy and her short black hair a mess, only to find Amber not only wide awake and first-day-ready but also clutching something behind her back and looking like the cat that ate the canary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mornin'.\" Hunter grumbled, rubbing her eyes and smacking her lips, \"You look happy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's becaaaaaause your uniform came!\" Amber giggled past her roommate's question, her arms coming around the front, \"Now it's gonna wear a little <i>big</i>...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter's eyes almost popped out of their head when she saw the sheer size of the blouse they expected her to wear! It was huge, closer to something you'd drape over your armchair than something you'd ever guess a girl like Hunter would wear. Even with her stupid chest, Hunter would practically be swimming in that thing! She could have used it as a beach towel!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god.\" Hunter groaned, running an open palm over her face in embarrassment, \"Tell me that's not my uniform and this is one of those weird prep school pranks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I didn't think you'd be as excited about it as I was.\" Amber giggled, turning it over to Hunter so that she could see and feel for herself just how <i>enormous</i> this thing was, \"It's yours though, they brought them last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is just great...\" Hunter groaned and made a face as she held the uniform out to its full spread, \"I can't wear this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you keep up like you did night...\" Amber teased, thinking back to Hunter's debut at dinnertime, \"You might just grow into it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha.\" Hunter said flatly with a sensitive arm over her still-distended stomach, \"Very funny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blazer, skirt, and even the shoes were no better. It was like they'd seen her pig out last night and planned for the future. Hunter couldn't wear this if she gained a hundred pounds! This was clearly a mix-up, and it couldn't have come at a worse time. It was the first day of her new life at this stupid school, and they'd already made it so that she couldn't go to class!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The girl delivering these told me that you can get it tailored at the Vandergriff.\" Amber offered helpfully as she grabbed her backpack, \"I'm gonna go grab breakfast in the cafeteria... you want to come with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't.\" Hunter grunted, \"Didn't you read the rulebook? If I go in without my uniform during school hours, I'll get a demerit...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So get a demerit.\" Amber snorted, \"Once you explain, I'm sure it'll be okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... my uniform...\" Hunter's stomach thundered in agony, still struggling to cope with her last visit to the cafeteria, \"And my stomach...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can always go to the tailor after classes.\" Amber suggested with a shrug\u2014her small frame showing that even her uniform as a bit oversized, \"I don't think it's smart to miss breakfast <i>or</i> your first day. Your call, though...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter looked to her roommate, then back to her uniform. What was she going to do?</span></div></div>",

Guess I'll grab my nicer clothes. I could probably wear the tie, at least...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, wait a sec,\" Amber said as she ran to her room. She came back holding the sweater vest they'd sent her in her uniform package. \"Here. It's far from perfect, but between this and the tie, and you should be a little closer to the uniform standard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter happily grabbed the vest from the lanky blonde's hands. \"Oh, thank you Amber!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, hey, there's no need to thank me that much. Now hurry up and get dressed. I want to grab something to eat before class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh,\" Hunter groaned, her stomach aching at the mere mention of breakfast. \"I can't even think about food right now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Mmm, it smells so good in here!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter's belly ached the whole time she was getting dressed, and for the walk with Amber to the dining hall. However, once she got a whiff of the feast being prepared by the staff, those pained gurgles were replaced by almost shockingly hungry ones. She found it hard to believe, but she was practically drooling just standing here, for crying out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I wonder if that stomach pill hasn't worked its way through my system yet?\"</i> Hunter thought, unable to fathom why else she could feel so hungry despite what she'd consumed yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber had already grabbed a tray. She'd loaded up a bowl of fruit, and was currently adding a couple waffles to the plate. Unaware of the thoughts going through Hunter's head, she said, \"C'mon, Hunter, you should eat at least a little something. You won't be able to concentrate in class if you're starving all day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Black's willpower was already extremely low, and she took very little prodding to convince to have breakfast. <i>\"But the question is, what should I have...\"</i></span></div></div>",

Her belly, barely recovered from last night, was once more rock hard, and Hunter was in an abominable amount of pain. If it weren't for Amber's help, it's very likely she wouldn't currently be able to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. I didn't mean t-URP! Oh God.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber crinkled her nose as the raven haired girl let a gut ripping belch loose right next to her head. She shook her head, trying to get rid of the ringing in her ear. \"Seriously, twice in two days? No, who am I kidding, twice in two meals!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm never taking one of those stomach aids again.\" Another, quieter belch left her mouth, though this time she aimed it away from her room mate. \"Ever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep eating like this, and you'll outgrow the uniform they dropped off by Christmas. Assuming you don't die, at least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter could only groan in response, focused as she was on placing one shaking leg in front of the other. <i>\"Oh God, this hurts,\"</i> Hunter thought as her mind replayed the events which led her to this state...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Well, I'll just grab a muffin.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat thought seemed innocent enough. After she'd eaten the muffin, though, Hunter felt like she needed a little something else. And so she grabbed a tray, and grabbed a fried egg and a few strips of bacon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill hungry, she got up for a waffle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo more quickly followed, then she started into a tray of cupcakes. The questionable nature of cupcakes for breakfast never entered her addled mind. One, two, four, ten, it just wasn't enough. She needed more! More and more and more and more! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWetting her throat periodically with cups of tea (heavy on the sugar and cream), she ate as fast as she could, only limited by her ability to chew and swallow. Hunter was vaguely aware of Amber's worried questions, but did little more then grunt in response. Even as her belly began to ache, she still forced herself from her chair to grab even more food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Oh my God, that cake looks so good! Ooo, cinnamon buns! Fresh doughnuts! Peach cobbler, mmm! Creme cheese danishes! Ooo, strudels!\"</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter was spending as much time stuffing her face in line as she was filling her tray. The entire lunchroom was watching with varying degrees of interest as the busty freshman seemed intent on filling herself to the point of bursting. A couple had taken out their phones and begun filming the spectacle. Hunter, though, was unaware of any of this, totally focused on eating more and more as her appetite unnaturally surged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, she was certainly paying for it now. Hunter had hit that final wall hard, and it was nothing short of a miracle that she hadn't thrown up yet. As she staggered along with the aid of her living crutch, she looked down and saw her impressive bust had done a fair bit of work as a primitive bib. Unfortunately, that meant the food stains were on the sweater vest she'd borrowed from Amber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sorry about your vest.\" Hunter wasn't able to say much more, currently holding back a belch that had the potential to become something far worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber shook her head a bit. \"Don't worry about it,\" she said. \"I can always wash it later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber couldn't help but look her suffering roomie over as the two kept moving forward. <i>\"Her boobs were already stretching it out enough. I guess her belly is now just helping keep it even.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two came to a crossroads in the walking trail. Truthfully, Amber had wanted to grab one of the scooters to transport Hunter, but all the mobility aids had been claimed before she got to the lobby, forcing the two to march there on foot. The two turned towards...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Choice One:</b> Despite Amber's advice, Hunter refuses to miss her first day, so they're heading to class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Choice Two:</b> Hunter is in no shape to attend class, and Amber is helping her to the infirmary. She has no doubt that they're far too used to dealing with cases of overeating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Choice Three:</b> Hunter is sure she just needs to sleep it off, so Amber is helping her back to their dorm. She'll inform the teacher of the what's happened on her arrival to class.</span></div></div>",

She wanted to take Hunter back to the room to maybe sleep it off, but without a handy mobility aid she probably wasn't going to make it. Frustratingly, the few people meandering down the hallway towards their first class took one look at the green freshman and gave the pair a wide berth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything alright, ladies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber poked her head up around Hunter's to spot a heavyset lady trotting towards them, young but clearly not a student judging by her white outfit, and olive skinned with wavy black hair. The nice blouse stretched itself tightly against a prominent pot-belly, and when the lady came to a stop, her jacket stopped swinging long enough to reveal the stethoscope tucked into her pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you a nurse?\" Amber asked. \"My roommate's really sick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodness me, she does look unwell,\" the woman said in surprise, stepping forward to give her a once-over, her eyes lingering on Hunter's engorged stomach. \"Overdid it at breakfast?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, how did you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Happens all the time, especially with the new students,\" the nurse said matter-of-factly before turning to Hunter. \"Do you think you can make it that far? What's your name, dear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurrr....Hunter Black,\" Hunter managed to huff out without dry heaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Hunter, let's get you to the infirmary and let you lie down,\" the nurse replied, taking her by the other arm Amber didn't already have. \"Baby steps, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, it was not much of a hike before Amber reached a room marked with a red cross. Holding open the door for the nurse escorting her bloated buddy, Amber suddenly became aware of a whole chorus of groans. Along the far wall were almost a dozen other students, mostly freshman, clutching at their stomachs in agony. One particularly enormous belch echoed from a freckled readheaded girl so massive she took up two chairs, making the poor freshers next to her turn acid green. The redhead peered over her chipmunk cheeks to spot Hunter being settled into her own chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alriiiight...\" she slurred. \"Newbies know how to EAT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis school is just too much, Amber thought to herself incredulously before the nurse shoved something into her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doctor's note, for Hunter,\" the nurse explained. \"Pass this to the dean of students and she won't get into trouble for being absent from her courses today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks miss...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hasek,\" Nurse Hasek replied. \"Now hurry along and get to your class, I can't write a note for you.\" Hasek chuckled as Amber dutifully scurried off, leaving the Nurse to survey her domain, All in all, not as bad as last year, she thought. The infirmary stations tended to get swamped on the first day as the new students got a taste of the cuisine, and while this was a lot to deal with, it was far more manageable. Rolling up her sleeves, she prepared to get to work caring for these students, thankful that for once during this rush she didn't have to deal with-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BANG*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-the head nurse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, let's see what the damage is this year,\" Allison Spades grumbled, waddling up to the row of students. The younger students, Hunter included, looked up hopefully, only to be greeted with what could very generously be described as an unpleasant expression. Compared to her prim and proper and heavyset underling, this new nurse looked disheveled, like she had just woken up late and rushed into work that day, and Hunter recognized the tell-tale signs of a hangover, thanks to seeing Parker wake up with quite a few of them growing up. Not to mention her size; this lady was closer to the headmistress in terms of her weight, sporting a saggy double belly and chunky thighs, with a nice fat double chin hiding her neck. The headmistress was definitely larger, but standing this close and looking this nasty, Hunter thought the nurse seemed a lot bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These girls get worse and worse every year, stuffing themselves like a bunch of greedy pigs,\" Allison complained without a hint of irony. \"Have you treated them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I was going to give them some water and let them rest, then-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said to treat them, not mother them!\" Allison snapped, prompting a lot of hurt looks from the students who were used to Hasek's kind words as the head nurse waddled into the back room, her hips brushing against the door frame. Nurse Hasek was rather tight-lipped as she waited, and Hunter couldn't help but be impressed, being used to living with girls who would have socked someone like this head nurse in the jaw in two seconds flat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't let her get to you,\" the massive redhead told the girl next to her. \"Nurse Spades treats everyone like garbage. Ooof...\" Hunter felt another wave of nausea rearing its ugly head, and curled up as the head nurse returned from the back room, carrying a bottle of pills that Hunter would have recognized if she wasn't too busy trying not to puke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure the Yeng stomach aid pills are a good idea...\" Hasek interjected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure I asked your opinion,\" Spades retorted, pressing a pill into Hunter's hand before going around to the others. \"Just take these and you'll be healthy enough to get to your next class.\" Hasek frowned as she went to get some water for the students to take with them, though most of them, desperate for relief, took them dry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter included.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, just take it easy girls, and don't overdo it on the meal plans, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be careful, thanks Miss Hasek!\" Hunter said brightly as she and the other girls dispersed, some of them forcing their way around the massive redheaded girl. Checking her phone and noticing it was just getting to the end of the first period, Hunter made her way to what would have been her first class and patiently waited outside. The nurse may have been crabby, but the medicine did help a lot. No more stomach pain! In fact, Hunter felt a bit peckish after remembering it was approaching on lunchtime soon. She gave a sideways glance at a nearby vending machine before the door opened and the students came flooding out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hunter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter flinched in surprise as her roommate dashed over and pulled her into a hug, only to immediately jump off, her face flushed as a crowd began to form in the hallway around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hehe, sorry about that. Got a bit excited,\" she said, awkwardly laughing it off. \"So...how are you feeling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better, thanks,\" Hunter said. \"Least I won't be missing any more classes today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, you didn't miss much anyway, just going over the rules and an intro to the class,\" Amber said, handing over a sheaf of papers. \"Got a syllabus for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Hunter said, leafing through it before a loud gargle echoed from her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh, are you serious right now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? It's lunchtime!\" Hunter insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, in two hours!\" Amber countered. \"And after that breakfast...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't that bad!\" Seemingly in response, Hunter whipped out her phone and opened up a video clip. To her embarrassment and shame, Hunter realized she was watching herself from earlier, gorging herself like a hog at a trough as the students cheered her on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And this is going viral, too,\" Amber pointed out. \"In a school that's pretty used to people eating like this, you eating like this is notable enough to go freakin' <i>viral</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, fine,\" Hunter said, throwing her hands up. \"And thanks for reminding me I've made a pariah of myself on my first day here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heeeeey, Hunter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter winced as a girl waddling by slapped her thrown-up hand, thinking it was a hi-five.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw the video, girl you are the BOMB!\" the hi-fiver said brightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I've never seen something so amazing!\" another girl piped in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could give the seniors a run for their money!\" an excitable freshman squeaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very impressive,\" an older girl with a snooty look to her said to her friend as they passed by. \"This one may be Buttercombe material after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter's heart fluttered. Poor, despondent, hand-me-down wearing Hunter Black....Buttercombe material!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This school is SO weird...\" Amber muttered to herself as she watched Hunter practically glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter Black's stunt tackling the Breakfast of the Apocalypse made her known throughout the school, and it was the icebreaker she needed to start making new friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption A: Just other normal freshmen girls like her, eager to learn and perhaps less eager to deal with the side effects that the food at Buttercombe can have on a girl's figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption B: Veteran students who think that she's cool enough to hang out with the older kids on campus. Whether they're popular queen bees or just the odd clique of familiar faces, Hunter is just happy to be included!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption C: Students who take a special interest in her ability to eat, and perhaps would very much enjoy to see her 'grow' into the mold of a proper Buttercombe student.</span></div></div>",

The closest thing she had to a friend besides her roommate was the guidance counsellor, Dr. Schwartz\u2014and that was mostly because of prior connections to her sister Piper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut for someone to approach her, and tell her that she as (without hyperbole) the bomb? Well, that was practically unheard of! Hunter Black was\u2026 the bomb! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho would have ever thunk it?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks!\u201d she said with a smile about as wide as she felt tall, \u201cI\u2019m happy to be\u2026 um\u2026 <i>Buttercombe Material!!</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls that had approached Hunter and Amber were older girls\u2014no doubt about it. Sure, had they been more versed in the peculiar traditions that Buttercombe Academy had adopted\u2014specifically the correlation between size and grade\u2014it would have been that much more obvious. The arabian ball of chub that had approached her couldnt' have weighed less than three hundred pounds. Her chins were wrapped tightly into her hijab, but the rest of her billowing body illustrated just how far she'd let herself go. Either of hte other two would have been an excellent example in their own rights as well. Hunter had grown up around lots of fat women, but never anyone <i>so</i> round and <i>so</i> young. But the fact that they were taller, more confident, and all-around more <i>mature</i> than either of them helped sell the image that their weights didn\u2019t\u2014Hunter had been approached by a particular sect of cool kids that just so happened to lean <i>hard</i> into Buttercombe\u2019s supposed lifestyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to know that not all of Buttercombe\u2019s newbees are a bunch of fucking wimps.\u201d Said the oldest\u2014a middle-eastern girl with a billowing brown belly that poured out from underneath her uniform, \u201cAll these other babies would have been crying home to their mommies after a meal like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, well\u2026\u201d Hunter clicked her tongue stupidly\u2014her intense desire to be liked outweighing her need for modesty\u2014\u201cYou know, food stamps and all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god she\u2019s funny too!\u201d said the WASP-y one as she leaned closer to touch Hunter\u2019s shoulder, \u201cIt\u2019s so nice to meet a freshman who isn\u2019t all \u201clike me, I\u2019m rich I swear!\u201d\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight?

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It didn't take long for that glowing feeling of popularity to be replaced with a hearty helping of anxiety. Years of being the unpopular book-loving dweeb through high school had taught her that a lot of friendships had catches, especially if the cool kids took interest in you. Those people had no problem schmoozing her up, treating her all nice, then dumping her with a hard group project 'because she's so smart and I'm just sooooo, busy', and more often then not Hunter was pressured into giving them exactly what they wanted, if only for that sliver of hope that the cool kids won't go back to treating her like dirt if she helped them ace a grade or two. They never did, of course, so even as she still basked in the glow of her famous feast, she put up a front in the face of these cool seniors at first, fearing the popping of the question, the asking of one teeny, tiny favor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver time, though, Hunter could tell there was something different about these three girls. For one, they weren't the popular cheerleader types who usually approached her, and two, it was very unlikely that seniors would need help from a first year student in their classwork so early in the semester. More to the point, Hunter never got the sense of that distance she had with the cool kids in high school, that yearning to be closer to them and actually get to know them. The girls genuinely did seem interested in her and where she came from, and while Hunter didn't have many cool and awesome stories to share, they always made an effort to look invested, at the very least. Mostly though, Hunter suspected that she felt they were different because they actually had something in common; they really enjoyed a good meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man...\" Hunter groaned. \"I am soooo stuffed right now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silence, ye blasphemer,\" the tall pale student announced in an old-testament sort of way. \" I, Coraline, doth decree, thou shalt always have room for ice cream!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter giggled at the silly impression of a vengeful and powerful god as she pondered her empty plate, a couple grease stains and condiment smudges left over. She thought of how a nice cold dairy would pair well with that spicy Italian meatloaf. Yeah, she'd eaten meatloaf. Cafeteria meatloaf, no less. Goddamn, the food here was good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe a bowl, then,\" Hunter concluded. \"Or two.\" She reached down to try and loosen the tightness of the skirt around her midriff, but was distracted when a billowing belly brushed past her shoulder and a banana split was set in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Somehow I thought you would say that,\" the three-hundred pound Middle Eastern girl said, setting the banana splits which she expertly managed to carry over down in front of the other girls, one for hunter and two each for the seniors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear, Sanya, you just like showing off,\" Coraline said accusingly as she dug into her ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you spend eight years as a waitress and it never goes away,\" Sanya said proudly, her hands on her wide hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, well you're outnumbered by the pizza girls here,\" Coraline retorted, reaching out to fist-bump Hunter, which she returned without looking up from her own dessert. \"Do you even count as a working girl if your dad owned the restaurant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You say that like he owned the Ritz or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nepotism totally makes you a spoiled rich girl, though!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does not!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls, girls,\" Hunter said, channeling the energy of her big sister. \"You're both pretty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two looked at one another, then burst out laughing. Hunter got a surge of pride at landing her joke just as the third senior girl waddled up with her roommate Amber not far behind, both of them with their own towering sundaes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crisis averted!\" the older, WASP-ier girl announced, patting Amber on the shoulder as they sat down. \"Don't worry honey, you're not the first girl to pop a seam here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-thanks Tasha,\" Amber stuttered, turning pink at the airing of her dirty laundry, so to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem! Clothing maintenance is a handy skill to have, especially at Buttercombe.\" Picking up her spoon, Tasha scooped a nice sized helping of whipped cream. \"Now I don't know about you girls, but I'm hoping to pop a few seams myself tonight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah that was something Hunter was still getting used to. Being a big eater was one thing, but growing up poor wasn't exactly a catalyst for wanting to deliberately damage your wardrobe. Here though, if only with these three, it was certainly not a bad thing to do. In fact, they seemed to encourage it. Amber for instance was little more then \"Hunter's roomie\" to her new senior friends up until the point where she split open the side of her jacket the first time, and then suddenly they became far more inclusive. Wolfing down her dessert in contemplative silence as Amber and Tasha chatted it up, Hunter wondered if she was just being paranoid when...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*PING*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter gasped as she felt her skirt loosen with a sudden snap, the button flying off and hitting the metal supports of the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" Sanya asked, sounding concerned as Hunter's face flushed red with embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...uh...think I popped my skirt open,\" Hunter admitted with reluctance. Looking down, she didn't even have to lift her shirt to see the damage, the belly hanging out was enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, that means more room for dessert!\" Coraline said with glee as she, much to Hunter's abject terror, pushed her spare sundae over to the younger girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? N-no, I'm fine with-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotta fill up the tank now,\" Sanya said, pushing her own spare towards her as well. Hunter stared at the extra two in abject horror as Tasha pushed her own spare over to join them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's our little challenge, you have a wardrobe malfunction mid-meal, you get extras,\" Tasha explained. \"Amber did it too, we stocked up on the vending machine in between here and my dorm.\" Amber nodded, letting out a tiny belch and patting her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sonya got back up to fetch more ice cream, Hunter stared at the bounty in front of her. She wanted to say no, reject this outright out of fear of puking it up an hour later or worse, but at the same time...this was a really good sundae.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe...kind of wanted more...</span></div></div>",

She was so delicate in this state that every step was met with an audible wince, her ballooned belly bouncing painfully at every awkward shuffle that they managed. She was still so full from last night, and then she'd gone and piled even more on top of it, so quickly! There was no way she was going to be able to sit down and participate in even the most basic introductory material in her next class. Or even the class after that, or after that... Hunter was going to have to spend her whole first day in bed sleeping off enough calories to feed an army!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow ow, owie ow...\" Hunter whimpered as she was lowered into bed, her hand clutching the sides of her turgid gut as it domed out on top of her, \"Begentleplease...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not like you're making it easy, you know.\" Amber made a face as she straightened back up to a standing position, \"Finding a balance between the sausage and the waffles you ate is easier said than done when I'm the one carrying you down the hallway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter could only pant shallowly as she struggled against the fullness of her stomach. Her vision was hazy and her thoughts were clouded. She'd never experienced anything like this before. Her whole body was cold and clammy, except for the peak of her mountainous middle as it rose and fell, red and shiny like a volcano about to burst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeesh, you look bad.\" the lanky blonde grimaced<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee thanks.\" Hunter managed a snarky response, if somewhat breathy and wet, \"I... don't think I'm gonna make it to classes today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No dip. You ate the whole cafeteria.\" Amber chuckled, finding levity in the situation, \"Wait until I tell all your teachers you won't be going to your first day because of a bellyache.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Amberrrr</i>...\" Hunter whined, \"Duh-Don't tell them that... puh-please...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, I wasn't gonna anyway.\" Amber put her hands on her hips playfully, \"Would you rather have a stomach bug or explosive diarrhea?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>AMBER</i>.\" Hunter whimpered more pointedly, \"I swear to God I'll... I'll throw up on you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them exchanged a laugh. What could satisfy as a laugh, given Hunter's current predicament. Even the slight breaths she was taking were enough to make her skin feel like it was tearing off. She was stuffed to an absolute limit, her maximum capacity. A pinprick would be enough to make her pop like a balloon in one of those old cartoons. Her forehead was damp with dewy sweat, matting her black bangs to her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna get to class.\" Amber said a little more softly, sounding more concerned than instigatory, \"Do you... need anything before I go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, just...\" Hunter burped, \"Turn off the light, please? I'm gonna try to sleep this off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber did as she was told, smiling gently as she inched towards the doorway made her exit as quietly as possible. With one of her long fingers, she flicked the light switch to its off position, and let the curtains take their turn at keeping out the daylight. The room was a soft creamy yellow as the sunlight filtered through the drapes, but it was <i>just</i> dark enough for Hunter to get some sleep...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hunter was walking through a long, dark hallway. She could barely see, and left to follow her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWherever she was going smelt delicious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery now and again, a lone candle would light the passage way, and there was always treats on the small tables they stood on. Brownies, and bites of cake, and tarts, and cookies, and more, and more besides. Hunter couldn't stop herself from trying everything, as it was just too good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first couple snack tables she handled without a problem. But the tables seemed endless, and she felt more bloated and uncomfortable the further along she got. A couple times, she thought she might not be able to stomach anymore, and it took her pushing herself to get the last few bites down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I can't leave anything to waste, it's just way too good!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when she thought she was at last too full to eat anymore, Hunter came across an odd fountain. The liquid that flowed within it wasn't water. For starters, it was pink and had a really strong, sweet smell to it. It was flowing from a large amphora being held by an extremely fat woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she looked at the statue, Hunter heard a voice in her head. <i><b>\"Are you hungry?\"</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe jumped, but answered the weird voice. \"Yes, but I'm so full. I can't eat anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice, angelic or daemonic, laughed. <i><b>\"Yes you can. Just drink of my water, and eat as you will\"</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter probably should have questioned the voice's motives, but she didn't. She was just way too hungry. Dropping her hands into the fountain's basin, she drank deeply of the sweet, entrancing liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she felt the pain in her belly disappear as the food she'd so far eaten vanished. Hunter, hungry before, now felt absolutely famished. Desperately, she looked around for something, ANYTHING to eat. Sniffing the air, she ran towards the promise of food, almost hysterical in her need to fill her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning a corner, the black haired teen found a feast of divine proportions arrayed before her. A long line of tables stretching into the abyss ran before her, packed to the brim with food. Candied salmon, baked ham, piping hot lasagna, fresh baked doughnuts still steaming from the fryer, and more endlessly stretched before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter's belly let out a growl so loud that it echoed off the walls. Her patience at its end, she began stuffing her face, swallowing mouthfuls of food as fast as she could funnel them to her insatiable maw. More, more, more, it was never enough! Her belly felt like an aching black hole, and she just couldn't get it full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Hunter ate more and more, she felt her clothes growing increasingly tight. As she stuffed herself, she realized what the fluid from the fountain did. Simply put, it emptied her belly, and kept it empty, by instantly converting whatever she ate into fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe olive-skinned teen was growing at a prodigious rate, her body layering itself with thick layers of heavy fat. Her already large bust was expanding rapidly, quickly snapping her bra and straining her shirt. Her gut began to grow, first as a little pot belly, but soon growing into a multi-rolled ball. Her love handles expanded, first hitting the size of baseballs, then softballs, then footballs. Her booty initially lagged behind, but all too soon was surging forth, stretching her poor skirt to its limits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter didn't care, so long as she could eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body kept growing by leaps and bounds. Her shirt popped first, freeing her giga-tits and letting the girls surge forward and down as gravity took its toll on her lardy extremities. Her belly stretched forward, downward, and widened, her rolls quickly growing too large to get her fingers around and still growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer booty and thighs burst her skirt and leggings, growing thicker by the mouthful. Her limbs began to tremble, only slightly at first, but it soon became unbearable, and Hunter collapsed under her own weight. The food, however, magically floated over to her and so she kept stuffing her face. Soon she was as large as a full sized van, but then the food suddenly stopped out of her reach. Hunter whimpered and reached for the food with a groan, the fat from her arm dropping a solid 18 inches. She failed to even come close, made totally helpless by her enormous weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\"My, my, my, aren't you a promising one.\"</b></i> That voice, so divine and hellish in equal measure, spoke again. <i><b>\"Most people need a little more coaxing, but not you, do you? My, my, my, what a gluttonous little thing. My master will be pleased.\"</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA figure walked agonizingly slowly into her view. Her skin was pink or purple, depending on how you looked at her, with random patterns of shifting scales and horns. She smiled, revealing a mouthful of needle-like teeth. Her nails were sharp, black talons, and her body was bedecked in countless piercings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\"You were born for the Prince, weren't you? You just love eating until it hurts. Eating and getting so much fatter. You're already so fat, but you just want to eat more, don't you?\"</b></i> Hunter held her silence, save a fearful whimper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\"Tell me.\"</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe remained silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\"TELL ME!\"</b></i> the Daemon Princess screamed as her face took on a more daemonic visage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter, in her terror, answered honestly. \"Y-yes, I do! I love eating! I love being fat, and I want to get fatter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Daemon Princess smiled. <i><b>\"Beg me for it.\"</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please! Stuff me past insanity! Make me fatter, please! I beg you! I need to eat! Please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe horrible creature laughed. <i><b>\"Oh, you wonderful mortal thing! You'll do well amongst us!\"</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe food began to float again, spinning together until it became a massive calorie cream. It flowed into Hunter's belly like a torrent of water and she felt her body simply explode with fat. Her body grew so much that her fat blended into a single drooping mass of rolls and lard, constantly growing, with only her unbelievably fat face exposed, delirious with madness and ecstasy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter woke up in a cold sweat in her darkened room. Gasping, she struggled to catch her breath. <i>\"Holy crap, I need to lay off the 40k...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaned forward. Her belly still somewhat hurt, though nowhere near as much as it had earlier. <i>\"What time is it?\"</i></span></div></div>",

She took Hunter\u2019s bags for her and said that they\u2019d be delivered to her dorm, and hurried her out the door like she was going to miss some big important event. And honestly, Hunter had been a little worried about missing her group too\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she had arrived fifteen minutes late and they hadn\u2019t even made it out of the cafeteria yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo <i>hiiiii</i>~\u201d said a chunky blonde in a big yellow shirt and white short shorts, \u201cI\u2019m Melissa and I\u2019m gonna be your tour guide today!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter had been lumped in with a group of girls\u2026 maybe about 20 of them. All of them were about her age, predominately white, really WASP-y most of them. She already felt like she didn\u2019t really belong, but being the only one late to a guided tour of the campus <i>and</i> feeling like the poor girl out really didn\u2019t do wonders for her self esteem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn top of that, Big Bird was going to be their tour guide. Great.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey really shouldn\u2019t let women with thighs that big wear shorts. Her butt looked like a giant marshmallow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow that everyone\u2019s here, we\u2019re gonna start our tour\u2014make sure y\u2019all stay together and if you have any questions, just ask me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so began the awkward shuffling of feet as Freshmen dragged themselves to stay at the sluggish pace of their incessant and inanely chipper tour guide. She did that fake thing that people do where they try to make it seem like you\u2019re going to be friends afterwards\u2026 nobody really seemed to buy it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter had never been the most social girl\u2014it came in the package of her being deeply sarcastic and thinking herself a bit smarter than most girls her age. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy had her mom done this to her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no way of knowing just how <i>boring</i> this would be\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter did her best to blend in.

Smart girl like Hunter Black managed to get herself separated from a group led by one of the loudest, most annoying girls in history? Go figure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt happened sometime after Big Bird started talking about the benefactors of whatever Wing they were in. The West Wing, yeah, but they were supposed to be in some big fancy computer lab or something. She had been talking and Hunter just kind of zoned out for a while\u2026 before she knew it, Hunter had taken a left when she should have taken a right. And then another left, and then a right, and then\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere was she, now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was perfect. Total Hunter move, she cussed as she tried to find her way back to her tour group. First day here and she\u2019s already lost as could be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor it being almost the first day of school, the hallways weren\u2019t exactly bustling. Not many other girls were out and about, and the ones that Hunter could see weren\u2019t exactly in the mood to help. For one reason or another, Hunter found herself without a Sherpa on this mountain that was her prospective home for the next for years\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey.\u201d A voice sounded from behind her, \u201cHey you\u2014skinny.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter turned around.

From what Hunter could tell by the fit of her uniform, she had a bit of a tummy and wide hips. Her thighs were thick and made the skirt of her uniform flare out a bit. She had her hands on her hips; the purple of her nails matched her smoky eye shadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe?

Interested?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, admittedly, Hunter was a very smart girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe\u2019d never missed a day of school (besides that time she got Mono from drinking after her older sister) and her grades were phenomenal. Hunter was the smartest girl in her family, in her school, and perhaps on one whole side of her home town. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo when an older girl in dark makeup who she just met asks her if she wanted to hang out upstairs, in a place that she\u2019d never been before, and knew nobody where her only lifeline was literally driving into another state by now, Hunter\u2019s gut reaction was to call stranger danger and go find her tour group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nB-U-T Hunter had never been cool before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sisters were cool.

But as this was her first impression with a Buttercombe dorm room, and still riding high on the prospect of being accepted by someone who was so clearly cooler than her, she was a little more dazzled by this room than any particular other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFull kitchen set, a big living room and two bedrooms. TV, nicer than the one at home, and cool band posters plastered all over the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter squealed\u2014which made Willa look at her funny, so she quietly ducked her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is the place.\u201d Willa said over the mid-to-high background noise of generic alt-rock sounds, \u201cMake yourself comfortable.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree other girls had already done as much, two of them crowded the furniture while the other stood ass-end out of the fridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust anywhere?\u201d Hunter squeaked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Willa asked, cupping her ear<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJUST ANYWHERE?\u201d Hunter asked a little louder<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, just wherever.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe choices were\u2026 not great. Willa had good intentions, but there wasn\u2019t actually a lot of room. And not for lack of trying. The frizzy-headed blonde plopped herself on one of the loveseats next to a full-figured Hispanic girl who was buried nose-deep into her phone. Between the two of them, Willa was the smaller. There wasn\u2019t a lot of room, but Hunter <i>may</i> have been able to squeeze in if she tried\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWould that be weird? Probably weird\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, on the <i>other</i> love seat, was this\u2026 really, really fat girl. She looked like a marshmallow, just big and fluffy. She had blonde hair cut into this cute little bob, straight out of a fashion magazine. She was so big that she had to prop her pillowy arms on her massive chest just to see her phone. There was about as much room there too, but\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat would definitely be weird. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlus, Hunter really didn\u2019t want to be rude\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, sorry, where are my manners.\u201d Willa turned the music down, \u201cLadies this is\u2026 uh\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHunter.\u201d The busty freshman piped, \u201cI\u2019m Hunter Black. New. I\u2019m student. New student.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026this is Hunter.\u201d Willa\u2019s cringing was obvious, \u201cShe\u2019s new. New student.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe other girls laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is Bianca\u2014she lives next door.\u201d Willa gestured to the Latina sitting next to her, \u201cShe\u2019s cool.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBianca was pretty chubby too for that matter. She was a little more belly heavy than Willa was though. She was actually dressed in her uniform\u2014maybe that helped? Hindered\u2026 whatever. Point is, she looked up from her phone to smile at Hunter, and then went promptly back to her social media feed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s Nora\u2014she\u2019s down the hall.\u201d Willa held a hand out to gesture to <i>all</i> of the huge girl sitting opposite to her, \u201cShe\u2019s pretty cool.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora wiggled her fingers at Hunter. Even that small action seemed to reverberate in the girth of her arms. Hunter had seen some larger people in her life, but Nora was probably one of the biggest. She wouldn\u2019t learn this until later, but Nora was actually a Junior, and qualified for the SSS program.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s Robin\u2014our RA.\u201d Willa pointed to the skinny girl in the fridge, \u201cShe\u2019s lame.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDefinitely lame.\u201d Nora snorted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo lame.\u201d Bianca added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I ordered you pizza.\u201d The skinny Senior stepped forward from the kitchen, \u201cAND found your ranch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLess lame.\u201d Bianca corrected, holding out her hand for the bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin was taller than Willa or Bianca, but wasn\u2019t nearly as big. She was somewhat plain looking, with glasses and a short academic haircut. But, that being said, she did find the ranch. And she actually looked at Hunter and introduced herself. So she was <i>polite</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice to meet you.\u201d She said earnestly, \u201cAll jokes aside, I\u2019m RA of the hall. You need anything while you\u2019re here, you come to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike ranch.\u201d Nora joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRAAAANCH.\u201d The other girls mooed in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis room was fucking weird, dude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nANYWAY.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cANYWAY.\u201d Willa rolled her eyes, \u201cSit down, New Hunter\u2014we\u2019re just about to get the night started.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Hunter blinked, watching Robin situate her skinny self next to Nora, finding herself suddenly without an option <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay\u2026\u201d she said, sitting criss-cross applesauce on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTonight\u2019s festivities were planned by\u2026</span></div></div>",

Uh, Robbie. You wanna get the stuff?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobbie rolled her eyes. \"Uh, no. I just sat down. You get the stuff.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBianca's eyes glanced at the other girls for a moment before settling on Hunter. \"Hey, newbee. Go get that bag from the table, wouldja?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, yea.\" Hunter, eager to be useful, popped up right away. She walked around the couch and grabbed the plastic shopping bag from the table. The top was tied off, but the size and shape of the bag's contents left little doubt what was inside. She carried it over and set it gently on the coffee table, her heart thumping a little louder and her palms starting to sweat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBianca leaned over and untied the bag, pulling out a shiny glass bong to a chorus of whoops and cheers from the gathered girls. Hunter stayed silent, trying not to look too nervous. One of the reasons for her social seclusion back in Daven's Port was her outright refusal to smoke or drink. It was part of her persona, a point of pride - she was the smart sister, too smart to burn her brain cells down with weed. At school she'd earned a reputation as a bit of a prude. But here she was, her first day at her new school - her first hour, even - gathered around a bong with girls she didn't know. She hadn't even been to her <i>own</i> room yet. She could almost imagine Piper's snarky smirk. Wouldn't her older sister be so proud... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ever smoked before, Hunter?\" Robin asked as Bianca popped the clasps on a small, round container. The smell of weed drifted over them - a more pleasant smell than Hunter expected. Even the weed was high-class at this place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... no. Never.\" Hunter replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh!\" Bianca grinned. She was packing the bowl, her belly squashed atop her thighs as she leaned over the coffee table. \"Nothing like corrupting the innocent.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen,\" Robin said kindly. \"You don't have to if you don't want to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you don't want to be cool, anyway.\" Willa said. Nora snorted. Robin shot the blond a sharp look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just kiddin!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's all right,\" Hunter said, sounding more confident than she was. \"I mean... it's gotta happen sometime, right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the spirit.\" Bianca slid the bowl back into the bong and lifted it onto her lap. She produced a lighter and looked at Hunter. \"Now, pay attention, newbee. You're about to lean some serious life skills shit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe explained briefly how to take a hit from the bong, following it up with a demonstration. Hunter watched as the water inside the vase bubbled and the chamber filled with a solid white smoke. Then Bianca pulled the plug and the fog shot into her lungs. She held it for a bit, cringing with the effort, before throwing her head back and letting it billow out like a steam engine. Willa cheered and shook her by the shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that,\" Bianca said, her voice a little strained, \"is how you take a hit.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey passed it around, each girl taking their own hit, before it finally ended up on the floor in front of Hunter. The young girl considered the bong carefully, lifting it, turning it, sliding the bowl in and out a few times. This felt like a betrayal, somehow. Like all those stupid kids she'd made fun of would win if she went through with this. It meant that they were right, and she was wrong. Hunter hated being wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on, then. Hit it!\" Willa encouraged her. \"Hit it! Hit it! Hit it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora took up the chant, and Bianca too. Hunter took a deep breath. She was in too deep to bow out graciously, now. If she walked away, she would forever be the lame girl, the stuck-up, the smart-ass. This was her chance to shed her old persona and emerge as someone else. To have friends. To be cool. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flicked the lighter and put her mouth to the opening, just as Bianca had showed her. She pulled. The water bubbled and the chamber filled. The chant of Hit it! grew in intensity until she pulled the bowl and felt the fog fill her lungs as her new companions cheered. She began coughing  almost immediately. Robin got off her seat and plopped down next to her, patting her back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, there! That was a big girl hit.\" Willa said. \"Nice one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her aching throat and watering eyes, Hunter felt acceptance flow over her as the girls all voiced their approval. Robin stood and got her a glass of water, which soothed the scratching in her throat and allowed her to catch her breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh. Oh man,\" Hunter muttered, coughing a little more. \"Jeez. That was... something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the doorbell rang. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit, the pizza.\" Willa stood quickly and moved to open the window, waving her arms uselessly to try and hurry the stench that had permeated the whole apartment. Robin rose again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it,\" the RA said easily, waving it off. \"They're probably high too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Robin paid for the pizza - three large pies, each with different toppings - Hunter began to feel the effects of the weed. It was a feeling that started in her stomach and moved its way up her spine, a creeping sensation that left her brain buzzing. It was...</span></div></div>",

First, she was filled with pride over the fact she\u2019d done this on her own. It was a big leap, but she could do this! Tucking her few strands of her long  brunette hair behind her ear, she congratulated herself for not wrinkling, ripping, or out-and-out loosing the paper she\u2019d been given that held all the important information about her new school year, including her room number and its location.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex was also filled with determination too. Yes, Alex was finally away from her overbearing parents. Away from them and the way they were always\u2026always\u2026well it wasn\u2019t exactly nagging, more like over caring about her too much\u2026was that a thing?  Always checking to make sure she was okay at every other hour of the day, calling her whenever she was a single minute later than she\u2019d said she was going to be, never in anger\u2026but they were just\u2026smothering her!  So when Alex\u2019s mother had suggested going to Buttercombe Academy, she\u2019d immediately jumped at the chance to finally get out of the house without even glancing at the pamphlet. She\u2019d be free and that was all that mattered to her! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe loved her parents really she did, but it was starting to just be too much! Alex\u2019s father had owned a large ice cream company; Glac\u00e9 de Greese. Although her parents weren\u2019t French in the slightest the haughty name was key in marketing, as well as Alex herself; much to her chagrin  her smiling chubby six year old face still adorned every tub the product sold. The company wasn\u2019t exactly world famous or anything, but they did quite well even considering the competition. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Alex\u2019s thoughts had led her to be filled with anxiety! Her dad\u2019s company had done spectacularly, no thanks to Yeng corporation, they\u2019d tried to buy her father\u2019s company for years!  Now the she was heading to an Academy where they\u2019d had a major partnership it made her a bit apprehensive.  She could remember after her father refused to sell-out to Yeng, they did everything they could do try and ruin him; negative advertising, scam reviews, signing exclusive deals with nearby restaurants so they no longer sold Greese brand ice-cream.  Through it all her father\u2019s company survived because their product was just that darn good. Her father had even kept the struggles to himself for the most part after coming home from work, but there were the one or two rare nights she could hear him retelling stories of outrage to the family  over dessert at their dinner table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, right, that was another thing Alex was filled with\u2026food; a lot\u2026and often! Revisiting her past, one can only imagine how often she\u2019d asked for bowl after bowl to be refilled with her family\u2019s own <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">fattening</span> luscious ice cream, and this was after the large delicious dinners with her parents! Over the years whenever any qualms about her weight were brought up her to her Alex\u2019s mother she was always ready with an answer; <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s just some baby fat, all girls have it. Tell me when to stop with the whip cream on top.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo \u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cYou might be a little big boned like your mother is all. Here I microwaved the hot fudge so it\u2019ll melt right into your ice cream tonight.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cObese is really just a blanket term honey. BMI is more like a clothing size, not like a disease\u2026.Hey, I heard Dad\u2019s got a new flavor he\u2019s working on, and he wants you to be the first one to try it as soon as we get home!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Eventually\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re just an early bloomer Alex honey, in fact if you ask me, those girls at school sound jealous! They\u2019re probably still stuffing bras with tissue paper and here you are outgrowing another pair\u2026 Oh, sweetie, I know there heavy, but there\u2019s plenty of other girls your age that need a double-d size for support, I mean I did too right around your age\u2026.I tell you what, when we\u2019re done shopping, I\u2019ll whip up some mac and cheese pie as soon as we get home. Sound good?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex always appreciated her mother\u2019s positivity growing up (and out), honestly it had really helped her stay in high spirits against the mean girls in middle school\u2026.but\u2026now that Alex was a little bit older and a little bit wiser and still somehow even bigger, Alex now felt that with her mother being quite the big woman herself, she might have had a bit of a pro BBW bias.  In fact Alex was fifty/fifty on that the whole \u201c<i>owning an ice-cream factory</i>\u201d thing being THE reason her mother had married her father so young, it certainly hadn\u2019t hurt, as she could never remember hearing her father complain about her mother\u2019s own massive weight even once. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain though, all of that was literally  behind the Alex now entering Buttercombe academy\u2019s student dorms, as of right now she was a new Alex, one filled with hopes! Hopes that included at least thinking about possibly starting a plan to start losing some weight now that she was away from her oppressively providing parents. Tottering around two-hundred and fifty pounds of teenage tonnage had at least come naturally to the young woman, so she had hardly any trouble navigating the crowded hallways. With one final check of the paper in her pudgy paws she saw this was indeed her room, she\u2019d finally made it!  Even if Alex was breathing a little hard from exertion, her positive thinking had pushed her on to her goal! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering through the doorway Alex was filled with surprise seeing that her roommate for the year would be\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Hello?\" Alex greeted from the door, seeing that her roommate had already settled into their quarters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl said nothing. She was maybe an inch or two taller than Alex, with blonde hair and tan, freckled skin that reminded Alex of a brown shelled egg. Much to her chagrin Alex noticed that the girl was a fraction of her weight. Most anyone her age would be but the tanned blonde was quite slender. Already changed to her uniform, Alex noted that there wasn't a curve on the girl to speak of, the uniform almost looked to be too big for her. Unlike Alex, who had a full chest and wide stomach and a girthy rear her new silent roommate had none of that. Even department store mannequins were more developed than her. The only hint of fat to grace her slender body was a pair of thick, wide thighs visible between the hem of her skirt and knee-high stockings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mysterious waif was standing there scrolling through her phone, chewing on something. She blew out a pink bubble of gum before popping it and chewing the gum back into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex was a bit miffed on being ignored but her budding optimism towards life at Buttercombe had yet to be depleted. \"Hello?\" she tried again, \"I'm Alex Greese, your new roommate?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl looked up from her phone. \"Oh. Hey, I'm Nicole Fraser.\" She went back to tapping away at her phone, changing the app as now Alex could hear the popping and bursting from one of those mobile match-puzzle games.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoodness, Nicole was a quiet one. Alex hefted her luggage further into the room, starting to feel a trickle of sweat down her back as the exertion was more than she had anticipated. Thankfully her roommate was too absorbed in her phone to notice, as Alex didn't want her first impression at school to be how fat she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving in faced a new challenge as Alex adjusted her glasses, noting the closed doors at either end of the dorm room that went off to the separate beds. \"Um, Nicole, which room did you take?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was another pop from Nicole's bubble gum. \"Oh, that's right. I needed to pick a bedroom. Thanks.\" Roused from her phone, the skinnier freshman blinked with fresh eyes. She had a long stare at Alex, viewing her for the first time, leaving the two hundred and fifty heifer of a teen feeling self conscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole crossed to a door. \"Why don't you take that one since you're closer.\" She disappeared into the room on the left, leaving Alex to get settled into the room on the right. Alex was thankful to finally get her things put away. There were clothes to unpack, school supplies to organize, and further efforts to make her room feel like home to distract her from her aloof almost oblivious roommate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least Nicole hadn't made fun of her? Alex tried to look on the bright side as she set her spare glasses case and a bottle of travel mouthwash on the nightstand before programming her alarm clock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough what Alex really needed was a distraction from the biggest temptation that sat on her bed. It was a large, if gaudy looking welcome basket filled with all manner of sweets and candy. There were gourmet chocolate bars, honey buns, and a variety of other treats. No ice cream but the 'face' of Glac\u00e9 de Greese hadn't gotten herself fat just from ice cream alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe really wanted to start dieting but her stomach betrayed her, growling and yearning for a bite from the yummy morsels. Eventually Alex could only sort her socks and underwear so many times before she caved in and unwrapped the gift basket. She promised herself she could cheat just this once. When classes started she would buckle down on her studies and try to shed some of this weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlbeit Alex had more than half of her goodie basket demolished before she came to her senses, lost in the taste sensations of each indulgent treat. Oh the chocolate was so rich! The brownie had a layer of caramel in the middle that would have gone perfectly with one of her father's homemade ice cream sundaes. Once she had one bite of the honey bun she couldn't stop with leaving it half eaten. Or leaving any of the four honey buns in the basket uneaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex was beginning to regret the splurge when she decided to get on the Buttercombe uniform. The yellow and orange clothing, although made to her measurements, was feeling a bit snug around Alex's doughy middle and her skit didn't leave her much give. That solidified her resolve to start loosing weight. Time to get out there and face the day, Alex Greese!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she left her room Alex saw that her roommate, Nicole Fraser, was sitting on the couch with her legs brought up to her lack of a chest so her feet were rested on the cushion. It had been years since Alex had ever been able to bring her legs up to her middle comfortably. Surprisingly, Nicole wasn't on her phone this time. She had a small notebook resting on her knees and was sketching away with her free hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Nicole...\" Alex wanted to warn her that Nicole's sitting position left the bottom of her tanned freckled thighs and her lavender, lacy undergarments visible. Nicole didn't make any sign of recognizing Alex's entrance, yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the one hand, Alex wanted to have a decent relationship with her roommate so maybe she should try to get to know Nicole. She sat on the other end of the couch. The action jostled Nicole but the tanned blonde didn't pause in her sketching. The quiet continued between the two roommates. Alex needed something to do so she turned to reading the informational pamphlets the academy had given her with her paperwork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex began to read the SSS brochure. The tiers of benefits confused her at first until she read the Intermediate Tier. <i>Students with a BMI of 35 or above are automatically eligible for this Tier. Please consult our physician for the proper forms.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAutomatically eligible! Alex knew that she wasn't that tall at 5'5'' and her weight put her squarely in the 40s since she had finished middle school. When she last checked her BMI it was 42 for her height at 250 pounds. This made Alex eligible for waived cafeteria fees, single resident housing, custom furniture. It was a dizzying and horrifying prospect to the young freshman that was looking to diet. God, how could her parents have let her get this fat?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-S-So Nicole,\" Alex needed a new topic of conversation, \"tell me a little about yourself. What to you think of Buttercombe so far?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore sketching from her quiet roommate. \"S'Alright. The rooms here are pretty cushy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother extended pause. Alex turned her head. \"Can I see what you're sketching?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not ready yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShut down by her roommate yet again, Alex's mind was swimming with the possibilities of what life at Buttercombe would bring her. She didn't want to get any fatter but gaining weight had become so easy for her with her hefty appetite that it seemed inevitable. Unless she made some drastic changes.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Even though Alex had made it this far into getting settled at Buttercombe Academy without flaking out, her insecurities were starting to get the better of her as she sat there on the couch. She might be, what, double Nicole's weight? A lifetime of smothering by a mother that encouraged her to eat and the dividends that came with being the child mascot of your father's ice cream company had did a number on Alex Greese.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was plenty smart and thus wasn't worried about her classes. Yet now that she was beyond her mother's supervision, it was high time to take matters into her own hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf only Alex could work up the nerve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Art. What are you here for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh??\" Alex was snapped out of her reverie by her remarkably untalkative roommate. \"What did you say, Nicole?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm enrolled in the art program.\" The skinny freshman was nose deep in her sketching again. \"You had asked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout what Nicole thought of the school? That had been minutes ago! Goodness, Alex couldn't let her nerves continue to bother her. She was going to make something of herself at school, finally be an independent girl. No, young woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Well, I'm in...I'm not quite sure what I want to focus on.\" Alex had a head for numbers and business, having learned from her father's lap how he run the company. When she could fit in his lap, at any rate. She'd dabbled in chemistry and biology. And she was an avid reader so she knew her literature. She didn't know where she wanted to shift her education focus, however, and as much as that was important her scare at reading the SSS brochure made her worried about getting her health under control before she plotted her course in life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey Nicole...\" Much as Alex Greese was emboldening herself to stand on her own two feet, she was hoping for a confidant. \"Would you mind coming with me to the infirmary?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole looked up from her sketch, blinking twice. \"The infirmary?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not contagious,\" Alex tried to clarify, before realizing that sounded worse. \"I just wanted to get some advice from the physician. And didn't want to end up lost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Nicole folded up her sketchbook. \"I can join you. I'm supposed to turn in a doctor's note.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhew! Nicole had her own reasons to go to the infirmary so Alex wouldn't feel like the center of attention. Even though her weight had become the center of her life, she now realized, for far too long. She had to stop thinking about what could have gone differently in life, about how she had already demolished half of her gift basket. This was no time to continue to flake out. Alex had to look to the future. Right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Nicole found her note the two roommates were off to travel across campus to find the nurse's office. Alec had gotten a sense of the scale of Buttercombe from finding her room although the trek made her realize just how palatial the school was arranged. The journey was half in silence until Alex found another topic of conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I may ask, what do you need to see the doctor about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are some medications I have to stay on,\" Nicole explained. \"I have an adrenal deficiency.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" Nicole could be quite frank. It put Alex's concerns into perspective. She asked a few more questions, in case there was anything she needed to monitor for Nicole as a roommate, although the skinner freshman assured her there weren't many complications. They soon found themselves at the nurse's office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clinical ward of the school, much like the other decor, had soft yellows and amber tones for the wall paper and accents. There was a nurse seated at the desk, with a few wide chairs nearby for patient waiting before the doors sung into medical rooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello,\" the nurse, Shiro Fukiyama, greeted the two roommates. If Alex thought Nicole was much skinner than her the nurse was practically bones. Not really, of course, she was somewhat tall with a limber build but very smelt, barely looked to weigh a hundred pounds. Alex was beginning to grow red faced by currently being the fattest woman in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can I help you?\" Shiro continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex mumbled. \"You can talk to her first, Nicole.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole Frasser shrugged, stepping to the desk. \"I'm supposed to turn this in to update my medical records,\" she handed over the doctor's note.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiro glanced over the document. \"I see. This won't take long to input. I will warn you that, given our relative isolation and medical budget we may need to find an effective generic or two for your medications. Do you have any side effects from previous replacement medicine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex didn't mean to pry, so she drowned out the conversation by looking over the office thrice over, working up the courage to ask about her issue. She was so caught up in psyching herself up that she nearly missed the nurse addressing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what can I help you with in the meantime, miss?\" Shiro asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Alex looked back to the desk. Nicole was slouched against the wall, giving Alex the space to approach the desk. \"W-Well it's about, my, my...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex Greese swallowed, getting right to the point. \"It's about my weight, you see, I would qualify for SSS assistance. I mean, the intermediate tier?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiro bit her tongue. Compared to Nicole, who had a healthy weight, Alex was a poster child example of teenage obesity. Many at this school were, Shiro had come to find out, although few were ever this big when they entered as freshmen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And so I was curious,\" Alex continued, \"would I be able to get help with some kind of diet plan? A regimen to help me lose weight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiro was rather surprised that Alex was both aware of her size and wanting to work at losing weight. \"SSS matters are addressed by my supervisor, Miss Greese, but I can help get you started. We may have to update some paperwork.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had a warm smile, which encouraged Alex. Today might be the first step in introducing a thinner Alex Greese. What could possibly go wrong with a Buttercombe and Yeng Corporation approved weight loss plan?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Being open with her new roommate, Nicole Fraser, and the nurse, Shiro Fukiyama, about her goals for her weight made Alex feel better about coming to Buttercombe. With the budding support behind her she vowed to become a young woman who could stand on her own two (if broad) legs, away from her mother's smothering and father's spoiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so Alex Greese took to the advice given to her by the school nurse about early pitfalls she could fall into when starting a weight loss regimen. At it's basics, managing weight was about calories expended versus calories ingested. Alex Greese would have to eat less and exercise more if she hoped to turn the Freshman Fifteen from a weight gain to a weight loss!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEating less was going pretty well for the first few days Alex Greese was at the school. The first challenge was finding a way to 'dispose' of the rest of her welcome basket without eating it. Nicole didn't mind taking it from Alex, having a nightly chocolate whenever she was holed up in her room working on sketches or homework. For four days Nicole and Alex were able to share lunch and at the further encouragement from her roommate Alex avoided more of the rich, calorie related dishes she favored as comfort food. Mac and cheese, potatoes with thick gravy, pot roast, chicken tenders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex and Nicole were keeping to simple meals of salad with plenty of vegetables and a protein. Well, Alex did have dressing on her said. And did reward herself with a small treat here of there but she still was eating far less than she ever did at home. And come Friday, when Alex was all to herself as Nicole's schedule differed, she kept to her resolve on her lunch and dinner plates. Well, she didn't cheat too horribly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExercising more was a different issue. Despite the reputation of the student body (it's size, in all connotations) Buttercombe Academy was a grand, vast campus to cross which left Alex walking plenty of distance between classes. As she learned to navigate the school she invariably found the longest routes but that was not enough, she should sign up for a gym class. She still had a week to make changes to her classes for this semester and was looking to drop an economics course, which was redundant for what she had learned about how economics from how her father managed Glac\u00e9 de Greese.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she settled into her first week at Buttercombe, it looked like Alex was going to stick to turning her life and weight around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo bad that all changed at the start of the second week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">(      (      (        )      )      )</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex and Nicole had settled into a comfortable routine by the time their second Tuesday at Buttercombe came about. They had two shared subjects and were studying up on their Lit class, with some healthy alternatives to what Alex previously had for studying snacks. Not snacks, but <i>sundaes!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So *crunch* *crunch*\" Alex brought the crunchy snack of choice to her lips. \"When reviewing 'The Yellow Wallpaper' you should remember that it's not actually a ghost story.\" Nicole had introduced her to dried edamame when she found her fingers and her lips looking for something to eat between mealtimes. They weren't devoid of calories and were an acquired taste but they had just enough salt and umami to satisfy two flavor profiles without being unhealthy. Alex was also riding on the confidence of having another checkup tomorrow about the progress of starting her weight loss plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But isn't it a horror story?\" Nicole asked as they compared notes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's not a visceral horror, like vampires or serial killers and stuff,\" Alex explained, followed by more crunching. \"There's a cerebral horror to how it was believed, at the time, to cure a woman of hysteria you could just lock her in a featureless room and--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir doorbell buzzed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Odd.\" Alex frowned at the door. She and Nicole had gotten to know a few other of their classmates yet she didn't think any of these acquaintances would make personal visits. \"Were you expecting mail?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole shook her head before she got up to answer the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex?\" She called. \"It's for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps Alex was being presented with more information pertinent to her weight loss plan. Instead, the complete opposite seemed to be staring her in the face and hitting her nostrils full force. An attendant stood in the hall holding an insulated meal delivery bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex Greese?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Y-Yes?\" Alex stammered, confused as to the presence of what smelled like a fried chicken dinner with the fixings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As a thank you for entering our Dorm Delivery program,\" the attendant recited, \"we wish to offer you this complimentary meal, with all of your future deliveries at considerable discount.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dorm Delivery?\" Alex was very bewildered now. She'd heard of it, of course, it was advertised at the cafeteria and the second option on the phones before you dialed out. \"I didn't sign up for dorm delivery!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are automatically enrolled after reviewing your medical qualifications,\" the attendant explained patiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex couldn't believe what she was hearing. \"Medical qualifications?\" Was this about her diet? But why would she be given a fried chicken dinner when she was supposed to start a weight loss plan?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss, I just deliver the meals. What you do with it is up to you. It is free.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith much reluctance Alex accepted the delivered meal and with Nicole's help they unpackaged the contents. The roommates discovered that it soon overtook the table where they were studying. An eight piece dinner of dark meat with potatoes, gravy, buttery corn, macaroni salad and coleslaw that was far too sweet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't sign up for this.\" Alex was getting distraught, unsure about what appeared to be a clerical error and struggling with the temptation put in front of her on a disposable takeaway platter. Maybe just one chicken leg couldn't hurt, right, after all this week of trimming calories?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex had picked up the leg before she dropped it. \"No. This can't be right, these are the kinds of foods I should be avoiding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole chewed thoughtfully on a spoonful of coleslaw, as she reported the taste. \"It did come free. But you're right, we can just leave it here until we decide what to do with it and go grab dinner in the cafeteria as always.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. Yeah.\" Alex worked to rebuild her budding confidence. She could choose what she wanted to eat. The event had disrupted any attempt at studying so the two roommates left for an early dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch as Alex hoped the cafeteria would distract her mind from the issue, the visit only compounded the matter as Alex was in line at the register.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex Greese?\" said the lunch lady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something wrong?\" Alex grew worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I just have to issue you a new meal card ID.\" Alex was handed the card. \"Henceforth your cafeteria fees are waived, which also translates to unlimited credit at campus vending machines and school approved alternative food options.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT??\" Several students turned to the sound of Alex's outburst, as did Nicole looking worried. Alex kept the upgraded card as if it was a black spot. How could she are trusted with an expanded meal plan when her goal was weight loss?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough her body was hungry her mind was not in any state to eat so Alex dragged a reluctant Nicole back to their room, the two trying to make sense of the issue all the way. She really wanted to check in at the nurse's office to ask what was going on. Unfortunately, the medical office was closed at this hour except for emergencies. Alex had fallen back on her meek habits. She debated back and forth on whether this qualified as an emergency.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't make sense.\" Alex tried to wrap her mind around it. \"The delivery, the meal plan, the...oh no...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Nicole asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex recalled where she had seen this information before. \"The Special Services for Stipendiaries program. SSS!\" Nicole had been placed on Tier II (Basic) after updating her medical records. \"My BMI made me automatically eligible for Tier III! Intermediate!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I missed an exclamation point there,\" Nicole said much to her roommate's confusion, the artist almost perpetually mellow in personality in tone. \"But wasn't that supposed to help with your weight loss goal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It talked about easing accommodations but,\" Alex couldn't finish her statement when she noticed that their room had been unlocked since they had left, with a few different attendants moving in what looked like a bed. \"Hey! Excuse me! What's going on?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe supervising attendant looked up. \"Oh, you must be Alex Greese. We're setting you up with your new furniture. Unless you wanted to enroll in the single dorm option.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Single?\" Without Nicole? Without any friend to guide her through all this strangeness?? \"I don't want to room without her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we're friends.\" Nicole stood by Nicole but didn't have much vigor in her unchanging monotone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suit yourself,\" the supervisor said. \"Looks like a mighty fine meal you got delivered there, shame if it went to waste. By the way, do you happen to have a current copy of your class schedule? We're supposed to swap out your assigned seat as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was enough to make the already 250-pound 15-year-old brunette go run to her room to cry on her bed. Which she couldn't actually do since the bed was currently being swapped for a reinforced model!</span></div></div>",

Alex was stuffed to the point of pain after her 3 but with Kelly\u2019s encouragement she was able to continue to eat, her uniform battled bravely stretching more with each passing bite . Alex finished the pizza and her uniform so tight that she was having trouble breathing and walking. A couple of hours had passed and Alex was still full but  Alex and Kelly went to the feast anyway. Alex planed on not eating at the feast but Kelly said that the feast only happened once a year plus the food looked so good . Alex was already painfully full but ate anyway , on 6th plate her uniform gave up and ripped a hole right down the front luckily a teacher have had a new larger uniform that was very big on Alex .

Her eyes tracing about the room she saw that in one corner sat an older looking student, laying on the couch and currently reading a book. She had raven black colored hair she kept in one long stylish braid down her back, and, as the girl gazed up from her book, Alex saw she also had a pair of dazzlingly bright blue eyes. Said eyes fell upon Alex in the doorway, and the girls jaw dropped just for a second. Alex knew what was most likely going through the older girls mind\u2026Alex\u2019s weight\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly though the couch bound student stood up, a good half foot taller than Alex, and greeted Alex with a smile.  \u201cHi, I\u2019m Dora Winifred Dayzin, but you can call me Dee dee or D.W, or just D! Whatever\u2019s fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, okay\u2026\u201d said Alex caught off guard by such jovial greeting, and was still expecting the fat insults to fly any second now\u2026 \u201cI\u2019m Alex\u2026Alex Gre-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm no uniform yet\u2026wait\u2026oh my gosh\u2026that means\u2026Are you a freshman?\u201d Dora asked, all while walking a small circle around Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...Yeah\u2026Why?\u201d asked Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>Ahhh</b>!\u201d The teenager gave a girlish squeal and giggle. \u201cI get my very own new-bee roomie!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Alex, Dora seemed to be hopped up like a hummingbird on sugar as she tittered about the room, now talking a mile a minute. \u201cSorry! I mean you\u2019re going to love it here! I get to be like a big sister\u2026I can show you around campus, and we can get lunch together and\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds great\u2026but can I sit for a bit?\u201dAlex really did need to take a load of her feet, and she was sure that if she hadn\u2019t said anything Dora would be walking and talking through the rest of the night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh sure! Um, I already have that room over here, so why don\u2019t you go set your stuff over there\u2026and Oh! And there\u2019s a gift basket in there for you too!\u201d said Dora as she motioned to the unlit bedroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLugging her luggage into the room Alex sat down and found the bed to be quite spongy and comfy. Beside the bed she saw a bountiful looking gift basket and a golden color letter addressed to Alex G. on the front.  Even wrapped in thin plastic, the sweet smell wafting from the gift basket was too much to resist,  Alex unwrapped it and found a small feast of treats awaiting her including a chocolate chip muffin which she started to munch on while she moved on to the letter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDora appeared in the doorway, leaning against the frame. \u201cSo Alex, you want to chat for a bit?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhaf?\u2026*<b>smack</b>\u2026<b>smack</b>\u2026<b>gulp</b>*..Sure!\u201d said Alex wanting to talk, but definitely to engrossed in this delicious muffin to actually stop eating it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWell, I\u2019m a senior here\u2026\u201d began DD placing a hand to her chest as she mentioned herself. \u201cMy family actually owns a chain of hotels nearby, but I\u2019m studying to be a nurse. Everyone\u2019s always asks why aren\u2019t I studying to be a doctor, and I always say I like working <i>WITH </i>people more than operating on them. Have you thought about what you want to do yet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*HmmpH?... <b>chomp</b>*\u201d Dora did seem very welcoming to Alex, so she could certainly see her as an attentive nurse. As for her own career Alex really hadn\u2019t thought about it too much, she was just starting high school after all!  \u201cNot really\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you\u2019ll have plenty of time, I\u2026didn\u2019t mean to pressure you or anything...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo *gulp* it\u2019s fine\u2026\u201d Alex feeling a bit emboldened by how the conversation was going so far decided to speak up a bit. \u201cIn fact <i>my </i>family happens to own the Glac\u00e9 de Greese ice cream company\u2026but I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s not what I want to do.\u201d Alex had once done everything she could to keep her schoolmates from knowing she was from the Greese family, with hardly any success of course. Now here she was almost bragging about it! How quickly things could change\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally, I\u2019ve never heard of the brand. But that\u2019s super cool though! You\u2019ll have to tell me all about it! Or see if you can get some sent here\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure\u2026*<b>gulp</b>* Hey D\u201d said Alex finishing the last bite of the large muffin, \u201cWhat\u2019s this note?\u201d Alex held up the letter, she\u2019d yet to open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! I completely forgot the welcoming dinner!\u201d said DD her eyes bulging for a bit at the realization. \u201cThey do that for Freshman here the first night! How could I forget? Ten minutes in and I\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm\u2026and what about <i>this</i>?\u201d asked Alex, who now had opened the envelope, and found a blue pamphlet alongside the dinner invitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm\u201d said DD taking two long strides and began peering over Alex\u2019s meaty shoulders. \u201cLooks like that\u2019s for\u2026the SSS introductory meeting later this week\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026.oh\u2026\u201d said Alex quietly, and turning red. Things had been going so well, and Alex\u2019s own big fat belly had to go and ruin things! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn awkward pause filled the room, with DD sensing Alex\u2019s discomfort. DD waited another second before continuing on \u201cWell..I don\u2019t know too much about it\u2026other than my  roommate last year was on it. She said it helped her out a lot, so I say go for it! I mean It\u2019s literally why they have it in the first place <i>right</i>? For support!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess going to the meeting couldn\u2019t hurt\u2026you're right!\u201d Alex shifted her weight, and  got up from the bed, finding Dora\u2019s enthusiasm for just about everything was rubbing off on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, that\u2019s exactly why they pair us wise seniors with you poor clueless freshman.\u201d Teased DD.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re like what? Three years older than me?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThree years is a lot of time to learn from  your senior sensei\u2026Now before you go to the feast, come here and hug it out new-bee roomie!\u201d<br>\r\nAlex matched DD\u2019s wide brimming smile, so glad to have hit things off so well with her roommate for the year! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Mmmph</i>!\u201d Said Dora giving a cute grunt as she finished the hug.  \u201cWe\u2019re going to have the best year ever girl! Oh, uh better try your new uniform by the way, they kind of expect you to look formal for this thing.\u201d Added Dora pointing towards Alex\u2019s closet, and with that she scooted herself out of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex, taking Dora\u2019s advice, found that the uniform waiting for her in the closet was\u2026snug\u2026but fit as well as most of her own older clothes did. Not perfect, but not unbearably tight either.  \u201cIt\u2019ll fit even better this time next month.\u201d Alex reminded herself, imagining how many new fashion options would be open to her if she lost even just ten pounds from around her middle. Back home the idea of her trying to lose weight seemed doubtful, but here,  It was possible! In fact with this positivity buzz surrounding her at the moment, it felt like almost anything was possible! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex left her room in her new uniform,  feeling rather good about almost everything this school had to offer now, now most notably the idea of this Freshman feast. Alex was on such a  roll of positivity she could hardly let her belly\u2019s own rolls get in the way of her making another new friend! Maybe she\u2019d actually try this SSS thing out, even if it was Yeng sponsored\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a thumbs up of approval from DD and a quick wave goodbye, Alex left the dorm room feeling better than ever!</span></div></div>",

Watching all that bulk pressed up against the new uniform you could still take in every booty bounce and slight hip wobble, before Alex finally fully slunk out of sight. After locking the door tight, you had to bite your upper lit to stifle the moan building up inside you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>Holy</b>! <b>Fucking</b>! <b>Shit</b>!\u201d you screamed internally your heart thumping so firmly it literally sent small shivers through your body. Your mind was racing with a million thoughts; but it was best you start in the past with your previous year here at Buttercombe\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJunior year you had been assigned to a fellow junior student L\u00fcka Gretel. L\u00fcka G! L\u00fcka \u2026L\u00fcka\u2026L\u00fcka\u2026Your eyes rolled further into the back of your head at just the memory of her. Her red hair, her chocolate brown eyes, her fair skin and that accent that was so cute\u2026Oh and L\u00fcka was stout, exceptionally stout!  You sigh deeply, remembering how things had started off so well that year. She was a foreign exchange student, and so she quickly became quite dependent on you to fill her in on how things worked here. All that semester as you were teaching her, you were learning new things about yourself too! Surprising things like; \u2018maybe you liked girls\u2019, and, \u2018maybe you really liked <i>this </i>girl\u2019, and then eventually, \u2018maybe you <u><i>really </i></u>enjoyed watching this girl eating and growing fatter.\u2019 It was quite the educational experience that semester to say the least.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nL\u00fcka was always friendly she seemed to be happy all the time, and she was smart too even if she could only speak in broken English. So you ended up doing most of the talking when you two would eat together, and L\u00fcka well\u2026she did most of the eating, pausing only now and then to clarify something she didn\u2019t quite understand. Day by day, breakfast, lunch, and dinner you watched how much the foreign girl could put away as she sat on the opposite side of the table, you eventually started offering to get her seconds and thirds so she wouldn\u2019t have to get up herself. You didn\u2019t mind, in fact, you soon realized something about the act was quite pleasurable to you. Even more pleasurable  was watching the results of such overeating, it seemed the undergraduate grew wider and thicker by the day! Even in the scant hours when the two of you weren\u2019t in the dining hall, she seemed to mention her weight at least once per day in some fashion; Complaining how tight her uniform was getting, talking about how hungry she was, asking if you could help her fit into her uniform before her new larger one finally arrived! She couldn\u2019t have been doing it on accident <i>right</i>? She had to have know how much it was turning you on! <i>Right</i>?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was near the end of the first semester when you finally worked up the nerve to ask her; Did L\u00fcka like you? She was gaining weight on purpose because she saw that you liked it right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><font class=\"size35\" style=\"\">WRONG</font></b>!\u2026Heartrendingly wrong in fact. The fire of passion you thought that had been building between the two of you, was snuffed out as quick as a candle when L\u00fcka revealed she in fact did not feel the same way as you did. What was worse, now that L\u00fcka\u2019s BMI had shot up way past the regular levels needed to qualify for SSS assistance, she ended up transferring out of your dorm room  at the start of the following semester, leaving you on your lonesome for the rest of the school year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had hurt horrifically being rejected like that. It hurt so badly in fact that all summer long you had done your best to stave off any of your newfound lustful big beautiful  woman desires; No videos of gainers stuffing their stomach full of two liters of soda, no checking in on any pictures from weight gaining models you had just started following\u2026you weren\u2019t even going to read any of those fantastically well written Writing.com stories! (Well not like the that site was working most of the time anyways\u2026) A full three months of chastity and starving yourself from any girls who even close to semi-qualified as \u2018thicc\u2019\u2026and then the universe drops the plumpest freshman you\u2019d ever seen right into your life as further punishment\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr maybe\u2026as a reward? Maybe\u2026this was a sign? Yeah! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019d certainly been shocked by the sight of her wide hips nearly eclipsing the doorway as soon as she entered, your jaw dropping reflexively a bit, but you had quickly regained composure. Unconsciously your scheming mind had pointed her straight to the gift basket as well, hoping that sure enough she\u2019d start tearing into it the moment she\u2019d saw it. Sure Alex had seen the note about the freshman banquet, but it wasn\u2019t like you\u2019d be able to keep her in your room all night\u2026as much as you wanted too\u2026 Plus you\u2019d even talked her into a quick friendly hug. <u><b>MMPH</b></u>! That hug! Four quick seconds of letting your fingers press into those sides that were like malleable dough! Getting to feel up the mousey marshmallow of a girl was just\u2026just\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slammed into the bathroom, grabbed a fluffy towel from off the rack, and went to town pleasuring yourself. Rubbing away on yourself with shameless abandon you began to invasion what Alex would look like with a few more pounds, then ten more, then twenty, easily outpacing  L\u00fcka\u2019s scale tipping three hundred pounds. Then rather suddenly your mind then turned to a vision of a gigantic version of Alex stomping along at building size, a smile on her chubby cheeked face as she reached down into the Buttercombe campus and plucked none other than L\u00fcka from a selection of tiny students. Wordlessly the gigantic Alex plopped your ex-roomie onto her large pink tongue like a piece of candy and then swallowed adding L\u00fcka\u2019s bulk to her own prestigious poundage. You came hard at that thought, bucking your hips in rhythm, breath escaping you in large puffs as you pumped away over and over again till the buzzing in you subsided a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreud would have had a field day; delusions of grandeur, utilitarian thinking, or hedonistic lust; you didn\u2019t bother to justify or classify how you felt now. All you knew was that this Alex girl was the new hotness that had waddled right into your life,  and in mere instants your gothic mourning for your lost <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">love</span> L\u00fcka girl was gone. Alex\u2019s family owned and ice-cream company, and Alex was already eligible for SSS day 1! Take that L\u00fcka! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExpertly cleaning yourself up, and then ensuring the towel and bathroom were properly taking care of, your mind began to reset back into reality. So you knew you like Alex right away, but how were you going to proceed going forward? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe you could cut the tension and just let her know how you feel right off the bat? The best case scenario was that she\u2019s totally into you too and you both can \u201cget to know\u201d each other immediately. Who knew maybe she\u2019s even into the whole \u201cstuffing her like a thanksgiving turkey\u201d thing! Well, okay\u2026maybe don\u2019t tell her THAT much yet, that was a whole other hurdle to deal with.  At least tell her you think she\u2019s hot!  Plus, even if things didn\u2019t\u2026if she didn\u2019t exactly feel the same way\u2026.you\u2019d at least know right away. Sure she was your new roomie, but she wasn\u2019t the ONLY girl in  the academy\u2026Maybe if she saw you with someone else she\u2019d even might get a bit jealous\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course you could maybe just wait things out for a bit. At least give the poor new-bee a week or two at the school to get settled in before you unload your feelings on her. It would be  hard not to let it slip, and maybe even a little agonizing eating lunches with her without dabbling in your devious fattening desires, but you could do it! You\u2019d get to know Alex a bit better too, her likes and dislikes, favorite colors\u2026favorite foods\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, the other part of you knew the only reason things had <b>REALLY </b>gone wrong with L\u00fcka last year was because she was too dumb to know what was best for her, the both of you really.  She hadn\u2019t complained a single word about all the pampering and plumping you\u2019d subtlety been responsible for\u2026right up until you did ask her out. So, you knew, <b>YOU KNEW!!!</b> that this time things would be different with Alex. You\u2019d be her best friend here at Buttercombe, as well as a sort of background food encourager, then when the time was right she\u2019d surely be smarter than Luka and admit she did feel the same way about you and your feedee ways! It was risky, dreadfully risky, but if you played your cards right you could make it happen without getting caught\u2026<i>If</i> you went that direction that is\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*Knock knock</b>* \u201cHello\u2026Dee? I think the doors locked.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh crap\u2026that was Alex at the door right now! Had two hours really passed that fast? Fortunately you\u2019d finished making sure everything was perfect minutes ago so Alex shouldn\u2019t be suspicious at all of what you\u2019d been doing while she was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m coming!\u201d you called back, smiling secretly at the irony. Taking a deep breath before you made another move, you decided that you were going to\u2026.</span></div></div>",

You'd been trying to control yourself but it was so hard when you're looking right at the hottest girl ever. Thankfully, Alex didn't seem to mind what you said as she simply laughed, not thinking much of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you insist, I guess it would be okay\" Alex said before her belly let out another growl, which made your eyes roll back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't get over that sound. It was a desperate call of a belly ready to be filled to the brim and then some that just drove you wild. What made it even better was that she was talking to her stomach too! Another turn on for you. Your day dream was interupted, however, by Alex who looked a bit concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, are you okay? You're eyes were rolled to the back of your head. You sure you don't just want to stay here?\" Alex asked you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed a bit and tried to come up with an excuse of some kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no! I'm fine! D-don't worry about me! Now come on let's get going!\" You say as you grabbed her wrist and led her out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing a senior, you knew your way around the Acadamy like the back of your hand! Not too far into the walk you turn to Alex with a cheery smile!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, remember this route, okay! This is how you get to the cafeteria. This is were you'll get all your meals, obviously. Trust me, the food here is the best!\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mention of food makes Alex's stomach growl again, to which she looks down at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen you'll eat soon, stop being so impatient!\" Alex scolded her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggle not to moan at hearing her speak that way to her belly. Luckily, the cafeteria came in sight rather quickly, giving you something to focus on other than that. It was at peak hours right now! Everyone was there for lunch and a sea of overweight girls could be seen eating or getting up to get more food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welp, here we are! What do you think?\" You ask Alex, but don't receive a reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn to look and notice that she's in utter shock at what she sees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This place is massive! I've never seen a cafeteria like this before\" Alex says, with awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure is! I wouldn't be surprised if it was the biggest room in the whole school!\" You say before noticing her demeanor change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I wasn't expecting everyone here to be so...big\" Alex said with a tinge of worry in her voice, which you quickly try to calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's actually quite common to be big here, believe it or not I'm one of the few skinny ones here.\" You say nonchalontly before going back to the topic at hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, how about we get in line and grab some grub!\" You say before leading Alex along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you seem to wait for a long while, as everyone in front of you loads up their plates. Finally, you and Alex get to the front of the line. You begin to fill your tray with what would be considered a normal sized meal. You turn back to look and notice that Alex is taking about the same portion size you are. That notion fills you with concern, but you try not to show it as she approaches you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, let's find a spot to sit,\" you say as you scan for an open table, which you eventually find.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and her make your way over there and sit down. The two of you begin to eat, but you can't seem to keep the small size of Alex's portions out of your mind, so finally you ask about it in a way that won't seem weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...you sure you got all you wanted?\" you asked her before taking a bite of the mashed potatoes you grabbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex nods her head in approval which makes you start to sweat a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure? It's just most people take a lot more than that is all\" you respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex shakes her head again. \"Nah, actually I'm trying to lose some weight\" Alex said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the outside you remain calm and actually pull off a smile \"Oh, I see! Well I hope you can do it! I know weight loss can be difficult\" you say before continuing to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever on the inside you're freaking out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHIT SHIT SHIT! She's trying to LOOSE weight???!! FUCK! NOW WHAT?\" You scream in your mind as you see your fantasy with Alex start to shatter!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Hundreds of students and parents with only a vague idea of what to do would descend upon the school in droves, and the result would always been that at least someone would have an issue. That issue would then cause issues for more people, and issues would cascade like a row of dominoes. A school's ability to run this sort of thing was less about if this would happen, and more about how it was handled when it did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nButtercomb had always been a school with solid organization, so they had a perfectly sound battle-plan going into this years move-in week. When Monday came around, they were ready to accept new and old students with open arms. They were even ready to handle all the complications that the new partnership with the Yeng Corporation may cause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, when Monday arrived, there wasn't a single backup of issues. Every issue a student or parent had was handled promptly and efficiently. Problems started and ended at the same point, and the day of arrivals ended without a single complaint. It was unprecedented in the history of the school, and was considered a major accomplishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincipal Polluck would have been ecstatic, if any of Buttercomb's staff had been responsible for it, but it wasn't. If fact, the sole reason for the days success was due to a student and her parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Marsh family was not a particularly well-known or wealthy family by any means, but those who did know them knew them by the work they'd done for the Yeng corporation. Ever since the corporation's inception, the Marsh family had worked as Yeng's most trusted allies. When Yeng first negotiated with retailers to put their products on shelves, the Marshes sent the invitations and planned the meeting to perfection. When questions were raised about Yeng's activities in Daven's Port, the Marshes planned and executed a fantastic campaign to clear up the rumors. Simply put, when Yeng needed something done, the Marshes handled it. Though, most of the work the Marshes did wasn't so grandiose. Usually they worked as simple butlers and maids, ready to serve the higher-ups at Yeng at any time. Most would call them servants, but the Marshes thought of themselves as something more. They took pride in their work dispute working in what some would call a lowly profession, and they strive to be the best in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Buttercomb had entered into a partnership with Yeng, the Marshes only saw fit to send one of their own to Buttercomb as a gesture of good will. Their daughter, Carami, had just entered into her high school years and hadn't chosen anywhere to work yet, so was the ideal choice to send. After speaking with Buttercomb's staff, it was decided that Carami would attend as a normal student so that she could spend the next 4 years away from her maid training and experience life as a normal girl. To broaden her horizons, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * * * *</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMother and father said that they weren't there to get involved with Buttercomb's move-in process, but when they arrived, they couldn't help but spring into action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear, could you watch everything for me? I want to see what's happening over there.\" The first to leap into action was my mother, Aya. She was dressed in a casual summer dress at the time, but she still gave off the air of being a maid regardless. Her posture was perfect, yet she wasn't stiff at all. And her sizeable assets made her seem warm and motherly. She was, in many ways, the perfect maid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'll go as well. Darling, go find your room, we'll say goodbye when this is all done.\" Her father wasn't far behind. He was a fairly young looking man in his mid 30s, but he often spoke well outside his years. Were his wife, Aya, was warm and kind, Gunther was wise and always seemed like he planned his next action minutes beforehand. He was slim, but imposing, and always seemed to know the right thing to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI just smiled and watched they took over the work for Buttercomb's staff. I wanted to help out too, but I had my own job to do at that moment, which was to arrive at my and make sure my things were safe and secure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, it didn't take very long. I'd already researched and familiarized myself with the campus, so while all the other students looked in awe at the campus and fumbled through the process, I glided through the process effortlessly. By the time most people would be gaping at the cafeteria, I was already in her room, securing my things. I didn't take any time to look at my room. Instead, I hurried out of it as soon as I was finished. After all, I knew that there were still people that needed help moving in. I rejoined mother and father quickly and set to work helping out the various other students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't an easy task. There were many people with a wide variety of issues, but I did the best she could. I wasn't nearly as experienced as they were, so I had to send people over to my mother or father a lot, but part of the job is knowing your limits and sending people to someone they can actually get help from. That, in of itself, is helpful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hardest problems to solve were ones related to student disabilities. I'd been warned about this by my parents, but I was still somewhat surprised by how many overweight girls arrived at the school. Most of the kids at my middle school weren't a kilogram over 100, but there were a few students I saw that had to be at least 150. I could only imagine how well those girls must have been eating. It brought a smile to my face thinking that so many parents cared about their kids that much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe ended up staying and working until everyone was moved into their rooms, it was around 5pm we we finished. A whole 7 hours after we arrived. That sounds rough, and it was, but it was worth it. Seeing everyone happily move into their rooms was reward enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwards, my parents and I said our goodbyes. It didn't take very long though. My mother was nice as always, and my father had plenty of advise to give me. When we were done, they walked back to their car, and I started back towards my dorm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I walked, I realized that my roommate would be there by now. Naturally, in my research, I'd already found out her name, age, weight, all that stuff, but I'd yet to see a picture of her, or find out what she was like. It was kinda exciting, actually. Usually I find a lot of stuff like this out before had, but this time I didn't really know what to expect. I wanted to find out who I'd be saying with. Hopefully, we could be great friends, and I could keep practicing being a maid with them! I know, I'm not suppose to be working, but I can't help it. It's in my blood, you know?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, I got to my -- our -- room, and knocked on it out of habit. I heard a voice yell, \"come in!\" before opening the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side was...</span></div></div>",

It wasn't exact, but Carami was pretty confidant in her estimate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side of the door was a girl who stood about 10 cm shorter than me. That'd make her about 165 cm tall. It's not a perfect estimate, but I'm pretty confidant in it. I need to be able to tell clothing sizes after all. On that note, I'd say her vital stats are probably around... 118, 128, and 120 at probably somewhere around a E cup. That's the best I can do though. Mother and father could probably even figure out her inseam and shoulder width, but I can't do that yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI know she's not a client, but friends should know each other's sizes right? I'm 92.4, 68.7, and 99.3 at a FF cup. I know, kinda big for a maid. My mother keeps telling me I'll need to eventually slim down when I start working for real, and I agree. Lugging all this around while working gets tiring after a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, I'm using the all the UK standards aren't I? I should probably get use to the US ones, That'd make her... 46, 50, and 47 at an F cup, and me 36, 27 and 39 at an H cup. She'd be 5'5\" and I'd be 5'9\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, the girl in front of me was pretty big. I already knew she was the biggest girl in the freshmen class weighing at about 114kg, but seeing it in person was something else. Her entire figure was covered with a layer of soft, plush fat, and it didn't really seem to have a preference for where it went. Since she was wearing a white one-piece at the time, it kinda made her look like a marshmallow. I kinda wanted to hug her just to feel it, but I didn't. Best to make a good first impression. Besides that, she wore a pair of glasses and wore her long-ish brunette hair down. Her bangs were medium length, but that didn't stop them from resting slightly against her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks pretty nervous, so I could guess she wasn't the most out going person, but I don't want to be assumptive, so I'll refrain from looking into her any further for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, I believe her name was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex Greese, right?\" I smiled at her, making sure she's who I think she is. I'm pretty confidant about it though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!\" Me saying her name first surprised her. She tried regaining her composure the best she could before responding, \"Yes, and you are...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Carami Marsh, your new roommate. It's a pleasure to meet you.\" I gave her a little bow afterwards out of habit. that probably wasn't a good idea though, because it flustered her a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... oh! Okay, you too... uh... would you like to come in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm? do I need permission to enter my own room?\" I tried messing with her a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah--\" She seemed taken aback at first, but then broke into a chuckle. \"Hehehe, I guess you're right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was my joke, but I started laughing a bit too. Good, she's not completely wound up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked into the dorm and started taking a look around. It had changed a bit since I was last in here. The once bland, yellow walls were now covered in small little decorations. A plush toy here, a character pillow there. Seems like her interests are as fluffy as she is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I kinda went a bit overboard with decorating. Is all this okay? I can take some of it down if you don't like it or you have something you want to put up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's fine,\" I reassured her, \"I don't really have anything to put up.\" Besides, I actually really liked it. It was pretty cute all things considered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seemed relieved by my comment. Though, after a moment a worried expression flashed across her face, and she turned to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, now that I think about it, I wanted to ask you something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, what is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... Do you know what's going on with our room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh, that. I had a feeling I knew what she was talking about. The rooms at Buttercomb weren't really rooms, they were actually more like a full apartments. Each student got their own room, and each pair of students had a near full-sized kitchen and bathroom. It was certainly bigger than any other high school dorm. We had all that, but the difference here was that a lot of it was bigger than it should have been. Our kitchen wasn't 'almost' full sized, it was full sized. Not only that, but the doors and halls were wider. Even the furniture was a bit bigger than it should have been, and on further inspection, they even seemed to be reinforced with steel frames. Anyone would think it was at least a bit odd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't though, because I'd already looked into it. Apparently, these rooms were meant for students with disabilities. The school's disability program, SSS, allowed students at higher disability tiers to have access to special rooms to accommodate their conditions. These rooms are typically provided for those at tier 3 or higher. The final piece of this puzzle was that the system counted excess body weight as a disability. Tier III was granted to any student over 35 on the BMI. Alex is 113 kilos at-- sorry, 250 lb at 5'5\" which put her at... 41 on the BMI. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex was Tier III on SSS, that meant she got an upgraded room. apparently, no one told her this. Well, I should probably tell her. She's going to need to know sooner or later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, I took the next few minutes explaining all that. Afterwards, she looked even more worried than before for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what!? I'm... I'm so fat that they think I have a- a disability...\" She looked distraught, like I'd told her that her puppy died.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong? Wouldn't having something like this help you?\" Honestly, I think she should be happy about it. The school's accommodations mean that she could be comfortable even at her size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess, but I don't want to be this big! I... I guess it's just a bit of a shock. I know I'm big, but...\" her words trailed off; though, she eventually spoke up again, \"Just so I know, what else does it give me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you can use powered scooters, you don't have any cafeteria fees, and you get discounts on dorm delivery services.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I told her what I'd read on the school's site, her face went pale. \"Th-that's... I don't want any of that! I'm... I'm trying to...\" She looked like she was about to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI still couldn't understand what she was so worried about. I'm sure she gets hungry a lot, free food means she can satisfy herself. Why would anyone not want that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was obvious that something here mattered to her a lot. She looked so pitiful, like a kitten in the rain. I wanted to help her, badly. I know I'm suppose to be here to broaden my horizons and not work as a maid, but the maid in me is shouting at me to help her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, I placed my hand on her head and started stroking it to calm her down. I don't know why, it's probably because she reminded me of a small animal, but it did seem to calm her down. Once she looked up at me, I said \"Hey, if you tell me what's wrong I might be able to help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes widened as she stammered, \"Wh-why would you--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because, what kind of mai-- uh, roommate would I be if I left you like this,\" I smiled at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-really? You'll help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As much as I can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-okay... well,\" She started, and from there she told me about her issue. Apparently, she didn't really feel comfortable with her current weight. It embarrassed her and made her feel insecure. The fact that the school apparently thought of it as a disability didn't help. She'd actually came to the school with the intention of loosing weight, but free meals, delivery, and a power scooter is going to have the opposite effect. \"I just don't trust myself, you know? I already tried some of the food, and it was so good... I... I need some one to help me keep on my diet!\" She declared at the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that point, the two of us had taken a seat on the reinforced couch. I sat there, thinking the entire situation over. Honestly, I'm usually opposed to the kind of diets she's talking about. They require starving one's self of all their favorite foods as well as constant, demanding exercise. All this gets harder and harder the heavier you are, and she was already 250 lb. It'd be hell on her. But she's also clearly suffering from this already. If I just leave her alone, her self-loathing might get worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHmm... what's the best option here...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Rosa was delighted with her rooms proximity to the cafeteria, as she opened the door she saw a girl that towered over her the girls name was Anna, Rosa was delighted that she had another German for a roommate even if physically they were polar opposites . Anna seemed to act suspicious. It took me a minute to figure out why then she offered both welcome basket and I know instantly she was a chubby chaser . I Hadn\u2019t  tried the candies in the basket before so even though I was so full that I could hardy walk I devoured the baskets contents. My girth busted clear out of my clothes so I put on the school uniform that was very loose not for long I thought . I told Anna to order the largest feast she could. So I sat there for over an hour and ate 7 massive pizzas , 13 quad stack burger  9 kfc family sized Buckets and a 4 foot wedding cake. Knowing Anna\u2019s weakness for my girth I asked her to rub my belly until the welcoming feast which she gladly did. Then me and Anna went to the feast . Were I ate 5 plate before trying to stop before Anna made me continue I had 23 plates after that then 13 plates of dessert before vowing back to the room I told Anna that I wanted her to make me the fattest freshman ever by the end of the year she salivated at the thought before agreeing then I passed out</span></div></div>",

This was the feeling Jen Polluck had as she walked through the campus of Buttercombe Academy, but no one could blame her for having that thought running through head. One minute she was being enrolled in the high school she always wanted to get into and it had everything she could ask for. It had a variety of sports teams, after school clubs and excellent teachers. Then the next thing she knew an earthquake destroyed the school beyond recognition leaving Jen high and dry with just a week before the semesters started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the night after the incident Jen\u2019s mother told her she received a call from her Aunt Shannon in which she said that she heard what happened and is working on enrolling her into Buttercombe. Both Jen and her mother were reluctant about this, but there wasn't much they could do with their current situation. While Jen is grateful to her Aunt for doing this for her, she is still hesitant about attending Buttercombe for two reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first was that Jen was well aware of Buttercombe's reputation of turning girls into blimps and turning the blimps into even bigger blimps. Jen knew that only a small percentage of girls leave the school thin and ever since Buttercombe started the partnership with the Yeng Corporation that number has decreased further. The second reason had to do with her Aunt Shannon, while Jen does love her Aunt a lot she can be a bit overbearing at times. For instance Aunt Shannon usually greets her favorite niece with what Jen has dubbed \u201cthe all-enveloping hug\u201d. Also, while Jen normally doesn't go overboard with eating food for some reason when she is around her Aunt, she cannot control herself and just eats like there is no tomorrow. The last time that Aunt Shannon visited Jen during the summer, Jen swore she gained 15lbs and don\u2019t even get her started with what happened on her birthday last year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright calm down.\u201d Jen said to herself. \u201cJust keep remember watch how much you eat and keep the number of visits with Aunt Shannon to a minimum.\u201d \u201cKeep those two thoughts in your mind and you might just graduate with your figure intact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jen entered the main building of Buttercombe, she saw a map of the campus and looked at it. Jen noticed that the headmistress\u2019s office was pretty close by, so were the dorm rooms and the cafeteria. After giving some thought Jen decided to go to...</span></div></div>",

Then in the center of the room sitting at her high quality desk, was the massive mass of fat that was her Aunt Shannon. Jen also noticed that Aunt\u2019s desk was littered with dirty plates suggesting that she was just finished a meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s my favorite niece!!.\u201d Shannon said with jubilant glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Aunt Shannon got out of her chair (which took a minute or two) and waddled as fast as she could and gave Jen the \u201call-enveloping hug\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's good to see you too Aunt Shannon.\u201d Jen muffled through her aunt\u2019s fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2019s your mother doing?\u201d Shannon asked curiously as she released Jen from her hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s doing fine.\u201d Jen replied. \u201cThough she was a bit nervous about me going to Buttercombe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh your mother worries too much.\u201d Shannon said with a chuckle. \u201cButtercombe is a perfectly fine school to go to.\u201d \u201cOh that reminds me\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Shannon waddled to her desk and picked up a sheet of paper that\u2019s was laying on the left side of her desk and gave it to Jen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d Jen asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour dorm room information.\u201d Shannon replied. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure if you saw your information yet, so I had this printed out for you just in case.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, Aunt Shannon I should probably get to the dorms then.\u201d Jen stated. \u201cAlso, could you try not to embarrass me in front of the rest of the school and not give me any \u201cspecial treatment\u201d while I\u2019m here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course.\u201d Shannon replied. \u201cBut if you ever want to talk or share a meal, just let me know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Jen gave her aunt a quick hug before leaving the office and headed to the dorm rooms which were across the campus..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wonder what my roommate is going to be like?\u201d Jen thought to herself. </span></div></div>",

Last year she had just been so captivated by how\u2026well\u2026BIG\u2026everything was here on Buttercombe\u2019s campus compared to her home town. Large academy buildings, which held plenty of classrooms, and so much to learn! Penny was top of her class back at her old middle school so it was no wonder she\u2019d been accepted to the academy and been so eager to be there! Such good grades had come at the cost of her social life, but  even that changed a bit during her first year at Buttercombe. New teachers, new classes, and new foods to try (a LOT of new foods,) and of course a few new friends. Truthfully though her R.A that year had really been the best of the best, helping her with anything Penny needed. Last year had just been sooo perfect!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow she was living her dream and just wanted to be that same friendly guiding light to all the girls on her floor. Oh yeah, Penny Parker was ready! She gave herself a once over in her bathroom\u2019s mirror and saw that her shirt was still untucked. She sucked in her tummy and quickly tucked her shirt in, it was a tight squeeze, but she managed to find room for it between her belly and her waistline. At 180lbs she could still squeak by and call herself \u2018chubby\u2019 and not out and out fat, but then again losing the weight she\u2019d gained since coming here had never been that high on her too do list anyway\u2026but was absolutely somewhere on her to do list\u2026more towards the bottom..honestly! In fact-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping out from the bathroom Penny saw something that stopped her train of thought completely! Apparently a note had been delivered under her doorstep overnight! Oh!

If you want.\u201d She had been sulking all the way here from Washington DC and the walk to her room did nothing to improve her temper. Buttercombe was even more ostentatiously luxurious than she'd expected but Carolina was unfazed. She'd seen plenty bigger and better places (well, actually not that many, her inner censor chimed in). As she looked around the living room she was supposed to share with another girl, she had to admit it looked pretty good. In fact almost as good as her own room back home. A nice big TV screen, two plush leather couches and several armchairs to entertain guests, there was even a fully equipped kitchen in one corner. She reached for the remote and the screen came alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI've unpacked your things and put them away, Miss Carolina! Is there anything else you'd like me to do before I leave?

A bar? <i>Another </i>bar? Where did it come from? Carolina blinked, looked around and discovered a welcome basket on the coffee table in front of her. A basket she had subconsciously taken from while she was engrossed in the channels the TV had on offer <i>and</i> in her feelings. She knew the basket was there to tempt her - her personally - into overeating. It had to be her Mom's doing again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer anger turned into regret as her gaze fell down on her waist she just stuffed 500 more empty calories into. She pinched her folds in disgust, wishing them to go away. Oh, she knew it could get worse, much worse. And it might. She had seen a living, breathing warning sign just this morning. Her 'little' sister Virginia, two years younger and already twice Carolina's size. She had to remain strong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked around to divert her mind from food and found some leaflets peering from underneath all that junk in the basket. Taking it out, she scanned the brochures quickly. Plan of the campus, amenities, services, introductory tour\u2026 Ah, yes. Carolina knew her Mom signed her up for the tour but you know what? Her Mom wasn't here anymore so f*ck her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe no longer breathed down her neck so Carolina was free to do whatever she pleased today. Chat with her friends back home, browse the TV, Netflix, laze the afternoon away\u2026 As part of a compromise her Dad had brokered after their first stormy fight, Carolina would get all the subscriptions she wanted, no matter age restrictions, while studying at Buttercombe \u2013 as long as her academic results didn't suffer. But that was a problem for another day. Today she could laze around\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr maybe not as she caught her hand sneaking towards the basket again. As much as she tried to resist, throughout her childhood Carolina had been conditioned to mindless snacking. Perhaps it might be healthier to go out and explore?<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><br>\r\n***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, in an office at the top of the main wing: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201eWhat's the issue you wanted to cover with me in person, Dr. Hinamizawa?\u201d The speaker was small, round and not exactly imposing; now she was out of breath, her rolls quivering with barely suppressed anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, come in, come in, Dr. Schwartz. Make yourself comfortable.\u201d The de facto head of the school gave her Head Counselor a long, calculating look, reclining in her chair behind a mahagony table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat's so urgent that I had to drop everything and trudge all the way from my lab to here?\u201d Dr. Schwartz steadfastly refused any of the mobility aids that she so readily recommended to all her students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh? I would swear I used the phrase 'at your leisure' in my e-mail, didn't I?\u201d Fukuda's English had greatly improved in the years she spent in America, to the point she could efficiently use it to manipulate others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, OK, I am sorry,\u201d the doctor knew all too well that the phrase meant ASAP in Fukuda's parlance and this was just another pissing contest she was bound to lose anyway. She grumbled something barely intelligible and went on: \u201cSo what is the sensitive topic?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, I have received a\u2026 request, you could even say a plea, from an old friend of mine \u2013 and yours too.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Carolina had never been a very active girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course looking at her even now, that much was obvious. Even at a school notorious for fattening up its students like holiday hams, Carolina had been right on track before she even set foot through the door\u2014and that was in spite of her protests, pouting, and petulance regarding her mother\u2019s unorthodox parenting style.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her wide belly and wider hips quivering with each lumbering step down the hallway, Carolina may as well have been made of cookie dough. She was a lazy, spoiled thing who had never so much as jogged once in her entire lifetime. Despite the fact that she liked to think that she was better off than her \u201clittle\u201d sister Virginia, Carolina was just as soft in the will as she was around the waist. Perhaps even softer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo watching her get red-faced and frustrated as her doughy body struggled to keep up with the exercise of walking at a moderate pace through the halls of her new home for the forseeable future, one could already piece together the problems in her creed to keep slim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hate this place\u2026\u201d she huffed, her soft double chin folding slightly as her mouth hung open, \u201cThey should have\u2026 a water fountain or something\u2026 somewhere.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer unused leg muscles ached. She was a lazy girl at heart, and she wanted nothing more than to indulge in her true nature. Laying out on the sofa, watching television. But those darn snacks were still there\u2014waiting for her. And she wasn\u2019t about to let her mother win another round of their weird little game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if it meant that her thighs would chafe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrection, were already chafing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarolina leaned against a wall\u2014her fat bottom squishing against the cool creamy plaster well before the rest of her did. How was she already this tired? Of course, she couldn\u2019t remember the last time she\u2019d gone up or down a flight of stairs. Mom had installed elevators early in their childhood home since she was in, like, first grade\u2026 she couldn\u2019t be <i>that</i> out of shape, could she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was already on the third floor\u2014that was three floors down from her dorm room! And going <i>up</i> stairs was going to be a lot harder than going down. That much Carolina knew for a fact...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d she sighed heavily, \u201cI guess there\u2019s no point in turning back now\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slumped down against the wall, letting her full weight fall onto it and off of her aching legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere was she even <i>going</i>?</span></div></div>",

A bespectacled redhead strode towards her, her tummy jiggling with every step. \u201cHuh? What does it look like?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt<i> looks</i> to me you're loitering in the History hall.\u201d The girl stopped in front of her, her arms akimbo. She was actually a smidgeon smaller than Carolina and around the same weight but judging by her swift movements she must have been in a much better shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is History hall?\u201d she looked around for the first time. Old presidents hanging on the walls looked at her, silently confirming it. What now? Her mother's favorite saying was: If all else fails, use the truth. \u201cWould you believe me I got lost?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redhead pointedly looked at Carolina's fleshy midsection. \u201cYou don't look like a lost freshman.\u201d She narrowed her eyes suspiciously: \u201cI want your full name!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no way around it. \u201cCarolina Griffith-Johnson.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d The girl pulled out a Y-Pad, pushed her glasses up her nose and started scrolling. Suddenly her demeanor completely changed. She forced herself into a smile. \u201cOh, I'm really sorry! I didn't mean it like that, it's just that this wing is off-limits for most students on days off. But it turns out you have every right to be here, uhh, Carolina.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarolina had just about enough. She'd sworn never to use her mother's name to get advantages at the Academy and yet this obnoxious nerd forced her to break her promise the very first day?! She used the haughtiest tone she'd copied from her mother: \u201cI believe it is considered polite for both parties to introduce themselves first. I haven't heard your name yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, sorry, sorry! Penny Parker, Residential Advisor. See, I'm supposed to watch out for unruly behavior <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">though maybe not here</font> but this is a handy shortcut and I was on my way to the cafeteria so would you like to join me? Since you're really new here, maybe I can give you some tips, show you the ropes kind of thing? Maybe we can be friends?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFriends? That was new. At every school Carolina had attended so far, her surname brought her either ridicule or wary respect. The handful of friends she'd made liked her <i>despite</i> being Griffith-Johnson. Did this\u2026 Penny mean it? A friend, an ally against Mom's machinations would come in handy in this strange place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it would mean going to the cafeteria. Yes, she could have just a salad or some fruit but Carolina knew her willpower (or lack thereof), knew she wouldn't be able to resist temptation. And based on her mother's enthusiastic description there would be lots and lots of it. Was an ally worth that?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I mean, there are plenty of vending machines here too. And after we stock up on provisions I can show you around. So this is your first and most important lesson \u2013 see that huge box over there? You just activate it with your bracelet, pick whatever you want at the touchscreen, wait for the beep\u2026 and collect your goodies.\u201d She grabbed a package of coffee cakes. \u201cNow these are the best, here, have a taste.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarolina tried to resist for a full second before grabbing one. \u201cUh, thanks, but what bracelet?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh?\u201d The chubby RA looked at Carolina's wrists, then peered back into her Y-Pad. \u201cIs it possible that you haven't been fitted yet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm, no? I just arrived today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny sighed. \u201cAnd given your privileged access, I suppose you haven't been at the orientation last week either. Didn't you at least get a leaflet in your welcome basket, explaining it all?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm, maybe?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway, this is something you cannot do without. Sooner or later you'd come to a door which you won't open without your bracelet- Come to think of it, how're you going to open your own room without it? How did you get in in the first place?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm, well\u2026\u201d Carolina knew how it would sound but she was interested to see Penny's reaction. \u201cMy driver opened it for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't disappointed. The RA blinked, gaped. \u201cWow! I wish I could say that one day. Well, let me take you to Ms. Fukiyama to outfit you. It's not far if we take the lift.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd, uh, I'll leave you there and run to the cafeteria, OK? I mean, the physical's going to take half an hour minimum.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe physical?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><br>\r\n***<br>\r\n</div><br>\r\nTo Carolina's surprise Ms. Fukiyama didn't weigh half a ton. Not even a quarter; she was a tall, skinny woman of Asian descent (Carolina guessed at least that part right). She had a soothing voice and gentle mannerisms, yet something seemed a bit off here. \u201cPlease, strip down to your underwear, Ms. Griffith-Johnson.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStrip? I mean, like, why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo I could properly examine you. Sorry, I got my orders. Go on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur plush brunette had no choice. She had to take off her dress with all its little rubber bands and slimming tricks and let her blubber on full display. This was hell she was trying to avoid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarolina would swear the nurse tsking when she emerged from behind the screen, blushing in embarrassment. \u201cStep here, please. Let me see. Height 5'6, weight 181 pounds- 82? Well, let's write down 181.5.\u201d She took a tape measure and went on: \u201cChest 39, waist- where's your waist? Let's say 35, hips 44\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you need all these numbers for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAsk the management, I've been here for two weeks only. I understand it may be unpleasant but all I know is, I'm supposed to do this with every student. Thighs 28. Now, sit down and give me your arm, I'm going to measure your blood pressure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurse was nice to her but clinically professional, she even gave her a short speech about eating right and exercising. All this sounded horribly familiar \u2013 and humiliating. But wasn't Buttercombe supposed to be different? As much as she struggled against her mother's machinations, right now Carolina would have welcomed someone like auntie Hannah Hammond, telling her how undernourished she looked and how she ought to eat more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow sign here, I'll outfit you with your bracelet and you'll be good to go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh?\u201d Carolina carefully read the paper. Her mother had given her several painful lessons in how costly it was to sign a document without reading it. But today everything seemed in order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she was reading, the nurse opened a drawer. \u201cOh. You've got your own special envelope. And you are Group Cee Plus Plus. Nice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Ms. Fukiyama clipped it on her chubby forearm and Carolina turned her amber bracelet over to see C++ stamped on it. \u201cIsn't that something to do with computers? What does it mean?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, I don't know myself. Most students I fitted out got C. I had a couple C+ and those were all snotty brats so,\u201d the nurse had a good look at Carolina's beautiful dress thrown on the floor, carefully tailored so it almost hid her wide waist and even wider behind, \u201cso maybe you are extra privileged?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! I mean, umm,\u201d now that she thought about it, it looked ever more likely. Damn Mom! \u201cMaybe?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGriffith-Johnson? Oh! Aren't you related to the, uh, Health Secretary?\u201d Seeing Carolina's angry look, the nurse backpedalled. \u201cSorry for prying. Anyway, your bracelet defines your access rights. Basically, there's a chip built in which does two main things \u2013 it lets you into areas where you have access and it's good for all the vending machines, the cafeteria, local shopping et cetera. So don't lose it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***<br>\r\n</div><br>\r\nAfter all the excitement and exercise, Carolina felt ready for bed. Luckily the bracelet let her take the lift so she did not have to walk all the stairs, somehow she didn't get lost and made it to the right suite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother swipe of her bracelet and the door opened, letting out the noise of afternoon TV. <i>What the-? Did I forget to switch it off?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi, roommate!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Roommate? Oh, God, I have a roommate. Why couldn't Mom use her money or influence to get me a solo room? Oh, right, she must've picked someone as a 'roll' model for me. So who is it?</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And while Carrie had seen much bigger stomachs, starting at home, this one looked impressively round and taut, swollen with whatever her roommate was currently eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned her head, getting her dirt blonde hair slide in her bowl, stretched her chipmunk cheeks in a welcoming smile. \u201cHi, I\u2019m Evie! Evie Littleton, junior, pleased to meetcha. Sorry for not standing up, I\u2019m bushed. The way here was horrendous, my feet are killing me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s OK, I\u2019m Carolina <font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">Griffith-Johnson</font>. Hi.\u201d And she collapsed into the closest armchair, feeling likewise exhausted after her trip around school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvie grunted as she swivelled her upper body to better see the newcomer. \u201cHave we met last year? I have a bad memory for faces\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, we couldn\u2019t, I am new here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA newBee? You don't look like one.\u201d Her roommate plopped several more chocolates in her mouth. \u201cOh, where are my manners. Here, have some.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Carolina picked the last two pieces, looking lost at the bottom of the huge bowl.<i> I need to replenish my energy,</i> she argued. \u201cWell, yeah, I\u2019m a sophomore. But I had to switch schools this year.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? Why? Were you at a co-ed school? What did you do? Got caught with a guy?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWere it not for a cheerful grin, Carolina would\u2019ve slugged her. \u201cNo! I did nothing. That is, I did pretty well at Forsythe. Almost made it to the honor roll. It was Mom who made me come to Buttercombe. Said I'd feel better here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe was right about that, believe me. Buttercombe is da bomb! The best school in the whole round world. You'll feel much more welcome here. Say, you did get a welcome basket too, right?\u201d asked the bigger girl suddenly, \u201cUmm, could I, y'know, have a bite? Please?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you get your own?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, yeah but it is already gone. I was hungry. Still am, in fact,\u201d Evie caressed her bloated belly, \u201cy\u2019know what? I\u2019ll tell you a secret if you share with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarolina hesitated. On one hand this would get rid of her temptation. <i>But the basket was for me. But she promised me a secret. But she needs all those empty calories even less than me. And I want to rest here, no walking to my room to fetch it. And I don\u2019t want to share, when all\u2019s said and done\u2026 No, I swore to keep slim. </i>As she pushed herself up from the armchair, her bottom tyre brushed against her thighs, reinforcing her motivation to share. She brought the welcome basket from her room and placed it mid-way between the chair and Evie\u2019s sofa. \u201cHere, go ahead. Eat it all if you like.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally, I am not hungry.\u201d Except as she looked at all the sweets and candy, her mouth started salivating. And her stomach chose this moment to remind her it wanted to be fed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvie had to hear its growling too. \u201cY'know what? Let's split it in half, OK?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, fine, I don\u2019t care.\u201d Except her hand shot and seized a bag of trouffles even before Carolina finished those words. \u201cSo what\u2019s the secret?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee, they include some goodies in the baskets that never made it to the vending machines before. And they want us to tell them if they\u2019re any good. Except most people never bother so they started offering rewards for our feedback. I found out by accident that if you log in to your school account, there\u2019s an icon, bottom right, that says FEEDBACK. And if you tell them what you liked most you get another basket just like this. I already filled it in. Don\u2019t forget to do it too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, well, maybe.\u201d That would defy the whole purpose of sharing the first basket, yet Carolina\u2019s mind already filed it away for future use. \u201cSo tell me, what\u2019s life like in here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s perfect, girl, believe me, just perfect\u2026\u201d and Evie told her at length the benefits of studying at Buttercombe. Carolina listened with interest, noticing that for some reason all the high points included eating\u2026 and failing to notice that as Evie\u2019s mouth was occupied with talking, most of the goodies ended up in her own stomach. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nEventually Evie ran out of superlatives to describe their school with. \u201cJust have a look at us. Ah, that\u2019s the life. I missed this all summer long. Mom made me go on a diet, said I was eating too much, getting too fat! Can you imagine?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the porker stuff herself with chocolate, Carolina had no trouble imagining it. But it would be much better to have a friendly roommate. And maybe means of disposal for her temptation too? \u201cNo way! Like, really?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the basket gradually emptied with their collective effort, Carolina finally discovered the letter Penny told her about. It was buried under the avalanche of calories and when she opened it, she found a copy of school rules, her timetable and also a warning she had to go to the school nurse and get a bracelet (check). And she also had to visit the seamstress to get a uniform before the welcoming dinner \u2013 what? \u201cListen, there's a seamstress at this school too? I am supposed to go there to have my uniform tailored, is it for real?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, you get to have it tailored? Me, I have to make do with off the peg model.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I mean, we have to wear uniforms here?\u201d Come to think of it, the RA \u2013 Peggy? - did wear something ugly brownish-yellow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, silly. It's to promote a feeling of community and alleviate income disparity.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow you're quoting the brochure,\u201d Carolina had to grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvie grinned too. \u201cSure but it makes sense, don't you think? Anyway, shouldn't you better hurry? The dinner starts at 6 and you still don't have your uniform. The seamstress is in the new building, umm, Vandergriff?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoooh. I don\u2019t want to move.\u201d She was beginning to feel the all-too-familiar effects of shoving two pounds of chocolate down her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI getcha, girl, but you better do. The school\u2019s pretty laid back but uniforms are the one thing where they put the foot down. You don\u2019t want to start your studies with an infraction like that.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As much as she whined about her fatty home life, it hadn't afforded her a lick of stamina. She just so badly wished that this could have been put off another day. She barely had a muscle to her name and somehow this school with a reputation of fattening up freshmen was going to make her burn <i>all</i> of the calories!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she had to make the trip alone! How horrible!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Nah, I'm not feeling it.\"</i> Evie had told her with a dismissive wave as she popped a couple of candies in her mouth, <i>\"But you go and do that.

Carrie had gone and shared her snacks with her, and this was the thanks she got?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll alone in the Vandergriff building, distinguished by its more modern design and significantly different layout to the main building, Carolina Griffith-Johnson felt like she'd stepped out of one frying pan and onto the oven eye! She had no idea where she was going, until that nice older girl had given her a helping hand in pointing her towards the tailor's. What's worse, all of the lower floors were almost devoid of human life since classes hadn't started yet\u2013<i>creepy!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carolina Griffith-Johnson?\" came a voice suddenly, and from behind her no less, that made the bottom-heavy girl let loose an undignified squeak of fear<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes!\" Carrie yelped, fearful for her life as she slowly turned to face an older black woman in the doorway<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought so.\" the teacher chuckled, \"Come on in, I've been expecting you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, the design studio was different than what Carrie was expecting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, there were pushpin models and mannequins. That much was pretty much a given, thanks to the nature of what it was that Mrs. Banks (the Fashion &amp; Design teacher, as well as the woman who had rescued Carrie from wandering the hallways!) worked with. However, the computers lined up against the back and left walls suggested that this studio doubled as her classroom. And what's more, Carrie was given a firsthand look at just where her measurements had gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this is you.\" Mrs. Banks referred to the wireframe outline of Carrie that catered to her measurements, taken by Nurse Fukiyama not two hours ago, \"Or at least, these are your measurements.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie narrowed her eyes at the fleshy bits of her wireframe counterpart. That fleshy belly and those wide hips were the bane of her existence, and laying them out like that on a tablet (no matter how big and impressive it was!) was enough to make the fire in her belly grow hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, I know it's never easy to look at your figure when it's laid out like that.\" the older woman laughed as she ran a hand over her stomach, \"But maybe this will help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a tap, Carrie's silhouetted simulated shape was tarped in a digital rendition of the school uniform. Yellow jacket, mustard skirt, with a white blouse. The knee-high socks and the uncomfortable looking shoes weren't the worst part, either. She'd look like a bottle of Heinz in this getup! And that little ascot. How dorky!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously she'd made another face, because Mrs. Banks was quick to swoop in again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, it's never as bad as it looks here.\" she smiled, playing with the image a bit, \"But I'll admit, not everyone looks good in bright yellow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I <i>have</i> to wear the whole thing?\" Carrie curled a nostril distastefully at her prescribed outfit for at least the next three years<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not the <i>whole</i> thing. But at least the blouse and the skirt.\" Mrs. Banks clicked her tongue, \"Ascot too, I'm afraid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No cute little dress alternatives?\" Carrie asked hopefully<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Afraid not. But if you'd like, there's a sweatervest option.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie looked at the example and recoiled in horror. The sweatervest hugged her model's tummy so tightly that you could see where her belly cut over itself on the skirt's clasp! That just wouldn't do at all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thank you.\" she whined<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually they settled on her getting the whole basic uniform. Mrs. Banks said that Carrie'd thank her when winter came, and she had a blazer to wear with her longer skirt. She'd done her best to tweak the measurements to the spoiled carolina girl's liking, but she still wasn't happy with the overall product.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now it'll be ready in a couple of days, so in the meantime you'll have to wear an tailored fit.\" the older woman cautioned, giving her a stack of plastic-wrapped clothing for Carrie to carry, \"That'll be your spare. You can always come back and get it altered when you have your new clothes in a couple of days, free of charge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUgh. Untailored clothes. They were going to be so baggy. With Carrie's wide hips and plump rump, her blouse was probably going to make her look twenty pounds heavier than she actually was. She hadn't worn anything that wasn't to her specific liking since she was Ginny's age. This was going to be miserable...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And don't worry about stretching your clothes out, now.\" the instructor said with a pat on top of the pile of clothes, \"We get to play with some pretty neat things in the design department, and you've been put down for the Yeng-Huan fabric blend. That's what's going to take so long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie's ears pricked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your clothes, sweetie.\" Mrs. Banks raised her eyebrows and cornered a smile like she'd said the most obvious thing in the world, \"They're going to be great. They won't stretch out, but they won't look baggy. Trust me, lots of girls love it. You'll have plenty of room if you need it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would I need it?\" Carrie made a face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're C++, Carolina; it's part of the package!\" the teacher tapped Carrie's bracelet, dangling from her wrist, \"Now go on, I've got to get ready for Monday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that, Carrie was alone in the Vandergriff once again, holding a pile of clothes and armed with more questions than answers.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Carolina trudged back with her bundle of new clothes, she felt even worse than on her way to Vandergriff Hall. She would have sworn she had been going mostly uphill on her way there but now there was another hill for her to climb. She sighed, feeling abandoned by the whole world. She felt muscles she didn't even know she had as they screamed against the abuse. Her thighs felt sore from all the chafing and unless some miracle happened, she knew they would be raw by the time she reached her destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked on a couple dozen yards but then she simply had to stop. Utterly exhausted, she paused to wipe sweat off her brow and think about her predicament. Why, she must have walked two miles already today! In Buttercombe of all places! Maybe\u2026 maybe she could find a shortcut?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she looked around, she spotted a faint trail, barely visible in grass. It deviated to the left from the paved path that went straight uphill, designed for cars or the carts people drove around. And most importantly, it seemed that the trail avoided the climb and went around the hill. Ideal for a tired pedestrian like her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarolina didn't even think about it and turned left. After years of her mother's conditioning, taking the easy way out was ingrained in her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd this trail definitely was easier; it veered a little downhill, soft soil and grass didn't hurt her feet as much as hard concrete. Still, it didn't take long before her fatigue got back with a vengeance. With every step her pace slowed down until she was crawling at a snail's pace and praying for a miracle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA miracle did happen \u2013 though it didn't seem that way first. As she trudged down the grassy patch, Carolina heard a voice shout: \"Hey! You there!\" Her mind clouded with fatigue, she actually made several steps before it registered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you hear me?! Miss! You mustn't go there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie stopped moving so abruptly that she nearly keeled over. Taking her time to steady herself, she turned around to see on of those overgrown white golf carts wobbling dangerously on the uneven green as it sped towards her. A plump woman sitting behind the wheel drove it rather carelessly, her boobs and belly shaking at every bump. She stopped in front of the unhappy student. \u201cAre you going somewhere, Miss?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly now did Carolina notice the yellow stripes and the sign on the side: Administrative Security. But she paid more attention to the white uniform, stretched tight over the guard's sizable chest. The nametag said Sofia Mendez. \u201cUh, yeah, Ms. Mendez, I had to collect my uniform from Vandergriff and I was now hurrying back to make it before the welcoming dinner starts.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman nodded, highlighting her second chin. \u201cI see. Are you aware that this route goes out of the campus, Ms\u2026 ?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCarolina. Umm, no, I didn\u2019t know that, sorry? I\u2019m new here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, you don't look like a newBee. You have to have some kind of\u2026 Oh, just show me your bracelet,\u201d and Sofia reached for it. When Carolina did as she asked, she tsked. \u201cC++? Don't you know that you are entitled to use mobility scooters? This seems fishy. What were you going to do there? And what's in that sack you're carrying?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy uniform! Look, I told you\u2026 I just want to get back before the dinner starts. I thought I could take a shortcut through here...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, no, no, no, trust me, you don\u2019t want to do that.\u201d The guard leaned forward, her belly bunching up in her lap, and whispered, \u201cYou don\u2019t want to spread it around but there's been an outbreak of Lyme disease, some kind of ticks infestation. We've been told by the authorities that they had it eradicated on the grounds but I wouldn\u2019t risk it if I were you. Walking around is unsafe. Look, hop on, I'll drive you to the main building. And I'll check your bracelet there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, thank you, thank you!\u201d Carolina surprised her by the outburst of joy. She was up in the cart's second seat before the guard finished her speech. It was rather a tight squeeze, both of them being bigger in the hips and while Carrie could console herself that she still fit into her seat, it was only because it was supersized. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSofia Mendez gave her another suspicious look, detained students in her experience seldom welcomed it with such enthusiasm. \u201cAnyway, let's drive back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the main building Sofia picked a side entrance that let her drive inside with the cart. \u201cHi, Jess! Caught another interloper already! Am I good or am I good?\u201d She shouted gleefully at a blob of a woman that munched on donuts as she watched a wall full of camera feeds. \u201cAnd now I'll check you in the system and you'll have to spill the beans!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told you three times already\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, yeah, yeah, you're new and you were picking up your uniform. But now we'll know the truth!\u201d The guard stopped at a data terminal jutting out of the wall so it could be easily accessed from a cart. \u201cBeep your bracelet here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine.\u201d Carolina shrugged as she did so. She had to stretch over the guard's body to do so, both squishing uncomfortably. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSofia then peered on the monitor, silence stretched and her olive skin was getting a little pink. Eventually she gave out an embarrassed cough before turning to Carrie. \u201cOh. Well, according to the log it seems you really <i>are </i>here the first day and you <i>did</i> just pick up your uniform as you said\u2026  And since you have C++... Well, we'll let you go with a warning, Ms. Griffith-Johnson, and, uh\u2026 sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, that's fine. Thanks for the ride, you saved my life.\u201d Carolina didn't think she was exaggerating. If that trail didn't go back to the main building, would she ever make it there?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, right. Remember that as a C++ student you\u2019re allowed to use the mobility scooters if there are any available. And it is <i>dangerous </i>to walk outside. So stay inside or take a cart, OK?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I really need to find out what the C++ stands for. But not now. I do not have the time for it, the dinner s about to start.</i> \u201cI\u2026 see. Thanks, Ms. Mendez.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd promise me, don't go on any more dangerous adventures like this, Miss!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, believe me, I've had enough! Thanks, Ms. Mendez!\u201d and she rushed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEncouraged by the outcome, Carolina tried to beep her bracelet at the lift. And lo and behold \u2013 it opened! \u201cFinally!\u201d she jumped inside and punched her floor. She never spotted the irony; for years she'd wished to be able to exercise without her mother stopping her. And the first day her wish came true she already did all she could to avoid exercising her flabby body.<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><br>\r\n***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in her room Carolina discovered that her freeloading roommate had already gone. A scrap of paper on the coffee table told her where to:<br>\r\n<i><b>Gone for the feast. Hurry up!<br>\r\nE</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glanced at her phone to see what time it was. \u201cOK, fine, no need to panic, you still have fifteen minutes left, girl. Let's get dressed and get down there!\u201d She unpacked the uniform and spread various pieces on her bed. \u201cMaybe it won't be that bad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was. When she saw herself dressed in her attire for the next three years, Carrie winced. All her dresses had various clever ways to disguise extra pounds. This white blouse looked as if it was designed specifically to draw attention to the way her paunch spilled over the hem of a too tight skirt. And when she turned around, the mirror showed her the mustard skirt didn't spare her behind either. It looked huge, almost Ginny-sized!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarolina knew she let her guard down a little over the summer. It wasn't like she had a choice. After hammering out a compromise with Mom that included full access to cable TV, she didn\u2019t want to lose it again over a cupcake. Or a dozen. So she ate a little more, indulged her sweet tooth on Mom's urging, and now its result was in plain sight for everyone to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh! God, I look like a cow!\u201d She closed her eyes, half hoping it would go away. Alas, no. She hurriedly put on the rest of her attire and rushed out without a single look in the mirror, leaving all her clothes strewn about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope the cafeteria won't be as hard to find as the design studio was,\u201d she worried as the lift carried her downstairs, sparing her the need to exert her muscles again. Carrie needn't have worried. As soon as its door opened on the ground floor, there was a large arrow pointing that way. And as she walked from her dorm, the din of students eagerly waiting for their first meal of the year was echoing down the hallways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she entered the great hall, Carolina was almost overwhelmed by the crowds she saw there. It was huge, with so many tables, large and small. Unused to such large crowds, she stopped dead in her tracks, trying to find a friendly face. And against all hope she found two. At one table the bespectacled RA Penny Parker looked alone and lost in thought while at another, her roommate Evie Littleton was regaling some tale to her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere would she sit?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Eventually, Caroline decided that her roommate was the best route to go. After all, they'd be rooming with each other at least until the Summer. Why not make making friends a little easier?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvie and her friends were sitting at one of the singular tables that dotted the cafeteria, crowding their eating space with stuffed bellies that rolled onto the top like beached whales. They were a loud bunch, and as Carrie made her way towards them she could hear their conversation and laughter well before she had actually reached the group of gourmands. Evie had seen her, her chunky cheeks bunching in a big smile, and raised her head slightly in acknowledgement of Carrie's approach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey roomie!\" she raised her thick arm high in the air and gave an excited little wobbly wave, \"You wanna sit with us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRightfully, Carrie didn't think that she would fit. These girls that Evie acquainted herself with were all double-wide fatsos, taking up plenty of room at what should have been a roomy table. The curvature of their bellies as they pooled in front of them, diamonds of pampered gut flesh eeking between the buttons on their blouses, kept them a comfortable distance from their table. Each girl's wide rump, prematurely ripened until they were vast and heavy, made an insular circle of booty blubber that Carolina doubted she could squeeze into. All of these girls were so big, even Evie was dwarfed by one or two of them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!\" Carrie tore herself back to reality and forced a smile, \"Sorry, I... excuse me, could you just...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flock of fat girls scooched as best they could allow. Chairs scraped beneath them as bellies rocked, quivered, and trembled in their slight motions. Laughter became a chorus of fatty grunts as everyone made slight adjustments so as to allow the newest addition to their group a spot to sit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hrmm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hrurp.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a fair bit of adjustment, Carrie was officially seated. What's more, Evie's friends were comfortable once more. They didn't seem particularly bothered by Carrie's addition, nor the added space that she took up, so that was nice. Carrie had sat next to Evie and a rather plain (if not excruciatingly fat) girl whose wide hips and side rolls kept nudging poor Carrie into her roommate. It was something of a tight fit, to say the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys, this is Carrie.\" Evie introduced the smaller girl with a showcasing motion, her arms jiggling with the motion, \"She's my new roommate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls smiled, some waved, most of them gave some variation on \"hi\". They introduced themselves, but Carrie couldn't bring herself to remember all of their names. There were five girls, not counting Evie, and the most important and striking thing about them all was that they all looked to weigh well over two hundred and fifty pounds apiece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These newbees are always so sweet and innocent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're just so <i>cute</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know Maggie Beaufort? You look <i>just</i> like this girl I knew...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarolina smiled and did her best to keep up in conversation. It wasn't one of her strong points, getting to know people. But it was either eat with Evie and her friends or be lonely with the RA, or worse yet eat by herself. She was going to have to build a circle of people she could talk to at some point, might as well just grin and bear it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd thankfully, Buttercombe Academy's orientation spread made it that much easier to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn due time, Evie escorted Carrie to the service station, where the culinary coalition that worked for the school had laid out plenty of options and servers to cater to the students and staff in attendance. Wide spreads dotted a tiny room, round girls bumping into one another butt to gut in anticipation of getting to taste what this year's welcome feast had to offer. It didn't disappoint! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, you got the duck.\" Evie's soft arm pressed into Carrie's side as she leaned over her tray, \"Good choice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had done her best to keep it light. Moderation was the key to staying thin. Or at least, not winding up like Evie or the rest of her friends who'd all piled their plates high with portions of ungodly sizes. Somehow, fitting back into place seemed more difficult as the girls entered their second (and in two instances, third!) heaping helpings of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not always this good.\" said a girl with a particularly round, flat face, \"You'd better enjoy it now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The food's always good though.\" the whale beside her chimed in, practically licking her plate clean<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just not <i>this</i> good.\" a girl a little smaller than Evie concurred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurrounded on all sides, Carrie didn't have a lot of elbow room. Her knife and fork motions were severely stunted by Evie's eager command of space, and the fatter girl beside her's general girth. However, she had to agree! These people at Buttercombe knew how to roast a good duck...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir sauces were superb...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir selection of sides amazing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie melted at the meal that she steadily began to wolf down. It was in her nature to indulge, she could hardly moderate her appetite better than she could subject herself to exercise. The spoiled little thing didn't stand a chance against the culinary excellence that Buttercombe money bought; she sucked down the soup, downed the duck with ease, and pounded down her potato like it was nobody's business!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get your fill, girl?\" Evie asked her roommate as she scooted out from the chair, patting her belly contentedly, \"I'm gonna head up for the night. You wanna come? I know you didn't eat much...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't eat much.\" Ha! Carrie had downed enough food to keep anyone well fed for the night, for sure. But she'd also wolfed down her welcome basket <i>and</i> had a couple of snacks throughout the day. She was stuffed! Her poor round belly was filled with the day's indulgences, each of them more enjoyable than the last...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're stopping after three plates?\" one of the girls said with a piggish snort, \"What are you, dieting all of the sudden?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're gonna stay here a little longer if you wanna stay with us, Carrie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, don't let her be a buzzkill.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had a big lunch, okay?\" Evie playfully stamped her foot, causing her entire body to wobble for a second that almost lingered into a moment, \"Whatever you want to do is okay by me, Carrie. I don't mind hanging out with these jerks a little longer if you're still hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie bit her bottom lip contemplatively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn one hand, less temptation. On the other, more food. Plus, it might be nice to get to know these girls a little better...</span></div></div>",

Sure, if her mother were there to push another course on her, Carrie would have rebelled out of principle. But her Mom was far away and these girls were nice and friendly so why not stay and indulge in conversation? Make friends? \u201cSure, I could have a bite. I mean, I didn't have any dessert yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no!\u201d the landwhale next to her exclaimed in mock horror. \u201cYou must \u2013 simply MUST \u2013 taste the cheesecakes they make here. With pecan and rum, lemon and white chocolate, raspberry\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPeanut butter-chocolate...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I saw at least a dozen different ones today. Let't go get'em, guys, before they're all gone.\u201d And the girls started standing up. With their bellies already filled, it was a long, strenuous process that required plenty of rocking about, heaving and groaning. While Carolina wouldn't admit it, she struggled as much as bigger girls. She was new to this situation. Not that she would never overeat, far from it! But back home there was always a maid to rush in and help her get to bed. Here she had to do everything on her own, balance her wobbly feet and all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually they were all up. Evie stepped back from the wall of fat rolling at her. \u201cOK, guys, I don't need to be around for that, I'm going  We'll catch up later. Roomie\u2026\u201d she paused, sizing Carrie up, \u201cmake sure you get back in one piece. You watch out for her, guys, will ya?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, right, bye.\u201d \u201cOK, see you.\u201d \u201cDon't worry.\u201d It was obvious the fatties focused on cheesecake, ignoring any other output for now. Evie shrugged and fled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBye!\u201d Carolina actually found out she was alone. Given their size, her newfound friends could move surprisingly fast when it came to getting more food. She followed them slowly to the dessert corner, letting out a few burps, when she spotted another familiar face. A small, round, blue-haired woman was leaning on a wall there, surveying the feeding scene with a benign smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wasn't there something I wanted to find out? </i>\u201cAuntie Helen? Hi!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAch! Is that you, Carrie? Hello! I could not recognise you in the uniform, you look so grown up! Come here!\u201d and she wrapped her in her hug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt still felt a little weird to Carolina, to see her so small. She used to look up to the dr. Schwartz, literally, but now she'd grown taller than her by half a head. Luckily she hadn't grown wider than her old family friend but even her present size brought other problems along as their bellies squished. \u201cOomph, careful! I'm stuffed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see, excuse my carelessness, dear.\u201d Helen quickly let her go, her eyes on Carolina's tummy. \u201cHow are you enjoying Buttercombe so far?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, it's good! My room's actually better than back home and\u2026 The food here tastes incredible! As good as in the best restaurants in the DC! Even better! I don't get it!\u201d Carrie beamed, then sobered up. \u201cBut, uh, actually, there was a thing\u2026 could I ask you something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course! That's what I'm here for! My door is always open. And for you not only metaphorically, Carrie! Come whenever you like! So what ails you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, I noticed I am in the C++ group but I don't know\u2026 Could you tell me what exactly that means?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer Mom's friend paused. \u201cActually, I am not <i>exactly</i> 100 percent sure myself but there should be an easy way to\u2026 Oh, there it is! Come, mein liebchen.\u201d And she dragged the poor girl to a vending machine which looked out of place by the cafeteria entrance. It was also different than the others, an even bigger behemoth, a sleek chrome monstrosity which displayed laptops, cellphones and various electronics on offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is a service terminal, Carrie. It dispenses various, uh, 'gadgets' for our students. And here,\u201d Helen used her own bracelet, then scrolled through a menu fast as hell \u2013 evidently she was used to it. \u201cJa, here are the brochures. Wait a second\u2026\u201d they heard a hidden printer at work, then a single sheet of paper slid out that she quickly snatched. \u201cHere you are. Group C++ covers all the benefits of Tier IV SSS even if said student does not yet meet its prerequisites-\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Yet?</i> thought Carolina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c-namely it provides an unlimited meal plan at the cafeteria as well as unlimited credit for vending machines, the Buttercombe Takeaway and Room Delivery and all other campus services. These services include unlimited wardrobe alterations and/or replacements as well as technology rental\u2026\u201c here the doctor paused, \u201eIn short, you may request a brand new Y-Phone, Y-Top, Y-Pad, anything you like from the list and it's been already paid for by your parents. The current favorite is the Himatsubushi 3-D VR Gaming Rig. Hurry and ask for it.\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat sounds good. Thanks!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGlad to be of help, mein liebchen. But aren't those your friends waving at you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere? Oh, right, sorry.\u201d Carolina spotted their frantic waves from the dessert table. \u201cGotta run, Auntie! See you next time!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnjoy your desserts, Carrie. Give my regards to Mom. And take the paper with you, you might need it soon.\u201d Helen Schwartz watched the girl stuff the paper into the pocket of her jacket and rush to the dessert queue as fast as her jiggling bottom let her. She couldn't help wondering how much wider those hips were going to get if little Carrie kept up her enthusiasm for Buttercombe cuisine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHurry up, girl! Where have you been? The cheesecakes are, like, almost gone! And all other cakes too!\u201d Her humongous new friend chided her. \u201cQuickly! Grab a tray \u2013 the biggest one \u2013 and load as much as you can! While you still can!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was another new thing for Carolina. At home there had always been an absolute abundance of food. No matter how much she'd overeaten, there had been still plenty more left over. Did she have to compete for food here? If so, she wasn't going to to make it easy to other girls! She crammed every nook of her tray with delectable-looking confectionery before registering her order by beeping her bracelet and heading back to their table. Dr. Schwartz watched it from her corner spot, her smile a fraction wider than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the girls got back to their table, silence ruled them for a time. They were all too busy stuffing their faces but eventually, as last gaps in their stomachs filled up, conversation sprung up again. \u201cMan, I missed this all summer long!\u201d the girl next to Carolina sighed as she struggled to swallow another bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, don't remind me, Chloe! Mom made me go on a diet, I lost ten pounds!\u201d one of the smaller girls complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, she did that to me too. But Gran lent me her car and credit card so I just spent my afternoons going from one drive-in to another. And evenings at the all-you-can-eat with my girlfriends from home. Would you believe I put on twenty?\u201d Chloe proudly patted her gut. \u201cBut still. None of that fast food can hold a candle to Buttercombe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs the eating really this good all the time?\u201d Carolina gathered her courage to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh right, I keep forgetting you're actually a newbee, you fit among us so well. Right, guys? Anyway, yeah, normal dinners aren't as, like, this big, but they're still the best grub I've ever eaten. And then there are the holidays. Oh man! Last year's Halloween there was so much candy around everyone got sick of it. And our Thanksgiving dinner lasted, like, all day. It was crazy! And then Christmas! If you can, try to stay over the holidays. They go all out for those who can't go home. You don't have to leave the cafeteria all day long, all day every day, none of that crap about cleaning breaks! And you take as much as you want, whatever you want, no snotty senior is going to hog it for herself! Oh!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarolina had her own reasons to stay at school over the holidays but this sounded so\u2026 so\u2026 either good or bad, she couldn't quite decide. Her stomach gurgled at this point, reminding her how much she\u2019d already forced into it on top of all the chocolate and snacks. She saw the crease between her two biggest tyres fill out as her stomach inflated with food, making her navel clearly visible in the white fabric of her blouse. At home this normally happened only on the said holidays and it was always a sign for her to step away from the table (or at least, have the maid help her).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she wasn't home anymore. She was having a good time with these girls and her tray was still half full of cakes she didn't get to taste. What to do? To eat or not to eat?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Her stomach gurgled again but Carolina took it as a sign there was still room in it and she ought to fill it with those wonderful cheesecakes. Besides, she really needed friends here and these girls were nice to her; a pleasant change to the bullies she'd known at her previous school. They were rather\u2026 big too but that actually helped sway her. In this group she could be the skinny sexy one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she abandoned all restraint. There was more room at the table after Evie's departure so she found a more comfortable position in her reinforced chair, one that didn't squish her poor tummy, and dug in.<i> It is just for tonight. This is a celebration of my arrival and making friends,</i> she tried to justify it,<i> starting tomorrow I\u2019ll be watching what I eat.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor now she watched the cakes disappear in her gullet one by one. They weren't big, five or six inches in diameter, but there still were nearly half a dozen of them left. Soon Carolina struggled with every bite, fought to swallow the sweet buttery substance, to add it to the mass that filled her throat. She felt herself redden from the effort. She was also sweating profusely and in the rare moments she looked at her companions, she saw the sweaty sheen on their pink faces too. But that didn\u2019t stop anyone from cleaning their trays. Chloe and the girl who complained about dieting (Sally?) even went for another helping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan, that was awesome!\u201d Carolina's exclamation interrupted their laboured breathing. Completely stuffed and exhausted, she let her hands hang limply down. As they did, they brushed a paper in her pocket. What was that? She took it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou betcha!\u201d \u201cIt was, right?\u201d \u201cWelcome to Buttercombe!\u201d \u201cWhat's that you got there, gurl?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, what is\u2026 oh.\u201d Carrie pulled out the leaflet she forgot about in her feeding frenzy. She briefly scanned it again but Auntie Helen already covered the most important points. \u201cJust some info for me since I'm new here. Umm, guys, can you tell me what is, uh, a Himit- Himatsubushi Gaming Rig?\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOooh! I been trying to get that for ages! I'm still on the waiting list. In fact, only Chloe already got one but she's on the SSS.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, don't stretch it, Sal. You asked for it right before we all went home for summer. They just didn't have enough time to deliver it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I know, but still. Can you imagine how many quests we could have done together in Alter Ego already?\u201d the (relatively) smaller girl was apparently a bit of a gamer as she launched into a convoluted explanation of all the benefits of the VR Rig. Other girls let her talk, only grunting in agreement. They were happy for a moment of respite, waited for their stomachs to process enough food to be able to move again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut eventually a chime resonated throughout the cafeteria. It sounded important and several students elsewhere stood up and rushed to get more food. Carrie saw nobody at her table looked concerned. \u201cWhat's that?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, that's just the first warning. And the service station will be closing now. We can stay on some more and rest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah but I think we should- *urrp* -get going anyway. By the third bell all hallways will be packed.\u201d And the speaker rocked herself upright, her packed gut almost defying gravity as it jutted ahead of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, true.\u201d  \u201cLet's go, guys.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith many grunts and sighs, and some swearing, the five fattened whales and Carrie heaved themselves from their seats and lumbered away to digest the feast they just consumed.<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><br>\r\n***<br>\r\n</div><br>\r\nAnother sweep of the bracelet, her door opened and Carrie stumbled into her suite. She made it to the closest armchair and collapsed in it, swallowing hard to keep her dinner in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvie was watching the TV lying on one of the couches, the dome of her belly aimed at the sky (or at least the ceiling). Now she gaped at her. \u201cGod, you're in such a state! Poor girl! I'll have some words for the guys tomorrow. I<i> told</i> them to look after you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUumph, that's\u2026 Ouch! That's OK, really.\u201d Carolina slid the hem of her skirt below her stomach and struggled to unbutton the bottom buttons of her blouse. She massaged the swollen pink orb that rose out between its white flaps. \u201cI'm\u2026 used to this\u2026 sorta.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, well, let me at least help you deal with it.\u201d Evie walked to the bathroom with surprising ease, given her size and the fact her dinner was not that much smaller. She returned with a small bottle of bluish liquid. \u201cHere, this'll help you. Yeng Stomach Aid; Extra Strength. They re-stock the stuff regularly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, right, I know this! Thanks! Ginny \u2013 my sister \u2013 sometimes takes it.\u201d Carrie knew that she'd had some objections to this particular medicine back home but in her present state she couldn't recall any. Besides, anything was better than that dull throbbing pain! She quickly opened the bottle and gulped what had to be at least a double dose. While she didn't lie that she was used to overeating, she had never let herself go as thoroughly as today. In the company of Evie's friends she felt \u2013 no, she was eating the least. And she still ended stuffing herself more than ever before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow she released a series of burps as the vile-tasting concoction began its work. \u201cAh, thanks again. Already feeling better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight? Works wonders, doesn't it?\u201d Evie chuckled back on her sofa. \u201cSo\u2026 what d'you say to the girls?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I like them. They're fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGlad to hear you're not going to hold this against them,\u201d Evie pointed at the stomach obscuring Carrie's view of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no! No, this is\u2026 nothing big, really.\u201d Maybe it was the Stomach Aid at work but Carolina's mind cleared and she rushed to add, \u201cand it's entirely my fault. I went and stuffed myself though I should have known better. Don't tell the guys anything. I'll be more than happy to sit with you in the cafeteria again\u2026 I mean, if you let me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, good. Why shouldn't we let you? I think you fit quite well among us.\u201d<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><br>\r\n***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey chatted a little more before Evie announced: \u201cI don't know about you but I'm beat. All that travelling\u2026 They should finally invent the teleport they've been promising us, right? See you in the morning, roomie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBye.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarolina browsed the channels for a while, noting that as her roommate, Evie, too, benefited from the selection Dakota Griffith-Johnson purchased for her daughter (or perhaps she had equally generous parents?). But although the Yeng medicine helped her feel human again, fatigue soon overwhelmed her too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh she switched off the TV and lumbered to the bathroom. She did toy with the idea of rebelling against hygiene and going straight to sleep. But while that appealed to her lazy side, the dried sweat on her skin made her feel like she ran a marathon and made her want shower now! And she knew from experience that if she didn't brush her teeth now she'd wake up in the middle of the night with her mouth feeling awful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she trudged to the bathroom and performed all necessary ablutions. When she was finished, she faced her naked reflection in the full-size mirror there. She could see her gut shrunk a little but it was still painfully swollen and Carrie knew she was in for a fitful night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, congrats, Carolina. First day at your new school and you\u2019ve already broken just about every pledge you made to yourself. You used your family name to get around, you abused the privileges your Mom got for you and you stuffed yourself silly. Twice, first with the basket, then even worse at dinner.\u201d Interestingly enough she didn't even think about the biggest transgression of her code at all \u2013 that given the chance, she avoided all exercise she could. \u201cI need to restrain myself better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put on her nightie and trudged to bed. She was already drifting asleep when her mind brought up a reminder. There was something else to be done today \u2013 what was it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, right, the welcome basket. Evie told her the school was requesting feedback and bribing them with a second basket if they told them which new brands they liked the most. Should she fire up her laptop and fill in the feedback before she forgot it all?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And she didn't intend on waddling home Ginny-sized either; that would have made her mom entirely too pleased with herself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ugh.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreat, now she was upset. Maybe a little something to take the edge off...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of crinkling cellophane capped off her night as she indulged in one last snack from her welcome basket. Or was it Evie's? Hard to remember this late at night. Carrie might not have wanted to bother to leave feedback, but she sure was satisfied with how everything tasted around here. The chocolate cupcake that she'd unwrapped (careful not to get any crumbs on her bed, of course!) was <i>divine</i>. Like nothing she'd ever expect to come out of a vending machine...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day officially marked Carrie's first day of Freshman year\u2014and, unfortunately, she was already off to a rocky start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I look like a cow!\" Carrie wailed into the full-length mirror, immensely frustrated with the reflection that wailed back at her, \"I hate this stupid school and I hate this ugly uniform!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch like Carrie predicted, her untailored uniform fit her like a sack of potatoes. Without all of the tricks she used in the very specific construction of her own custom-made clothing, she just looked like a formless chubster. Her waist was hidden in the billowing white blouse that pooched over the waistband of her skirt, making her look like a bonafide fatty. Her hips pushed the pattern of her skirt outwards, making her butt look <i>huge</i>, and the sleeves gathered around her arms so it looked like she had bingo wings and... and... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>UGHHHH</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're a cow, then I'm a total whale.\" Evie chuckled as she entered the reflection, nudging her roommate over with her bigger shape. Their soft stomachs collided in a way that only added to Carrie's combustion, rather than pacified it, \"You look <i>adorable.</i> Stop worrying about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvie, despite being much fatter than the younger girl, looked much more at home in her uniform. She had already put on her butter-yellow blazer, her belly reaching forward and distending the plaid of the skirt. Her thick legs were hugged tightly by the stupid knee-high socks, but the sleeves on the blazer did well to hide her jiggly upper arms. All in all, Evie might have been fatter than Carolina was, but she looked so much better than her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hrmm...\" Carrie whined, \"This is so unfair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're so cute!\" Evie pinched Carrie's round cheeks, \"Look at you, so grumpy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M'not grumpy. I'm legitimately upset.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll feel better after breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike last night had never happened, cupcake and all, Carolina had woken up hungry. A spoiled appetite to last a lifetime and a deeply-ingrained sense of eating her troubles had left her practically smacking her lips at the thought of some bacon and eggs. And buttery grits. Big fluffy biscuits. Carrie felt like she could have eaten an entire farm at this rate...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is breakfast as good as dinner around here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As long as its better than these stupid ugly uniforms...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLumbering down the hallways along with the sea of other similarly stuffed students, Carrie was in no mood to go to class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd had an hour to eat her breakfast. And in that hour, she managed to eat almost as much as last night. Not only had Evie, Chloe, and the others insisted that she get her fill of bacon, eggs, grits, et cetera, but they'd practically pushed her back for more! French toast, plates full of waffles drenched in butter, those peanut butter pancakes (which had <i>not</i> lived up to the hype!} and more all found their way into Carrie's poor stuffed tummy and she was suddenly very aware of the fact that she had to go through a whole day like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so stupid...\" Carrie grumbled, waddling along her fatter friends as they slowly broke apart to go to their respective classes, \"I don't wanna go to class...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me about it.\" Evie hiked the top fold of her belly up and struggled to unclasp her skirt, letting out a sigh of relief as her stomach distended even further out, \"Ahhh... that's better...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie's homeroom was in the main building. Which was good for her, because that's where Evie's was. Almost everyone else had broken off to head towards other buildings. Some by cart, some by foot, but each and every one of the girls that had walked out with Carrie were just as stuffed as she was. Some of them even more\u2014a couple of landwhale seniors looked like they'd have to rolled back to their rooms by the end of it. Poor Carrie was too sore in the stomach to make a comment about it, but she hadn't exactly protested seconds, thirds, or fourths...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is me.\" Evie puffed as she came to a stop outside Mrs. Jackson's room, \"Have a good first day, Carrie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't.\" Carrie puffed, \"Wait, where did you say my homeroom was?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right, I was supposed to walk you there...\" Evie grunted, obviously just as stuffed and tired as her smaller roommate, \"It's really easy to get to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Evie!\" the bootilicious brat whined with a stamp of her foot, \"You're the worst!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's real easy, newbee. Stop stressing about everything so much.\" Evie stuck her tongue out playfully, \"I've gotta get to class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie grumbled to herself as she waded through the sea of whales that were her fellow students. She collided with ripe booties, shimmied against stuffed jiggly guts, and bumped into more than a few fleshy side rolls as she struggled to navigate her new environment. How was she supposed to get anywhere with all these chunky girls slowing her down?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ugh</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just wanted to nap. Her belly was so full and she was so tired. Carrie had almost never had to do anything she didn't want to do before, so this mild inconvenience was almost entirely too much for her poor pampered self. To make it even worse, her next class...</span></div></div>",

Maaaybe a little bit bigger than most but not by much. And there were some who made her feel almost slim, like that lardball in the back\u2026 Waitaminute! She looked familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi, Carrie! Wanna join me?\u201d Yes, it was Sally. And there was an unoccupied seat next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi!\u201d Carolina shuffled there and sat down, relieved to ease the burden on her overtaxed muscles. \u201cUmph!

In her anxiety she completely overlooked that the company of her new friends made Sally balloon in a single year. \u201cUmm, how's the teacher?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMs. Porter? Oh, she's not that bad, you'll see. Actually she never taught us yet but the girls didn't complain much last year. Except, uh, they said she insists that we read\u2026 Oh, there she is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs their teacher lumbered into the classroom, Carolina actually felt a little relieved. After all, she had just observed the behemoth seniors in cafeteria and those were at Buttercombe only for four years. A teacher could have been here easily double or triple that so she had been expecting a real landwhale, carried by one of those oversized golf carts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome back from holidays, class! In case you don't know me yet, I am Ms. Porter and I will be teaching you English this year.\u201d Carrie was half-right, the brunette did arrive in a cart and she was big, yes, tall and wide, especially around the waist. But she wasn't the size of her sister Ginny yet, though her sprawling gut already drew a lot of attention. And more importantly, the teacher arrived equipped with a full bag of goodies so there was hope yet the lesson may not be so harsh\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I see we have a new arrival in the class. Can you stand up and tell us a few words about yourself, please?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh no. She was singled out in her very first class! Public speaking \u2013 public attention in general \u2013 had always been one of Carolina's great fears. Mom could never understand her reluctance, her shyness in the spotlight. After all, Ginny took to it like a fish to water. But for Carrie it was the worst possible torture. And now this\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bought herself some time as she struggled to rise from her seat. \u201cUmm, hi. My name's Carolina and, uh, I've transferred here so\u2026 Umm, well, my hobbies are\u2026\u201d watching TV probably didn't count, \u201canimals and nature,\u201d it looked good on the widescreen TV, \u201cand travelling.\u201d Preferably sitting down in a car seat far away from her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see. And what kind of books do you read? Do you read?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, sure. I like\u2026 classical mysteries.\u201d Just last week she binge-watched the old Sherlock Holmes series.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what did you read last?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, crap. What was the name of the original book? At least one of them? \u201cUmm, the\u2026 the Sign of Four?\u201d Carrie overplayed her stage fright a little, letting her voice tremble, in the hope the teacher would ease up in her interrogation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was successful. Ms. Porter turned her attention away. \u201cInteresting. Thank you. And now, class, just like last year you can find the reading list for this class, English II, on the subject webpage under my name, easily accessible from your Y-Pads. Unfortunately there is very little in the way of mysteries, Carolina\u2026\u201d Some people chuckled. \u201c\u2026but I hope you will enjoy reading the books anyway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee? She's not that bad, right?\u201d Sally chuckled next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Carolina wiped sweat off her brow and decided not to comment. \u201cI'm not much of a reader, you know?\u201d she admitted instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, none of us are, don't worry. There're more important things, like, do you game?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm, sometimes?\u201d She was interrupted by her belly growling. When she was nervous, Carolina ate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? What kind of stuff?\u201d Sally turned to her. \u201cUh, never mind. Are you hungry? Here, have a snack. I always come prepared.\u201d And she held out a packet of cupcakes.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Carrie and Sally weren't the only girls snacking in class. Plenty of girls had gotten used to being able to munch liberally throughout their days as freshmen, and the returning Sophomores of Ms. Porter's English II class were no slouches in the snacking department. They were, however, the only girls who were actively not paying attention in class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, like, you and Chloe used to be roommates?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, last year.\" Sally sucked on an off-brand gummy worm until it slurped past her pink lips, \"She got me hooked on these things. I swear, everything tastes so much better than back home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie couldn't have agreed more. Even given her mother's government and Yeng connections, everything at Buttercombe had tasted... <i>better</i> somehow. Not in a way that she could directly put her finger on, but it was as if Sally had said it for her. Last night's dinner, this morning's breakfast, the welcome baskets... even these gummy worms were pretty great! Carrie had been pilfering pretty steadily from the king-sized bag of candies, much to the distaste of her already stuffed stomach. After a breakfast as big as hers, you would have at least thought that after her nerves died down, she'd have reeled her chubby little hand back in from Sally's snack bag...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then she got put on SSS, and I got assigned to a new room.\" Sally whined as longingly as her hushed tone would allow, \"I miss my Chlo-Chlo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You get a new room when you get put on SSS?\" Carrie asked, a gummy worm dangling from her mouth, \"Huh. That seems dumb.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So dumb.\" Sally's belly growled loud enough to give the girls in front of them pause, \"Hey, what hall are you on after this? The baking club is doing a fundraiser, and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No fair! Sally was supposed to go with me to that bake sale...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe, the largest of Evie's friends currently wedged into a desk so tightly that her stomach cut deep into the wood, was much less quiet than Sally had been. That meant in regards to her tone of voice as well as her snacking. Just like the smaller brunette, Chloe had brought plenty of junk food to tide her over until the next lunch break. Muffins, cupcakes, granola bars... honestly, Carrie didn't think that the blimpy blonde had actually managed to pack her schoolbooks into that backpack of hers!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well...\" Carrie gulped down a big bite of extra-frosted cupcake, \"It's still going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie had left her English II class topped off, her breakfast nestled comfortably underneath a pile of candy that Sally had been nice enough to let her snack from. Then she'd walked her to the next hall, where her next class <i>and</i> the bake sale were going on. Coincidentally enough, her Economics elective was the same one that Chloe was taking, which meant that this was at least two times a day where she'd have someone to <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">snack with</span>talk to!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, you and me will just loop by there after class lets out.\" Chloe pouted, crossing her thick arms over her bib of billowing breast flesh, \"Ooh, hey, are they giving an SSS discount?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie paused. She hadn't thought to ask for a discount. It stemmed from her not liking to <i>ask</i> for special treatment, given her mother's connections. However, the thought that she could have gotten her cupcake... and the half-dozen cookies she'd wolfed down on the walk to class... made her bristle a bit. Those things were expensive!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... didn't think to ask.\" Carrie made a face, licking her chops for stray frosting, \"This whole SSS thing is still kinda new to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're on SSS too?\" Chloe turned, the desk creaking ominously beneath her as she wrestled against her bulky sides to face her friend, \"No way! You're so skinny!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie immediately swelled at the compliment. Her? Skinny? Nooo!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww!\" Carrie gushed, cheeks rosy red with pride and false modesty, \"We can go see for ourselves after class!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-<i>hem</i>.\" the voice of their instructor interrupted their conversation, \"Is there something that you two would like to <i>share</i> with the rest of the class?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No Ms. Pembsler...\" both girls groaned in unison...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy lunchtime, Carrie wasn't any less full than she was at breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree classes, and all of them explicitly with at least one of her friends. English II with Sally, Economics with Chloe, and History II with Evie. And all of them brought a beaucoup of snacks, junk food, and treats to tide them over until this very moment. Looking at them all, as well as a few of the other members of their friend circle who had this lunch period, you would have thought that they'd all starved themselves before today!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh boy, you're really gonna like the chicken.\" Evie smacked her lips as she placed her cafeteria tray down in front of the server, \"It's so good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Burgers too.\" Chloe mumbled glassy-eyed as she drank in the sight of those sweet buns<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god the macaroni pie is to die for!\" Sally squealed, \"You're gonna love all of it, Carrie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarolina was still a little green around the gills. All the food she'd sucked down all day hadn't magically gone anywhere. Here these girls were, the same girls who she'd spent the day snacking with, ready to pound back even more heavy food like they hadn't eaten since the day before! Everything <i>did</i> smell good, and it wasn't in her nature to say no to anything tasty. But it was starting to feel a little ridiculous...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, they just put out the chocolate silk pie!\" Evie extended a fleshy arm to point, \"Better grab it before\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too late, it's mine!\" Chloe hefted her way through the crowd, \"Come to mama!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarolina Griffith-Johnson had spent her whole life around people who liked to eat. Her whole family, especially her mother and her little sister, had always picked on her for holding back. But in a place like this... how long could she ever hope to hold out?!</span></div></div>",

Try the pink.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way!\u201d Carolina munched on her nuts too, now noticing with pride that her bowl was still half-full. Almost. \u201cI've never worn pink. It doesn't suit me, trust me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust try it. After all, what's a couple extra clicks to you?\u201d Evie grunted, starting the laborious process of getting her obese body upright. Her huge gut, spread around when she laid down, now bunched up in her lap, greatly complicating her movement. She rocked back and forth a couple times before finally dragging herself upright. \u201cUgh. Listen, Carrie, I'm gonna go for ice cream next. Want some too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah, I'm good. I'm not that that big an eater. No, thanks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d Evie turned back in surprise. \u201cYou'll have to go pick it up yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, fine, bring me one too. Cookies and cream. For later. \u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRiiight\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Evie stopped obstructing her view of the widescreen TV, Carolina fumbled around for her remote. She licked stray caramel off it and zoomed in at her virtual avatar. She ordered the Himatsubushi 3-D VR Gaming Rig mostly to please Sally but she found some apps she liked too.<br>\r\nVirtual Fashion Studio was the best one of them, letting her design new clothes from scratch without having to move more than a couple fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seldom used the 3-D goggles, though \u2013 they were so big you couldn't quite snack when you had them on. So she tested the limits of their TV instead. And she had to admit that even there her avatar looked very realistic. Too much in fact \u2013 wide hips, big butt and all. It was based on her measurements as uploaded by Mrs. Banks and reminded Carrie of the one thorn in her paradise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she was holding back! Sure, there were some slip-ups but overall she felt she stayed true to her goal. Like today. It was Sunday and Carrie used her C++ status to order roast lamb and mashed potatoes for lunch to their room. And while Evie went for thirds and fourths, she stopped at seconds and had only one cake. And some cupcakes. And the cashews. And she would eat the ice cream too, soon\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo divert herself from unpleasant thoughts, she lifted the remote and clicked several times. The black gown her digital copy was wearing turned pink. Carrie fiddled with the joystick, making her copy twirl around. Huh, not that bad\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee? What'd I tell you?\u201d Evie was back with two gallons of ice cream and two dining spoons. \u201cPink suits you. Here, take your cookies and cream.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, thanks. Well, yeah, but all pink is too bland. It needs\u2026\u201d she struggled with her ice cream for a moment, in the end balancing the tub in her lap. It was getting a bit small for it but the ice cream nicely cooled her tummy. \u201c\u2026spicing up. Like, maybe, a white vertical stripe?\u201d She opened the tub, stuck the spoon inside and with both hands finally free, she touched the buttons to make it happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGirl, that's<i> good!\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you really think so?\u201d Carrie preened, raising a full spoon of ice cream to her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. Except I would make the neckline lower.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way!\u201d A second spoonful of ice cream found its way to Carrie's mouth, unnoticed. A couple clicks. \u201cIt would look like this.\u201d Another spoonful, then she took the bowl and poured the remaining cashews into the hole she made.<i> I wonder how they might taste together\u2026</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe knock on their door was hard not to hear. \u201cWhat? Is it the guys already? What time is it?\u201d Evie stopped scraping her cake to ask her roommate. She was watching reruns on TV and spread on the couch, she couldn't see over the mound of her gut that Carrie was in a food coma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh,\u201d Carolina blinked a couple times to wake up from her stuffed slumber. She pressed a button on the remote. \u201c2:05. Weren't the girls supposed to come at 3?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, they were. And they're not the sort to come early. It must be someone else.\u201d Another knock was heard, the visitor was getting impatient. \u201cAnd I'm not getting up this time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don't want to\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, I've already gone and brought you the ice cream and the red velvet cake\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, because you wanted them yourself!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's besides the point. Plus I'm older and you're still tiny. <i>And</i> it's most likely that boring RA of yours anyway, coming to chat with you. So lift your skinny butt and let her in. And order some more cakes while you're at it, will you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, all right.\u201d Carolina dealt with the order first, with a couple clicks on her tablet, before hauling herself upright. \u201cComing! Coming!\u201d As she huffed to the door, her chubby cheeks noticeably reddened from the effort, her rounded belly bobbed beneath her blouse. No wonder, the better part of a red velvet cake was only the last on a long list of things she stuffed in it this morning. She could feel her stomach churning as it processed the flood of calories when she opened the door. \u201cUh, hi.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello, mein liebchen.\u201d The round Buttercombe Counselor smiled at her. \u201cMay I have a word with you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, yeah, sure, come in. let's go to my room. Sorry, I was asleep\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, that's all right, dear. I know how beneficial a siesta is and I'm glad you respect the needs of your body.\u201d Helen Schwartz patted her on her arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly when they entered her bedroom, did Carolina notice empty wrappers spread around her bed. \u201cUmm\u2026 please ignore the mess.\u201d Carrie was no slob! She just\u2026 didn't quite master the art of tidying up after herself, she'd always had people for that. \u201cUmm, would you like a snack or something to drink?\u201d And she cursed herself she didn't think of it sooner. Now she would have to trudge all the way back to the kitchen because her bedside storage was empty and waiting for a refill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no, no need! I won't hold you long, dearie, I just came to ask if you are adjusting well to  Academy life?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, sure, Buttercombe is, like, perfect!\u201d Carrie launched into an enthusiastic, if somewhat rambling description of her first weeks at school. \u201cReally, I mean, everything's perfect.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, good to hear that. But still, if there's anything you need, do not hesitate to ask Auntie Helen.\u201d She paused, waiting for a reply. \u201cOr just drop by. You know I'll be happy to see you anytime.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm, thanks, Aunt, I will.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway, I won't hold you up any longer, you must have plenty of schoolwork and friends so enjoy yourself. And drop by! See you.\u201d And the small round woman was gone before Carolina could even stand up from her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, Aunt Helen, bye.\u201d She went back to the living room to see Evie unpacking a fresh stack of cakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe cakes are here! Was that the Head Counselor?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, yeah, she's an old family friend. Mom must've sent her to check up on me. Ugh.\u201d She made a face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere, have another cake, it'll cheer you up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I don't want to get fat\u2026 but I've been holding back, one cake won't hurt me.</i> \u201cThanks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello, mein liebchen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bloated face framed with multiple chins leaned into the camera and frowned. \u201cHi, Helen. Is anything wrong? With Carrie or\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no, no, nothing wrong. Quite the opposite, Dakota. I know you don't want me to put too much pressure on her but I went and checked on her today. After all, she has been with us almost a month so I was interested to see how she was adjusting to Buttercombe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd\u2026\u201d The behemoth stuffed half a donut in her mouth, her cheeks bulging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd everything is going well. Very well indeed. We have found her a suitable roommate and Carrie has become a part of her circle of friends. She is picking up the right habits without any pressure from us. In fact, she has had her uniform resized twice already, frequently orders room service, I am confident she will break 200 soon, she is only three pounds away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2026 How did you manage that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike I said, by handling her with velvet gloves. Carrie does not feel any pressure in Buttercombe. She is free to do whatever she likes \u2013 and her likes play straight into our hand. She is not even aware of it, I just checked. For instance, her uniform pieces were resized under the pretense of replacing off-the-peg product with custom-made clothing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrangely, the mammoth Secretary didn't look happy with that. \u201cHuh, but that means we can expect a backlash as soon as Carrie gets it. You should make sure any diet or exercise is impossible by the time she tries it. I know you've got more than enough tools for it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNein, I would not recommend that. Like I said, best let her think she has everything under control.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 you're the expert. I don't much like it but do whatever you consider best. As long as it doesn't blow in your face. Anyway, gotta go, I have an important\u2026 meeting. Bye! And thanks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, bye.\u201d Dr. Schwartz rubbed her chins in thought. What should she do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Of course she could help her grow, she had done so innumerable times. She could have filled her so full of helpful chemicals that the girl would stuff herself to the brim at every meal and beg for more. But\u2026 wasn't she doing that already on her own?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Helen some browsing on the school camera network to find Carolina on recent footage. There she was, eating her fill at a cafeteria table with her new friends (Helen made a mental note tables needed expanding), going for seconds and thirds and fourths\u2026 Another camera showed her waddling to the class, red in face from the effort, pausing to refuel at every vending machine on the way. Yet another showed her in class, barely paying attention to the teacher as she happily snacked on her friend's stash. And here\u2026 several more clicks of the mouse showed the entrance to Carrie's room and the endless parade of deliveries from school kitchens and sweet shops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn short, Carolina was doing a fine job of expanding her figure already, enabled by the school environment. Was it really necessary to interfere, to have her overeat even more? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thing was that in recent years, Helen Schwartz was becoming a fan of a hands-off approach. It was a lot more challenging to set up the conditions just right and then wait for the test subjects to succumb to gluttony of their own volition. But it also felt so much more satisfying to know that her subjects pumped themselves full of calories of their own free will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, she would wait and see. After all, she could always change her approach if the girl unexpectedly started showing resistance to her new regimen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the subject of dr. Schwartz's deliberation was firmly wedged in her sofa. It felt a little snug since she somehow ended sharing it with Chloe and the girl was <i>huge</i>! There was also the small matter of Carolina's own growing behind but she preferred to ignore it, focusing on her triple cheeseburger instead. Delivered from the Buttercombe kitchens straight to her room at no extra charge, it tasted heavenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was her second but she somehow failed to notice, engrossed in idle chitchat with her roommate and friends. She did notice when Chloe polished off her third burger, making Carrie feel like a paragon of restraint next to her. Still, as talk slowly petered out with everyone getting full and drowsy, she too became gradually aware of growing pressure in her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlinking to to drive back sleep, Carrie licked stray ketchup off her lips. It was hard to pin down why but she was feeling vaguely dissatisfied. Maybe because she had promised herself to resist Buttercombe temptations? She stifled a yawn. \u201cYou know, guys, maybe we ought to do something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike order a couple pizzas? Good idea, Carrie.\u201d Sally completely misinterpreted her suggestion. It looked like her fellow sophomore was making a conscious effort to catch up in size with her older friends. She was always suggesting more food and eating past her limits. Today her greedy gut already slipped out from a too-tight T-shirt and bulged out in all its pale round glory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight, guys. I am getting peckish too.\u201d Chloe's trained appetite was always up to a challenge and she was remarkably quick with her phone when it came to food. A couple swipes later she added: \u201cAnd I just came across a special offer on pizza rolls today. Buy a dozen, get a dozen free. Wanna me to order? My treat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow! Go for it, girl.\u201d \u201cYeah, right!\u201d \u201cA dozen for me too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, there are seven of us so\u2026 seven dozen pizza rolls, times two, here they come.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, actually, I meant\u2026\u201d Carrie struggled to express her vague feelings. What 'something' did she have in mind? Certainly not walking or exercise, the girls would just laugh at her and she was no fan of that herself. But more eating did not look like the answer to her problems. She made a sweeping gesture at all the burger wrappers spread around to express what she could not put into words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince her intentions weren't clear even to her, no wonder she was misunderstood. Chloe nodded, highlighting all her chins. \u201cYeah, it needs some dessert too. Since you've been such a great host to us all today, Carrie, I'll add on some of those cheesecakes you love so much. There! Done.\u201d Smiling cheerfully, she raised her hand to high-five Carrie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hard to resist the girl's enthusiasm. Carrie smiled too and high-fived her. \u201cThat's nice of you, thanks, Chloe.\u201d Truth be told, she was looking forward to that cheesecake or two. And maybe some pizza rolls too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day was a vague blur for Carrie. Eventually even the biggest eaters stuffed themselves into a stupor and they spent most of the afternoon napping together until their appetites stirred again. And then they repeated their feast. When Penny the RA sent the other engorged girls back to their dorms late in the evening, they could barely waddle out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarolina never thought again about her dissatisfaction until she was brushing her teeth before bed. As she looked into the mirror she noticed her cheeks were looking puffy. Was it a trick of the light or was her face really getting rounder?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlarmed, she took out her phone and swiped to find a good photo from the time of her arrival at Buttercombe. Putting it next to her reflection in the mirror she really looked bigger today but she just had a big dinner, right? Were those hips looking wider too?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Carolina carefully compared herself in the mirror with the old photo. She did <i>look</i> rounder but the lighting in her Buttercombe bathroom was so much sharper, adding more and deeper shadows, making her <i>seem</i> rounder. Yeah, that had to be it. It had to be just a trick of the light, no need to be alarmed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor now. There was always the possibility that her new eating habits might lead to gaining weight. On impulse, Carrie snapped a photo of her reflection and vowed to do so every Sunday so she could compare. And do something about it, if it turned out she was really getting fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut for now she could carry on eating. Happy with her conclusion, she stopped worrying about her size, switched off the lights and went to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following days reinforced Carolina's belief that she was keeping back. All she needed was one look at her new friends, spilling out of their uniforms as they filled their bellies with ever-greater feasts, to feel like a model of restraint. <i>Her</i> uniform fit perfectly. Yes, she'd had to visit Mrs. Banks again for another refit but it wasn't her fault that the Fashion and Design teacher goofed up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn short, Carolina felt good. She ate as long as food was in front of her, and at Buttercombe that was always the case. She ate until her stomach would stretch to new limits during massive binge sessions she had partaken in, until she groaned and moaned that she couldn't swallow another bite. But that did not deter her from picking up the fork again as soon as she found some more room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she ever thought about it, she wouldn't find a single memory from her first weeks in Buttercombe  where she wasn't eating. Carolina spent plenty of time in the cafeteria, she ate in the class, she munched while chatting with her friends or when watching movies. She binged whenever she was bored. There wasn't a second in the day that she didn't have something delicious in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspecially while studying. After her laziness peaked in her first month at school, Dr. Schwartz warned her in another friendly chat that her grades were slipping and she needed to do something about it or her mother might take her home. Carrie didn't know this was an idle threat. Since she enjoyed Buttercombe far more than Forsythe, her previous school (and she certainly didn't want to go home to her annoyingly perfect little sister), she set about to remedy it. While she seldom used it, she inherited Dakota's drive and determination and now she thrust all her efforts into improving her grades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't want school to cut into her socializing, though, so she started studying late at night. While Evie lay groaning in the next room, unable to sleep after another excessive feast, Carrie would switch on her laptop and pour over her textbooks, pouring a steady stream of chocolates into her mouth. Yes, her stomach would protest but Carolina wouldn't hear it, her attention fully focused elsewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis dedication to her studies soon brought fruit. Even before October was over, she was well on her way to the honor roll\u2026 and she had to arrange another meeting with Mrs. Banks as her uniform stopped fitting again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFitting was becoming a problem not just for her, though.<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><br>\r\n***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, can't you move over a bit, Chlo? I can't fit in there!\u201d Sally got held up at the service station and came to their table late because she (again) overloaded her lunch tray so badly she could barely lift it. Now she was balancing it precariously above Carolina's head as she tried to squeeze into the tiny space left around the last seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can't!\u201d Their biggest friend wiggled on her chair, making it creak, as she tried to scoot to the right a bit. Her huge hips were overflowing it on both sides, touching another girl's thighs. \u201cSee? Lizzy's in the way!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm not! You're too big!\u201d But Lizzie was no twiggy herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Carolina shifted to the left, worried she could get a food shower if Sally let go of her tray. But she couldn't move far either; an inch or two and then she hit a flabby wall named Evie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis sucks!\u201d Sally gave up and collapsed on a chair by the next table, luckily it was empty. She quivered from the effort, her prominent belly pushing up the white blouse as it spread on her thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, it does,\u201d Chloe paused eating to add: \u201cY'know, I think we'll have to split tables. It's supposed to seat six but\u2026\u201d she gestured at their bulging figures, bursting out of ill-fitting uniforms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie looked around the cafeteria and saw similar issues repeated elsewhere. Its furniture was clearly inadequate for the growing Buttercombe population. \u201cYou're right. You know what, guys? I think I'll visit Aunt He\u2013 I mean, Dr. Schwartz. Something should be done about this, the tables are too small.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you? That's awesome!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick check on her tablet found a free slot in the Head Counselor's timetable that very afternoon and so a couple hours later Carolina outlined their issue to her Mom's friend. She used to be wary of Aunt Helen but her incessant friendliness, helpfulness and good humour made Carrie trust her implicitly. \u201c\u2026 so as you can see, the tables are simply too small \u2013 and the chairs too. Something should be done about it. I know it's not your responsibility, Auntie, but I don't know who else to ask.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe portly woman nodded her head and patted Carrie's hand. \u201cAch, ja. You did well to come here, my dear. I wonder how the management could have overlooked such an important issue. Here, have a cupcake.\u201d And she pushed the bowl closer. \u201cI will make sure something is done about it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks!\u201d Carolina grabbed two for good measure. \u201cAnd while they're at it, maybe add some kind of automation too? Self service is so last century. Serverbots like in better restaurants would be nice\u2026 they're Yeng-made anyway, aren't they?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can see you have given it a lot of thought, mein liebchen. I cannot promise you serverbots but larger tables and better chairs should not be an issue. I shall speak with Dr. Hinamizawa right away. Is there anything else you would like me help with?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm, no?\u201d Carrie stuffed the other cupcake into her mouth whole and grunted as she stood up. \u201cThankth,\u201d she mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGut, gut. Come again whenever you feel like it. And take some more cupcakes for the road.\u201d Dr. Schwartz watched with barely hidden glee how her most prominent charge perked up as she loaded on more calories to go. When she turned to leave, Helen could admire her most prominent feature, the ever-growing behind. She called up Carolina's vitals on her screen and nearly whistled. Her growth even accelerated in the second month, yet the girl seemed oblivious that she had eaten herself into new dimensions. Helen's strategy seemed to be paying off. \u201cOh, and Carrie? Do call your mother again. She yearns to speak with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh\u2026 I will. Bye.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A couple days after her visit to Dr. Schwartz, Carolina was reclining on her sofa, chatting with Evie and eating fresh pastries. It was another typical lazy afternoon at their dorm and now, as they had all but exhausted conversation topics, she was slowly drifting to sleep until she heard: \u201cSo\u2026 Had any ideas yet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIdeas?\u201d Carrie wasn't sure what her immense roommate, stretched on her own sofa, was talking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor the Halloween party and scavenger hunt.\u201d Evie grunted as she shifted her body to see Carrie over the crest of her belly bulge. \u201cI mean, Halloween's this week, right? So what costume are you going to pick?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026 this week already? I completely forgot.\u201d As Carolina thought about it, she reflexively reached for another morsel. Eating was becoming just as common as breathing for the growing girl. \u201cHuh, actually, I'm not sure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, high time you come up with something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, see, I'm not even sure what kind of things I've got here, y'know?\u201d As much as Carrie hated to admit it, since her arrival she hadn't worn anything but the school uniform or stretch sweatpants. She hadn't seen most of her wardrobe since her Mom's driver unpacked it and it was packed by her maids. \u201cMaybe I should have a look, see what I could use.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah! Good idea, girl! Let's make a fashion show out of it!\u201d Evie grunted as she stretched to get her last pastry. \u201cAnd maybe order some cupcakes first?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, I'm not so sure\u2026\u201d frankly, the smaller girl felt too stuffed and moving (whether to show off her dresses or simply to order more food) was the last thing on her mind right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on! All right, let's make it something salty if you insist. What tickles your fancy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarolina was surprised to see that her tray was empty too. \u201cOK, how about those mozzarella sticks? I think I saw a special offer on them\u2026 yeah, here it is. Interested?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor sure. That SSS is a wonderful program, eh?\u201d and Evie groped her gut, as if measuring how far she had to go before she became eligible too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDefinitely. And some Yeng Cola to go with it. There.\u201d Carrie made the last click, rocked herself upright and lumbered to her room to inspect her wardrobe. A while later, a surprised exclamation could be heard. \u201cUgh! Come on, Mom! You can't be serious! Why'd you tell them to pack this? You know I'd never wear it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d Evie shouted, not willing to get up. \u201cShow me, girl!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou'll gag,\u201d Carrie warned her before showing up with a fairly elegant, long red dress. She leaned on the doorframe and the cloth cascade down her curves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy? It looks good. Try it on!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh\u2026 It doesn't look as bad as I remember it,\u201d admitted Carrie. \u201cBut I'm warning you, it's going to hang off me. Mom keeps ordering me clothes two-three sizes too big, hoping I'll fatten up into them.\u201d With that she retreated into her room again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA series of grunts followed. She wanted to get out of her sweatpants first, stretched uncomfortably tight over her growing behind. And when she was done with that, the red dress was nowhere as roomy as Carrie'd recalled either. It pinched her waist too much and her hips fit in only because they stretched the cloth, smoothing out its folds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she ignored that feeling now, focused on how she looked. As she posed in front of the full-length mirror built in the wardrobe, she was astonished how well she looked in it now that it fit. Even the cleavage, her old sore point, was suddenly looking so much fuller. And when she emerged in the common room again, her roommate confirmed her feelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWooow! Carriekins, you're looking good! And seriously intimidating! All you're missing is a crown and you could be the Red Queen.\u201d Evie gushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way! That's so\u2026 so nerdy. But maybe I could use some white makeup and false fangs, what do you think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA vampire? Nuuh, that's been done to death\u2026 but if you insist. Or maybe you could be a vampire queen?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh, we'll see. And what about you, Evie, what're you going to be?\u201d Carrie was interrupted by their bell ringing. \u201cOh, the sticks are here.\u201d<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><br>\r\n***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalloween came with some strange news. The day before, when they were told their cafeteria would be closed all day until 5 p.m., pampered Buttercombe students nearly rebelled before Ms. Fukuda assured them they could order to their rooms all day, as much as they liked with no additional charge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone partook of this offer as much as they could and as they trudged to the cafeteria for the grand opening at 5 p.m., you could hear groans and moans from most of the overstuffed students as they waddled towards yet another meal. Carrie and Evie were no different and while her roommate the Arabian belly dancer enjoyed the advantage of a bared belly, the Vampire Queen had no such luxury. She groaned. The constricting cloth hurt her full tummy and yet she was feeling hungry again \u2013 or at least peckish. She trudged forward, hoping the trial would be over soon and she could sit down again (and eat).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhead of them, standing on a raised dais, Fukuda Hinamizawa watched the waddling throng with satisfaction. She coughed twice and reached for speaker phone. \u201cDear students, let me welcome you all to our annual Halloween celebration! But first let me say a few words.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ignored the muffled groans and went on: \u201cYou will be pleased to hear that we have listened to your numerous pleas and when you enter, you will find your cafeteria reborn, transformed to better cater to all your needs. You can enjoy new, sturdier, armless chairs as well as bigger, wider tables. And that is not all! You may recall we promised you a scavenger hunt. Well, we delivered! The new tables and chairs are still wrapped up and each piece of furniture has some kind of a prize inside. So hurry up, unpack as much as you can and don't tear up your prizes! There are vouchers for all kinds of goods and services, you may find unlimited access to our kitchens or even access to higher tiers of the SSS for the lucky few\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the statuesque Japanese wanted to go on, the assembled students did not let her. As soon as she mentioned the SSS, a deafening roar filled the hallway and the crowd surged forward to the cafeteria doors. Fukuda barely had time to stand aside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls went with the flow, Evie as eager as anyone to win the SSS and Carrie unable to resist the stampede. Once inside, they both instinctively headed to where their table used to stand. However, their movement soon slowed down as they had to get around their round schoolmates who were tearing the cardboard off their chairs. Larger tables meant less space to walk and although the designers tried to compensate for it by stretching the dining area all the way from the serving counters to the entrance, there was simply not enough room for all the plumpers who poured inside all at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarolina was pushed and pulled, jostled around and almost knocked down. She bent over, catching her balance at the last moment by grabbing a still-wrapped chair ahead of her. And as her belly squeezed against the confining dress, she heard an ominous ripping sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe froze. Her fingers probed the gap which suddenly appeared on her left side. Luckily nobody seemed to notice so far but it was bad. Three or four inches of the seam around her waist were gone, her tender flesh in plain sight for everyone who would happen to look there. What could Carrie do now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Some other time, Carolina may have turned back. Two months ago, she probably would have. In her time at Buttercombe, though, she had seen enough wardrobe malfunctions to become a little blas\u00e9 about them. Besides, there were benefits to be reaped here! Caught in rush, she went on the treasure hunt as if nothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was still grabbing the chair that stopped her fall. Now she started tearing off the wrappers, hoping to find something good. It was surprisingly hard; Carrie had never exercised her muscles much and since her arrival the most strenuous activity for her biceps was carrying an overloaded food tray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she persevered and soon enough she managed to tear off the first flap. Then a second one and when she slid the back out she caught a glimpse of white amid the brown cardboard bits. What was it? She snatched it and turned the voucher eagerly over to read: <b>50% discount at all vending machines until end of semester</b>. Huh. Not bad except her Mum kept her credit topped up. On the contrary, she might get angry if Carrie's monthly bill suddenly halved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment something soft bumped into her, almost causing her to lose balance again. \u201cLook what I got!\u201d Evie waved another strip of paper, almost jumping with joy despite her size. Her huge gut jostled from side to side as she did her little celebratory dance, pushing Carolina further away. \u201cUnlimited uniform alterations and-or replacements! I really, really needed that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, good for you,\u201d Carrie couldn't quite appreciate this perk given she'd enjoyed it since her arrival but she tried to fake her cheer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily Evie noticed nothing, too engrossed in the hunt. \u201cOK, now let's get another\u2026 chair?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs both roommates looked around, it appeared all chairs \u2013 at least in their vicinity \u2013 had already been stripped bare of their wrappers and other students, quicker on their feet, had moved on. Then Carolina had an idea. \u201cHey, Evie, Fukuda said every piece of furniture\u2026\u201d and she gestured at the table in front of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight!\u201d and they both started tearing cardboard off the top. Soon enough, another white paper appeared and both Evie and Carrie reached for it, almost tearing it apart. Evie was more persistent, winning the reward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, it was my idea!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but I saw it first. And\u2026\u201d when she finally looked at the paper, Evie burst out laughing. \u201cAnd\u2026 all right! Just look at it! Why fight?\u201d and she threw it back so Carrie could read what it guaranteed: <b>Table service for you and all your table mates until the end of this school year.</b> \u201cAren't we lucky, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, really lucky.\u201d Carolina tried hard not to think it may have been rigged. After all, she had asked Auntie Helen for serverbots and this table was placed exactly where they used to sit... \u201cUh, should we search on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, well, no.\u201d Evie tested her new, much wider chair and happily sighed as her legs were relieved of the burden of hauling her body around. \u201cOne, I'm too tired and two, everything's been unwrapped anyway, see?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm, well, maybe not everything\u2026\u201d Carolina was just getting into the spirit. \u201cMaybe there's something else special that we've overlooked?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir debate was interrupted with Fukuda's voice that boomed throughout the cafeteria with the help of loudspeakers. \u201cPlease, everyone, take a seat. And watch out for the empty wrappers, girls.\u201d The Vice Principal paused for a moment. \u201cWhen you are seated, all students please register your prizes by running your tablet over the code bottom right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment of confusion followed as people searched for their friends, for free chairs, there may have even been a scuffle or two over a prize. Carrie and Evie lucked out as it were. They could claim their vouchers in relative peace and quiet and then wait. In due time, Chloe, Sally and the rest of the gang gravitated to their table too, huffing and red in face, too out of breath to even boast about their prizes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarolina used the free time to have a good look at their new table. It was a wide, broad oval with semicircular cutouts, big enough even for Chloe's gut to fit in. Conveniently, it also allowed up to half a dozen plates to be placed within arm's reach, or three full trays. And there were eight of these bays while there were only six of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was not the only one to notice. Trisha, the dark-skinned, bottom-heavy friend of Evie's, asked: \u201cUh, guys, could I invite my roomie to sit with us?\u201d And after a series of noncommittal grunts, she shouted at the top of her voice: \u201cHey! Abby! Come'ere! We've got a place for you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl who dragged her chair to them in response was notable for being almost slim, though the tightness of her elven ranger outfit revealed she'd already succumbed to the Freshman Fifteen (perhaps even Thirty). She looked around the table from one plumper to another, nervously curling up her black hair. \u201cUmm, hi, I'm Abby. Abigail Hearns?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, why so formal? You're a freshman, right? Don't worry, we won't eat you, Abby. Any friend of Trisha's is welcome here. Come, sit with us.\u201d And Chloe introduced her to everyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they started chatting, a mob of caretakers swarmed the cafeteria, picking up the torn pieces of packaging and tidying up the place. And while they were at it, a trio of older women showed up at their table. \u201cCan we take your orders, please?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOrders?\u201d \u201cWhat orders?\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, right! You're those servers, aren't you?\u201d Evie beamed as she turned to her friends. \u201cJust imagine, girls, we won table service for the whole year! Aren't you glad you joined us, Abby?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new girl just nervously smiled while everyone else went overboard with their orders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone except Carrie. She fingered the tear in her flanks, thinking furiously. Luckily, nobody spotted it yet but it was a clear warning sign. Yes, she wanted to eat, she <i>needed</i> to eat, her stomach was crying for sustenance. But when she burst her dress on empty stomach, what might happen if she overate? And she <i>should</i> curb her eating. This was a slippery slope\u2026 with the spectre of her 'little' sister Ginny looming at the bottom. What to do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a slippery slope indeed but when the server asked what she would like, Carrie started ordering and didn't think twice. Her short time at Buttercombe had already ingrained in her that the only correct response to offered food was: eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile the microphone was picked up by Mrs. Banks, the Fashion and Design teacher. \u201cAnd now, students, while you are queuing for your dinner, have a good look at costumes of your peers.\u201d All seven girls at the table shared a sigh of relief they were spared the ordeal; today's queue looked especially vicious. \u201cAnd if you see one you really like, don't hesitate to nominate it to our Best Halloween Costume Contest. You'll all find it on your tablets, you can add descriptions, photos, whatever you like. And don't forget the costume owner's name! The grand prize is another top-tier SSS berth for the lucky winner!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, d'you know what that means?\u201d Lizzie sighed and tugged at her beauty queen sash that slipped in between her boobs. Then she pushed up her coronet. \u201cWe can't win because nobody will see our wonderful costumes. That's so unfair.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you rather, like, stand in that shove-fest for eternity when you can wait for your food in the comfort of your new chair?\u201d asked Sally. \u201cBesides, what's keeping you from taking your own photo and uploading it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I know, I know. But still, it isn't fair.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThose girls over there could claim it's not fair they don't have personal servers,\u201d commented Evie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd we're getting preferential treatment too, girls. They're already carrying our order on that cart, see?\u201d As Chloe pointed, her bingo wing jiggled. \u201cOh no, they're turning the wrong way!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, someone else must've won this prize too,\u201d Carolina deduced. \u201cBut look, the second cart is coming our way! We can finally eat!\u201d And she made the whole table laugh when her stomach chose to highlight her declaration with an ominous growl. When the servers handed over their first course, she dug in as eagerly as her friends, her worries over weight forgotten; at least for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch later, Carolina swallowed the last bite of her tiramisu, scooted back on her chair and stifled a burp, her stomach distended from an almost endless dinner. She could feel a draft on her side as the tear grew ever bigger. But she wouldn\u2019t let it bother her, opting instead to take a sip of hot chocolate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the faculty table, Mrs. Banks picked up the microphone again, looking a little red in her face. \u201cI hope you liked the Halloween feast, dear students. I know I certainly did,\u201d she paused to stifle a burp. \u201cThe nominations for the best costume contest are now officially closed and you may begin voting for your favorites.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie did not bother, afraid if she bent down to retrieve her tablet, her belly might split her dress entirely apart. Instead she just sat motionless, taking shallow breaths since the mass of food in her stomach pressed on her lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe noticed that plenty of other girls did did not care either, too stuffed or lazy to care about any contest. But others took it up with glee. Abby, who spent the last half-hour dying of boredom since she couldn't eat a single bite, now enlivened the sleepy atmosphere at their table with a running commentary on the weirdest and most awkward creations she could find.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple minutes later (after another order of desserts by the hungriest girls at the table, Chloe, Evie and Sally) Mrs. Banks took the microphone again: \u201cWithout further ado, let's get to the point you've all been waiting for! The grand prize of SSS goes to\u2026 Saturn, a creation by Camela Mencia! Come forward, please, Camela, to receive your reward.\u201d When the girl finally stood up with the help of her peers, applause was replaced with a wave of chuckles, some laughed out loud. The round girl really resembled a planet, nearly as wide as she was tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the faculty table a hushed debate ensued that Mrs. Banks bent down to follow, unsure what was going on. \u201cErr\u2026 but now it has been pointed out that Ms. Mencia already is on the SSS, actually, uh, so\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the poor teacher stood there, unsure what to say, Fukuda Hinamizawa snatched her mike. \u201cSo she will instead have the use of all vending machines <i>and</i> the room service for free until the end of her studies at Buttercombe!\u201d She waited for cheers to subside before rushing out: \u201cAnd a new SSS beneficiary shall be determined from the contest front-runners by a teachers' committee led by our resident fashion expert, Mrs. Elmira Banks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother bout of hushed discussion later, Mrs. Banks announced, \u201cSo, uh, the teachers' committee picked Gina Lollobrigida a.k.a Hunter Black! Ms. Black, please come here.\u201d This time, the applause was rather subdued. The evening gown looked really good but admiration was tempered with envy as the skinny freshman to take the coveted prize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe name sounded familiar to Carrie. \u201cWho's Hunter Black? Does anyone know her?\u201d she turned to her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all shrugged, only Abby the freshman predictably nodded. \u201cYeah, well, we've got Fashion and Design together and she's good, works hard\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh! A teacher's pet!\u201d exclaimed Evie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat explains it all. Anyway, I'm getting a little peckish again,\u201d added Lizzie. \u201cAnyone else for ordering another round of cakes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, sure.\u201d \u201cMe too.\u201d \u201cOne for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie didn't ask for one but since everyone else did, the servers brought her a cake too. And what could she do when it landed right in front of her? She went on eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral hours later and several desserts heavier, Carolina shuffled back to her room, wishing she had a cart to carry her weight. The tear in her dress was growing with every swing of her overstuffed belly but she was past caring about that. Now she was in grave danger of bursting. She trudged on, slowly and carefully, both supporting and being supported by Evie who was in very much the same state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly a\u2026 couple more\u2026 steps\u2026\u201d Huff.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The great Halloween feast was over. Carrie bade Evie good night and waddled to her room, tearing off her red dress even before she closed the door behind her. Then she dropped down on her bed just in her bra and panties, fighting off a food coma. She should\u2026 go and wash her face\u2026 brush her teeth\u2026 but she couldn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGradually her clouded mind became aware there was something wrong. <i>Since when is my belly so big it forces my legs apart to sit comfortably? I am full, sure, painfully so, but still\u2026</i> She turned to her wardrobe (she left it open when she'd run away to the feast) and had a good look at herself in its full-length mirror. She gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fatty that looked back bore only a distant resemblance to what Carrie'd been used to see. All her features were swollen, her face had chipmunk cheeks and a clearly defined second chin, her arms inflated, losing all definition, even her chest grew a little, now resting on the monstrously bloated belly that filled nearly half of her lap. Her biggest feature was luckily out of sight but given how far her hips spread, her bottom must have grown too. And her thighs, oh God! She had to have put on at least forty pounds since starting her studies, maybe even fifty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, back home she'd still be called slim and even among her friends here at Buttercombe she was still on the smaller side. But for how much longer? <i>Fifty pounds in two months!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaced with the naked truth, Carolina did what she'd learned to do whenever faced with adversity. She opened her bedside table drawer and took out a Yeng Bar from her emergency stash. And another one\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed like a good plan until she her hand scraped the bottom of the drawer. Then she suddenly felt she had only made things worse. Bloated and fuller than she ever had been in her life, the poor girl collapsed in the bed, closed her eyes and groaned. As her hands gently caressed the mound of her belly, she felt like a whale trapped in her own blubber on the coast of her bed. There was no way she\u2019d be able to get up now, much less make the hike to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarolina had a bad night. Her stomach woke her up whenever she put the slightest pressure on it, so she kept tossing and turning nearly all night. Only when it processed enough calories to subside a little, she could finally enjoy some uninterrupted sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot for long though. Soon after her senses registered distant thuds. What was it, an earthquake? Then someone seized her arm and shook her awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCarrie! Wake up! It's breakfast time!\u201d It was Evie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLemme sleep\u2026 'm tired\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAren't you hungry?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNoo\u2026\u201d except just as she said it, Carrie felt she was hungry. Impossibly hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it's your missed meal, not mine,\u201d Evie chuckled. \u201cI'm going, with or without you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, OK, just a minute, I need to get dressed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer uniform felt a little tight, which was weird. After all, she'd had her adjusted less than two weeks ago. The skirt was not that bad, although it hiked up a little higher than she remembered. But her white blouse was seriously constricting her tummy. Then Carrie's thoughts flew back to last night. <i>Oh God, I must've been blind. All those refittings and adjustments \u2013 that wasn't Mrs. Banks doing a bad job, that was me getting fatter.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now there was no time to dwell on it, Evie was waiting. She dragged her blouse down to properly cover jiggling tyres of her belly and hurried away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were servers at their table again, waiting for their orders. As she chatted with her friends, Carolina's weighty woes were forgotten for the moment. Just like everyone else, she went a little overboard, knowing she wouldn't be the one carrying it all. And then she had seconds, just like everyone else. And third, like Evie and Chloe and Sally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly when Chloe almost coaxed her into fourths, did Carrie wake up from her gluttonous haze. A feeling of light breeze on her tummy made her look down. It pushed out from her blouse, its pressure forcing two midriff buttons to open. Her full stomach expanded, filling out the space between her rolls and turning them into a single taut dome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she watched her pale belly, the brunette was feeling fatter than ever. Fatter and maybe a little tired of her rebellion against Mother. Frankly, she couldn't even remember anymore why she'd started it all those years ago. Wasn't it a little childish of her to refuse all the good things in life just because her mother was pushing them on her? Perhaps this was a sign she should give it up and enjoy all her perks to the fullest?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If she strained her ears, she could hear Evie snoring happily away. That girl had an iron stomach but Carrie had no such luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept was it really just luck? Didn't Evie offer her some stuff from the bathroom cabinet a couple weeks ago? She stood up and rummaged in there, finding a half-full bottle of a bluish liquid: Yeng Stomach Aid; Extra Strength. Carrie took a good swig, hoping it would kick in soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe trudged back to her room and sat down on her bed, gingerly feeling out her stomach. There was a lot of it to feel out. Her growing rump was still Carrie's defining feature, likely it would always be, but her midsection was doing all it could to catch up. Her rolls were growing together, slowly merging into a single keg-like protuberance reaching from her bust to her crotch. Sitting down, it filled an ever larger part of her lap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed<i>. I overate again, despite all the promises to myself I won't let Mom dictate what and how much I eat.</i> This was the old argument. But now, in a lucid moment, she took it a step further. <i>On the other hand if I refuse to eat just because Mom might want it, then in fact I AM letting her dictate my diet anyway. So if I want to completely ignore her I should eat whatever I want whenever I want it.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarolina's epiphany came at the best possible moment. Her stomach gurgled again but this time it was a happy gurgle, announcing it was ready to digest. Despite the recent painful reminder where her gluttony led, she was feeling peckish once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout even thinking about it she took her tablet from the nightstand. <i>Nobody's going to serve you at this hour,</i> she chided herself while her fingers deftly opened the Room Service tab.<i> Nobody\u2026</i> But the app was still active, although there were remarkably few goodies left on offer \u2013 eager Buttercombe eaters probably decimated it overnight. Those pizza rolls did look enticing though and it was amazing that someone was ready to serve the whims of her appetite even at 4 in the morning (or perhaps ominous but Carrie preferred not to think along those lines). Her fingers placed an order for a dozen pizza rolls before she realised what she was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Are you sure you want to eat that, girl? Not that long ago you complained about feeling sick and now</i>\u2026 She almost cancelled it, almost. But the display changed too quickly for that, announcing<b> Order confirmed, delivery within 10 minutes.</b> This made her stand up. She didn't want the delivery boy to wake up Evie so she shuffled outside to wait in the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was there, she was drawn to the huge vending machine. She eyed the many snacks in the machine's window, salivating. She could almost hear them speaking to her.<i> Eat us, Carrie!</i> It was all too easy to use her bracelet and unwrap a tasty treat. And another one\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took three more bars before hum of the elevator finally announced her delivery. She eagerly rushed back to her bed, unwrapped the paper bag and started munching. It felt good, perfect even, so much better now that Carolina felt like sticking it up to her mother. Empowerment through eating, this was going to become her favorite way of rebelling against her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidmorning found her spread on her bed with a contented smile, sleeping off the effects of her latest binge.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was strewn with corpses of their enemies \u2013 empty plates and wrappers that the servers couldn't keep up with carrying away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer allies didn't look much better, though. Abby, the little Freshman girl, had tried to stop eating an hour ago and constant prompts to have a taste put her in a food coma not long after that. Lizzie and Trisha, Sally and Evie had far better training but they too dropped out and dozed off as the evening went on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut not Carrie. She had the genes for it and now that she no longer held back, she discovered an appetite so voracious it surprised everyone present, her included. Her capacity was improving in leaps and bounds and today she was evenly matched with far bigger eaters \u2013 like Chloe who just licked her last plate clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing her look, the SSS behemoth leaned over to her to whisper: \u201cFinally full, eh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was full five or six plates ago. Not sure why I keep going.\u201d Though that wasn't quite true. Carrie did what her family friend Hannah Hammond had told her many years ago:<i> \u201cYou know the stomach is a muscle just like any other, sweetie. You have to give it challenging workouts it if you want to use it effectively. And it's important to stretch it as much as you can.\u201d</i> So she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie noted a hint of triumph in her friend's voice.  \u201cBuut\u2026 if you give me a sec, Chlo-Chlo, we can go on eating.\u201d She unbuttoned her white blouse and slid the hem of her brown skirt below the overstuffed orb, letting it hang out in all its glory. Then she waved. \u201cHey, server! Bring us another batch of cheesecakes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman had a look at their bulging guts, shook her head and went for their next order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf students stayed in the cafeteria until closing time and were unable to leave, they were transported to their dorms in carts by helpful attendants. Buttercombe Academy never advertised it to avoid students abusing the service but once Carolina found out about it, she regularly did just that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow she watched the door to her room approach over the pink dome of her belly and almost \u2013 almost \u2013 regretted it. Had she not known about the carts, she would have never had her latest binge go so far. When she caressed it, her stomach could be clearly felt beneath all the fat tissue, tight as a drum. She had never overeaten so much and now she felt every bump, every seam in the floor. Even breathing hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd doorsteps were much, much worse. As the attendant drove her into her room, Carrie swallowed hard to keep the contents of her stomach down, then she tried her voice. \u201cHey, you\u2026 can you\u2026 bring me\u2026  Yeng Stomach Aid\u2026 from the bathroom\u2026 cabinet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, there was a third ingredient to her success. Her genes and determination would mean far less, were it not for the miraculous Yeng cure to every stomach ache.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks.\u201d As she swallowed the bluish medicine, Carrie was already planning her midnight snack. Her bedroom cabinet was half-empty. Did Evie leave some uneaten ice cream in the fridge or not? Perhaps she should use room service again? Oh well. Plenty of time to decide. First she must digest a little and roll over to her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was leaving her class the next day, all Carrie could think about was lunch. Not that she would starve herself during lessons, far from it. But she had English with Sally and the girl spent the last hour chatting about today's menu. No wonder they were both salivating in advance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd no wonder she was annoyed when Ms. Porter stopped her. \u201cCarrie?\u201d the humongous teacher called just as she was to leave the room. \u201cCould you\u2026 come back for a minute?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, yeah?\u201d she stepped aside to let others through, looking at her friend. Sally gestured to the cafeteria and was gone, waddling remarkably fast for her size. Carrie wasn't offended, she knew that for Sally anyone came a distant second to eating. \u201cYeah, what's wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Vice Principal would like to speak with you ASAP.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie gulped. \u201cUmm, and\u2026 why? I didn't do anything wrong!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don't know anything else, Carrie, why don't you go and ask her yourself? Right now?\u201d And the teacher started her cart, signalling the discussion was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo poor Carolina trudged for a good while along the corridors on an (almost) empty stomach, hungry and tired. At least she was allowed to use the lift! And from there it was only a couple steps on the top floor to the door marked <b>Vice Principal.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knocked and entered. \u201cUh, hello, Dr. Hinamizawa? You wanted to speak with me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello, my dear. I did indeed, come in. I am so very happy to see you are coming along nicely.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie just shrugged and grabbed a donut, mumbling something unintelligible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, you are probably wondering why I asked you to come. Well, it concerns\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cYou are probably wondering why I asked you to come. It concerns your mother, Dakota Griffith-Johnson.\u201d The formidable Vice Principal, Dr. Fukuda Hinamizawa leaned back in her chair and frowned. \u201cSpecifically, she called me yesterday to request your presence at your family Thanksgiving dinner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarolina frowned too. She wanted to do more, to scream and swear, though she didn't dare. Did her overbearing Mom interfere with her life<i> again</i>? Then she recalled a tidbit she overheard from Evie. \u201cBut you don't let students leave the Academy for shorter holidays, right? A friend mentioned it recently.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh, you spotted my problem. You are correct that we normally do not let students leave whenever their parents request it. However, yours is a special case, given your family ties with our partner-sponsor. Therefore I would like to ask what is your personal position on the issue.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie had to juggle the sentence around in her head a couple times before she understood it. \u201cWell, actually, I've been looking forward to spending Thanksgiving here with my friends.\u201d Evie had also mentioned what Thanksgiving dinners looked like at Buttercombe and she was looking to the feast as much as avoiding her mother. Although avoiding that constant tug of war with her Mom would be a welcome bonus. \u201cSo I'd much rather stay here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she said that, she expected Fukuda to welcome her rejection. To her surprise, the aloof Oriental sighed again. \u201cOh, do have another donut, my dear. You see, as your mother pointed out, your presence there might draw favourable attention of high-placed dignitaries to our school. It might\u2026 smooth out certain past misunderstandings between us and the establishment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo I have to be there?\u201d feeling stressed out, she inhaled the donut in a couple huge bites and took yet another. \u201cI mean, with my Mom?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, well, I am somewhat aware of your differences. I am not forcing you into anything but consider the following, please. In my experience, if you do someone a favor, you are far better placed for any future negotiations. And in this case you would be owed favors from both your mother and me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, true\u2026\u201d Was this how her Mom thought all the time? It took some adjusting but she was beginning to like the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe other argument in favor of going is that it is always better to face the issues head on. As you know, Fortune favors the bold. And who knows? Maybe you will find some common ground with her. So what do you say?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I don't really know.\u201d Carrie wasn't just playing for time. She was genuinely torn between her old distaste and new desire to move on, to grow out of her childhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFukuda could see that. \u201cAh. In that case I am officially asking you to spread the good name of the Buttercombe Academy.\u201d She tried a warm smile, perhaps she was taking some lessons from Dr. Schwartz? \u201cI have known Dakota Johnson since she was only a little older than you are today and you show the same promise. If you help me \u2013 us \u2013 you have my word that I shall assist you on your journey just like I helped your mother. At the Academy to begin with. Does it sound good?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all fine and dandy but Carrie noticed she was promising vague future benefits in exchange for immediate consent. On the other hand, she wouldn't want to have the Vice Principal as her enemy. What should she do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Carrie decided to test Fukuda's promises right away. The evening before departure she threw a party for her new friends. Strictly speaking it wasn't quite allowed but she was not risking much. It was a fairly quiet affair like she expected. She'd ordered heaps of food on her Mom's card \u2013 pizzas, burgers, fries, pies, cakes, plenty of snacks and sweets \u2013 and everyone was too busy chewing to make much noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she watched the six girls of varying girth enjoy themselves, Carolina couldn't help thinking what a stroke of luck she had. Evie et al. helped her come to terms with her figure and appetite and hopefully with her mother too. The next few days would settle that but she already felt much better than ever before in her life, less under pressure and with more friends than she ever had. She was lucky indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr was it not luck? Thinking about it, she suddenly realised it would fit her Mom's sneakiness if she'd somehow arranged for Evie to become her roommate.<i> Huh, never mind that. However it came about, I was the one who made friends with her and it was my choice that brought me here. And now stop dwelling on the past and get back to the present, girl, before they eat it all and you'll have to go hungry.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that there would be any danger of that. Carrie'd taken their appetites into account when ordering and there was more than enough food for everyone. A lot more, in fact. As evening slowly turned into night, her friends parted one by one, wishing her a good Thanksgiving and staggering away on the verge of bursting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby and Lizzie left first, claiming they could not eat a crumb more. Trisha, Chloe and Sally had better trained appetites but even they eventually gave up and departed around midnight, sneaking along the hallways to their rooms (as much as they could sneak at their size). They envied Evie who did not have to go anywhere; the big-bellied junior was snoring in her armchair, unlikely to move before breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich left Carrie to deal with all the leftovers. She, too, felt stuffed to the brim but the mere idea of moving all that stuff into the fridge felt so exhausting. Plus everything was so yummy she was getting peckish just looking at it. \u201cIt might be easier just to eat it all, or at least things that might go bad. Can I fit it all in?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she remembered she'd brought along a bottle of Yeng Stomach Aid from her last visit to the bathroom. She took a good swig and while she waited for the effects to kick in, she started making a list. <i>First the uneaten quarter pizzas, those rolls over there, the ice cream must have melted already so I can just drink that, I should also get rid of that unfinished cheesecake\u2026</i><br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><br>\r\n***<br>\r\n</div><br>\r\nMorning found Carolina lying on the couch, empty plates and trays strewn all around. When Evie woke up to rush to the bathroom, she rolled over on her side so her stomach would have plenty of space to roll out, and slept on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCarrie?\u201d her roommate had to shake her shoulder. \u201cCarrie, wake up! It's breakfast time. And don't you have to go somewhere soon?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLemme sleep\u2026 plenty of time\u2026\u201d Then she jolted, fully awake. \u201cOh no!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo are you coming with me?\u201d Evie was already refreshed, her uniform blouse tidily tucked in under her gut. \u201cTo breakfast, I mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, sorry but\u2026\u201d next to her Carrie looked in a poor state. Her pale belly peered out of a too-small blouse strewn with crumbs and even some ketchup stains, her hair was an unkempt mess. \u201cI can't. I need to pack first. I should've done that yesterday.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo pack? What for? You're leaving for a couple days only.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, yeah, but\u2026 I need to find something to wear, y'know?\u201d Carrie didn't like to admit it but that was the real issue. Would anything still fit? \u201cBesides, I've been eating until 3 a. m. so I'm not hungry yet. Go on without me, I'll come later. Maybe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, OK. See ya then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlone in their rooms, Carolina heaved herself up from the couch and trudged to the bathroom to splash some cold water into her face. Then it was time to face her wardrobe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she rarely moved outside these days, she was vaguely aware that it was getting cold so her summer things were out of the questions. So she went through her warmer outfits, hanging as her driver left them two months ago. \u201cToo old, too small, too nerdy, this might fit, this definitely won't\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she looked at the all-too-small pile on the bed, she sighed again. There was a reasonable selection of blouses and loose sweaters that would hide possible gaps, but no skirt and only a single pair of pants. And even those did not look wide enough for her new behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had no choice. Plopping on her bed, she forced first one trouser-leg, then the other up her growing thighs. The real struggle came when the pants came up to her buttocks. Fighting the fabric and pushing the pliable meat inside, she eventually slid the hem over the shelf on her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the fight was not over yet. Her recent overindulgence made her belly grow too. She pulled the flaps but it soon became clear they would not button over the fat. Sucking it in as much as she could, she buttoned her pants under the biggest tyre. It made the flab hanging over look even bigger and was a really tight fit. She scratched her belly, wishing for a snack. Or breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, I'm a mess.\u201d As she watched herself jiggle in the mirror, an unpleasant thought surfaced in her mind.<i> If I didn't feed myself this fat, maybe Mom wouldn't be so eager to show me around? Was I hoisted by my own petard? </i>She scrounged her face in distaste. Was it really possible? <i>No, no, Mom has no way of knowing how much I put on at Buttercombe, right? Besides, that's a moot point anyway. Whether she knows or not, I have to stand up to her, be it now or at Christmas.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelieved at her conclusion, she stepped out to the bathroom again\u2013 but before she could put on her make-up, on the third or fourth step she heard the unmistakable sound of tearing cloth. And a quick glance showed her a tear running down her hip along the seam. What now? <i>What would Mom do?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she searched for the number on her phone, Carolina absently scratched her tummy, \u201cUh, hello, Dr. Hinamizawa! Could you put in a word for me with Mrs. Banks, please? It's an emergency. I'm supposed to leave soon to go to my Mom like we agreed but I have nothing to wear, I just busted my last pair of pants\u2026 Yeah, thanks a lot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you poor little thing,\u201d the Fashion &amp; Design teacher welcomed her in her realm with a suitably understanding face. \u201cDr. Fukuda told me about it. Do not worry, you're not the first student to have this little problem. I have plenty of discarded clothing from your older schoolmates. We'll surely find something there that you like and fits you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, really?\u201d Carrie's face lit up. \u201cI need just some pants or a skirt, I don't want to go home in these sweatpants.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see. But first we need to update your measurements so we that know what to look for.\u201d The older black woman took a tape that looked weirdly out of place among all the monitors and electronics. \u201cSo let's see\u2026 waist 43, that's plus eight inches, hips 51, plus six compared to September.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Carrie didn't know what to think. It was one thing to come to terms with the fact that she 'gained some' and quite another to hear the exact numbers. \u201cThat's\u2026 quite a lot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, well, you're a big girl now but don't worry, we've got more than enough spares that are chic and look good on a girl of your figure. Such as\u2026\u201d Mrs. Banks opened the storage room and strolled  to the racks on the left, \u201c\u2026 this. All of this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow!\u201d In no time at all, Carrie found a pair of pants she really liked, dark blue with silver seams. \u201cI want these!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, try them on.\u201d But when Carrie left the cabin, the teacher frowned, \u201cAren't they too big on you? No, no, no, I get that you like them, and you will haveet them, I'll just make a few adjustments first, at the back of your waist so that they fit you better. Here, feel that? Isn't it better? And I'll use a thicker thread so you could easily cut it and make the pants bigger again if\u2026 if needed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm, thanks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTake them off, have a seat and wait, it'll take me only a couple minutes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Carrie watched the teacher sew, her stomach reminded her she skipped breakfast. \u201cUmm, Mrs. Banks, could I run to a vending machine? I haven't had breakfast and I'm getting hungry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older woman paused her sewing machine to have a good look at Carrie. It seemed she was getting ready for a long speech but then she deflated. \u201cOf course, dear.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral minutes and a package of cupcakes later Carrie strutted around in her new pants which fit her like a glove. \u201cThank you, Mrs. Banks! How can I repay it to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, perhaps you could donate your old clothes to my reserves?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI definitely will! I mean, when I return to Buttercombe from Thanksgiving! Thanks again, Mrs. Banks! Now I have to run!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was a figure of speech. Carolina did no running any more, she drove the cart and she made it to her dorm just in time to see her mother's driver ask about her whereabouts. \u201cHi, Rick! I'm here! Wait a minute, I'll pick a couple things and be right back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as soon as she was comfortably seated in the back of family limo, she licked her lips. \u201cUmm, Rick? Do you have any snacks on board? See, I had to skip breakfast\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, of course, Miss Carolina. Your mother made sure you'd be well-provisioned for your journey. Just open the box on your left.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n/I had intended to to cover her visit at home in time for Christmas... Oh well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnjoy the holidays./</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As she let the driver help her out of the limo, Carolina felt heavy as never before. Yes, she was over fifty pounds heavier than when she'd left home for the Academy but mostly it was due to the state of her belly. It was fully stretched out, frantically churning to process everything she had crammed in it during the long morning drive. On top of her Buttercombe breakfast she'd emptied all the snacks in the car and had the driver make a pit-stop at a Yeng-Dowell to steady her nerves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that it helped. She felt nervous like never before, coming to face her mother after three months of separation. She'd vowed to start anew, without childish tantrums, speak to her as one (almost) adult to another. But she knew it was going to be hard to avoid old habits. Especially if her mother were to be as overbearing like\u2026 like she always was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook at you, Carriekins! You're looking really good!\u201d Even coming from Buttercombe, the sight of her mother was a little unnerving. Dakota Griffith-Johnson was a firm believer in 'the bigger the better' philosophy and a desire to consume everything in sight turned her into one of the fattest humans on Earth, though her exact weight was a state secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she drove into the garage in her custom-built mobility scooter, her Mom looked indeed bigger than ever. She'd always been wide-hipped but now her inhumanly big behind looked ready to spill out of the confining space again. Not that her gut would be any smaller. It domed ahead of her, propped by its supports, obscuring the view of the Secretary's bloated face. She was looking ever more like her caricatures in the opposition press, \u201cThe Blob that Ate America.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Carrie bit her lips to keep snarky comments inside. \u201cHi, Mom.\u201d As she leaned over to hug her mother, her widened hips knocked down a toolkit off a bench. \u201cOops. Sorry, I keep bumping into things nowadays.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBe it a lesson to you, young lady. If you always drove in your scooter, it wouldn't have happened.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, right but I'm still not sure how I feel about my weight,\u201d Carrie noticed that hearing these words, her gluttonous mother frowned and started huffing as she switched on her Y-Pad. \u201cIs anything wrong, Mom?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm, I will take your luggage to your rooms, young Miss.\u201d And Rick the driver fled the looming confrontation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, nothing, nothing, pumpkin, just\u2026 ah, here it is. I've been informed that your snacking declined by 40% last month. I hope you aren't trying to diet again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom! Are you saying you've got snitches at Buttercombe to report on me?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no, no! I wouldn't even think about it, sugar. My old friends mentioned it in passing, they were concerned.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie had a pretty clear idea who they probably were. \u201cUgh. Well, in that case those 'concerned friends' should have told you that I won a 50% discount at all vending machines. If, as you say, my snacking declined by 40% in November, that actually means I ate, uh\u2026 20% more?\u201d Ouch. Was it even possible? Judging by the state of her wardrobe, very much so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDakota beamed. \u201cAh, I'm so happy to hear it. Remember, all boys love a soft, round girlfriend,\u201d and she patted her flanks, making her entire body ripple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer daughter wasn't amused. \u201cReally? Then you should've sent me to a co-ed school, not to Buttercombe! I haven't seen a boy since August!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCarolina, please! I'm your mother, not your enemy! I want the best for you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie swallowed her first reply. Somehow they started off on the wrong foot again, mother always riled her up.

Still, Carolina wanted to finally have a normal relation with her mother \u2013 as much as anything could be normal with that blobby behemoth, the immensely rich and powerful Dakota Griffith-Johnson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, Mom.\u201d To offer an olive branch, she climbed into her scooter that was gathering dust in the garage since she'd got it for her birthday. Except there was no dust in it today. Someone must have cleaned it in the hope Carrie would use it, and filled in the snacks compartment too. Without thinking, she took a big bite off a Yeng Bar. \u201cSorry, Mom. I know you mean well. It's just\u2026 there are better ways to show it, you know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDakota Griffith-Johnson looked sheepish, though you had to know her pretty well to recognise the emotion in the way her chipmunk cheeks puffed up. \u201cOf course, sweetie-pie. I am sorry too, truly sorry. Let's go to the living room. So how have you been? The school is treating you well, I hope? Given\u2026\u201d She bit down on a remark regarding Carolina's weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie was thankful for that. They chatted on in a remarkably civil fashion, Mom asked about her classes, schoolmates. To her surprise half an hour passed without any further hiccup. It was possibly the longest conversation they'd ever had. But eventually they were running out of topics and Carrie hoped she could go to her room next, to rest and recuperate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead her mother asked: \u201cListen, is there anything in particular you'd like to do today? I cleared up my schedule to be with my girls all afternoon but Virginia stood me up, she's got some party she can't miss. So it'll be just the two of us, perhaps we could bond?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie bit her lip. A whole afternoon alone with her mother sounded like a nightmare. As she lowered her head, her gaze fell on her new blue-silver pants, now covered with crumbs from an apple pie the cook had brought them. Maybe\u2026 \u201cUh, could you take me to that tailor of yours, Mom? Apart from my uniform, I've outgrown every single piece of clothing I got. Even these pants are a gift from the Fashion &amp; Design teacher at school, otherwise I'd have had to drive here in my sweatpants.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, right! Let's have fun clothes shopping! I can take you to our favorite Frenchie\u2026\u201d Mother drummed her belly, \u201cright after a second lunch, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they arrived at the Yeng Drive-In for a late lunch in the family van, a bored teen asked without looking: \u201cHow can I help you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Carrie saw Mom's eager look, she nearly answered <i>I don't want to eat,</i> purely on reflex. But in fact she was getting a little peckish. All that adrenaline pulsing in her veins must have sped up her digestion. She leaned forward from her back seat so the boy could hear her, her tummy bunching in her lap. \u201cOne Mega Burger Combo, please. And double cheesecake.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd four Combos for me. I've got a figure to keep up!\u201d joked her mother. This made the boy look up, Carrie saw his eyes widen in shock. He must have been new, Mom was a frequent client in here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen their order was ready, she put it all on the empty back seats and drove to a parking spot. The van was custom-built with a ramp, front seats torn out to make place for Dakota's scooter. Now she turned it around, away from the steering wheel, to face her daughter in the back. \u201cSo? What are you waiting for? Dig in!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was waiting for you, Mom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, no need to be formal among us girls, sweetie! Ginny would've inhaled her first burger already. Can you pass me the first tray?\u201d She leaned back, placed it on her doming gut and started eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie hadn't planned on eating too much. She nibbled on a fry, took a bite of her burger\u2026 and suddenly her new appetite overcame her. It felt just as pleasant as feasting with her Buttercombe friends. Occasionally they commented on the taste but mostly they kept filling their stomachs in amicable silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie's order was much smaller though, so she found herself licking off the last cheesecake crumbs while Mom was still going strong \u2013 if that was the right word. She was gulping down the last burger almost without chewing, her breathing heavy and ragged, she seemed exhausted merely by the act of eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was done, she spent several minutes catching her breath. \u201cWhew! That hit the spot. But I should have told Rick to drive us in the limo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie slid down in her seat to make more room for her stomach, winced as the safety belt dug into it. \u201c *Uurp.* And I shouldn't have eaten so much.\u201d She felt her belly straining against the fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Nonsense, sugarplum! You need a full tummy for a proper fitting. You'll see.\u201d<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><br>\r\n***<br>\r\n</div><br>\r\nCarrie had been to Boutique Fabrice before but this was the first time she drove there with her Mom. It made sense she got to meet Fabrice for the first time too. Soon after Mom announced her name to the parking lot attendant, a dapper little man, slimmer than most Mom's acquaintances, scurried out of the building to welcome them in person. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFabrice was looking harried and uncomfortable. \u201cBonjour, madame et mademoiselle, welcome to my humble etablissement.\u201d He wrung his hands, visibly nervous. \u201cUmm, please understand that with the Thanksgiving ahead of us this is a very busy day for us\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you'll find the time for your best customer, right?\u201d Mom threateningly drove her scooter towards him, stopping at the last moment so she loomed over the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gulped. \u201cOh, yes, certainement! Only it might take a little bit longer than you are used to,\u201d sweat beaded on his high forehead, \u201can attendant will be with you momentarily and please accept our refreshments in the meantime.\u201d He pointed to a table in the reception area that two boys were just filling with snacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom's haughty expression melted a little at that. \u201cOh, fine. That's better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBon appetit, madame et mademoiselle.\u201d And he nearly ran as he disappeared in the rooms beyond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother chuckled as she set her scooter in motion again. \u201cDon't be fooled by his accent, pumpkin. I found out he was born in New Jersey. So what do we have here?\u201d And she stretched her mouth open to fit an entire pastry inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie was about to ask her how she could still eat when she found her mouth full of canapes too. They both lost the sense of time as they grazed on snacks. Their table was half-empty when finally a discreet cough made Carrie turn around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, hello, Ms. Griffith-Johnson, Miss, my name's Suzy, can I help you?\u201d The seamstress wasn't much older than Carrie but she was much slimmer and as she looked at her big customers there was a hint of worry in her expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, good!\u201d Mom exclaimed with her mouth full. \u201cAh, yes, my little Carrie needs something nice to wear tomorrow so<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, ma'm. And I'll tell the boys to bring more refreshments. Follow me, please, Carolina.\u201d And she hurried away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she waddled behind the seamstress, Carrie was struggling to keep up and regretting her appetite. \u201cUmm, could you\u2026 slow down\u2026 a little?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, right, sorry.\u201d The girl glanced back at her. \u201cListen, we have several dresses we'd set aside for your sister, uh, Virginia? Except she's, uh\u2026 outgrown them. Would you mind if we adjusted them to your size? You have essentially the same figure, it'd be much faster than sewing something from a scratch. Quite frankly, I doubt we'd be able to manage on such a short notice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know. But I've got a very different taste than Ginny.  Well, show me what you've got.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzy led her into a large cabin. While Carrie sat down to catch her breath, she ran to the storage and returned with an armful of clothes. The first two dresses were just as bad as Carrie feared \u2013 flashy, colorful, the deep neckline a bit vulgar. The third gown, though\u2026 Dark blue, flowing, changing hues as the light shone on it. \u201cThis one! I want this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, a perfect choice, Miss. Some silver jewelry and you'll shine wherever you go. The cloth is stretch so it'll adjust to your body but we should take it in anyway, in a couple places, so it would fit. I'll take your measures now, please.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl was properly deferential but Carrie would swear she frowned at her size when she thought she wasn't looking. She even tsked when measuring her waist. \u201cOK, it shouldn't be too difficult. I'll stitch it up for you to try it on. Want to wait here or go back to your mother?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a long walk. \u201cUmm, could you send me some pastries in here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzy audibly sighed. \u201cOf course, Miss.\u201d And rushed away again. A quick snack later she was back and Carrie could finally put on her dream dress. It fit her well as she paraded before the mirrors, watching her reflections with mixed feelings. <i>Aren't dark colors supposed to be slimming? Oh well, with how much I like to eat these days, it'd be stupid to think I'd stay slim. And I'm still much slimmer than Evie. Or Ginny.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerfect. I'll sew the new hems and have the parcel sent to your home. It should be there this evening.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you!\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Finding Mom wasn't hard \u2013 her scooter hadn't moved away from the table with refreshments. Someone had to have refilled them in the meantime too since many plates were still full and yet Dakota Griffith-Johnson was looking content, her inflated gut spreading high and wide, dangerously stretching her burgundy blouse (Fabrice's product, how else). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight made Carrie pause. Like so many times before, she wondered what drove her mother to such heights of excess. She felt repulsed again but today she had to parse her emotions to identify what else she was feeling. Fall at Buttercombe had taught her the bliss of senseless indulgence, the lure of lazy idleness. As she watched her mother, there was envy mixed in her feelings, and a desire to match, to exceed her Mom's sloth and gluttony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie huffed to the table, rewarding herself with a cupcake for the effort. She inhaled it in one go before turning to her mother. \u201cHi, Mom. I'm finished here. They'll deliver my dress so we can go home now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe humongous chest lifted with a sigh. \u201cOh. Already? I was hoping we could spend more time together, Carrie, just the two of us. We meet so seldom\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie reminded herself that she wanted to be the bigger person \u2013 at least figuratively. \u201cOK, Mom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerfect!\u201d Her mother's  jowls stretched with a smile. \u201cI'll show you my new favorite place inside the Beltway! Polly's Patisserie! We'll have a blast, you'l see!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie stifled a groan, hoisted by her own petard. \u201cYeah. Hurray, mom.\u201d She furtively probed her tummy. She'd been stuffing it all day today, would it be up to the job? <i>I should have taken some of that Stomach Aid along. Oh, well. I can manage a couple bites.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomewhat to her surprise, Carrie enjoyed herself in Polly's Patisserie. The owner, a jovial (and jowly) woman of indeterminate age, was so friendly and forthcoming that she easily forgave Mom her barbs in the vein of: \u201cSweetie, there\u2019s no way that\u2019s going to be enough for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt stung but her mother was right. The first Carrie's plate was only half-full: a brownie, some macarons and a tiny piece of cake. But they were all so tasty that she gladly went for seconds in the buffet-style patisserie. And thirds. And when she saw Mom still gorging, she succumbed to temptation for the fourth time too. Now she was regretting it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it's been exquisite like always, Polly,\u201d her mother smiled at the owner, \u201cyour people do a wonderful job, worth every penny. I am well and truly stuffed. Come on, let's go, Carrie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026 yeah, Mom.\u201d If even her mother was stuffed, Carrie felt about to burst. She reclined in the booth, breathing heavily, her tummy stretched into a big round ball. When she tried to stand up, she had to fight off the urge to vomit. \u201cJust a\u2026 second.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Polly saw her pleading look, she rushed to help her. The owner was a big woman too but there were plenty of muscle underneath her blubber. She lifted Carrie up by her shoulders and half-carried her all the way to the van. \u201cPerhaps you should start coming in your scooter, my dear, like your bigger sister does.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Bigger sister,' that hurt. Though strictly speaking Polly wasn't wrong. \u201cUh, maybe I should. Thank you, bye.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMainly she should have known better. She'd had plenty of parties with Evie et al., she knew she ought to rein her appetite in before it was too late. Now she was too full. Fuller than ever before in her life. Carrie moaned, unsure whether from pain or pleasure. It was all Mom's fault for pushing so many tasty pastries onto her! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, she shouldn't begrudge her too much. After all, apparently her mother had been spending these 'bonding afternoons' with her gluttonous little sister. Perhaps she should have felt flattered that Mom expected her to have the same capacity as Ginny. But now she was feeling more than a little queasy when she shuffled from the van to her scooter waiting in the family garage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery step was sending waves of pain throughout her body as her stomach protested against so much jostling. For a painful moment she wondered how she would ever climb inside before recalling the scooter had a retractable ramp. She pushed the button and waddled up to collapse in the seat. Somehow this felt like unimaginable torture and she honestly regretted she hadn't taken the scooter for her afternoon romp with Mom like Polly said. <i>Next time,</i> she promised herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she raised her head again, she noticed her Mom's impatient glance. \u201cUh, don't wait for me, Mom, I'll stop in the bathroom first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, pumpkin.\u201d And the supersized scooter whizzed away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie was glad mother left her alone. She was about to attempt something Mom would surely not approve of. <i>I don't have my Stomach Aid but I'm willing to bet either Mom or Ginny use similar stuff. And if they do, there should be plenty of it in the bathroom next to our dining room. I'm not happy about it but if Mom expects me to eat like Virginia, I wouldn't want to disappoint her.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer heart racing from both the thrill and the exertion of hauling herself upright, she leaned out of her scooter to open the bathroom cabinet. A quick inspection of it found a dozen familiar vials with bluish liquid in two separate batches, one marked D and the other V. It didn't take a rocket scientist to tell what was what.<i> I don't dare use Mom's stomach aid\u2026 or do I?</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><i>I'll take Mom's medicine, I need as much help as I can get,</i> reasoned Carrie as her hand took the familiar vial. She sniffed but the liquid was just as odorless as the Stomach Aid she'd been using at Buttercombe.<i> Let's see what it feels to walk in her shoes.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was most likely a placebo effect but Carolina began to feel better as soon as she downed the vial. Her stomach stopped churning as much, her heart ceased thumping as if it were trying to break out of her chest. Her spirits lifted, she drove to her closet to change \u2013 only to have them crushed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was going through her wardrobe but all her favorite T-shirts were too small now. In the end she did squeeze into an Abercrombie University shirt that used to hang loose on her. Today it was wrapped tight around her enlarged chest which would make Carrie happy, were it not even tighter across her belly. And the yoga pants she put on next were even worse. Yes, they stretched all the way around her sizable bottom but they stretched so much the black was turning to pink over the two jiggly globes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned around in front of her mirror for a second time but it only confirmed her first impression. Wrapped in too-tight fabric, she was looking like a burrito. She sighed. \u201cOh well. Wasn't the tee an XXL? At least Mom's going to be happy.\u201d And yet, the more Carrie watched her reflection, the she was liking her new look. With bigger boobs, a bigger butt \u2013 and yes, a big belly \u2013 she no longer looked like a scrawny poor relative, living here on sufferance. She was looking so womanly, so sexy! That was a novel feeling for Carrie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she walked out of her closet, her steps were almost jaunty. She walked halfway to the kitchen before her stomach reminded her it was still kind of full and did not want to be jostled. Only then she realised her mistake and returned for her scooter. She rationalised she wasn't driving it out of laziness but out of necessity. What if Mom made her overeat again, eat so much that she wouldn't make it to her bedroom on foot?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a breather she drove to the kitchen in its comfort, certain she would find her mother there. Dakota Griffith-Johnson was sitting at a half-moon table, surrounded with snacks and chatting with the kitchen staff while she was answering work e-mails. Carrie stopped her cart next to it and snatched a muffin before asking: \u201cHi, Mom, what time's dinner?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm, Ginny should be coming home from her party in two hours so\u2026\u201d she was interrupted with a growl of Carrie's stomach, \u201chow about a pre-dinner snack?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie expected to be feeling hungry again, though she felt a little different than when using Stomach Aid. Hungry, more than just peckish. \u201cYeah! I was about to suggest a pizza\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAn excellent idea! Girls, warm up two Quattro Formaggi for us. And some fries too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer pizza was gone and Carolina nervously nibbled on the sweets the cooks brought them as she chatted with Mom. Strangely enough though, her nerves weren't caused by Mom. By now she almost felt like a BFF. Carrie was nervous because she knew she had to hold back, otherwise she'd burst at dinner. And yet something was urging her to gorge on everything in sight. Was it the Mom's concoction? She was holding her appetite in check but only just.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat it meant was that she ate only one morsel for every five her Mom inhaled. While she ate more slowly, she was filling up anyway and it had its consequences. As her stomach kept expanding, eventually it slipped out of the confining T-shirt and revealed her bottom roll; pale, jiggling and crisscrossed with faint stretchmarks. Carrie wouldn't have noticed it, were it not for Mom's approving glance. She felt a ghost of old annoyance at that, her hand reflexively shot to pull the hem back down. But\u2026 why bother? It was going to spill out again anyway. She let her belly hang out and chewed on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, soon after that their chewing was interrupted. The sound of garage door opening announced that Dad was bringing her sister home, much earlier than expected. Carrie braced herself for the first encounter with her gluttonous (not-so-) little sister \u2013 the last potential conflict today \u2013 but she needn't have worried. Ginny just breezed through the room in her scooter. \u201cHi, Mom. Hi, Skinny. Going to bed, OK?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was rather abrupt even for her. When her Dad walked in Carrie didn't ask, too busy eating. But her Mom did. She frowned, turning to her husband: \u201cWhat was that about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shrugged. \u201cAh, a disagreement with her friends, from what I gathered.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, poor sweetie! Becky!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, ma'am?\u201d One of the kitchen maids jumped up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBring a tray of cookies to Ginny's room. Or no, no, wait. I'll take them myself. Gimme that!\u201d And her mother stepped on the gas, with a last apologetic glance towards Carrie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeft alone with her father (all those kitchen helpers did not count) Carrie felt a little uncertain. After all, it had always been Dad who'd been on her side, supported her when she refused to be stuffed like a Thanksgiving turkey. What if he saw her change as a betrayal? She gave him a sheepish smile, looking at the kind man who seemed perpetually in tow of her domineering mother. \u201cHi, Dad. I'm so happy to see you again.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPleasantly plump but now relegated to being the thinnest member of the family, he'd been the rock she'd clung to during the most turbulent years of her puberty. Now he smiled. \u201cMe too. Come here, sweetie. You've grown so much!\u201d unable to hug her in the scooter, he settled for patting her thigh while his eyes searched her face for signs of her true feelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe suppressed giggling. \u201cDad! You're not supposed to say that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, your Mom likes to hear it,\u201d he chuckled too. \u201cBut seriously, though. Everything OK, pumpkin? With school, friends\u2026 Mom?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure. Better than ever, Daddy. Why?\u201d Following his glance, Carrie was reminded how her well-fed bottom belly roll hung out of the too-tight T-shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, well, suddenly you are best friends with Mom and let her push food on you and\u2026\u201d he vaguely gestured at her figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCouldn't I simply decide to grow up?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd out?\u201d he grinned, patting her belly this time. \u201cWell, if it's really so\u2026 You're looking good, really good, Carrie, don't let anyone else tell you otherwise. One day soon your curves will make some boy very happy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Dad!\u201d she blushed. \u201cDon't talk like that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour parents used to be young too, sweetie, believe it or not. Not that long ago. Still, I'm worried about you. Just don't let your Mommy push you into anything you wouldn't want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDaddy! You should know by now that I'm not gonna let Mom push me around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, right. You're my clever little girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie returned his smile a little uncertainly. It was getting a little awkward, as much as she was glad for his support. Thankfully Mom returned soon, and she was fuming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, damn those raging hormones! I must say, Carrie, I'm sooo glad you've put your teen angst behind. You'll never know what it's like until you have daughters of your own. Ginny these days is\u2026 Ugh!\u201d She washed her frustration down with a pitcher of juice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuh? So perfect little Ginny wasn't flawless after all? \u201cUmm, I had no idea I was that bad? Sorry, Mom, I didn't mean to\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, that's OK, sugar,\u201d she drove her scooter to pat Carrie on the shoulder. \u201cAs I said, it's a part of life. Though I'm really happy you're shaping up so well. But let's talk about something more important.\u201d She winked. \u201cIs dinner ready yet?\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was well past midnight and Carrie was lying awake in her bed, watching shadows play on the ceiling. The wild churning of her stomach wouldn't let her sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDinners at the Griffith-Johnson household had always been lavish affairs but until this day she'd never fully participated in the stuffing ritual. Today, elated by her reconciliation with Mom (and prompted by the mysterious contents of her Mom's blue vial) she'd overeaten like never before in her life. She'd eaten so much that kitchen maids had to carry her to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd seen Ginny manhandled like that many times but she'd never thought that one day she would be in her place. Not that she was regretting her gluttony. The only thing she regretted was that she couldn't order the maids to bring her Mom's stomach aid. Well, she <i>could </i>but they would have told her. So Carrie had to wait until she became mobile again \u2013 at least mobile enough to roll over from her bed to the scooter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was ready to try now. Not that the pain in her stomach would ease much, quite the opposite. And Carrie wanted quick relief. Jerking and gasping with pain, she started crawling towards her salvation. She crawled a foot and paused, another foot\u2026 The worst part came when she had to lift her body across the gap between the side of her bed and the scooter. Her unused arm muscles quivered with the effort but she made it and sped away to the common bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took Ginny's vial this time, not willing to risk her Mom's again. She sighed with relief as she felt her muscles relax and her stomach stretch. She massaged her belly a little to help speed up the process, then her gaze was drawn to the mirror. Was that a zit forming on her nose? And another on the left cheek? And one in her cleavage too\u2026 it must have been all the chocolate and sugar and stress. Oh well. She'd have to mask them with make-up in the morning before the Thanksgiving feast started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat reminded Carrie she'd not seen her new dress yet. A messenger delivered it from Fabrice's while she was in the middle of eating frenzy. Now she eagerly drove her scooter back to her rooms to unwrap the package.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the pain in her stomach subsided, she climbed out and unrolled the dark blue fabric, admiring how it looked on her. She put it on and twirled around, tried various angles in the mirror. She was entranced and would have spent even more time in it but she soon started feeling another effect of the Yeng medicine \u2013 she was getting peckish again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she heard a click nearby. Was it her sister's door? No doubt she was heading for her midnight feast. Carrie hesitated. Of all the people in the household, her sister was now the one she wanted to meet the least. On the other hand, she was beginning to feel first echoes of new hunger. She knew it was artificial but that did not help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe undressed again and looked at the pale mass around her midriff.<i> I'll show you who's the boss here. It's time to sleep, not to eat</i>. She put on her nightshirt and climbed into her bed, trying to will herself to sleep but to no avail. Her stomach was quickly emptying with the help of Yeng chemicals and demanded to be filled again. And Carrie had been conditioned in the last months to obey her appetite\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGah! Fine! You win!\u201d Endless minutes rolling in her bed convinced Carolina she had to fill the gaping hole in her belly, otherwise she'd never get to sleep tonight. Hopefully Ginny would have already left?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as soon as her front wheels emerged in the corridor, she saw the light in the kitchen. And when she drove there, Carrie found the young teen nursing a half-gallon bucket of ice cream in her scooter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny didn't even look up, hypnotising her bucket instead. \u201cWhaddaya want?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm, I was\u2026 thinking about having\u2026 a snack.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, that's you? I though you were Mom- Wait a minute! A snack? Driving <i>a scooter</i>? Who are you and what have you done to our Carrie?\u201d Suddenly Ginny chuckled \u2013 though perhaps cackled might be a better word. \u201cOK, fine, wanna ice cream? Just pick whichever flavour you like from Fridge Three.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIce cream? That looked like a sound idea. Carrie picked rocky road while racking her brains for a safe conversation topic. \u201cSo\u2026 what's new, Ginny?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh, same-o, same-o.\u201d Her little sister finally looked at her. \u201cHow' bout you? You retaining cake, Skinny?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie decided to let the barb be and take the sentence at its face value. \u201cWell, yeah. Buttercombe Academy is\u2026 is\u2026\u201d She struggled to find words. \u201cYou'd like it there, Gin. I know I do, even though I was ready to hate it. Just imagine\u2026\u201d Filling her stomach with ice cream, she waxed poetic about all the perks her school offered before noticing her little sister's gloomy look. \u201cBut what about you? Have you fought with Mom? Why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh! Don't ask! Mom's so clueless!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was new too. Not that long ago, Ginny would claim Mom couldn't put a foot wrong \u2013 at least if she ever walked again. And as she reclined in her scooter, Virginia was looking a little\u2026 smaller. Sure, she still weighed far too much for her thirteen years but Carrie would have sworn that belly used to dominate Ginny's looks far more. Certainly her nightshirt was a little loose on her now, even with a full stomach. What was going on here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLost in thought, she spooned the ice cream until she scraped the bottom. \u201cHuh? It's gone already?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sister cackled again. It had a bitter undertone. \u201cWant another bucket?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don't see why not.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere, have mine. I don't think I'll finish that. I've had too much as it is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis comment made Carrie uneasy. She couldn't recall her sister ever admitting she overate. Especially when there were no other empty plates, wrappers or containers on the table. Since when were two gallons of ice cream too much for her? She drove closer to pick up Ginny's ice cream and then she pressed her sister's fatty hand. \u201cListen, don't let that get to you. You know how many times I have fought with Mom. Just do what you consider best and the rest will sort itself out. It won't be tomorrow, nor next week but give it a couple years\u2026 Mom means well but she has weird ways of showing it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I know. Well, I'm gonna sleep now.\u201d And as her scooter crossed the threshold, she turned back to whisper: \u201cAnd, ah, thanks, Carrie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou're welcome.\u201d Carrie found in the meantime that Ginny's bucket had completely melted so she upended it into her mouth, gulping the thick sweet cream. It was still over half full but when she licked last drops, she still did not have enough. Ice cream was fine but she wanted something a little more substantial, something like- yes! Like this batch of brownies cooks left here for anyone who would be hungry overnight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie took the tray out of the fridge on the table and started munching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinished with writing her last reply to Sally on the Yeng Friendsbook, Carrie's hand reached for another brownie but came up short. The tray was empty. She picked up a couple crumbs, finally full and content, and patted her belly \u2013 a habit she'd learned from Evie. It was time to go to bed, except she was getting so sleepy\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But why would Evie wake her up? She wanted to sleep\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWake up, please! We need to start working on the feast!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Now that she thought about it, her bed did feel a little\u2026 wobbly. Like that scooter she had back home. \u201cWhat feast?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour Thanksgiving feast, Miss. So please, could you leave the kitchen and go to sleep in your room until the first brunch course is served?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026 Oh, right.\u201d Carrie finally woke up enough to recall she was back home. \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHalf past four.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOuch. Umm\u2026 Would you have something small to tide me over 'til then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe head cook rolled her eyes and grabbed a gallon of butterscotch ice cream from Fridge 3. \u201cHere you go, Miss. Can you go now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, yeah, right. Thanks.\u201d Carrie slid her thighs apart to put the bucket there. There was less space than she remembered and there was something else missing too. \u201cNo, wait! I need a spoon!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally satisfied, the girl drove out of the kitchen so the kitchen helpers could start cooking.<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><br>\r\n***<br>\r\n</div><br>\r\nFive hours later, refreshed and no longer sleepy, Carrie was looking forward to a festive stuffing. A Thanksgiving feast in the Griffith-Johnson household was never limited to a mere turkey and pumpkin pie. It was an all-day affair that started mid-morning and stretched long into the night, seconds and thirds were compulsory at every course (though Carrie used to rebel against that). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday she had intended to hold back too, at least a little. However, as soon as she saw the piles cooks had prepared for their \u201cbrunch,\u201d she just couldn't put down the fork. There was so much good food to be had, ravioli with triple cheese, cheesy garlic bread, fried calamari, platters of brownies and\u2026 and\u2026 she couldn't leave a single bite uneaten! Her Buttercombe conditioning took over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, a couple bites into her second helping she noticed that Ginny looked like she wanted to refuse it. Mother didn't notice anything yet, entranced in her own humongous portion. But she was bound to see it soon. Carrie frantically thought how she could prevent their fight. She smirked and squeezed her sister's biggest roll, trying to act playful.  \u201cHey, squirt! How about an eating competition, like in the old days?\u201d Before Ginny stretched her stomach and started beating her so often that it stopped being fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny's reaction was predictable. \u201cSquirt? Who're you calling a squirt, Skinny?! You're on! Becky! Another helping for me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Miss.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Carrie slid the rubber hem of her pyjama pants below the belly bulge in anticipation of heavy eating, she congratulated herself. Despite growing into puberty, there were still ways her little sister could be easily manipulated into eating \u2013 such as the use of sibling rivalry.<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><br>\r\n***<br>\r\n</div><br>\r\nBrunch was followed by a short nap to digest everything everyone crammed into their stomachs (Carrie again 'borrowed' Ginny's concoction for better results) and then it was time to put on her new dress. She was admiring her looks in the mirror when several cars stopped by the security booth outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guests were arriving. The Johnson grandparents eagerly greeted her oldest granddaughter, on their heels Uncle Kenny came with his newest skinny girlfriend in tow, even Aunt Piper showed up. Everyone milled in the living room a little before the head cook came to ask: \u201cUh, should I start serving, Madame, or would you prefer us to bring more appetisers first?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe behemoth sighed. \u201cAh, we're still waiting for one more guest \u2013 Hannah Hammond was supposed to come too, Piper \u2013 but I'm getting really hungry, snacks won't be enough\u2026 Yeah, we can start without her, no doubt she'll show up later. Let's move to the table, people!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Griffith-Johnson girls waited for their lighter, more nimble guests to clear the way, gobbling up leftover appetisers, before they drove their scooters to the dining room. Their mother gave them a stern look, already waiting at the head of the table. \u201cAhem. So, we meet here again, my dears, for this humble Thanksgiving repast. As always, there is plenty to be thankful for\u2026\u201d and she launched into another of her beloved speeches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie fought the impulse to roll her eyes, then she saw Ginny do exactly that. Luckily, Mom made it brief today, perhaps all the lovely smells wafting from the kitchen helped. \u201cAmen. Now dig in, my beloved family and friends! Remember, a well fed home is a happy home.\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, I see I've arrived just in time,\u201d Aunt Hannah stood in the door, her killer curves stretching a demure business suit. \u201cLet your hair down and your bellies out, ladies\u2026 and gentlemen!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say everybody heeded her advice, even Ginny forgot about her grudge when she saw the turkeys being rolled in. Silence ruled the room for the time being, interrupted only with industrious munching and chomping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***<br>\r\n</div></span></div></div>",

Sure, there would be more courses to come but\u2026 \u201cUh, Becky? Could you give me another helping?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sister was sitting across the table from her and no longer eating, so it was no surprise she noticed. She cackled again, elbowing the guest on her right. \u201cAunty, look! The skinny bitch started eating!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie gave Ginny an amused look. \u201cShut up, Squirt. Becky, pass me the gravy.\u201d As she stretched to get the bowl, she found another advantage of the sleeveless dress she was wearing \u2013 it didn't restrict her plumping arms, letting her pour a generous amount on her portion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dress was also giving Hannah Hammond a pretty clear idea of her recent developments. \u201cOh, you're looking good, Carolina! Real good! See, didn't I tell you, Kodi? Blood's thicker than water.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom paused in her eating for a moment, her face a mixture of amusement and annoyance. \u201cYeah, you did.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiscussion around the table veered to her newfound eating habits but Carrie studiously ignored it, focusing on her portion instead. She was soon interrupted again, though. As she was making her way through the fourths, her phone vibrated. Evie had sent her a photo of Buttercombe feast and a message:<b> Wish you were here, right? </b>it said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie chuckled and copied the question with a photo of their spread to send back. Truth be told, both piles of food looked comparable \u2013 and knowing the Academy chefs, Evie may have been eating better. Carrie was determined to trump her by eating more. Today and every day. She may have to slow down for now, however that only meant she could converse while eating. She turned left to her tablemate. \u201cAunt Piper, I think I saw your littlest sister Hunter at the Buttercombe, was it her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old family friend looked like she found some of the weight she'd lost recently. Despite that, though. for the first time ever she was smaller than Carrie. Now she nodded, making her second chin appear for a moment. \u201cYeah, she's really enjoying it. Tante Schwartz is letting her help with some extracurricular projects\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><br>\r\n***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoof. I've really overdone it today. \u201d Another hour later, Carrie was well and truly stuffed. Sweating heavily from the heat her stomach was generating, she pushed away her last plate for the helpers to carry away and leaned back, massaging her swollen midriff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's why we have ice cream \u2013 to soothe full stomachs, dumpling.\u201d And Mom passed her a bucket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, adding another half gallon to her load did not exactly help her digestion but another drive to the bathroom for a swig of Ginny's medicine did. By the time pies came in, Carolina was feeling fit again \u2013 fit to continue eating, at least. Pumpkin, apple, cherry, chocolate or pecan, she did not really mind, devouring everything in sight like a hungry monster \u2013 even like her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually everything blurred. Carrie later recalled only hazy wisps of memories \u2013 a series of toasts that Mom proposed, Aunt Helen offering her more pies, her grandparents saying goodbye, Aunt Helen bringing in a special order from a Belgian chocolaterie, her stopping Ginny's outburst with another reminder about their little contest\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually, that was the only thing she remembered more clearly \u2013 her eating competition with Ginny. When they met in the kitchen the next morning, eyes still bleary, it was the first thing her 'little' sister asked - \u201cWho won?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie shrugged. \u201cUh, nobody, I guess? We can say it ended in a draw.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, or in a food coma. So what do we do? I want to beat you, skinny. Do we go on eating?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so Carrie spent the rest of her stay at home permanently full. Thanks to some illicit help courtesy of Yeng the competition winner was never clear. She suspected that Ginny may have eaten a little more but neither girl was sure so they agreed on a draw \u2013 and another round on Christmas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then it was time to return to Buttercombe, in hot pink jeans borrowed from Ginny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cEvie, hi! I missed you!\u201d Carrie waddled in, carefully holding her tummy with both hands to avoid too much sloshing. She added all the edible contents of the limo pantry to it on her drive back to the Academy and now she was feeling a little queasy from all the walking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, hi\u2026\u201d her roommate was lethargically spread in a sofa, her gut pointing to heavens, presumably stuffed to the brim judging from the groan she let out when she tried to face her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie heard Rick the driver walk in too. \u201cI'll put all the things in your room, Miss, and leave, if it's OK?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, wait. Leave one basket here. Evie, look, this is a gift from Aunt Helen, Belgian truffles and chocolates. Wanna have a taste?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, sure!\u201d the beached whale suddenly mustered enough strength in her underused muscles to swing herself upright. \u201cGive it here.\u201d The driver promptly obeyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBye, Rick!\u201d Carrie gingerly sat down on her own settee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how was family Thanksgiving?\u201d asked Evie as she unwrapped the first morsel. \u201cWow, those are good!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, fine. Actually, it was the best Thanksgiving I've ever had\u2026\u201d as she talked, Evie's all too visible \u2013 and audible \u2013 enjoyment of her gift was making her hungry again. Well, not hungry, she still felt her stomach pushing out but she was a little peckish. And those truffles were so small they'd hardly take up any space in there\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a package of them. \u201cImagine, Evie, if all the cooks from Buttercombe were there only for the two of us\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was well past midnight, the basket was empty and Evie was snoring on the sofa. However, Carrie was still a little peckish thanks to the last swig of Yeng Stomach Aid and she recalled Aunt Helen giving her two baskets (\u201cone for you and one for your friends\u201d). Back then she found it hugely excessive, now she was thinking she should have asked Ginny for hers too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStretched on her wide bed, she continued plopping chocolates into her mouth until a beam of moonlight reached her window and lit her towering belly. This awoke Carrie's curiosity. She stood up, grunting and sweating, and opened the wardrobe to have a good look at her expanding figure in its mirror. As she did so, she noticed her scale at the bottom. She tapped it with a toe to switch it on.<i> I wonder how much I weigh now.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to crane her neck forward over the belly bulge to see the numbers.<i> I should ask around for a talking scale. How much is it? Huh\u2026 Have I really put on five pounds in four days? Where did all that new flesh come from?</i> In the mirror she could see all the empty wrappers strewn around.<i> Oh, what a silly question. Well, now I can really start pulling my weight.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cupped her breasts in her hands. Though she would have preferred more calories to have ended up there, nobody would ever call her flat again. Then her arms slid downward, to the heaviness of her stomach hanging below. Its full roundness was almost hypnotizing. Soon she was rubbing it, massaging it. it felt so sexy. Later her gaze slid further beyond, to the hips that jutted out on both sides. They were so wide that they nearly filled even a Buttercombe mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Girl, you are getting so big\u2026</i> Yet she found she didn\u2019t mind it. She'd already admitted to herself that she loved eating to excess. Now she was surprised to find out she liked the results as well.<i> Buttercombe, watch out! The new and improved Carrie is coming! </i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next day Carrie got into the Buttercombe spirit in full; full being the keyword. She managed to squeeze two breakfasts into her schedule (and stomach), two lunches, countless snacking in between. Her newfound greed came to a sudden halt when she managed to squirt ketchup all over her face, to the merriment of Evie et al.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie grunted, rose and retreated to the bathroom to wash herself. Then she took out her makeup but before she could reapply it, second thoughts came as she stared at herself in the mirror. Her face looked bloated, her breasts strained the yellow blazer, her painfully full belly bulged over the belt, her thighs touched all the way down underneath the mustard skirt. <i>Huh, I am becoming what I fought against so long, so hard. Perhaps I should cut down a bit? And move around more?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then new reality reasserted itself.<i> What am I thinking? Do I really want to diet and exercise? No way! </i>She grabbed a vial of Stomach Aid from her purse, only to find it empty.<i> Didn't Ginny have an improved version? Perhaps I should ask around. And I know where.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning on the washbasin, she quickly fired off a text message to a number she'd acquired recently: <b>Back from Mom. Wanna talk about it?</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later she was knocking on the door marked Vice Principal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome in, it is open!\u201d Dr. Fukuda Hinamizawa ventured a rare smile, her face muscles straining with the effort.  \u201cGlad to see you round, Carolina. Please, have a seat, have some donuts. From your disposition I surmise everything went well?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, sure, even better.\u201d Her mouth full again, Carrie launched into a redacted description of her Thanksgiving festivities. \u201cAs you can see,\u201d she concluded some time later, \u201cI tried to uphold the Buttercombe reputation as much as I could. Definitely at the table but I didn't get into any fights either\u2026 Actually, I think eating makes people mellow out, be less confrontational.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh yes, I am glad to hear that. And you are absolutely correct, food does help smooth out the wrinkles. Not that there wouldn't be plenty of power struggles in the present system too.\u201d Fukuda looked uncomfortable saying that. \u201cIt is a \u2013 what do you call it? A dog-eat-dog world? At least we do not have to eat real dogs, Yeng feeds its people well. Still, the price of defeat is steep.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe way she said it made Carrie pause. Was this the reason why the woman who once epitomised Yeng now ran only a tiny boarding school? And was she perhaps looking to regain that position with Carrie's help?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarolina felt deeply uncomfortable, as if she were trying to use an atrophied muscle. Was this how her mother thought all the time? She didn't like it much but she did like the fact that Fukuda was the first adult ever who treated her as a player on her own, not like an extension of her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUneasy from the attention, she squirmed in the plush seat, her eyes darting around the room. She noticed a small mirror in the corner, oriented so that it showed a bloated caricature of Carrie. Looking at it, she realised she looked a lot like Dakota Johnson in the first photographs from their family album.<i> Am I turning into my mother?</i> She asked the mirror silently. <i>What should I say? What would <b>she</b> say?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The truth, or a version of it,</i> her reflection seemed to answer.<i> It is the easiest solution and has the added bonus that it might confuse your enemy.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, for what it's worth, Mom didn't speak ill about you, Dr. Hinamizawa. Quite the opposite. So perhaps your\u2026 exile here is only temporary?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, well, let us hope so.\u201d Fukuda lost her introspective look, returning to the present her eyes focused back on Carrie. \u201cAnd what are your plans now, young lady?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh\u2026\u201d Carrie licked her lips. Donuts were gone. \u201cI'd go for a second lunch?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean a third one, right? Haven't you had two lunches already?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas she watching her? \u201cEh, who's counting?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Oriental woman chuckled, her mood visibly improved hearing those words. \u201cQuite right, Carolina. Anyway, I meant to ask if there is something I can do for you to make your stay in Buttercombe more pleasant? Anything?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerfect, this was what Carrie was waiting for all along. \u201cUmm, while I was home, I noticed that Ginny- my little sister\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGinny was taking some medicine like the Yeng Stomach Aid we have here. But it was better, more powerful. Could I start using it too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time the smile seemed genuine. \u201cOh, well, I would not call it more powerful but rather more focused, tailored to your personal needs. And I don't see why you shouldn't get one too, Carolina. However, I am not a medical professional, I will have to have a word with Dr. Schwartz and nurse Fukiyama first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExpect one of them to call you ASAP.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you.\u201d Carrie squirmed in the low seat, trying to stand up. It took her three tries to succeed while the Vice Principal watched her struggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly when she was finally standing, red in face, and smoothing out her blouse, Fukuda concentrated again. \u201cNo need to thank me, I will be glad to help one of my favorite students, Carolina. Oh, and one last thing. Mrs. Banks reminded me to ask you for the clothes you have outgrown.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, sure, I'll be happy pass them on. It's not like I'd fit in them ever again.\u201d And Carrie patted her stuffed gut, curious about the effect it would have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFukuda blinked. \u201cOh. Right. Quite right you are. Well, do not let me detain you any longer, my dear. Goodbye for now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBye.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was merely an innocent prank.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot so innocent if two freshmen had to spend the night in the infirmary,\u201d grumbled Fukuda. \u201cThe girl was justly reprimanded and that's it. I don't want to argue about your prot\u00e9g\u00e9 any more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, fine. Here, have a Belgian truffle, it shall sveeten your mood.\u201d The round doctor pushed a box to the tall Oriental and rose from the plush guest chair, huffing. \u201cAnyway, if that is all\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, not quite,\u201d Fukuda paused to plop a couple chocolates into her mouth, adding them to the dozen she'd already eaten during their meeting. \u201cDakota Johnson\u2026 uh, Griffith-Johnson called. She is ecstatic about the way we turned her errant daughter around. I have to confess that Carolina's progress astounded me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed. It has been most entertaining to vatch her transformation.\u201d It looked like Dr. Schwartz found the whole world entertaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCertainly the speed with which she started imitating her mother was astounding,\u201d admitted Fukuda. \u201cShe proved my point \u2013 peer pressure is just as effective as your chemicals.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot entirely, though. We should still vatch her. And get ready to employ them should it appear that a relapse to her ways. At the very least I'd recommend a cocktail to alleviate the, uh, minor negative aspects of her weight gain, to fortify her health.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, sure, we could do that. Actually I must say that when I spoke with her yesterday, she asked me for a tailor-made version of our Booster. 'Something like my sister Ginny takes,' were her words, I believe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee? See? I'll immediately get to it. I mean, get my techs on it.\u201d Dr. Schwartz turned to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFukuda sighed. \"But it doesn't feel as rewarding when the victim\u2026 err, patient asks for it herself, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wrong</i>, Dr. Schwartz wanted to say but she knew it was unwise to push her luck. Dr. Hinamizawa already admitted to having been wrong, sort of. It would not pay to provoke her too much now. But she couldn't resist adding: \u201cIn that case ve could add some more substances into the cocktail. Like Y-09-V1 for a smoother, acne-free skin, girls like that\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, yeah, yeah, don't bother me with minutiae, sort out the details yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd Y-15-S to improve her appetite and Y-22-RX to stretch her stomach and\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are incorrigible!\u201d but the harsh words were followed with a happy chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Schwartz noticed Fukuda didn't explicitly forbid her from adding anything. And given who the girl's mother was\u2026  She chuckled too. \u201cOh, I have been corrected many times. Everyone must make sacrifices until our great work is done. But as they say in America, easier to ask forgiveness than permission.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you asked her, Carolina would tell you it was a little unsettling to walk into your hallway after a long hard day at school, only to find a teacher waiting for you there. Even if, this time, the said person was not exactly a teacher. \u201cAuntie Helen? What are you doing here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI vanted to see how my favorite student is doing, mein liebchen,\u201d the Head Counselor had a better look at her and added: \u201cAnd congratulate you to a brand new uniform?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks! Looks fine, doesn't it?\u201d Carrie stopped for a moment to strike a pose. \u201cI gave most of my old clothes to Mrs. Banks and she paid it back to me by using some of the same tricks on this blouse and skirt combo. She said it makes my tummy look smaller?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAch, sicher. It certainly does.\u201d Dr. Schwartz left out that the said 'tummy' was looking far bigger than at the beginning of the semester. She could tell that the Fashion &amp; Design teacher did all she could to mold Carrie's blubber into an overblown hourglass shape but neither her belly nor the expansive behind could yield that much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plumped-up student waddled the door meanwhile and paused. \u201cUmm, where are my manners? Sorry, Auntie. Wanna come in, have a tea, coffee? A snack?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no, no, I shall not burden you for long, liebchen. I just dropped by to give you the first batch of your own personalised Yeng Booster.\u201d And the doctor flourished a sizable vial of full of familiar bluish liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! I've been looking forward to it. So you say it's a special version only for me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed, Carolina. Look, it is even marked so,\u201d and Dr. Schwartz showed her a large label saying <b>Carolina G-J Stomach Booster</b>. \u201cHowever, it is merely a first trial run. After you deplete the vial, come tell Auntie Helen how it made you feel. Und ve shall recalibrate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, I'll come ASAP.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo not overuse it, though,\u201d she wiggled her finger as a warning. \u201cNo more than five drops after each meal and no more than ten times a day. Should undesirable side effects occur, come to me at once.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, right. Thanks a million, Auntie,\u201d and Carrie hugged the little doctor, leaning down to her bluish hair. \u201cYou don't know how much that means for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAch, but I do, I know your mother, mein liebchen. And do not forget. If you have any problems vith your Booster, do tell me immediately. Goodbye, Carolina.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBet on it. Bye!\u201d and Carrie rushed inside her dorm room, eager to put her own booster to the test.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Part of this offer was that Kiyomi would be getting some special benefits at the academy. But to in order to get this offer Kiyomi had to sign a  contract that made it so she would in the future only be able to use and advertise Yeng Corporation products, whether is was food, clothes, electronics or furniture it had to be Yeng. The contract was also special in that Kiyomi's managers couldn't get Kiyomi out of this contract and only Kiyomi herself could do it if she wasn't pleased with her time at Buttercombe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiyomi is known across Japan and is also getting famous around the world. She got very famous due to her ability to sing and her lovable and innocent personality. Even thought Kiyomi is taking a break from fame she still loves her status and fans and wants to be able to update them on her life when possible. The whole reason for her break is to be able to catch up on studying and she is very grateful to Yeng for alloying her to be a transfer student. She has spent months learning English and about American culture and is now ready and excited for school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiyomi wears her long hair in two very stylized  large pigtails. Kiyomi isn't required to wear a normal school uniform, instead she has a uniform that looks like her performance outfit that still has the Buttercombe colors.

Finally she didn't have to be performing and writing songs and could be going to school like a normal teenage girl. Well not exactly normal as she was in another country, with a new and different culture, and she would be getting special treatment due to her contract. The first benefit was the larger then usual dorm room (even for Buttercombe) that she had just entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Is this really my room?</i> Kiyomi thought to herself. <i>Well, I'm glad I signed that contract. Wonder what else they will do to have me keep up the contract.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiyomi put her bags on her absurdly large bed and turned towards the closet where her new custom made uniform was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Guess there's my answer. I still can't believe they let me design my own uniform.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting it on and looking at herself in the mirror she continued. <i>They didn't need to give me all the benefits to get me to come here, but I couldn't really refuse. Just getting to go to school was enough. And advertising only Yeng products doesn't seem that bad. Like they make so much stuff that I'll probably be in every magazine and billboard.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiyomi walked around her room for awhile taking in all the wonder of going to an academy like this. On the table there was a massive gift basket filled with treats that were making Kiyomi's mouth start to water. Right next to the basket was what looked like a smart-phone. It was special Yeng made prototype that came part of the contract. It was made to help Kiyomi study in English. It also allowed her to see her schedule, order food to her room and allowed her to access and update social media. (The social media was monitored by Yeng, so they could block any harmful information getting in and out of the academy) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter picking up the phone and some sweets from the basket Kiyomi walked to her window and looked outside, where she could see some of the student still arriving and being guided to their dorms. Seeing all the people made her think about something she had been wondering about since she arrived here. <i>All the girls she had seen were large. Even the staff appeared to be larger then anyone she had met. Why could this be. Well she had learned about how different the food culture is in America, maybe it had something to do with that. It could sign of wealth or health being that size here. That must be it, that's just what an attractive woman looks like in the western world, right?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mind started quickly wonder towards a different subject<i>. How would people treat her. She definitely stood out with her uniform and being so thin compared to everyone. Would people here even know about her being famous. If they did would they want to be friend or would they think that Kiyomi wouldn't want to be around \"regular people\".  And how would the teacher act, they obviously had to know about her.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll these thoughts were starting to make Kiyomi get nervous, but she snapped out of it as she heard a knock on her door. Who could that be? Wait! Kiyomi was supposed to be getting a tour of the academy and also she had a medical checkup today. Was she late?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiyomi went to open the door and saw...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Kiyomi went to open her door she could hear people talking on the other side. It sounded like to women. Kiyomi opened the door and in front of her stood two rotund girls wearing Buttercombe uniforms. One of them was a tall brunette wearing glasses, the other was a shorter, and much plumber, blond who was almost hiding her face behind her hair. The two large girls had quickly stopped talking when Kiyomi opened the door, and now they stood there looking at her as if they had seen a ghost. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You... You're really...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe taller girl began to talk, but was she was so nervous she was barely able to form words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I meann uhhh... We um.. we are here to...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before she could finish a third girl stepped from behind the first two, shoving them a bit, and started talking herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Listen. I don't really know who you are but these two weirdos are like your fans or something. And they'd like to have your autographs. So before they faint could you like sign some'ing.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Oh, sure. I would love to sign an autograph.\"</i> Kiyomi replied as the third girl stepped back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike the other two girls, who were definitely overweight, the third girl was only slightly chubby. She was redhead, with a face full of dark make up and ear and nose piercings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls nervously stepped up holding posters of Kiyomi, that she then began signing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"With Love from Kiyomi Okura to...?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Oh umm.. I'm Margot\"</i> said the short blond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"And I'm Ann\"</i> continued the taller brunette, then pointed to the third girl. <i>\"And that is Cass\"</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"She doesn't need my name. I ain't gettin' nothing signed.\"</i> Cass huffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting the posters signed the three girls left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"OMG, I can't believe she's really here!\"</i> Margot said whilst clutching her poster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I know. And did you she how pretty and thin she is?\"</i> Ann replied. <i>\"You think we have any classes with her?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Thin. In Buttercombe no one's staying thin for long.\"</i> Cass said under her breath without the other two hearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow one of Kiyomis questions was answered. There definitely are some people who know who Kiyomi is. But not everyone, like for example Cass, which shouldn't be surprising as Kiyomi hasn't really hit the mainstream outside of Japan yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiyomi's day continued after this. Ms. Fukiyama, the school nurse, had come and lead Kiyomi to her office to give her an check up. She was completely healthy, but was given some drugs to adjust to the different air pressure in the mountainous region that Buttercombe was located.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"So just take these for a week and you should be fine\"</i> Said Fukiyama.<br>\r\n<i>\"Now, your classes will start tomorrow. If there's anything I can help you with to prepare just ask\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I think everything is fine\"</i> Kiyomi replied. <i>\"But who will I be going to class with{\"/i}<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Oh, you don't know yet. Well you will be attending some of the easier classes with other transfer students for now and your phone should have an tutoring program on it. Also you can always get some help form the teachers and the tutors. After the first courses are done you can look into getting on some more harder classes. Now is there anything else?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the nurse's check up Kiyomi was free to return to her dorm. She could feel an surprising hunger as she walked through the hallways. Whether it was due to the medicine or just the smell of food coming from other students eating around her, she couldn't resist getting something for herself. She went up to a vending machine and looked inside. Her mouth began watering as she saw the options in front of her. Using her phone she was able to get a handful of chocolate bars for free out of the machine.  <br>\r\nAs Kiyomi continued her way to her dorm, whilst eating the treats she bought, people had started noticing her and Kiyomi started to feel like she was definitely standing out. But that shouldn't have come as a surprise considering how different she looked to everyone with her idol uniform on.</i></span></div></div>",

Throughout the centuries, almost every member of the Marigold family has tried their best to be successful, only for their timidness and stressful lives to cause them to blimp our from stress eating. And no Marigold has graduated under 200 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuliet, while following that trend by getting close to 200, was anything but cautious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving been locked in and sheltered for most of her life by her mother Mo in Valentine, Juliet during her first few days at Buttercombe seemed just as scared as her mother was when she went. However, upon being witness to a public wrestling match up close between Buttercombe and another school, something awakened in her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo longer did she want to be sheltered... now she wanted to feel in constant threat while being able to overcome it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that match, Juliet would try joining the Wrestling Team, only to find it boring for her before quitting. Still trying to find that thrill, Mo would eventually turn to fighting back the bullies of the school, enjoying the occasional punch to the face as long as she got to punch back. She would also take up stunts, such as jumping down the stairs, to fill that hole in her heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually though, Juliet\u2019s Freshman year would end, and as the new year came, the ginger-haired sophomore would climb out of her mother\u2019s SUV carrying multiple bags, and her body carrying various scars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow listen, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s gone on with you during this freshman year of yours, but please be careful... I don\u2019t want you coming home with a scar like last time...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing a bit from her mother\u2019s worry, Juliet would simply shrug at her mother\u2019s comments. \u201cLook mom, I know you want me to be safe, but I\u2019ve kept myself alive haven\u2019t I?

One scar she had gotten from missing a landing on a jump from the top stair to the bottom, while another had been caused by a particularly nasty beat down from Violet Sullivan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, I can\u2019t wait to get into more trouble this year... summer\u2019s been so boring but now I\u2019m free once more!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading off to her new dorm room, Juliet would take her time to empty out her sports gear from her bags, which included some roller skates, some hockey gear, and a dartboard with a bunch of darts. This year, Juliet thought, she would push for an extreme sports club, so that she could put herself even more on the edge, and she was intent on putting that thought into action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually though, as Juliet finished unpacking, she would hear a knock on her door, and as she opened it up she would see...</span></div></div>",

As she did, she would end up seeing a taller woman wearing a maid's headdress, with a rather hefty hourglass like figure. A bit curious about the girl, Juliet would sidestep to let the girl enter, before closing the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... your my new roommate right? What's your name, and what's with that weird headdress?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The name's Camari Marsh. And as for the headdress, it's a remnant of my old outfit, since they have a policy on a uniform that I wish to uphold...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching the woman bow, Juliet would notice Camari's delicate movements, frowning as she realized how much opposite the freshman was to her. While Juliet was excited for getting into danger, to her Camari seemed to be the exact opposite, and a reminder of what her mother is like without the immense fear in her voice. As such, Juliet thought, the girl certainly needed something to change her around, much like how she was changed in her first year...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Camari... I just finished getting unpacked, perhaps once your done getting your stuff unpacked we can go out, and I can help you explore the school in some fun ways? I know some shortcuts through the school so we can use those paths, we just gotta make sure we don't get caught!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" Camari would put down her backpack, slowly unpacking and revealing the rather simple school supplies she brought with her, as well as what appeared to be a feather duster and a spray bottle. \"I would be interested in touring the school, but I don't really want to get in trouble. I got to uphold the Marsh family's diligence since my sister's forsaken it so much...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus, you take your family name so seriously? What are you, a princess or something? We ain't exactly in a school for royalty, this is just a private school, take your chances to live!\" Grabbing her rollerskates and popping off her standard shoes, Juliet would slowly pop on the rollerskates and tie them up, before carefully walking her way to her dorm's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, it's dangerous to skate indoors!\" Camari would try to grab onto Juliet's arms, only to walk back and gasp in fear a bit upon noticing the extreme girl's scars lined up all across her arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm? Oh, are you scared about these scars? Pfft, they're just markers of how I've managed to survive all the stuff I go through! Let's see... this one's from falling down some stairs, this one's from scraping my arm on a ro-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please stop!\" Looking at the scared look on Camari's face, Juliet would snicker a bit, only to see her put her hands on her plump hips, puffing her cheeks up a bit in anger from the snickering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-look, I don't want to get in trouble, but I'm not gonna let you get any more hurt! I'll follow you, but only so I can make sure you don't get any more scars like those! How's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, now I like where your going! You can't stop me from skating through... but I love your spunk for deciding to follow me!\" Patting her potbelly in pride, Juliet would feel her belly rumble, before opening the door. \"How about we head off to the cafeteria first, school pays for all of our meals, so you'll get to enjoy the best cuisine Buttercombe has to offer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I could have a bite to eat, I am a bit peckish...\" Camari would rub her stomach, which was surprisingly flat compared to the rest of her hourglass figure, as she would follow Juliet walk out of the room, before beginning to skate. Trying to keep up, the maid would be running as fast as she could, while Juliet would simply be skating casually, without a care in the world...</span></div></div>",

If the car ride is too stressful you can always help yourself to a snack. I have some more brownies in the back seat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth \"Lizzie\" Thompson leaned over toward the passenger side window and pressed her cheek into the glass as she stared out toward the rolling countryside. This had been the scene for the past two hours now. Stuck in a car while her doting mother ranted and raved about the upcoming year, all the while wishing that she was headed in any other direction than Buttercombe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... more than familiar with where the brownies are, Mom, thanks,\" she replied, staring out the window with a laser focus now. In truth, the brownies were exactly part of the problem. With the windows up, there was nowhere for the smell to escape to except up the nostrils of the listless passenger and nowhere for the confections to escape to except her plump, paunchy pot belly. 3/4ths of the \"little snack\" that Ms Thompson had decided to \"bring for the ride in case anybody gets hungry!\" (anybody obviously meaning her daughter) had already found its way past Lizzie's lips. And two whole trays of 25 brownies each was hardly a little... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Lizzie really, really couldn't help herself. Lizzie ate when she was stressed (or when she was tired, or when she was cranky, or when she was offered) and nothing, <i>nothing</i> could possibly spell out stress like the impressive practically castle-like grandiosity of the Buttercombe Estate finally looming into view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost people didn't have the \"privilege\" of getting to drive up to the private academy with their parents, but Lizzie's mom served dual roles in her life as overbearing (s)mother and as the newly appointed head of the culinary arts department at Buttercombe, a position that Lizzie was... begrudgingly proud of her mom for acquiring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'She'd better,' Lizzie had inwardly fumed upon finding out. 'An entire summer of taste testing better not have been for nothing.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Honey, try this linguini with flaky cheddar on top! After you're done with your fettuccine alfredo, of course,\" her mother had cooed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh ooh sweetheart! Which cupcake do you like better? Make sure you try them both.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. My. Gosh. Sugar Booger, this flan is absolutely divine. Here! Have some more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd every time Lizzie would whine and prevaricate and sulk... then pretty much give in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sigh... You know I was supposed to start my diet today but whatever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, I'm really full already, I- is that whipped topping?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Mommy, my pants don't fit anymore and I need to- mmmm that smells delicious. Did you just make it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat entire summer of taste testing was certainly evident on her physique. Ending her sophomore year at just 225 pounds, Lizzie had sworn the vow to end all vows that she would get her weight under control over the summer, or at least manage not to gain so much. Starting off her junior year at over 260 was a cruel wake up call that she had been putting on weight even faster than usual. And this damn school was sure to be absolutely no help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had remembered hugging her dad goodbye on the front porch just hours earlier. A jovial man himself, much like his wife, he had given her a firm squeeze on her soft shoulder.<br>\r\n\"Careful they don't have to roll you back home this year, pudgy pie,\" he had guffawed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daaaaaad,\" Lizzie had whined, stomping her foot petulantly and sending her thick thighs jiggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"David!\" Her mother had sashayed out the door past him and gave him a stern, disapproving look, one of the few times her face ever formed a frown. \"We don't want our daughter feeling self-conscious on her big day back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm only Haha,\" he laughed, barely even able to get through his own joke, \"Ha-hoping she follows in the Thompson footsteps,\" he grinned, giving his own stunningly fat middle a swat. Ms Thompson was a woman with a passion and a real gift for cooking, and that was certainly evident on the frames of her loved ones. Dave Thompson's entire body shook as he chuckled at his own lame sense of humor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLizzie had to stifle an embarrassed smile. She swore, her dad was the only person on Earth who was even cheesier than her mom. A match made in Heaven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut his point still stood, Lizzie had been unfailingly coming back fatter and fatter every year and with all of the \"strings and connections\" having a Culinary Arts teacher for a mother netted her, she was sincerely worried that this year wouldn't be any different. Not that Lizzie actually <i>needed</i> any help, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLizzie and her willpower had had a bit of a falling out lately, and try as it might to plead with her, remind her how much farther her belly and butt were sticking out or how much wider her hips always seemed to be getting, Elizabeth would listen instead to her sharp cravings and her insatiable tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaid tummy was looking less like a \"tummy\" and more like a \"belly\" as of late, pooching out over her seatbelt and into her lap. Lizzie gave it a frustrated jiggle. She didn't tend to gain too much weight in her stomach and wasn't a fan of seeing it start to look more like a \"Thompson Belly\", as her dad called it. Lizzie's primary concern was her lower half: her ever fleshier cheeks, her ever widening hips, her ever thickening thighs... Her little pot belly sticking out farther than usual might have had something to do with the roughly 30+ brownies she had been cramming down her throat out of anxiety during the whole ride up here. Those on top of the two Number 7s her mother had been so kind to stop for at Big Bob's Best Burgers and and the hearty \"going away breakfast\" she had consumed before even leaving the house. She knew from experience that her tummy would soon shrink back down to a more reasonable size, the bloat instead traveling downward to fill out her proportionally enormous hips to an even more ludicrous degree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Lizzie had done plenty of fretting over how much she had eaten that day but what worried her an even greater degree was that she still wanted <i>even more</i>. The scent of the remaining brownies was calling ever so sweetly to the plump coed and she was trying with every bit of her will not to leap into the back seat and tear them all apart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir garish teal SUV pulled up to the great gates of Buttercombe Academy, gates that, although ancient and prestigious-looking, at once began to open electronically, as if to silently usher them in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLizzie, at this point, had given in and fetched another brownie from behind her as she surveyed her official surroundings for the next few months. Not much looked to have changed. Having arrived early than most other students with her mother, the usual bustle about the academy had yet to take full swing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing the brownie in just two bites, she furtively pinched a love handle and sighed, 'I really have to go easy this year,' she thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that was the thing with this place. It just honestly seemed like there was food <i>everywhere</i>. Every hallway you turned there was a vending machine or even two luring students and faculty alike over with flashy displays and scintillating treats. Outside, the campus was dotted with a myriad of different outdoor kiosks and food stands. Classes themselves had no rules against snacking and her mother had mentioned earlier <i>double lunch periods</i>. Lizzie blanched at the thought; it was almost like her mother was <i>trying</i> to fatten her up sometimes. In truth, she wasn't; Ms Thompson just loved to dote on her \"perfect little angel\" and didn't seem to understand the difference between \"comfort\" and \"comfort food\", her natural inclination toward cooking and baking meant that they were her go-to for just about every problem. It was a wonder Lizzie hadn't blown up sooner. Or, as her dad had put it, \"followed in the family footsteps\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLizzie looked over at her mother as she pulled the car to a stop. It was easy to see the resemblance. Dana Thompson was a remarkably pretty woman and so was her daughter. They had the same golden blonde hair, although Dana wore hers a bit shorter and normally had it done up, the same deep blue eyes, the same angular face and soft chin. They had the same laugh, which Lizzie absolutely hated; Lizzie could easily pass for her mother's mini-me. Well, except for the \"mini\" part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther than their striking resemblance to one another, the two women were of drastically different sizes. While Lizzie was quite a bit overweight at just north of 260 pounds, Dana Thompson was...</span></div></div>",

Said girl was fat, really fat, with two large and puffy cheeks on her childlike face and a double chin that rested on her large bosom. She had her brown hair tied into locks that fell on her soft shoulders. Her whole body was round like a giant walking marshmallow but the most noticeable thing were her huge breasts, each the size of her head, that rested on her round belly. Every movement was followed by the quivering of her entire body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn spite of her large size, she was wearing a trendy and cute pink and black striped t-shirt with frills, which couldn't cover her wide cleavage, a trendy jacket that made her appear even rounder and a skirt in pendant with the shirt. All of this clothes were signed with the mark \"Carlyle\", a small and new fashion house that was quite popular among plus-sized girls like Rose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's the bag, Rosey\" said a gangling man with a brushy mustache. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks daddy\" said the fat girl kissing her father on the cheek before grabbing her trolley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have a nice school year\" said her mother from inside the car \"we'll see this winter\". Her mother was basically an older Rose... that was more than two houndred pounds slimmer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure mommy! Bye bye!\" Said the brunette she waved her plump hand as the car left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a big smile, Rose turned to see the large building behind her. One where she had spent the previous two years, and where she had many many meals, as her body can attest to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to her there was a fat black girl who had just arrived at school. Rosie knew her, she was in the same class after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Tania\" said the fat brunette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the other girl didn't greet back and moved backward. Rose tried to get close, but then Tania turned on her heels and ran 1err... waddled away as if she had seen a ghost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose sighed as she pulled her trolley to school. She was one of the fattest girls of her year, she was already fatter than the majority of graduating students and only a selected few juniors could rival her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Rose didn't mind all the extra weight she put on during these two years. She thought she looked cute, could still find fashionable clothes and could eat anything she wanted without care, unlike, how her friends said, those \"thin girls obsessed with diets\". It didn't help that said friends encouraged Rose's fat positive view. Heck, even the school seemed to support her, not only it provided her all the adjustment for a girl of her size, but she got some special and delicious bars that only few other girls received.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, being that fat had its downsides, like getting tired out after a few steps or getting stuck on the desks, but couldn't outweight the pros for the top-heavy girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she waddled, she saw some other girls, and guessed they were all juniors or at least sophomore since they stopped chatting the moment they noticed the buxom brunette. Rose sighed and ignored them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose was a girl as sweet as her appearance and really wanted to make friends. Unfortunately, her first year at Buttercombe she roomed with a certain Violet Sullivan and quickly became friends with her, followed by Violet's close friend (and right hand woman) Sakura Toshima. Rose was happy to have made immediately two new friends, unfortunately, these were the only one she made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reason is simple, Violet and Sakura were two big mean girls who liked picking on the weak ones and, since Rose had gotten involved with them, everyone feared her even if she couldn't hurt a fly. Still, Rose didn't want to lose Violet and Sakura, they were really nice to her, but would've liked the possibility of making new friends. After all, friends are like chips, the more you get, the better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo years have already passed, that was half of her time as student, and still had two years ahead waiting for her but now the girl was resoluted to make new friends. Many new friends. Maybe she could find some friends who got along with Violet and Sakura, that would've been a dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the first thing she needed was to catch her breath on a bench. All these steps were tiring for the obese brunette, her new dorm could wait.</span></div></div>",

The two shared an equal look of disbelief at the number, but as much as either of them tried to avoid it, the digits stubbornly remained displayed on the scale. <br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d began Dr. Shiro breaking the silence, but wanting to do so in the most inoffensive manner she could, \u201cRose, I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s obvious what I\u2019m going to say next, so I\u2019m going to recommend that you sign up for-Hmmm\u2026\u201d the doctor looked puzzled by something on the paperwork in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm?\u201d  Echoed the big buxom brit, having no idea what the doctor was looking into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell it says here, that last year you actually turned down enrolling in the special services for stipendiaries program?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, right, well\u2026 I didn\u2019t think I really needed it last year. I\u2019ve always heard it was rather embarrassing \u2026And honestly I\u2019ve always been used to being a \u2018bigger\u2019 girl even growing up in England\u2026so I guess I\u2019m just\u2026I dunno\u2026more comfortable getting around with a bit more bulk than others?\u201d Said Rose, feeling a tiny bit more able to speak in confidence to the woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I\u2019m glad you\u2019re at least conscious of the path you\u2019ve been heading down.\u201d Said Dr. Shiro mentally marking Rose as one of the first girls she\u2019s heard of turning down an offer to advance a tier in the SSS program.  \u201cBut, as a physician\u2026\u201d (<i>a Yeng sponsored one at that! Dr. Shiro added privately</i>) \u201c\u2026I strongly suggest you take enrolling consider enrolling in SSS this year. It was designed precisely with students like you in mind.\u201d Dr. Shiro handed Rose a small booklet titled \u2014SSS &amp; YOU\u2014:  from the numerous others piled off to the side on her desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou do only have till the end of the week to decide if you want to easily transfer to a SSS-single room for the semester, it\u2019d be a room with more\u2026dependable\u2026furniture, for a girl such as yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cOh, right\u2026Umm\u2026thanks\u2026\u201d Rose said taking the brochure. Without another word Rose got up and made for the door, her mind now buzzing in thought. 350lbs! Maybe she should enroll in the program\u2026 If anything It would be quite the convenient excuse to not see Sakura and Viola 24/7, and some of the perks involved did sound pretty good from what she could remember hearing about them\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNext?\u201d called Dr. Shiro giving her pen a click,  it felt like today was going to be a loooong day for both of the women.</span></div></div>",

That was nearly  160kg when Rose did the conversion! Even with her height that put her at a BMI of 55\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe numbers literally lingered in front of her too! Belly heavy and beyond being simply \u2018busty\u2019, Rose was reminded of her weight whenever her front half bounced and jiggle doing anything but a slow walk.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlow walking was exactly what she was up to right now in fact, lumbering behind the two senior students gossiping away in front of her, the two women who had turned her life here on the  Buttercombe campus completely upside down since day one! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c-still Rose, I can\u2019t say I\u2019m not a bit jealous you get a room to yourself.\u201d Said Violet Sullivan the senior on the left, a lady with a exceptionally stocky build but a categorically classified \u201cstacked hourglass\u201d frame, her warm Mediterranean skin tone accompanied by a quaff of curly black hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeriously I should have signed up last year.\" said the woman on the right. Similarly raven haired, only with blue streaked highlights and a bob cut, the now severely slender Sakura Toshima continued in her spoiled tone. \"I would have gone all out if I\u2019d know Mom and Dad would make me get a tummy tuck over the summer.\u201d Sakura gave a pout before muttering  \u201cStupid company press photo shoots.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey cheer up Sakura, at least you procedure went well! Not like that girl who got the horrible nose job. Total disaster.\u201d Retorted Viola<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know right!? Talk about \u2018<i>Rhino</i>\u2019-plasty!\u201d That last joke was enough to send the two off cackling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf they\u2019d both turned around they\u2019d see that Rose wasn\u2019t laughing at the moment, in fact she hated their gossiping, all the chitchatting the two did was the exact reason Rose was so renowned as being a bully! She was glad the two were taking her latest news so well though, Rose had committed and signed up for SSS, (although she hadn\u2019t exactly mentioned the major reason was that she wanted a solo room to herself.) Rose immediately found that it had been the right choice too, an extra large bed, a reinforced couch that didn\u2019t sound like it was going to crack every time she sat down on it, and most importantly of all it was on the far opposite side of the level from where Sakura and Violet were rooming, so now, with any luck, Rose might hopefully make a new friend, or, even more optimistically, friends! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of new friends brought her mind back to the present, where it became more focused on the faces of fear the trio got as they power walked past fellow students. Rose wondered at how she could easily be in the exact opposite position as one of the frightened females,  if her very first day of Freshman year had gone only just a tiny bit differently\u2026</span></div></div>",

The night before her first day she\u2019d been so enthusiastic to show off her passion for fashion and clothing design she\u2019d gone and made a few design alterations to her academy attire as soon as she got her hands on it. <b>Bam</b>! A stylish bangle here, a stitch or two to add a pleated design to her shorts there, her name sewn in bright pink cursive over the front breast pocket, and she surely had the most unique outfit in the whole academy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly such alterations had been strictly forbidden by the school\u2026and she\u2019d ended up having to serve a dreaded detention the afternoon of her very first day!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling sick to her stomach as she took her seat in the lonely detention office and still dressed in her designer duds, Rose promised herself she\u2019d never ever end up here again! Minutes later, at the top of the hour, entered the teacher watching over detention that day Ms\u2026 Well, Rose couldn\u2019t really remember the name, but in truth she really wasn\u2019t important. Who <i>were </i>important were the two Sophomore\u2019s who arrived outside the detention rooms door a cool five minutes late. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re late.\u201d The teacher had murmured, not quite strict forceful but more begrudgingly and with a sigh, seemingly familiar with the devious duo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, we\u2019re only\u2026one\u2026two..five minutes\u2026That <i>is </i>pretty damn late.\u201d Had said a younger Violet Sullivan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWon\u2019t happen again.\u201d Assured the heavier Sakura Toshima. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose\u2019s eyes had lit up at the sight of pair. They might have only been a year older but she could tell these two were just so\u2026so\u2026cool! <br>\r\nThe two were surprised to see they weren\u2019t alone here in detention, and interested at their new detention companion, made their way over towards where Rose sat, electing to sit on either side of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow\u2026busted on the first day just like us?\u201d Asked Violet with an arch of her eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Ye-Yeah\u201d mumbled Rose into her double chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you in for?\u201d Sakura  asked in an inviting joking tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy\u2026my uniform.\u201d Said Rose immediately warming up to the attention the two were giving her.  \u201cI wanted to, you know show off for everyone here. Well they say it\u2019s not standard so they sent me here\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? That so stupid! Don\u2019t you think so Violet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTotally unfair, I mean I think your design is awesome! Umm\u2026\u201d she bent it close to read the girls monogrammed name, a bit distorted by the full-size breasts the fabric contained.  \u201cRose!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026I am rather fond of it myself.\u201d Said Rose heart skipping a beat, and sensing a chance to make friends with these cool girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Rose, Sakura, Violet!  All of us here in detention on the first day! That\u2019s like a sign from the universe or something!\u201d said Violet, her green eyes alight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d asked Rose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, we\u2019re soo becoming best friends!\u201d assured Sakura. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShhhh!\u201d came from the teacher at the head of the nearly empty classroom, who then promptly went back to the trashy paperback she\u2019d been thumbing through; Big Cowboys. Bigger Guns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBitch.\u201d whispered Violet.  \u201cSo anyways with our flower names we should be a group, like\u2026the awesome blossoms or something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwesome blossoms? Really? Do you want us to get laughed out of the school\u2026seriously\u2026\u201d Said Sakura shooting a scowl at Violet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was just an idea, you don\u2019t have to bite my head off Sakura. Plus, I don\u2019t hear you coming up with anything!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would if you just gave me a minu-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026how about the Femme\u2019 flowers?\u201d piped Rose from between their argument.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot bad\u2026definitely better\u2026\u201d said Sakura appreciatively. Her eyes widened and a smile dimpled her chubby cheeks before she announced, \u201cWait\u2026I\u2019ve got it\u2026the Fatal Flowers!\u201d she said spreading her fingers for dramatic effect<br>\r\n.<br>\r\n\u201cOh Sakura that\u2019s perfect!\u201d said Violet, giving a thumbs up in agreement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFatal?\u201d squeaked Rose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe name had stuck, and from that moment on the two had taken Rose under their wing. The three did hit it off great! Rose was eager to learn anything and everything the two sophomores had to share, and they even went as far as to request a special three room accommodation to \u201chelp further the freshman\u2019s education\u201d as the put it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne night Rose had brainstormed the idea that if they each used their own jacket she could sew a FF symbol on the back, and since it was their own jackets and coats technically weren\u2019t breaking the rules! Sakura and Violet loved the idea, and so their \u2018gang\u2019 was formed! It was so nice for Rose to have friends, almost like their own special club, Rose loved it! Well\u2026loved it most of the time\u2026sometimes she found that the two could get a bit\u2026pushy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Newbee, that\u2019s the last two slices of pumpkin pie! Fork em\u2019 over! Here Rose, one for me one for you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more time she spent with them, even when it was just her alone around Violet or Sakura separately, they more she noticed how they  seemed to be very\u2026aggressive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust a second blondie, I left my snack card back in my dorm room, and me and Rose here are starving. You wouldn\u2019t mind us borrowing yours for a few swipes at the snack machine right?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay! Rose had to admit after spending more and more time with them, the two were both downright bullies at times! No wonder they\u2019d both ended up in detention on that first day! In fact since that fateful day Rose avoided getting another dreaded detention, but Violet and Sakura had racked up quite a few trips and for quite a few reasons; shouting, curing out a teacher, breaking into a teachers contraband closet, outright taking candy from a student!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose really wasn\u2019t bad girl like them at all\u2026but..she also didn\u2019t want to leave being a part of the Fatal Flowers either! Their rebel bad girl attitude only added to their coolness in the freshman\u2019s eyes, and they\u2019d never done anything nasty to Rose\u2026 So, whenever the other two did get assertive\u2026Rose just sort of staid a few steps back and turned her head the other way, the other two usually complementing her on being a good look out for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConsequently over the last two years the trio\u2019s reputation had grown, and grown, and grown! And so had Rose! Pushing past two hundred pounds her freshman year, and fattening up and up past three hundred during her sophomore semesters, Rose had to admit she just couldn\u2019t say no anytime her friends generously offered their ill gotten gains. The already big British girl blimped up and out, but at least it had been alongside Voila and Sakura\u2026only now\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura had once been quite a big girl and quite a big eater, but now apparently after a tummy tuck over the summer she\u2019d slimmed all the way down to just over 120lbs. Meanwhile Violet was also no stranger to snacking, either possessed the metabolism of an Olympic athlete, or had to have actual Olympic goddess blood from her Greek heritage, because while she did put on the pounds and tip the scales at over 200lbs,  she seemed to only gain in all the right places for a budding woman, the poundage gained only enhancing her curvy inflated hourglass figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it came down to it in fact, the only thing that had grown more than Rose herself was her reputation, again thanks in no small part to Sakura and Viola! Such snack-food shakedown situations often going something like; <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll right you know the deal, fork over the snacks! Or would you Rose here would personally escort you to a swirly?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBetter make it fast too! Rose here doesn\u2019t exactly like waiting when she get\u2019s hungry! Isn\u2019t that right Rose?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, back in the present day here Rose was; 350lbs and a supposed mean streak of being one of the biggest bullies in the whole school. Renowned as the \u201cmuscle\u201d of the fatal flowers, when in actuality she wouldn\u2019t hurt a fly, much less be fast enough to actually swing at one! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, after her new SSS plans maybe now things would be different this year for the trio? Yeah! So far this semester, they\u2019d been pretty pleasant, okay maybe less bossy than normal, but certainly not as bad as last year! It was possible they\u2019d both just mellowed out over the summer before taking their Senior year seriously. </span></div></div>",

I think not.\u201d Proclaimed the girl boldly. \u201cDo you know who you\u2019re talking too? I\u2026am Lily Melinda Taft.

Internally Rose was cheering the girl on, but outwardly she remained silent. She really didn\u2019t like where this was heading, fortunately Rose\u2019s sheer size and Violet and Sakura\u2019s vulgar vocabulary were intimidation enough 99.9% of the time, unfortunately this unrelenting Lily girl looked to be a part of the .01% that wasn\u2019t going to back down from their bullying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh it\u2019s not us you should be afraid of\u2026\u201d said Violet after recapturing her bossy composure. \u201c\u2026Rose on the other hand\u2026\u201d She motioned for Rose to step forward, which Rose did\u2026hesitantly. \u201cWell let\u2019s just say you don\u2019t want to get on her bad side\u2026\u201d Rose could see her own shadowing looming over the girl, her ample figure eclipsing any escape route the poor Lily girl may have had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose took another step forward, the sliver of her exposed belly between the bottom of her honey yellow uniform and the top of her pants jutting out and haphazardly, aimed like a rifle towards Lily on a firing line. Perched above the gargantuan gut were the top two solid cannons that were her JJ sized breasts. All together Rose\u2019s fat formed a solid wall of fleshy intimidation before the much less large Lily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-what are you going to do you c-cow? S-squash me?\u201d Lily was now clearly stressed out, but the fighting spirit her parents ingrained on her hadn\u2019t gone out yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust say you\u2019re sorry...\u201d said Rose her own voice now trembling a bit. \u201cP-please\u2026\u201d she wheezed in a much quieter voice\u2026 Things had never gotten this intense before, and\u2026what exactly WAS Rose going to do if this Lily girl didn\u2019t apologize?</span></div></div>",

She was glad she didn't she didn't have to hurt her but she still felt bad about the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha!!!! Rose you should've seen the look on her face!!! Geez your size always gets them huh Rose.\" Violet said jokingly slapping her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Rose you you could push anyone you wanted around with how big you are. Any bigger and when they are you they'll they won't even put up a fight anymore. But seriously girls I'm starving. Let's hurry up to the cafeteria.\" Sakura said as she started walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose and Violet started walking with her. Rose was still bothered by what happened and a little about what they said. But she was really hungry. She always got hungry after these things. And as always Violet and Sakura would always push her to eat eat more then she could or should just because she was the \"big body\" of their group so she was supposed to eat tons of food. So maybe....maybe she can relax a little at the cafeteria and just eat so she could stop thinking about it.</span></div></div>",

She hangs out with feedees whenever she can, and when not at the cafeteria she's usually ordering a pizza or exercising. She does not realize however that the bigger she gets, the harder it will be to live up to the previous master of the wrestling team, Cassie Hart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVera is a extremely well-endowed girl, with most of her weight going down to her chest as she gains, with the rest going to her gut.

When it came to the younger students, namely the Freshmen and Sophmores, they usually ranged on the smaller size, but with the Juniors and Seniors, they tended to be coming in with a hefty amount of weight, whether they wanted it or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne particular student getting back into school however clearly intended to get bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Thud* *Thud*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith step after heavy step, the woman known as Vera Mist would slowly walk through the halls, carrying a big backpack filled with sweets and snacks of various types, while keeping an eye for the dorm room she was supposed to be in. As soon as she got to her dorm room, the albino woman thought, she would eat the entire contents within her backpack, or at the very least as much as she could before she got full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked though, Vera would feel a bit of a constant pain from her obese body. With her fat mostly accumulating in her breasts, they would represent as a big mass of flesh that would stretch out big and plump, resting on her taut and large belly with only a tiny bit of her breasts sagging over the edge of her gut. In addition, her rump would be big and covered in flab, though not to the degree of her chest and gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her fat however, if one were to actually feel Vera's flab, they could find a noticeable amount of muscle beneath her fat. While Vera had been trying to make sure she was constantly eating when she could, she also took her time to exercise, in order to keep her muscles in shape. So far this has been working well for her, but she did not know if this would last as she got bigger and rounder. This was one of two reasons that she kept to a Tier 1 SSS package, the other being stubbornness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at her list to find her room, Vera would look at the doors as she would continue to walk. \"A-110... A-111... Ah, A-112. I think this should be the room. Maybe now I can sit down and eat for a bit...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the door and squeezing through, Vera would sit down on the couch in her new room, opening her backpack. She was the first one to arrive at her dorm, so for the moment she had the dorm to herself. Grabbing bags of cinnamon rolls out from her backpack, Vera would open them before beginning to chow down, while also pulling out a big bottle of soda to drink alongside it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she ate vigourously however, she would quickly be interrupted by a knock on the door, before seeing it open.

Sighing, Vera would begin to turn around and sit down, but she would end up hearing a \"Excuse me...\" from back by the door, causing her to turn once more, confused a bit. As she leaned forward (nearly causing her to lose balance in the progress), she would end up finally seeing the student that had arrived at her door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the girl, she would appear to be rather curvy, but with a slim stomach, with both her breasts and ass being somewhat squashed together due to her short stature. And as the short girl would look at Vera in turn, she would be quivering a bit in fear, and a bit in excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe short girl would be the first to talk. \"Uh, is this A-112?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, are you supposed to be my roommate or something? I was expecting someone a bit... bigger at least.\" Vera would slowly walk back to grab a cinnammon roll from her back pack as she said that, bringing it up to her mouth as she munched down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... I think. M-my name is Harmony. Harmony Hammond. I was told this was my room, but to tell the truth I didn't expect someone to be so... big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContinuing to look at Vera, Harmony would slowly raise her arm, at first seeming to want to feel Vera's fat, to feel if it was truly soft on the albino woman. Upon second thought however, Harmony would simply just rise her hand forward for a handshake instead. \"So... what's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vera. And that's *munch* all you need to know about *gulp* me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting down rather quickly, Harmony would feel a small shake from in the room as Vera would continue to eat through all of the snacks within her backpack with a ferocity. Realizing the large albino woman's love for food and feeling a bit unrequited about the handshake, Harmony would pull out a couple of cooking supplies, to load up in the fridge for later, keeping out a box of mac and cheese for the albino woman to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well miss Vera, if your still hungry after all that, I can always make you something to eat... not entirely the best cook but I can at least make something palatable for you... if you want that is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing that, Vera would tap her gut, to get a feel of how much room she had, feeling it a bit full, but still taut enough at the moment. After a bit of thinking, Vera would slowly begin to put her snacks away back into her backpack, before throwing it upon the nearest bed. \"You know what, if you want you could make that now, I'd enjoy that a bit. Haven't had a home-cooked meal in a while, mainly just fast food and sweets. Fastest way to improve size after all...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing the words \"increase size\", Harmony would blush heavily, but she would nod as the short woman would begin opening up the box of macaroni and cheese. Looking for any pots and pans in the room, Harmony would sigh, not seeming to find anything before grabbing a couple of plastic bowls and looking up the microwave instructions on her smart phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n___<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about an hour of cooking, Harmony would slowly walk back to her rotund roommate Vera, a couple bowls of macaroni and cheese being hold on a small platter as she placed it down. At the moment Vera was doing a bit of pushups, her breasts squishing as they were pushed into and out of the ground, before stopping as the woman would rest her belly on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Macaroni's done! I had to cook it in a microwave, this room doesn't exactly have pots and pans to cook with. Guess I'll have to buy them one day, but I at least have several bowls for you. So how many do you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All but one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Harmony would blush a bit, as she lowered the platter in front of Vera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard me. All but one of them. I'd eat them all, but I assume your going to have one of them, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah I was going to have one, but... are you sure you have that much of a appetite?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaiting for a response, Harmony would get none as Vera would quickly dig into the first bowl, swallowing the goopy macaroni with the speed of a competitive eater, before moving onto the next. Realizing the woman would eat through all of them if she didn't grab one, the short Hammond girl would quickly grab a bowl, letting Vera continue to eat as she tore through her meal with speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Vera would quickly finish all of her meal, she would feel very full, turning to her side as she rubbed her taut gut, which was now sticking a bit out of her school uniform. Meanwhile, Harmony would simply sit on her bed, slowly eating through her meal as she simply watched Vera eat and eat, finishing at around the same time as Vera despite only having one bowl compared to the albino's 6.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wow... you really have a appetite...\" Harmony would slowly go to pick up the now empty bowls strewn in front of Vera. Putting them in the sink, the short girl would simply leave them there, as she simply walked in front of the junior's belly, before kneeling down. \"Do you mind if I... touch your belly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Humph... don't really care. If you want to feel my gut go ahead, you made me a damn good meal so I'll let you do that... this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing as she slowly brought her hand down to the albino girl's gut, Harmony would blush heavily as she felt the hardness of the compact belly, filled to the brim with macaroni and snacks. Moving up and down, Harmony would feel a bit of muscle to the sides of her gut, buried beneath her fat causing the Hammond to feel a bit aroused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Harmony could feel any more however, the bell would ring, quickly snapping her out of her curiosity. \"Oh, that should be the lunch bell I think! You need help getting up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I should be capable of getting up myself...\" Turning around back onto her stomach, Vera would belch a bit as her full stomach was pushed to the ground, before using her arms to push up back onto her feet. Once again towering a bit over the girl, the fat junior would slowly walk to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a bit full, but I can at least get some food to eat later from the cafeteria, right? You think you can help carry for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding a bit, Harmony would walk with Vera from behind, getting a good look at her big and firm behind as the two made their way to the cafeteria...</span></div></div>",

She was used to feeling small thanks to her naturally diminutive stature, but Vera seemed to be the biggest, fattest, most imposing woman she had ever seen in her entire life. It was incredibly hard for her to not stare at the taller and wider woman as she confidently strode through the hallway towards the cafeteria, her breasts, and stomach bouncing in time with her heavy footfalls on the floor. She felt the blood rush to her face as she remembered how fast Vera put away all the food she made, just how much space was in that belly of hers? She didn't know why she was feeling all of these emotions, and so intensely, but Harmony wanted the answer to that question; badly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore her freshman roommate had known it, Vera entered into the cafeteria of the academy with Harmony still trailing behind, almost instantly making her way towards the food counter. They had gotten here much earlier than most of the other students, so the line was relatively short, but Vera\u2019s order, much to the staff managing the kitchen, was long. \u201cThanks again for holding my food.\u201d The bigger of the duo shoved a tray into Harmony\u2019s arms, to which she replied she was happy to help. Internally, however, she was regretting ever volunteering in the first place; she had no idea her roommate was going to make her load so heavy! Huge globs of sweet baked beans, two helpings of glazed carrots, almost an entire fried chicken, and an oversized bowl of potato leek soup with a big cup of chocolate milk were placed on the smaller woman\u2019s arms, her struggle apparent to Vera. \u201cC\u2019mon, it\u2019s not that much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarmony assumed that Vera would lead her back out of the cafeteria to their dormitory, but instead she was guided to a nearby bench to set the food down on, the 400 lb girl\u2019s weight making the seat under her ass bend. \u201cWait...you\u2019re not going to start eating now, right? After all the food I made you earlier?\u201d Harmony blinked and was not ashamed to let her jaw drop at Vera\u2019s nonchalant shoulder shrug in response. \u201cBut I thought you said you were full?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said that I\u2019m kinda full, a small but important difference between actually full.\u201d Vera offered a slight smile to her exasperated roomie before looking down at her assortment of food spread in front of her, wondering what to start with first. She was stuffed, but she decided on her way to the cafeteria that she might as well try and push her limits as to how much food she can carry; she was dedicated to her growth. Finally, her eyes landed on the buttery, salty soup that was being served today and decided on that. If she was in her room, she would simply grip the bowl on both sides and lift the rim to her mouth, but in the cafeteria, she was not oblivious to common manners. \u201cOof\u2026\u201d she exhaled as the first spoonful hit her stuffed stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you alright?\u201d Harmony asked, sitting down beside her. \u201cIf you want, I can carry it back to-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Vera cut her off with an irritated expression before it softened to a more apologetic one. \u201cSorry, I mean...I\u2019m fine. It\u2019s just soup, you know? It\u2019s a little embarrassing If this Is what I can't hold down.\u201d The fat albino took another spoonful and winced through the pain before taking on another. It hurt to have that much food in her stomach, but at the same time, the more she ate, the easier it became. It felt more like she was pushing her physical prowess to her limits rather than punishing her body. Soon, faster than Harmony expected, all that was left of the potato leek soup was a few stains at the bottom of the now-empty bowl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVera\u2019s stomach, already incredibly prominent before, now stuck out even further, taut and pink from all the pressure the food created. She patted the tightly packed sphere of flab and muscle with a smile on her face, while all the while Harmony looked like she was in awe. \"I've never seen anyone eat so much as you...\" The words escaped Harmony's mouth without her being aware of it, simply too enthralled by how big Vera's stomach had become. \"So, like...does it hurt? Gah, sorry, stupid question...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVera lets out a small smile and patted Harmony on the shoulder to snap her out of her self-loathing, the powerful muscles that are hidden underneath her flab accidentally knocking the air out of her roomie. \"Nah, it's alright. Yeah, it hurts a little, but in a good way, like after you went to the gym. Think of this as my wrestler's training.\" She slapped her stomach, the pale orb wobbling as the food began to digest and break down within. \"Do you think you can carry the rest of the food back to our room, though? My arms are going to be busy making sure my gut doesn't move too much.\" She Shoves her hands underneath her globe of a belly and stood up, the chubby mitts stabilizing any movement that might have occurred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, s-sure!\" Harmony nodded, quickly lifting the heavy tray back into her arms, a bit easier now without the calorie-laden soup. \"Goodness, I can't believe you're going to eat all of this for dinner...\" The small woman stared down at the great display of food in her arms. Just the carrots alone would be enough to fill her up and then some.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dinner? What makes you say that?\" Vera tilted her neck to one side on confusion at the roommate. \"Lunch isn't the only meal the school gives us, you know. The food you're carrying is going to tide me over until then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are...are y-y-you messing with me?\" Harmony went slack-jawed once again. \"You just ate enough food to last me, like, a day! How can you still be hungry?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not.\" Vera shrugged. \"But I'm going to be. I'm full now, yeah, but in a couple of hours, I won't. I'm apart of the academy's wrestling team, so when I'm not eating, I'm exercising, and working out always gives me my appetite back.\" With that explained, Vera turned her prodigious backside at Harmony once again as she made her way out from the cafeteria, the smaller woman looking at the albino incredulously for a few moments before a hot blush came across her cheeks. Not wanting to get left behind, she rushed after her, thinking (and hoping) that this will be the routine for the rest of the year at Buttercombe Academy.</span></div></div>",

As the heavyset albino would leave though, Hannah would end up going off in a different direction, since as a freshman the young Hammond would have to get set up with all of the proper services offered at Buttercombe, including her Tier 1 SSS services.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking out to the field, Vera would plop down her stuff before beginning to do some crunches to exercise her leg muscles. At her size, it was very difficult for her to do such as a bunch of her fat would get in the way, however as she continued to struggle, Vera would slowly rise bit by bit, before falling fast and pulling up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she continued her cycle, Vera would count the number of times she would rise, which would climb slowly but surely. \"11... huff... 12... huff... 13...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Vera, I think you may have gotten a bit too big for crunches like those... I mean look at you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing the voice, Vera would quickly rise up and glare at a chunky pear-shaped woman with red hair, which she would recognize as one of her wrestling mates, Darcy Garcia. Only being about 150 pounds lighter than the albino Junior and a foot shorter, most of the woman's weight would lead into a booty that would almost match Vera's own ass in size, leaving the albino woman a bit envious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, shut up Darcy. I don't need you to criticize my exercising...\" As she would stand a bit, Vera would wipe a bit of sweat from her rounded and heavy gut, before taking a small swig of chocolate milk from her thermos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw don't worry sweetie, I'm just worried about our strongest member. After all if you got too big, we'd lose a major part of our group, and our results would struggle. Not to mention I wouldn't get a chance to spar with you again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing this, Vera would sigh with a bit of displeasure, before walking up close to Darcy, thermos in hand. \"There is no such thing as too big. Anyone who thinks that is just simply not strong enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what are you going to do when your hips get too big to stand properly then, or if your gut gets so big that your weighed to the floor? What then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, like your one to talk with those thunder thighs like yours...\" Walking up to Darcy's side, Vera would quickly tap at the redhead's thighs, causing them to jiggle loudly as her behind would clap a bit. \"And those thighs do seem bigger than before we left for summer...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh... shut up, and let's jog...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to continue the conversation out of a bit of mild embarrasment at that comment, Darcy would quickly begin to jog at a fair pace, her thick thighs sliding against each other with loud claps as she would move her legs. Vera would quickly follow behind the girl, her loud footsteps causing her gargantuan breasts to bounce up and down over time, though the albino woman would not be able to run as fast as Darcy due to her weight slowing her down somewhat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually though, the two wrestlers would end up getting tired after almost a hour of running, and as they would walk to the closest benches, the two would think a bit, before having Vera sit on the bench and Darcy on the ground. After all, both of the girls thought, if both of them sat on it, the bench would most likely break, and they would have to pay for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrinking the rest of her thermos in a single big gulp, Vera would look down at Darcy from her seat as she would slowly open her container of beans, eating slowly from it . \"Really though, what caused you to gain all that booty over the summer? I'm actually a bit envious...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon realizing that Vera was actually curious, Darcy would simply sigh and cross her legs as much as she could for such a pear-shaped woman with thick fat-laden thighs and legs. \"To be honest, it was because I broke an arm and had to stay in bed for a few weeks. Normally I try to keep my weight stable in the summer due to mom being such a fat chef, but I couldn't do my usual exercises. But at the least now my arm's all better, and I can exercise...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's good to hear... sorry for being a bit mean to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, Vera. I know what size means to you. It's just I wanna keep you from getting... well too big to play. Maybe I can help manage your weight, find some even ground in staying fit and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I should be okay for now.\" Vera would close her now half-empty container of beans and slowly rise from her seat, patting her gut a bit before doing a few stretches. \"I just need to get big enough to where I can win every time, and then I can try balancing my weight. Simple as that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope your right about that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about a half an hour more of exercise, Vera would turn her way back from Darcy, waving goodbye as she planned to march back to her dorm room for a after-exercise meal. While Vera did enjoy Darcy quite a bit, she was a bit annoyed in the girl's constant worries about her health and weight. At the very least though, Vera could trust Darcy for her expertise in wrestling, being able to keep up with herself in the ring as well as being a master in using her behind to weigh her opponents down. Hopefully, Vera thought, she was able to keep her skills up over the summer despite her injuries...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Oh, h-hey there, Vera!\" Harmony stood up from her bed as she heard Vera enter into their dorm; she could hear her coming down the hallway outside, as well, her heavy footfalls making audible thuds through the walls. \"Did you, uh...have a good time with your wrestling practice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More or less. It did work up an appetite, though.\" Vera walked briskly from the door to the little mini-fridge that their room had, setting the empty Thermo and container on top to wash later before opening it up to get the rest of the food inside. Harmony blushed heavily from the action; her bed was situated just opposite of the fridge, and as Vera bent down to retrieve more food to eat, her impressive backside was shoved mere inches from her torso. Harmony bit her lip as she tried to look away, failing hard; Vera's workout had left a thin film of sweat on her skin, leaving her half-exposed ass glistening softly in the room's light. \"Hey, do you think you wanna come to dinner with me and my friends?\" Before Harmony was tempted to reach out and grope the fatty flesh in front of her, Vera stood back up, carrying the rest of the food she had got from the cafeteria earlier in her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Um, you mean like the cafeteria, right?\" Hammond tried not to stare as Vera made her way to her bed before sitting down, the wood and springs underneath her fat behind groaning ominously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I was thinking of heading out into Wellington, the town. There's this sushi place that's kind of out of the way, but the wrestling team loves it, and I think you might, too.\" The food that Vera had in her arms was a pre-dinner snack, not dinner, chowing down voraciously on the cold carrots and fried chicken. Normally, when people asked Harmony to go out for sushi, she would have told them 'conveyor belt only' and been done with it, but she had a sudden thought. She didn't have the same appetite as Vera had, but she was infatuated with watching her eat, and it was making her hungry as well. Perhaps, just this once, she could afford to splurge a little and take up that offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, we can do sushi if you'd like. As long as it does not take too long.\" Vera tried to act cool about the offer and not sound so very eager for the idea so her roommate doesn't suspect anything. \"Classes start tomorrow, you know. I want to make sure I get a good night's sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, right. I understand. I'm going to pull up the directions to a great place that I know.\" Vera chuckled out loud, pulling out her cell phone from her pocket as she ate. It was kind of amazing how she could focus on eating with one hand and use her phone with another simultaneously. \"I didn't see you eat anything for lunch, earlier, so I bet you're starving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarmony smiled and rolled her eyes. \"Well, thank you for caring about me, new roomie. Do you think we could head out now, though? My appetite isn't going to last forever and I might just settle to eat a protein bar instead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVera dropped the last bit of fried chicken roll from her plastic fork and let out a soft gasp, looking quite surprised by what Harmony said. \"Wait...what? Just a protein bar? Harmony, forgive me for making comments on your personal choices and lifestyle, but a protein bar as a replacement for a proper dinner is not suitable at ALL for any person! You could end up getting yourself sick!\" Hammond was taken aback by how passionate her roommate was about her having dinner. Thinking about it, however, it made sense that someone who deliberately tried to get fat on purpose would care about food, but she made a good point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarmony was silent for a moment before replying. \"...alright, Vera. I guess I can afford to treat myself, at least for one night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\" Vera nodded before setting the empty containers on the side of her bed. She stood up and walked towards the door, motioning for her roommate to follow her. \"Trust me, Harmony, it really will be worth going out for some good and filling food tonight. I know how to treat my friends well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...friends?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometime later, Vera and Harmony had made their way off the campus grounds of the academy and were walking down the streets of Wellington. Hammond thought it would be a good idea for her to eat food that was freshly prepared and was filling for once, as it would be beneficial for her health, but the real reason why she came was that Vera would be there with her. She was the sort of woman who could subsist an entire day off of a protein bar, two pieces of toast, and a single scrambled egg without even flinching. Sometimes even the egg wasn't needed either. How much sushi would her stomach be able to withstand?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Harmony. Don't keep standing out in the cold, or you might get sick!\" Vera beckoned her to follow him inside the building. Harmony flinched as she realized the two had made it to the place in question, but she was so caught up in her train of thought that she just kept walking. The questions that had plagued the girl's mind at that moment were quickly forgotten about; as fast as they had initially appeared, they were already gone. When they stepped inside, Harmony was surprised to see that it was already so busy despite the time of night. There were people of all ages, even teenagers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay, Harmony? You seem a tad shaken. Did you realize you were allergic to sushi or something because if you are, we can go somewhere else-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarmony shook her head. \"No, it's fine. I'm fine. I would not mind eating here. It seems like this place is rather popular, but also not a well-known chain either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed. It's a place that becomes beloved through word-of-mouth rather than an abundance of newspaper ads or expensive commercials. They don't waste money trying to coax people into their establishment by brand recognition or flashy pictures, they let their cooking do all of the talking. They use their money to buy more expensive, fresher ingredients and hire cooks who are capable of making the food. I came across this place when I was eating with some officers, so they told me about it. I thought you would like it, Harmony.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we'll have to see what kind of authentic sushi they prepare here.\" She remarked. She reached into her back-pocket to retrieve her wallet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Vera held up her hand to stop her. \"No, it's alright, Harmony. I'd be happy to treat you this time. I told you in the car that I treat my friends with well, yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but...!\" Harmony stuttered, a little blown away by how generous her new roommate was being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yoohoo! Vera! Over here!\" A voice rang out from the crowd, one that Vera recognized, and she instantly made her way over to it, leaving harmony behind for her to follow. The two made their way to one of the low tables where another duo was already seated. Darcy was seated at one end, while on the other end...</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Upon hearing the high-pitched voice, Vera could immediately recognize it as another one of her wrestling teammates as well as her best friend Josie Hishinari, currently sitting down with a towering pile of salmon and rice, sitting next to Darcy, who was merely just eating a normal-sized portion of tempura shrimp. Wanting to sit and reconcile with Josie, Vera would immediately sit to the right of the big blonde woman, while Harmony would merely stare at the size of both her and the wide-hipped Darcy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh It's been all summer Vera!\" Josie would say while holding a handful of salmon, not being the kind of girl to care about public etiquette, much to Darcy's embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same Darcy, and your a lot bigger than you were in Spring too!' Vera would casually touch Josie's big belly, a bit packed but with plenty more room to be filled. While Josie weighed the exact same as Vera, her breasts were much stronger, with her belly being much wider in exchange, swallowing up the edge of the side of the table she was sitting at and requiring her to reach a bit to reach her food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh nothing usual, I've just been pushing myself to eat as much as I can without bursting. My older sister's been helping me too... ooh, I could pull up a pic for you to see her, she just pushed 600 at Stuffington U!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"600... I-isn't that a bit much?\" As Harmony would slowly sit down, she would take her seat next to Darcy due to there not being enough space on Vera's edge of the table. Sitting down, Harmony could feel the wide woman's hips almost brush her, even with a bit of space between the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally noticing the petite woman, Josie would turn to look at Harmony, putting down her phone for a bit as she turned to look at the brown-haired Hammond. \"Ooh, who's your new friend Vera?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, she's just my roommate for this year, Harmony... Hammond I think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarcy would raise her eyes a bit as she heard the name of the woman sitting next to her from Vera. \"A Hammond huh? Related to Hannah perhaps? I heard some rumors about her, about her fattening up any woman she's with...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah, she's my aunt...\" Harmony would blush red all over, feeling delight from sitting next to so many obese women, though not knowing women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well hopefully your not like her then. Don't want my hips bloating up big enough to make it impossible to go through doors, after all.\" Once she was done talking, Darcy would grab and eat a tempura from her plate. Thinking about the idea of Darcy's hips growing to a gargantuan size being unable to fit through doors, Harmony would smile a bit with pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Josie and Darcy would continue to eat, the four women would continue to talk, as Vera and Harmony would wait for their orders. Vera would get a pile of shrimp, tuna, salmon, and rice that was similar in size to Josie's meal, while Harmony would simply get a serving of tamago sushi and salmon, eating slowly as she watched the two gargantuan balls of fat eat with a fast stride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So *munch* Josie...\" Vera would swallow a huge mouthful of salmon, before continuing. \"You were saying about your sister?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah!\" Josie would finish off her plate, which was nearly depleted of salmon and rice before Vera's meal had arrived, before pulling out her phone and pulling up a picture of her sister. \"Yeah, my sister finally grazed 600 pounds, and she's aiming to get even bigger! I've even heard she's considering a career as a competitive eater and food critic!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the picture, Vera would smile heartily, seeing a gargantuan woman riding a electric scooter across the halls of Stuffington. The woman was on all accounts extremely big, with her hips particularly sticking out both to the side and behind her by a good distance. In the picture, the woman would be holding a jumbo-sized hot dog with relish on it, with a clear bite already on the hot dog implying she was in the middle of eating it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I hope she has a great career! Man, if she were a wrestler, she'd be so amazing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe a sumo wrestler, Vera... 600 pounds is way too big for a woman...\" Darcy would shrug as she listened to the comments of both Josie and Vera, pushing away her plate due to being done eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you sure?\" Harmony would be a bit nervous, but despite not knowing why she felt like she should talk. \"I feel like it's a... good weight to be...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, even Harmony agrees with me, and she's such a small fry. Hey waiter, another plate of salmon and rice for my friend Josie, and another serving of tempura for Darcy here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, no thanks, I'm satisfied!\" Darcy would sigh and blush a bit as she watched her blonde friend receive another big serving of rice and salmon. While she was proud of her hips, she didn't like being fat and was not into getting any bigger, hence why she was eating light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while of eating, everyone would be done with their meals, with Vera, Josie, and Harmony being packed tight with food, while Darcy would merely have a slightly filled gut. While the albino and blonde woman were simply eating for the sake of getting bigger, Harmony only ate enough food to fill herself to the limit due to being infatuated with the girl's overeating and wanting to emulate it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof... I overdid it...\" Harmony would lie back in her chair, rubbing her rounded gut, which was raising up her uniform the tiniest bit, a bit in a circular manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah... same here, but I'm glad I *bworp* did...\" Vera would be patting her packed gut heartily, causing her to burp loudly a bit and causing Darcy to be even more embarrased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I should probably be getting home now, I gotta get ready for class tomorrow. I think my first class should be cooking or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which teacher? Cause I think I got Miss Crowley, and she's also my first class... I think.\" Harmony would tap Darcy on her hips a bit to get her attention, as she raised her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I got Crowley soon... If your asking if I need a assistant though, I don't really need one. My roommate Rosa already agreed to, since we also were both having the same teacher.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, you really should see Darcy cook, she makes amazing cakes!\" Josie would still be bubbly with energy, despite having a keg-sized full belly resting on the table and causing it to shudder from the weight. Darcy would blush from Josie's comment, but would ignore it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotta agree, she really does make some great cakes, but Darcy's right. I should probably head home to sleep too. Need to rest and digest for another full day of eating and learning...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRising up from her seat and holding up her gut with both of her hands, Vera would leave enough cash to pay for the group's meals, before beckoning for Harmony to follow her as the two would begin walking home. The sky dark and the moon rising a bit in the sky, Harmony would stick close to Vera's belly, watching it bounce as the two would slowly walk home to their dormitories...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Harmony's eyes were tired, but she refused to shut them and go to bed just yet. Even though her body cried out for rest, Hammond refused and instead focused all her attention on her roommate's body. Vera was sitting on the other side of the room, the albino woman's huge gut heaving up and down with each breath, and as the food from her dinner digested, Harmony swore it grew just the tiniest bit every time it swelled. She was tempted to walk over and climb into the bed with her, press her hands against the massive stomach and feel it grow under her touch. Of course, that's not what she did that night; but it was definitely what she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarmony's thoughts were still focused on Vera even as she began to doze off, her body getting tired of her ignoring ts needs and forcing her eyes closed. Yet her mind was still buzzing with activity. She thought about how much bigger her new roommate will get this year, and how she may be able to help her with her unusual quest. That night, her dreams were filled with ideas and potential scenarios about how her life at Buttercombe Academy will pan out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVera leaned back with a contented sigh that quickly devolved into a ribald belch. \u201cOof! That was good! What\u2019s up next?\u201d The waitress of the sushi restaurant swallowed the dryness in her throat and turned away from the massively engorged albino girl, surveying what was left of the buffet of food behind her. Spatterings of sauce and crumbs adorned the metal surface of the bar, the contents of each tray having been licked clean by the ravenous wrestler girl behind her. Stiffly, the waitress took a step forward and desperately surveyed the nearby tables, and those, too, were utterly barren. The heaping mounds of food they had once held were now contained in the massive, fatty, blob of a gut that was churning away happily behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the sushi restaurant's waitress felt a warm, soft mass ooze onto her back. She tried to step away but was too slow. The tide of fat encroaching upon her had already pinned her against the buffet, rolls, and divots of warm, pale chub squishing around her. The unfortunate waitress\u2019 blood turned to ice as she was smooshed deeply into Vera's massively fat belly, her body sinking into the warm flab as the bottomless pit of the wrestler hauled her in close. \u201cOh? Is there nothing left out here?\u201d Vera asked, her eyes scanning the same empty platters and plates just as the waitress had done moments ago. \u201cAww, but I\u2019m still so hungry\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waitress stood still as she felt Vera's huge belly gurgle and quiver against her body. The roiling, gooey churns of her happily digesting stomach were deafening...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the doors to the kitchen burst open, a huge cart covered in five-star dishes emerging, followed by the timid chef pushing it along. Vera perked up at the sound, and the engorged wrestler flashed her new servitor a wide grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi! Did you bring me more tasty treats? My belly\u2019s only about halfway full, so I can fit a lot more food inside me!\" Vera pushed the waitress aside so nothing would impede her from her food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How...how can you still be eating?!\u201d The chef shouted, stopping dead in her tracks and leaving the cart unattended. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell...I'm still hungry, that's why I'm eating!\u201d Vera said with a giggle and a petit burp, taking a heaping handful of her tummy and wobbling it. Waves of soft blubber rolled and jiggled at her touch. The albino girl\u2019s massive gut utterly dominated her form, dragging along the floor as she trudged along on her tree-trunk thighs. Impossibly wide hips sporting an immeasurably fat ass followed along in her wake, decimating any doorways the wrestler happened across and bowling over anything that wasn\u2019t buried beneath her belly fat or plucked up and added to it. Though the girl's blobby tits were as large as her head, or perhaps even more, they still looked small in comparison to the rest of her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two remaining staff workers at the sushi restaurant didn\u2019t have any words to describe how they felt about this woman still being here. She came in the morning and refused to leave long after everyone else went home. They watched as Vera hauled her tremendous, quaking bulk upwards and trotted her merry way towards the cart of food. The mounds of fat that coated her body moved more akin to pudding than to flesh. Each hefty, floor-creaking step sent her many rolls of blubber into motion. The entirety of her body swayed from side to side as she moved, her blubber moving as though on a delay from her steps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith each tremendous footfall, her engorged gut sloshed, gurgled, and protested the movement. How could one person possibly eat so much?! When Vera had wandered into their restaurant she had certainly been plump, but now she had become positively mountainous, and was still craving for more!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chef and the waitress were still caught up in her whirlwind of conflicting thoughts as Vera polished off the last of the food on the cart, sending the platter that previously held the last dish down her throat for good measure. Another small belch was stifled, and another satisfied pat was awarded to her tummy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHumming cheerfully once more, Vera grasped two overflowing handfuls of blubber and mashed them together. Her fingers sank deep into the dough, pressing deep down into the layers of her fat yet still failing to find even a hint of the stomach that rested beneath. The fact that her fat was becoming too thick to even feel the rest of her body through was\u2026 exhilarating for Vera, to say the least. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was more exhilarating and exciting, however, was digesting all of that meaty slop. Her stomach boomed forth as it happily went to work. Hot, pulsating walls kneaded and ground down into the food she had gorged upon, softening and mushing it together, slowly working all of those diverse dishes and the server who prepared them into a single, sloppy mass of semi-liquid calories. Once everything was thoroughly mulched and mashed, her meals were ready for their next, and final step. Vera\u2019s stomach roughly pumped the mass of fattening goop into the latter half of her guts, siphoning the stew down and forcing it into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that finished, Vera grew even fatter. Her dune of a belly bulged out even further with fresh layers of flab, rolling across the carpet and knocking over the cart that had once held a banquet-sized feast. Quivers of delight went up and down her body as her chest expanded, fatty globes sinking into her belly and weighing even more heavily upon her. Her lardy ass expanded with great, lurching wobbles, hanging lower and lower while providing a convenient shelf for her rolls of fat and too-generous love handles to rest upon. To support her even more massive butt, Vera's thighs expanded to something more akin to redwoods than the mighty oaks they had been before. A veritable barrelful of soft fat now had to slide and ooze past its twin with every step she took, not that anyone would ever be able to see it with her obscene belly in the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, only a few gently burbling dregs remained within her pit of a stomach. Vera felt giddy as she surveyed her immense mass, drinking in every sensation of her huge, warm, soft body--and fantasizing about what it would feel like to be even bigger. Fatter, larger, more immense. She wanted her gut to fill rooms and then overflow them, and with her appetite and current mass, that wasn\u2019t a far-off goal. All she had to do was keep eating, stuff herself silly, devour more and more. More of Vera, and less of everything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarmony awoke as she heard a series of groans and creaks come over from Vera's bed as her roommate stirred, the titanic albino woman rolling onto her back and pulling off the covers of her mostly naked body. Harmony arose drowsily, remembering her dream as clear as day as the blinding midday sun peered in through the window. She watched the fat hippo of a woman turn around as she heard movement behind her, her belly had shrunk down significantly down to its normal size but had noticeably grown an inch or two from its original size yesterday. Her gigantic thighs still squished together, and her huge, heaving chest was sagging down to her belly, round and soft as they were last night with perhaps a tiny bit more volume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh hey, You\u2019re up! Ready for breakfast, roomie?\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Breakfast would be simple for the two to get, with Vera getting a large stack of eggs and sausages and Harmony settling for a simple stack of three pancakes and two fried eggs. Normally, Harmony would only get a slice of toast and an egg at home, but something about Vera's appetite was driving herself to eat more, though she was not sure why herself. Once the two were done with their breakfast, the two would split ways, Harmony finding and finding Darcy to head to her first class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Vera, she was off with Josie to head to her first class, which just so happened to be her favorite: Gym class...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n___<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFitting herself into a gym uniform while within one of the gym's washrooms, Vera would look at herself in the gym's locker room, checking out her body. She could barely feel any changes, but she had felt like her gym shorts were a bit tighter, and that her gym tee seemed to be riding up the tiniest bit higher, causing her to smile a bit as she would turn around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Josie, how are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Having a bit of a problem getting these shorts on, but otherwise fine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaiting for her friend to finish getting into her clothes, Vera would get out of the washroom and meet up with the gut-heavy woman. Looking at her, Vera would notice that the girl's gym clothes were a smaller size than her own, and on Josie's body they looked like they were skin-tight on her body. \"Think you may have to get some new clothes soon with how your growing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know! I'm so excited for that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smile on their faces, the two girls would join the other students to the gym, seeing the school's round and plump coach, Marsha Alberway munching on a single jumbo-sized dog as she counted the class's attendance. In the past she had tried bringing in a baseball team in a school initiative to bring in sports, but like most of the sports besides wrestling, her baseball team would fall out, though she would stay employed and would eventually be promoted to primary coach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday though Marsha seemed to be happy, and as she finished attendance, she would put her board and pencil down. \"Ah, normally I would be sad today, but I have some very good news! The old wrestling coach has unfortunately retired, but one of my old students from back when I was new here has agreed to work here as a tertiary coach for here, as well as a temporary coach for the wrestling team! Now, please welcome Cassie Hart!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing the name, Vera would heavily smile, as she watched the blonde-haired and extremely pear-shaped and overweight Cassie Hart pass through the double doors into the gym hall. Vera had known about this woman all her life, knowing her as a champion holding several belts despite her immense size, and being a figure she could look up to as well. And as the albino woman stared at her hero, she would see her rubbing a full belly while walking up to be side by side with her old coach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, it's good to meet you again after all these years. It looks like you haven't changed much since I graduated...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh...\" Marsha would nervously laugh a bit as she finished off her chili dog. \"You seem smaller than when you graduated though, quite a bit in fact.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that, well I just didn't get that much to eat after graduation. Being a wrestler doesn't exactly pay well, and I still have to pay for both myself and Jean. Now...\" Turning around, Cassie would pat her stomach, letting loose a small belch as she addressed the class. \"As you may know, I'm Cassie Hart, winner of some local wrestling championships in this state. Just because I'm big doesn't mean I'm strong, and if you want to do well in this class, you better sure make your all strong too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Vera and a few other new and thin Freshmen would yell, before realizing that they were on their own in chanting and slowly lowering their hands in embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, as the coach of the wrestling team, I will let everyone know that while first meeting for all the members of last year who haven't graduated is today after all classes, sign-ups will not begin next week. If you wish to sign up, just ask me or Miss Alberway here and we'll help you get registered.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking a bit forward, Marsha would blow her whistle. \"Okay, so for now let's do some walking... 5 laps should do for now, and if anyone still has stamina than may-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha, you gotta push your students harder than that!\" Cassie would walk behind Marsha and pat her on the back a bit hard, causing the redhead to blush a bit. \"20 laps minimum everyone, no excuses! Go, go, go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeavily happy, Vera would get up and start walking around with all of the other students, her big and plump breasts bouncing with each and every step. While most of the Seniors and Juniors were either mad or depressed at having to walk 20 laps, Josie included, Vera would walk with a joyous stride, both excited at the chance to build some more muscle strength for her fat as well as for a chance to impress her hero as much as the albino woman could...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Meanwhile, at another part of Buttercombe Academy's expansive campus, Harmony was attending her first class as well, 'Culinary Arts', a more stylish way of saying 'Cooking'. The room was laid out to have rows of shared desks in the middle and several miniature kitchen stations hugging the walls, each of them equipped with the bare minimum a student needed to make a three-course meal at the very least. \"Alright, class, good morning to you all!\" An athletic-looking woman with dark red hair was standing at the front of the class, the words 'Ms. Amber Crowley' written in marker on the whiteboard behind her and standing in great contrast to the students, many of them chubby, some of them properly fat, and one or two around the same size as Vera. Harmony looked around her and found Darcy from the sushi restaurant last night behind her, the wide-hipped girl meeting her gaze and smiling in recognition. The Hammond returned her smile before diverting her attention back to Ms. Crowley's speech. \"Tomorrow we'll be going over proper...er, nutritional etiquette, but today, I want to see where everyone is regarding their experience in cooking. I'm going to assign you all into pairs of two, and then please go over to an available kitchen and get a feel for everything by cooking your favorite dish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if the stars had aligned at just the right sequence in the heavens, Harmony found to her surprise that Darcy and she would become partners, for today and the rest of the semester. After the rest of the class was paired with someone else, Amber Crowley released them all from their desks and instructed them towards the kitchens, while she would walk around and observe to make sure things were going smoothly. The kitchens, the Hammond found, were well-equipped, but quite small, something that was very apparent to her as her new partner accidentally hip-checked her for the fourth time in the first five minutes. \"S-sorry about that, Harmony...\" Darcy apologized with an ever-increasing blush on her face. \"If you want, I can ask Ms. Crowley to switch if this is too much of a problem.\" Harmony, despite the blush she was mirroring, shook her head with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-that's alright, Darcy. I'm happy to have you as my partner!\" She smiled, putting the wide-hipped girl at ease, at least somewhat. \"So, what were you thinking to cook? She said to make our favorite meal, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pomegranate-Honey Glazed Chicken,\" Darcy said with a smile...but Harmony could tell that her heart was not into it, it looked strained and forced. \"I mean, it's not my favorite, and I know that's what the teacher asked us to make, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about we make my favorite, instead? I'd hate to see you eat something you don't like?\" Harmony offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Darcy shook her head. \"No, it's not that I don't like glazed chicken, I love it! It's just...I don't love it as much as cheeseburgers...\" Her blush came back, looking dejectedly at her fat-swathed rear end and thighs, swamping over the kitchen's counter and pushing some utensils out of the way. \"I've been trying to eat healthy as of late, trying to get rid of this fat ass. It gets in the way and has a mind of its own. I can't turn around without accidentally hitting someone with it, which I'm sure you know now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey, we all deserve cheat days, right? Your, uh...posterior is bigger than average, yes, but you're not so bloated anywhere else, from what I can see.\" Harmony tentatively moved forward to place her hand on Darcy's shoulder, not liking her new partner putting herself down. \"And, if you don't mind me saying...I'd k-kill to h-h-have an ass like yours...\" Harmony instantly regretted what she said the moment it left her mouth. Why did she say that!? It was so forward and personal, and she had only known the girl for less than half of a day!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Darcy's reaction to the comment was not negative at all. \"O-oh! Well...thank you, Harmony. I still think it's too big, but your right, I have all semester to get rid of it. Today's cheat day~.\" She turned around to put the ingredients for her glazed chicken meal away, accidentally bumping her prodigious rear end into Harmony once again. The Hammond blushed heavily from the action but said nothing, figuring she was going to have to get used to those globes of butt blubber crashing into her if Darcy was going to be her partner. And, secretly, she was planning to convince the girl to have more 'cheat days' in the future, meaning it might be more of a 'problem' at the time went on. \"So, any suggestions for what we should use for our hamburgers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mayonnaise, maybe? And bacon, grilled onions, and maybe I can make some fries to go with it?\" Harmony was quick to offer the most calorie-laden foods to put into their creation, which Darcy did not object to. \"And...look! This freezer has Ice Cream! Do you know what goes great with burgers and fries? Milkshaks~\" Darcy nodded, getting a mixer machine for Harmony to use, while the Hammond began dicing up pieces of pineapple and pie crust to make a pineapple upside-down cake flavored shake. Dumping pretty much the whole carton into the blender along with a liberal smothering of salted caramel syrup, she set the machine on low so that she could focus her attention on the other projects in the kitchen that needed attending to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Ms. Crowley, walking around the class to see if there was anyone who needed help getting settled with their new kitchens, noticed what Harmony and Darcy were making from afar and frowned. So many calories, she thought, and theirs probably were one of the more healthy meals being made out of everyone else. When she told her students to cook their favorite meals, she didn't think that most of them would make pancakes and pizza and meat pies and pasta. She was going to have a serious time of reigning in their diets this semester.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNear the end of class, Harmony and Darcy were finally done with their meal. There were two hamburgers, one for each of them to enjoy, each of them stacked high with three beef patties dripping with grease and slices of cheese, next to an impressive pile of fries and a tall glass of milkshake topped with whipped cream. Darcy knew that all the calories in what she was about to eat were going to go straight to her ass...but it looked soooooo good. </span></div></div>",

How could the teenager not sleep like a queen knowing she \u201cearned\u201d the prime position she\u2019d worked her way towards?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving come from a rougher neighborhood than most Buttercombe girls, Camela knew to get anywhere in Buttercombe you had to live m\u00e1s! Even before her Buttercombe years, she learned from experiencing life the hard way that if you wanted to get things done you had to be a bit demanding and willing to break some rules! And also, unlike what she imagined about most of the girls here, she hadn\u2019t come from a wealthy or powerful family, no her own family was far from privileged, and that meant Camela had to promptly learn how to take advantage of all the school offered, and them some! Lunch passes, snack machine discounts, special perks for offering to be an R.A, the school was giving opportunities away, and Camela being woman of action was all too willing to take and take and take anything that was being given out! In her hunger for perks and opportunities to rise up the ranks, she\u2019d gotten power hungry! It was sometime during her Sophomore year though all those opportunities and responsibilities, and perks, well they started to just go a bit to her head\u2026and her stomach\u2026oh and especially her ass! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Camela dressed in front of her room\u2019s mirror she still had to marvel every time her reflection showed   how chunky her tanned chocolate colored chulo had gotten! Now a senior at the school the latina\u2019s body was now inescapable of being described as anything other than large, or grande or gorda by her family, and yet her ass was still proportionally just plain bigger than the rest of her. Not that she minded at all, hell it made sitting all the more plush and pleasurable. In fact she really didn\u2019t dislike anything about her swollen size, if anything it only meant the on rush of more and more perks for her. No cafeteria fees AND dorm deliver thanks to the SSS, with the promise of more to come now that she\u2019d reached tier IV! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer new size also seemed to gift her with an unanticipated bonus\u2026 intimidation. Any skinny freshman who was going to give Camela (or Ms. Menica if she was feeling particularly bossy that day) would think twice before getting into an argument with a woman who weighed three times what she did. Camela\u2019s supreme size, unconsciously or not, frightened quite a few annoying students back into following rules Camela\u2019s rules.  Yes, all in all Camela had \u201cearned\u201d the good life; a senior, SSS privileges,  the special R.A\u2019s room to herself,  and a butt load of New-bee\u2019s she could boss around!  She knew though she couldn\u2019t relax just yet, not before letting this year\u2019s floor know that their R.A was large and in charge here! Take for instance what she was doing now\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach semester a complimentary welcome basket was left in all rooms for each girl attending Buttercombe, complete with complimentary chocolate muffin. Now fully dressed, Camela quickly snatched each and every muffin from each and every gift basket. You wanted to be large and in charge you have to earn it, just like she did, no matter how many other students and co-eds she had to step on to get there, when Camela wanted something she did anything it took to get what she wanted. Anything. Plus, rewarding any newbie that wanted to get on Camela\u2019s good side with a chocolate muffin would be icing on the cake.  Wolfing down three of the chocolate chipped calorie laden delights as a prelude to breakfast, Camela went and washed up in her bathroom. On her way she noticed there was some mail she hadn\u2019t read yet, probably more about that SSS perks and changes they were making this year, she\u2019d definitely look into those later. M\u00e1s prima!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCamela could hear high pitched voices, and footsteps now, knowing these same voices would be  begging to do favors for her days from now, and the matching footsteps would be hurriedly carrying out anything she asked them to do or face her wrath. One last time she checked the mirror making sure she looked flawless, that her entire appearance was spot on and exuded power, so every Freshman, Sophomore, Junior or even other Seniors that were living on her floor, would all quickly come to know that she was Camela Menica and she had the power here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving her room Camela took her first look at the students of her floor as they came flooding in, Camela could see\u2026</span></div></div>",

Seems like mostly freshmen this year, not a weight over 250. Nice. Freshmen are fun. What a blessing for her senior year. \"As you may already know, my name is Carmela M\u00e1rquez Mencia. I am your RA. This means I run things around here. THAT is the first rule.\" Carmela turned to the white board behind her and grabbed a blue dry-erase marker from its tray. She wrote \"#1: I AM IN CHARGE\" in big letters on it. As she wrote, her rump and armflab jiggled slightly. She liked that. She turned back to the congregation. \"This is the most important rule. You do what I tell you, and I do what I want. For example, you may have noticed that I've taken all of your muffins from your welcome baskets. I did this because I could, and because I like muffins. I'll be eating all of them. You can't have them back. Now, while I am the person in power and my power is absolute, this will be the only time I abuse that power unprovoked. But understand that if you break the rules, ESPECIALLY rule 1, I will not hesitate to requisition your property, put you under indentured servitude, or mete out your punishment in any other way I see fit. Is that understood?\" The room grumbled with \"yes\"es and \"yeah\"s as Carmela put her hands on her hips. \"Good.\" She picked up a clipboard from her podium. \"Now here are the other rules straight from the Buttercombe student handbook...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Carmela paced across the front of the room like a navy general, reading out every minute syllable of the residence hall rules (boring shit like \"the trash cans must never be more than 85% filled\" and \"showers must only last 20 minutes maximum\") Catie Ranganathan and Dee Saurel whispered to each other in the back of the room. \"I hate this fuckin' bitch.\" \"I know right? We just got here and she's already getting on my nerves.\" Both were the only seniors in the room other than Carmela, transfers from out of state. Catie and Dee were best friends and essentially sisters from a young age, attached at the hip since elementary school. After, let's say, an \"incident\" involving her parents' in-ground swimming pool, underage drinking, and lots and lots of green Jello mix, Dee was sent off to Buttercombe as a means of straightening her out and getting her away from the \"bad influences\" she'd been hanging out with. Of course, Catie was heartbroken to find this out and begged her very permissive folks to send her away too, a request they happily obliged. And so here they were, both far away from home, getting lectured about how much dust they can let accumulate on the tops of their wardrobes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So now,\" Carmela started, pulling a padded rolling chair from beside her and sitting and straddling it, back to her chest, \"we're gonna get to know each other. Your floormates are going to be great friends of yours, I'm sure of it. We're gonna go around the room and you're gonna tell us your name, your year, where you're from, and three facts about yourself. Three facts, you ask? Why three? Because I said so. I'm not letting you off the hook. Who wants to start?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...And silence. A thin freshman with dyed blue hair coughs, but says nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmela clears her throat and rolls a little on her chair, which creaks under her bulk. \"I guess I'll start and we'll go clockwise. Ahem, I am Carmela M\u00e1rquez Mencia, which you should know if you were paying attention, God help you if you don't. I am a senior, but I want to try and go for a fifth year because I love it here so much.\" Dee looked to her friend and made a mock gag motion with her finger and her mouth. They giggled silently. \"I'm from Philadelphia, but I was born in Puerto Plata in the Dominican Republic. Three facts about myself: my favorite food is empanadas, but the idiots in the cafeteria can't make Latin American food for shit here so I haven't had one in a looooong time, when I graduate I want to pursue either criminal justice or law in my higher education, and if you want to get on my good side I DO accept bribes. Okay, that's me. You next.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the finger turned to Catie. She put on a faux-\"happy to be here\" voice, but everyone could tell she wasn't too jazzed. \"Hi, I'm Catherine Ranganathan, but you can all call me Catie. I'm a senior, transferred from Ohio, which is coincidentally also where I'm from. I, uh, I guess I wanna go into culinary school or business or something so I can own a restaurant like my oldest brother. I used to play softball at my old school. And\u2026 Oh! My family on my dad's side is Bengali.\" Carmela's ears perked up at the word \"culinary\". She looked the girl over: she was about her height with dark hair that complimented her tan skin, styled into a long ponytail that rested on her left shoulder. She had big brown eyes and angular, groomed eyebrows, very much on fleek. She was a little pudgy, mostly on her broader than average hips, but very small for a senior. Carmela made a mental note to keep an eye on her. Those cooking skills could come in handy\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen was Dee's turn. \"Do I have to?\", she muttered to her friend, who elbowed her without looking, smiling a big fake smile. \"Fine.\" She made no effort to conceal how much she didn't want to be here. \"I'm Dee Saurel. My transcript says my name is Mary Saurel, but it's wrong. My name is Dee. I'm also a senior and I also transferred from Ohio. Do I have to say three facts? Can't I just say one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmela looked unamused. \"Three facts.\" This chick looked like a troublemaker. She had a late-2010s alt-girl look to her: dyed blonde hair messily done up into two pigtails, a black choker, wireframe circular glasses that probably weren't prescription, a septum piercing rotated out of symmetry, strong eyeliner, black lipstick, pale white skin. She wore a black leather jacket over her uniform and was stick thin, a few inches shorter than her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran through quickly, to get it over with. \"Ugh. I'm here because I turned the pool into jello. I didn't come to this school on my own free will. When I graduate I don't want to do anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmela made another mental note: this girl's gonna break a lot of rules. She'll have her worshipping her 24/7 by the end of all the punishment she'll have to mete out. She couldn't wait.</span></div></div>",

Directly after the floor meeting that morning she had changed from her prim and proper Buttercombe uniform back into her more comfortable clothes: a big white undershirt and a tight pair of felt shorts which did very little to cover her behind and clung to her like panties. She munched on a bag of Cheetos, which she had almost completely devoured. After she finished the bag, which made up her breakfast along with all 30 of muffins she had requisitioned this morning, she licked off her cheese-stained fingers and mentally prepared for lunch. Ahh, this was the good life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmela was, like all the faculty and staff of Buttercombe, enrolled in the Special Services for Stipendiaries program. She was in the fourth tier, which was typically intended for students and teachers with mobility issues who wouldn't normally be able to make it to class, but because of her weight and a childhood asthma diagnosis of which she hadn't had an attack in almost a decade, she very easily qualified. This had a number of perks: voluntary class attendance, free lunches, extra amenities for her room upon request, and more, but her absolute favorite of these perks had to be cafeteria delivery. Discounts came with every subsequent SSS tier, but even at tier 3 it was still something of a luxury. But tier 4? It was free. Free food and free delivery. At the push of a button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmela stood up, stretched, scratched an itch on her ass, and plodded barefoot over to the desk where her Y-Pad was. She started it up, opened the BUTTERCOMBE CAFETERIA app, and scrolled through today's menu. The move-in day offerings were always more opulent than normal, so Carm clicked a lot of boxes. Like, a LOT of boxes. Two, no, THREE large pizzas, four XL orders of the INCREDIBLE mac and cheese, fifty chicken nuggets, four two-liter bottles of root beer (her favorite), and a slice of chocolate cake. No, actually make that a whole chocolate cake. If she can't finish it in one sitting, well, there's more for later. And this was LUNCH.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter placing her order, Carmela plodded back to her spot on the bed and flopped down, springs squeaking under her bulk, turned Netflix back on, and waited.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><b>SATURDAY, 11:49 AM: ROOM 407 - CARMELA'S ROOM</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmela was halfway through her second pizza when there was a knock at her door. Ugh. The goddamn nerve of these kids. Since we saw her last, Carmela had received her opulent to say the least lunch. The tantalizing spread had been unloaded atop the coffee table as she watched, unmoving and lounging on her bed. She also demanded the delivery girls push the table across the room to her bedside so she could have easier access. Her intent to move from her position was non-existent; the less exertion the better. This was move-in day, for crying out loud! What more productive thing to do but sample the best the Buttercombe cafeteria had to offer\u2026 and sample she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore her rude interruption, Carm had wolfed down in record time three of four orders of mac and cheese, barely breathing between bites, about half of her chicken nuggets, one and a half of her root beer bottles, and finally experienced one of the greatest culinary ideas she had ever conceptualized. Since she mentioned it at the floor meeting, Carmela had been thinking about Mexican food. How she hadn't had a really good burrito in a long time. Or a great taco. Then, mouth full of cheesy pasta, eyeing the pizzas yet to grace her taste buds, inspiration struck. She opened one of the boxes and dumped one of her mac and cheese containers onto the circular pie, then sprinkled chicken nuggets into the mix. She rolled the pizza up, bread sagging with grease, cheese coming out of its tubular opening, and held it like an award. My God. It's fucking beautiful. She chomped down on her giant pizza burrito and continued and continued, the cheese staining the margins of her mouth and chin like a poorly applied yellow lipstick. Occasionally stray macaronis dropped down onto her lap and shirt and cleavage, an unfortunate casualty of her display of gluttony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter devouring the whole thing, Carm leaned back to catch her breath. She rubbed her belly, which was taut but still hidden beneath her baggy shirt. Memories of seconds ago danced in her head. She belched, something she only really tried to do at the end of meals as some sort of cosmic compliment to the chef, but she couldn't help herself. There was so much, she needed to make room. Fuuuuck. Then, in her moment of respite, a knock at her door, and from Carmela, a different kind of \"fuuuuuck.\" She tried to stay silent in the hopes that whoever was knocking would think she's out and go away, but that thought process was interrupted with another beefy burp. They knocked again. Well, shit. Guess she had to answer now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, on the other side of the door was Catie, the aspiring restaurant owner from before. She was still in her Buttercombe uniform since she and Dee, her roommate, didn't have a chance to change yet. She held in her hand the roommate agreement form and room inspection checklist, very basic paperwork for dorm living, but she was bracing herself for the worst from her RA, especially because of the signage on her door saying \"IF THIS DOOR IS SHUT, I'M BUSY\". But she wasn't prepared to take any shit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom inside, there was a persistent thudding of footsteps until the door swung open, hitting Catie with an overwhelming pizza smell as Carmela stared her down. Even though Carmela was the same height as Catie, she seemed to loom above her like a grand mountain. Her mouth was covered in cheese and sauce, bent to a slight frown. She had very clearly been interrupted. \"What do you want. Can't you read the sign? It says when the door's closed I'm busy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatie was, of course, prepared. \"Well Carmela, I'm just here for my room inspection. I'd like to get it over with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmela rudely licked some of the cheese from her lower lip. \"Didn't I tell you at the meeting to wait for tomorrow for that? I've got- URRRRRRP. Work to do today.\" She didn't excuse herself after her burp, instead lifting up her shirt slightly to expose her fat gut, giving it a little jiggle so as to convey \"the work I just spoke of is stuffing my face\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, I'd like to get it over with. I have things to do tomorrow, and so does my roommate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed to Catie that Carm admired her persistence, but really she realized that she could use this interruption to her advantage. \"Alright. Fine. I'll get my clipboard and we'll do your inspection.\" She shut the door in Catie's face. This was annoying, but it was a chance for HER to be annoying.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Camela continued to squint her eyes a bit, adding to her already hoggish like appearance. It looked like someone was moving a vending machine down the hallway or something? \u00a1Excelente! More vending machines for her to raid at the end of each month with her R.A. master key.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait a minute\u2026*<b>Boom</b>* *<b>Boom</b>*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat wasn\u2019t a machine that was moving\u2026*<b>Thump</b>* *<b>Smack</b>* *<b>Bang</b>*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was\u2026<u>THE </u>absolutely largest girl Camela had ever seen! And she\u2019d spent three years at this school! Now her eyes were nearly bulging out of their sockets trying to comprehend this\u2026this\u2026enormous mound of booming blubber as it slowly made its way towards where she stood. Tall as well as wide, each step of her waddle seemed to echo down the hall sending Camela\u2019s own frame slightly trembling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-no way.\u201d Camela weakly gawked, as the gigantic student now continued thundering her way closer with every step. As the heavyset heap of flab loomed nearer, Camela could see more and more outrageous details of the girthy girl come into view.  A great whopper of a stomach surged out and upright, making the white top she wore look like a tightly drawn cream colored beanbag. The gut her top failed to contained bounced from below the outfit, with each movement sending it visible flopping atop the girls tree trunk like thighs. Her breasts bobbed along with the rest of her body, they were ample and perky enough they almost seemed to force her arms a bit to her sides. Below the top-half of tonnage, her heavy thighs bustled forward in a slow steady motion, but her hips had enough of a wobble and bounce that Camela could tell there was a prodigious posterior being trucked behind the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was another thing, Camela quickly came to realize.  Camela could personally confirm, some days her own <i>tremendo culo</i> had meant she\u2019d fight to get out of chairs, i.e. adjusting to her own weight over the years had often been a bit of a struggle.  Yet, she simply couldn\u2019t get over how the gargantuan girl seemed to move so easily,  like she was comfortable crating around such heft. Even getting red faced  this fatty never seemed to awkwardly stumble or stagger to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201c\u00a1Hostia puta!\u201d Camela cursed under her breath, slipping back into her native tongue as the large and wide woman locomotive finally came to a rest, right outside the R.A\u2019s door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhew!\u2026Are you\u2026the R.A?\u201d the gargantuan girl exhaled noisily, wiping a few beads of sweat from her forehead before resting her expansive backside against the wall opposite of Camela. Caught like a deer in headlights Camela only nodded. In response, the girl reached into her voluminous cleavage with her  sausage like fingers and retrieved an envelope, she then extended the moist crinkled honeysuckle yellow letter towards Camela. Camela gingerly plucked it from the girls pudgy paw, the letter having been bathed in both sweat and the outrageously obese female\u2019s perfume of choice. As Camela began to open the letter, the sizable schoolgirl then immediately began fishing about in the purse she carried till she found a king size candy bar and quickly worked her way through it, her delivery duty now done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruthfully,  Camela actually had been sent the exact same note just the night before, and if she had browsed her mail that morning she might have been a tiny bit better prepared for this surprise wrecking ball that had crashed her plans. Since arriving here days earlier than most other students, (another R.A perk) her mind had been absorbed with making sure everyone knew she was going to be the big shot around here\u2026only now\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile reading the message, the Latina lass couldn\u2019t keep her jaw from dropping even further at this sudden shocking turn of events;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Rush Immediate Attention to; Camela Mencia R.A <br>\r\n<br>\r\n It is with great pleasure that I now inform you that the relative of one of our most influential alumni will be residing on your floor.

The Latina lass was pretty sure she had butchered the name somewhere; it was clearly foreign, just like the girl overwhelming her doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whale of a woman (still resting her monumental as on the wall); had a dusty brown skin that certainly seemed natural, thin brown eyes and shoulder-length black hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmph?\u201d The girl mumbled, her fat cheeks flooded with the last remnants of her chocolate bar, as she dully responded to her name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t talking <i>to</i> you.\u201d Camela replied with a hint of iciness in her voice. All-in-all she was rather annoyed; she had planned to head down to the cafeteria at some point for the welcome feast, but now she had no idea what she was supposed to do!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh.\u201d The girl replied, licking her fingertips of any chocolate residue; before opening her mouth again. \u201cCan I come in? My feet are tired.\u201d Without waiting for any kind of answer, the behemoth of a girl huffed and puffed in an effort to push her colossal ass off of the wall and began to waddle towards Camela!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the kind of effort one saved for wafting away a fly, the titanic teen pushed Camela aside! It was like the R.A was a freshmen again; getting pushed around by all the obese seniors! Stomach pressed against stomach as Kanda waddled into the dorm room and approached the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, with a grace that did not fit her elephantine proportions, the girl lowered herself onto the couch. The metal bent, but held as the land whale made herself comfortable. Now happily seated, the girl began to fan herself with one fat hand, her tongue lolling as she panted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry; I can\u2019t\u2026*puff*\u2026stand for very long\u2026*wheeze*\u2026at my\u2026*gasp*\u2026size.\u201d She forced out, her voluminous chest rising and falling like a set of bellows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCamela was dumbfounded and speechless. First this queen of the sea cows shows up, then she gets a weird letter about babysitting her or something, then the girl just <i>waltzes</i> into her dorm room like she owns the place!? This would not stand! She strode towards the intruder, her buoyant buttocks bouncing with her rage, and stood ready to give this girl a verbal bitch-slap she was never going to forget\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Camela held her tongue; remembering the letter that still resided, scrunched up, in her balled fist. As she tried to remain calm; the lardass seemed to have regained her breath, and was now pulling out various candy bars and other unhealthy snacks from her purse in some fast-food version of Mary Poppins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you explain why you are here?\u201d Camela asked, poorly hiding her snarl behind gritted teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*Ommmph* *urp*\u201d The response wasn\u2019t very promising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry\u2026didn\u2019t catch that\u2026\u201d Camela replied, barely hiding her venom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*Gulp* Mom\u2019s rich.\u201d Came the audible reply, before the Thai teen stuffed her face full of junk again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk that line of questioning was going nowhere. \u201cAnd you are in what year\u2026?\u201d Camela asked, changing the subject and hoping to herself she wouldn\u2019t be dealing with this butterball for too long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*URP* Sophomore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMierda\u2026\u201d Camela cursed, that meant she would need to be shown all the ropes. Wait\u2026sophomore\u2026this girl was HUGE!? How was she only a sophomore! On learning this fact, Camela studied her (literal) huge problem more closely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKanda wasn\u2019t overly big in any specific area; she just seemed equally huge no matter what part of her you looked at, she was fat from top to toe. Hell, Camela was even wondering if this girl could even wiggle her toes. Staring closer, Camela tried to eyeball the girl\u2019s weight. She wasn\u2019t a great judge at just how fat someone was, but she gave it a shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor starters she was clearly bigger than Camela, so that put high three-hundred pounds out of the running. Five-hundred? Nah, that was a bit too big. Four fifty? Hmmm, little low-ball there. High four hundred pounds? That was probably right; and insane when Camela thought about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a near-quarter ton teen, Kanda was surprisingly well-dressed. Her top fit her well, with only a sliver of cinnamon skin peeking out from under the lip. And her Khaki pants didn\u2019t seem to be busting at the seams; in fact she had managed to tuck her big belly into them quite comfortably. She seemed pretty prim in general. She had neatly applied makeup, and her hair (while clearly naturally straight) had been curled and dyed a chocolate brown at the tips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPretty-little-rich-girl or not, Camela still wanted this blubbery ball out of her dorm room, NOW!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStomping closer, Camela loomed over the seated leviathan. Still she went unnoticed in the face of the girl\u2019s gorging; so with one swipe Camela snatched the soda can the girthy girl had been guzzling from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen. I don\u2019t care what that letter says.\u201d She snapped. \u201cBut you can\u2019t come into my dorm and treat it like your hotel. <u>Go</u>. <u>To</u>. <u>Your</u>. <u>Own</u>. <u>Room</u>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCamela was quite happy with herself as she straightened up. She hadn\u2019t been outright rude, so the Headmistress or the Vice Principal couldn\u2019t do squat. But she had laid down the law, like an R.A should (for once in her life).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up at the Latina Senior, the bigger of the two women opened her mouth\u2026</span></div></div>",

But by the last few minutes as they rolled up the mountain path, she had begun to run out! Shino had had to (*gasp!*) ration them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was why she was in such a great mood, because now that she had planted her fat little feet back on Buttercombe soil\u2026she could restock her supply seemingly endlessly! So with a barrel-like soda drink tucked under one arm, and a sack-sized empty bag of chips flowing in the wind behind her, Shino re-entered Buttercombe academy for her senior year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything was as she remembered it, including the indoor golf karts. Without wasting a second, Shino waddled her rotund form over and dropped her luggage in the back of the kart, meanwhile placing her drink in the front. It took a lot of effort to get one of her stubby cone-like legs over the seat, but once her fat rump was settled in Shino was set.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the steering wheel proved to be problematic however. It seemed the pounds that Shino had put on over the holidays had found their way to her big bloated ball-like waist, meaning her stocky arms had trouble reaching around it as her belly pressed into the bottom of the steering wheel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually by leaning forward (meaning she could also slurp her drink whilst driving) she got her tubby fingers around her target and she was off.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShino hadn\u2019t always been fat; in fact she was the only member of her immediate family who even breached the \u201csoft\u201d description. It all started when her parents both started working for Yeng corp. One day they brought home some free samples for their daughter, and Shino was eager to try them. After trying them, all she could think of was more (Her parents didn\u2019t curb her eating either. They couldn\u2019t say no to their only child.); the additives had really made a serious impact on her. Whether it was because the snacks were untested ones that had somehow got out of the lab, or that Shino had been too young at the time to have such strong additives, or if she was just more vulnerable to additives in general\u2026nobody knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what was obvious was that the once skinny girl became bigger and bigger as the years passed. Her weight really took off once she and her family moved to the states, and Shino was enrolled in Buttercombe Academy. With no barriers to her relentless eating, she swelled like she was hooked up to the stuff. Shino was always the first girl in her class to hit the next level of SSS. Level 3\u2019s automatic enrolment on having a BMI of 35 was paltry to a girl who had hit a BMI of 60 in her junior year. There was talk of putting her on tier 4, but Shino was oddly active for a girl of her roundness, so it had been postponed\u2026for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShino had also never been one to complain much, so any joint pain thanks to her incredible weight she kept quiet about. It also helped taking the school golf karts and scooters as often as possible. She was practically wheeled about from dawn till dusk. Like right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Beep beep!</i> Kawaii girl comin\u2019 through!\u201d Shino chuckled as she passed by some of her fellow seniors as they waddled towards the front desk to get their keycards. Shino\u2019s chipper attitude made her pretty likeable among her classmates, with only the brattiest of bitches truly disliking her. That said, she only had a select small circle of tried and true friends; although their bad habits together was murder on each other\u2019s waistlines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShino rolled up to the front desk and leaned further over the steering wheel. \u201cHiiii!\u201d She greeted the overweight woman behind the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello Shino! Looking forward to another year?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYup! It\u2019ll be the <i>bestest</i>!\u201d Shnio replied back with a big beaming grin across her chubby cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaha! Wonderful; your chipper spirit keeps me feeling young.\u201d The woman chuckled heartily. \u201cHere\u2019s your keycard.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe card was passed from one set of chubby sausage-fingers to the other, but before Shino could race off to her new dorm room, the older woman spoke again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust letting you know, I was told that you need to see someone before you get too settled in.\u201d She said quickly, catching Shino before she could put her foot on the peddle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh?\u201d She replied; this was a bit unusual. \"Who is it?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Shocked gasps and hushed whispers passed through the entrance to Buttercombe Academy; the freshmen had never seen anyone so clearly, obviously and blatantly\u2026fat before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDull thuds echoed across the high-roofed ceiling as Peggy Wilson lumbered forwards to get her room keycard for the year. Her gigantic flabby form rippled and jiggled with every step, her poorly fitting clothes creaked and groaned with the burden of containing her, combined with the excess pressure each rocking step put on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach step was punctuated with a deep wheezing breath that flew through her upturned pig-like nose, resulting in a constant stream of little hoggish snorts. As Peggy had grown bigger and fatter over the years, walking had become less and less desirable to her\u2026but today she was driven by one desire, to get to the welcome feast and make as much use out of it as possible. She wanted to gorge, to glut herself, to eat until she couldn\u2019t fit another morsel past her plump pink lips. That was worth any amount of walking to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter exchanging pleasantries with the tubby woman handing out the keycards, Peggy waddled over to the elevator (walking she could do, but stairs she had signed herself off of ever taking again). Despite the fact it was already filled with plenty of other students, Peggy squished her way in. She hadn\u2019t eaten for fifteen minutes, and her mouth was watering at the thought of more food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Peggy! Had a nice vacation?\u201d The redhead on her right greeted, completely ignoring how Peggy\u2019s belly was squeezed against her, or how her own looming tits were overlapping Peggy\u2019s torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was already *rnnk*\u201d Peggy grunted. \u201cFood was totally meh though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redhead covered her mouth to stifle her laugh. \u201cHaha! I swear Peg, all you think about is food. We\u2019re gonna have to roll you out at graduation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that point, the elevator dinged to signal it had stopped at Peggy\u2019s floor and ending their conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Peggy sloshed her fat form out into the corridor she thought about what the girl in the elevator had said; rolled out at graduation\u2026that needed to be added to her goal list.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully for Peggy, her room was close to the elevator. So it wasn\u2019t long before she was beeping her keycard across the sensor, and entering the threshold of her home away from home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeggy was used to the grandeur of Buttercombe d\u00e9cor now; so the high ceilings, luxurious kitchen facilities and reinforced to hell furniture were all part and parcel for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoosing the bedroom closest to the kitchen, the blonde teen dropped off her wheeled suitcase and returned to the living room, now with welcome basket firmly in-hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut instead of instantly emptying the wicker basket, Peggy headed for the refrigerator. Opening it wide, she peered at the icy contents. Yeng corp was more than happy to advertise their wares throughout the school, including their new brand of ice-cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning from ear-to-ear, Peggy snatched up two cartoons of the frozen treat and waddled over to the microwave. Stuffing both inside, she set the timer and waited. It was an old trick, warm up the ice-cream enough to make them drinkable, and then gulp them down in seconds rather than minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she waited, Peggy withdrew her phone from her purse and took a picture of what she was doing. Opening up one of her various social-media apps she hit up her most frequently visited group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAspiring Fat Chicks, or AFC as they called it, was a group Peggy had started with a former roommate in her freshman year. In it Buttercombe students shared, tips, tricks and inspiration\u2026in getting fat. Everyone in there wanted to gain weight for one reason or another, but to prevent ostracism people were kept anonymous other than to the girl who told them about the group and added them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPosting her recent photo, Peggy typed up a little comment about her activities. As she did, a little icon of a pig face popped up along with her tag \u201cSow Queen\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:verdana, sans-serif\">Sow Queen: Guess who\u2019s back and already microing some Ice Cream!</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother icon bearing a cow popped up as typing almost instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:verdana, sans-serif\">Udder Bitch: Two cartons!? Dam girl! Show us the damage on the scales when you\u2019re done!</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few more posts happened in moments, commenting praise and urging Peggy on. She was always surprised at how popular her group was; until coming to Buttercombe, Peggy had no idea how many girls wanted to live on the large side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Ding*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe noise of the microwave pulled Peggy out of her social-media haze. Putting her phone down, the gluttonous girl took one of the cartons in hand, opened the lid to see the contents swirling around in a sloshy goop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChucking her head back, Peggy wasted no time in pouring the contents down her throat. The ice-cream was tepid, and not at all cold to the touch. This allowed it to slide with ease; and within moments she was licking the tub to get at the last dollops of residue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second carton followed suit; this time Peggy was so eager, she didn\u2019t notice little rivets of ice cream dribbling down the sides of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finished the creamy treat with a deep fatty belch, lapping as much of the spillage as possible with her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe obese blonde wasn\u2019t done yet though; the welcome basket was still full. Without hesitation, Peggy crammed her hands into the basket, coming up with a honeybun in one hand and a cupcake in the other. She took alternate bites from both treats, cooing and moaning with the waves of tastes hitting her. Without even licking her fingers clean, Peggy dived back in again, and again, gorging herself until not even a crumb was left as evidence of her gluttony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut even after finishing a whole welcome basket and two cartons of ice-cream, Peggy\u2019s belly gurgled. She was a big girl who had grown used to big meals; she needed more to be truly sated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile there was another welcome basket sitting all alone in the other bedroom, Peggy was not a total bitch. So that left Peggy with her favorite option, the welcome feast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExiting her room, Peggy got quite the stares from her younger peers. I mean, she was quite the sight. Her boulder-like stomach lurched out from under the hem of her shirt, pressing the top of her jeans and threatening the integrity of the top-most button. Her thunder-thighs and swaddling upper arms rolled over her lower legs and arms respectively, jiggling and shaking like pudding; but her face was really the runaway fattest part of her. Peggy\u2019s second chin was a massive slab that rested on her chest, rolling whenever she chewed. Her blue eyes were piggishly squished behind fat bulbous cheeks; and when combined with her nose gave her a real porcine appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer \u201c<i>look</i>\u201d was something else as well. Peggy\u2019s jeans were on their last legs, the seams frayed and small pockets of fat flesh oozing through the gaps; while her pink top seemed to ride higher and higher with each lumbering step. Her hairstyle was quite impressive however. With long blonde hair down to her wide (but oddly flat) ass, tied up in a pair of long pigtails; she still left her fringe free though. Pulling all her long hair back gave her a headache.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Peggy had reached the grand hall, and the throng of obese teenagers had built up into quite the traffic jam, the bloated blonde was quite tired and sweaty. She mopped her brow, but continued diligently onwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again she ignored the sights she was so used to, and instead made a beeline for the smells. Peggy piled her tray high with anything she could get her hands on; she didn\u2019t even have to worry about grabbing anything that was not fattening as hell. It was all so rich and delicious, especially today of all days. Peggy could guarantee herself that she would be waddling away with some extra inches on her figure after tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping her tray to a lonesome table, Peggy began her feast. Knife and fork were turned up at the speed offered from simply using her fat sausage-like fingers; or hell even her face (One Mississippi mud pie was treated like a face-pack as Peggy dived her face in to take a deep gulp).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*Rnnk!* That\u2019s the stuff\u2026\u201d Peggy snorted as she took a breather. As she took in a moment to lick her lips and gather any stray residue, Peggy noticed out of the corner of her eye someone approaching her\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cHaving a pig-out without me?\u201d A familiar voice asked, pulling Peggy out of her feeding frenzy mindset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hefty teen turned to look at the figure that had approached her; holding a cafeteria tray in her hands was Bessie Bridges, Peggy\u2019s fellow freshmen roommate three years ago and the other mind behind the AFC chat group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis seat taken? Or are you waiting for your ass to grow fat enough to fill it?\u201d Bessie teased, nodding to the other side of the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2019S all yours *rnnk*\u201d Peggy snorted, offering with a flabby arm; and with wide swaggering steps, Bessie waddled her own bodacious butt over and dropped it onto the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you would expect from someone who helped start a group called \u201cAspiring Fat Chicks\u201d, Bessie was also a big girl and just as big an eater. Her body stored fat in a totally different way to her friends, swelling her caboose into colossal proportions and turning her tatas into titans. She wasn\u2019t exactly thin everywhere else though; her stomach was plump enough to take the weight of her huge breasts off of her back, and her face was very well-padded. She had dressed up today as well; tying her long black hair into a plait and pulling out her best singlet top with the frills on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was most striking about Bessie was her skin; the African-American teen had a strong case of vitiligo, meaning most of her skin was a milky-white color. With the exception of some dark-brown blotches, with the most prominent being a single large one over her left eye. This had caused the girl to be bullied when it first manifested itself; her skin\u2019s unfortunate resemblance to a Holstein cow gave bullies no end of insults to throw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut over the years she learned to own it, including her moniker \u201c<i>Udder Bitch</i>\u201d on the chat group being a nod to her odd skin pattern (as well as her <i>literal</i> udders that jutted from her chest). This attitude eventually evolved into a bit of a rebellious streak; Bessie wanted to do what she wanted when she wanted and nobody could say anything to put her down. And one thing young Bessie loved to do was eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd boy did she, Bessie and Peggy ended up rooming together in their freshmen year, not because of some special treatment for rich girls, but because the Buttercombe Vice Principal thought it best to put the only overweight freshmen together, hoping they would help each other out. This seemed to work a little too well; Bessie learned that Peggy was a driven young women aiming to get to the top of whatever she was doing. And Peggy learned that Bessie (who at the time was still a little insecure) was trying to make herself fat so nobody picked on her for her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey made a pact; to help each other and anyone else in their shoes to put on as many pounds as they wanted. And Bessie was more than pleased with the results; no longer was she teased for her strange skin, but admired for her almost exaggeratedly womanly figure. She had the thinner girls envious and girls of a certain persuasion drooling over her, and she drank in the attention like rich nectar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the table, it was a good few minutes before either obese young woman spoke again. Both bloated bitches cramming every morsel of food they could into their mouths as they made good on the once-a-year feast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUuurrrrfff\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*URRRRP*\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGawd I feel so full\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I\u2019m gonna *rnnkk* pop\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral trips to the buffet and back later, and both Bessie and Peggy were feeling the pinch. They had let their belts out long ago, but their stomachs (despite the years of stretching) could only hold so much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI feel\u2019s funny\u2026*hic*\u201d Bessie slurred, leaning back in the seat to give herself as much room as she could. As she winced in pain, her belly began to feel funny, and with a jolting sensation Bessie\u2019s belly button shifted into an outtie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeggy burst into piggish grunts as she tried to laugh through the pain of her own tightly packed stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! It\u2019s not funny!\u201d Bessie huffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*RNK* Totally *RNK* is! *RNK*\u201d Peggy answered, her words coming in ragged gasps. No sooner had she answered however, when a jolting sensation hit her to. Her belly was too large and round for her to see or even feel the furthest edge; but Bessie\u2019s laughter told her everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHahaha! Oh my gawd you total pig!\u201d She guffawed, pointing at Peggy\u2019s now out-turned belly button that peeked out of her ill-fitting clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair eventually had to stifle their laughter as they heard the screeching of the microphone located on the stage. Looked like the headmistress was about to give a speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when the bloated besties looked, they saw it was not the hefty hippo headmistress that was standing behind the podium, but the Vice Principal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere\u2019s *rnk* Polluck?\u201d Peggy whispered as Dr Hinamizawa tuned the machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI heard she almost got too fat to walk over the Summer, no way she is getting up those stairs now.\u201d Bessie muttered back in a hushed tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*Rnk* Fat chance, nobody here\u2019s getting that big before me here.\u201d Peggy replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWanna make that a bet skinny?\u201d Bessie teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSkinny? I have forty *rnk* pounds on you!\u201d Peggy hissed back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHem hem!\u201d Came a loud, very fake, cough from the stage. The teasing tubbos silenced themselves and waited as the doctor gave her speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome all to Buttercombe Academy for Growing girls!\u201d The Asian woman announced. \u201cI am Dr Fukuda Hinamizawa, Vice Principal. But you can call me Fukuda if you wish.\u201d The thin woman tried to sound as friendly as possible, but there was no way she could match the matronly warmth of the Headmistress. \u201cUnfortunately Headmistress Polluck is unable to make it today\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTold ya!\u201d Bessie interjected as quietly as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut hopefully I can fill her shoes for the time being\u2026\u201d Dr Hinamizawa then proceeded to introduce all the new teachers, announce the departure of some others, and finally introduced the SSS system to all the newcomers in the audience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat reminded Peggy, she needed to get herself onto the fourth tier of SSS as soon as possible. The less walking she did, the fewer calories she would burn and the fatter she would get.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the wiry woman completed her speech, to lukewarm applause, and headed down from the stage. And once again, an entire room of teenage girls was left to their own devices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSooooo what are we doing next?\u201d Bessie asked, rolling her bulk to face Peggy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe piggish girl had already decided\u2026 </span></div></div>",

Ever since Sapphire walked up and asked Tabitha if anyone had been sitting at the lunch table, they'd been inseparable. From one another and, coincidentally, the lunch table. They sat at the same one, every day! Loading it with all kinds of fine cuisine that only a place like Buttercombe could offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that they were seniors, this was going to be the best year of their lives!

It was the hardest summer break of her life, but somehow the weighty wallflower pulled through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, it wasn't like she had much of a choice.

The dark haired girl was going to be positively furious if Sapphire was watching Brooklyn 99 without her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSapphire! I\u2019ve missed you so...\u201d started Tabitha before catching herself short, met with a rather unexpected scene.<br>\r\nUnsurprisingly, Sapphire was there on the sofa, wearing a wildly overstretched Guns\u2019n\u2019Roses T-shirt that barely covered her belly button along with a pair of equally taxed grey shorts.<br>\r\nCombined with the fact that she was systematically delivering handfuls of Doritos and pizza to her mouth, this had been a common sight, albeit usually featuring Tabitha close by.<br>\r\nThe oddity came in the form of the other girl on the couch, also eating, with her legs intertwined with Sapphire\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhmygod! Tabs!\u201d shrieked Sapphire, clumsily dragging herself from the sofa and lumbering towards her friend, throwing her arms around her in a weighty hug \u201cI\u2019ve missed you so much!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve missed you too Saph\u201d cooed Tabitha as she returned the hug tightly, not wanting to let go of her best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you\u2019ve got to tell me what\u2019s been going on!

her perch straddling the glutted blonde between her legs whilst lowering another muffin to the girls already chocolate coated lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis comment instilled a clear change in mood as the blonde opened up and ate with gusto compared to the lethargy that had seeped into her prior to Bobbi's suggestion.<br>\r\nIn truth, Coach Alberway was in no way fit to get on anybody's back but this had not stopped some individuals at Buttercombe attempting to fall in line with any imaginary sports program that may be on offer.<br>\r\nOne such girl being Naomi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an outward disliking to exercise and an equally voracious appetite, Naomi had been adamant to eat herself out of Coach Alberway's cross hairs which had been something of a pull factor for Bobbi.<br>\r\nManipulating the blonde's anti-exercise fueled appetite had made Naomi one of Bobbi's many favourite subjects at the academy and the impact was clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'a girl\" purred Bobbi as she continued to feed the failing athlete sweet confections, riding the ballooning blonde's belly like the slowest bronco on the planet.<br>\r\nNaomi could barely manage a smile as she contended with all that was in her mouth, only thinking of the numbers slowly rising on the gymnasium scale and the inevitable exemption from any strenuous activities for the year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo illusions came with the relationship Bobbi and Naomi had formed over the years.<br>\r\nNaomi needed to get fat to get out of sports, Bobbi was happy to help and got the sweet payoff of watching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uuuuuurp!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaomi's burp seemed to go on for ages and rattled around Bobbi's bedroom, provoking a soft, almost cute, giggle from Bobbi who gently patted Naomi's belly as it settled down from the exhalation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh, making room for more honey?\" teased the redhead, leaning a little closer to her target's face with a coy smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaomi was preoccupied stifling more burps, each one bouncing Bobbi gently on top of her fattened cushion which stirred a slightly wild reaction in the redhead's mind as she maintained her composure with a slight tightening of her thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, theres more where that came from still if you want it...\" teased Bobbi, peering down the side of her bed at the array of fattening delights already stockpiled ready for feeding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooph, you did good today girl\" complimented Bobbi as she scooted to the main door of her apartment with a hand on the handle, ready to allow Naomi out into mostly quiet corridor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...buurp...thanks Bobbi\" groaned Naomi as she lumbered one thick thigh past the other in slow labourious movements, each leg nudging her heavy double belly in its bloated state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redhead smiled, watching the little waves of fat dance around Naomi's body.<br>\r\n\"Keep this up and we'll have you on the sidelines all season\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaomi's head nearly flicked up in excitement at the prospect.<br>\r\nIn reality, she hadn't played sports for most of her Buttercombe career but she wasn't going to even risk starting now.<br>\r\n\"Thank God, you're so great Bobbi\" praised Naomi with a genuine smile as she reached the front door, her body continuing to jiggle seconds after her abrupt stop, a motion not gone unnoticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Naomi, you're too sweet\" cooed Bobbi with a hint of red on her cheeks, albeit from watching Naomi crossing the room rather than embarrassment \"you come on round any time you want to get some food\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaomi simply nodded as she took a step to cross out into the corridor whilst Bobbi waved to her back, watching as bulbous ass cheeks shuffled away from her.<br>\r\nAs she closed the door, Bobbi gently rested against the wood with her own bubbly butt bouncing slightly against the solid surface.<br>\r\nNaomi was DEFINITELY one of the good ones, even if she was slightly delusional.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobbi's moment of contemplation with images of large blonde girls seared in her mind did not go long uninterrupted however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sooo...how's she doing?\" called a voice from the large sofa situated in the middle of the common area of the apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite delightfully\" purred Bobbi, glancing at her toes with a coyness before striding towards the sofa and leaping into its marshmallowy cushions, jostling her roommate upon landing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I could see that\" remarked Sheridan, adjusting her glasses slightly as she too recalled Naomi's trials of crossing the living room \"I mean what are her numbers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Always such a swat\" muttered Bobbi with an air of tease \"she said that she was up to 378...before tonight that is\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheridan nodded slightly as she slid her laptop up her legs from the coffee table and opened up a spreadsheet with a few swift clicks.<br>\r\nThe record keeping had been Sheridan's (nerdy) idea but both girls had benefited over the years as girls came and went and blossomed under their tender loving care plan.<br>\r\nA soft padding sound accompanied the scrolling names with the multitude of numbers married up to them only built the anticipation for the two redheaded feeders as Naomi's name drew closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There she is\" murmured Sheridan as a clawed hand combed her hair as the blonde girl's name came into view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! How much did she weigh before Summer?\" asked Bobbi, resting her chin on her roommate's shoulder to read from the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before Summer, Naomi was...342lbs\" answered Sheridan quite plainly as she flicked to the adjacent box, inputting the new value.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobbi wolf-whistled, dropping herself heavily back onto the sofa and crossing her legs.<br>\r\n\"She wasn't messing around back home huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope\" replied Sheridan, clearly concentrating, as she scrolled to another girl before glancing at the back of her hand and adding the number '259' to the end of her list.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobbi glanced over the extensive list of names scrolling before her as Sheridan continued to add new weights to the respective girls as she went.<br>\r\nThe two girls really had been doing this for some time now and had gone through A LOT of girls at the academy, all leaving much larger than they started at the school.<br>\r\nThe biggest portion of girls on the list had been solo projects either from Sheridan or Bobbi, with them both racking up an a near equal total but, on occassion, the pair had found a subject willing to play at sharing allowing them both to sink their teeth into them.<br>\r\nThese girls really had got big.<br>\r\nStatistics aside though, both Sheridan and Bobbi knew that it felt good watching these girls blow up under their doting ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, we haven't got long left here now Bob\" spoke Sheridan, cutting through her friend's concentration/daydreaming<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose not\" spoke the shorter girl, adjusting her bra clumsily to gain some comfort in her sizable chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you know what that means right?\" inquired the bespectacled redhead, glancing over the rims of her designer eye wear<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobbi looked blank as she fished muffin crumbs from her cleavage, obviously remnants of Naomi's feasting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've got to make our mark, thats what\" asserted Sheridan as she looked back at the self-built database before the two girls, each one wearing something of a deviant smile.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It may be a little early in their story to consider all the possibilities at play here. We\u2019ve only just met Bobbi Fawcett and Sheridan Winters, after all. But perhaps, given the notion of what amounts to not much more than an idle fantasy, we can at least begin to appreciate this illuminating\u2014if not alternative\u2014look at what might have been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheridan and Bobbi both shared a mutual fetish for fat. More specifically, they shared a specific fetish for making another person fat. They had both known about their preferences at this point, and it was only over years of working together that they were able to leave such a sizeable mark on Buttercombe Academy\u2019s poor unsuspecting student body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Sherry had often fantasized about what would have happened if that fateful date had gone differently. Perhaps if Bobbi wasn\u2019t yet aware of or, hadn\u2019t developed her fetish for fattening other people up. If Bobbi was entirely at her disposal, Sheridan would have molded her roommate into the perfect fatty. Four years of nothing but pampering, coaxing, psychological and caloric warfare stuffed into such a short body\u2014the possibilities were enough to make the nerdy feeder drool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd sometimes, do a little bit more than drool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a common recurring fantasy over the years for her to think about Big Bobbi (as she\u2019d taken to calling her inside her head) and, maybe it was a way for her to keep the home fires lit. After all, their relationship was built on trust. She couldn\u2019t very well trust Bobbi if Bobbi couldn\u2019t trust her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut What If\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOog\u2026 Sherry\u2026\u201d Bobbi burped sickly, \u201cThink\u2019mfull.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smaller girl, not skinny but certainly much smaller, ran a hand across the vast tank that was Bobbi Fawcett\u2019s legendary gut. Having come fully unsheathed from underneath the tent-like skirt that barely contained it while in uniform, Bobbi had parked herself down on the couch and filled it full of everything her SSS perks could buy. Pizzas, subs, Chinese food, entire courses of meals. Anything and everything that Sherry had taught her how to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw, Bob, noooo\u2026\u201d Sherry said, a crazed twinkle in her eye as she watched her prized piggy struggle to keep consciousness, \u201cYou ordered all that food though. It\u2019s gonna go to waste!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t\u2026\u201d Bobbi panted, her breathing shallow, \u201cI can\u2019t do it\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFour hundred pounds. Four hundred pounds of Bobbie Fawcett. Three years of rooming with a girl like Sherry would do that to you though. Her first year in and tiny ginger bombshell Bobbi Fawcett was porking out into extra large sizes. Sherry wasn\u2019t sure if it was her, if it was the school, or if Bobbi was just bound to be big. Ever since that first date with her, Sherry knew that Bobbi had potential. And her first day in her senior year, she\u2019d already <i>far</i> exceeded their going away feast from before the Summer\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, you\u2019re being a baby.\u201d Sherry cupped her girlfriend\u2019s cheek lovingly, running a hand under her chins, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to hold back to impress me\u2014I <i>like</i> your body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSherry <i>loved</i> Bobbi\u2019s blobby body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Bobbi burped, struggling to get comfortable as she wrestled with the hundreds of pounds that made up her sandbag of a stomach, \u201cLucky me\u2026 you\u2019ve got a thing\u2026 for fat girls\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSherry had never been shy about her preferences. They\u2019d been dating for three years\u2014it\u2019d be a little hard to hide something like that. But what she <i>had</i> hidden was her hand in making Bobbi so big. It had taken some doing, but she\u2019d managed to pork her pint-sized pixie into a complete and perpetual pig. With inches between freckles on her meaty arms and what looked to be a third chin coming in, Sherry thought Bobbi was beautiful. And lucky for her, she was <i>far</i> too weak willed to turn the tables on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe\u2026 you could\u2026?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobbi\u2019s flickering fantasy of fattening up others\u2014rather than herself being fattened\u2014shimmered again. It wasn\u2019t the first time that she\u2019d weakly tried to suggested Sherry pick up her slack. Sherry was loathe to think she\u2019d ever slip that far. But Bobbi was cute and, hey, she couldn\u2019t blame her for trying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way, Bob, you know I can\u2019t handle all this heavy food.\u201d Sherry\u2019s own chubby shape was an indicator that this was a lie, but Bobbi hardly had the energy or the know-how to argue with her feeder, \u201cHere, maybe if we get your shirt off\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobbi was already too big for her uniform. She\u2019d already sized up in anticipation of getting even fatter over the Summer (more out of resignation than any excitedness, that rested squarely with Sheridan) but she\u2019d far undersized the damage that Sherry\u2019s influence had done to her willpower and appetite. She was up a whole thirty pounds since the Summer was over\u2014far over Sherry\u2019s calculations on the Excel spreadsheet she kept specifically for her girlfriend. Among the others, of course. Sherry had lots of projects, but only one Big Bobbi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWrestling with the buttons, Sherry\u2019s nimble fingers struggled to undo the white blouse portion of the uniform. Bobbi\u2019s flesh diamonded through the open gaps, threatening to pop the buttons off any minute. But that would be too embarrassing (and too hot) to allow this feeding session to go where it needed to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsheathing Bobbi\u2019s belly fully, leaving her in just an unbuttoned skirt, socks, and a custom-ordered bra, Sherry took in the size and scope of her special project.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBiting her lip, she did her best to keep composure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTh-There now, doesn\u2019t that feel\u2026\u201d Sherry shook Bobbi\u2019s stuffed sack of a stomach slightly, wobbling her side-roll and sending a ripple throughout her entire body, \u201c<i>Soooo good</i>?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUrp\u2026\u201d Bobbi\u2019s trained brain interpreted the slight amount of extra room as well as Sherry could have hoped, \u201cA little\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood.\u201d Sheridan smiled, \u201cGood.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the ginger binger went back to stuffing herself, Sheridan clenched her thighs together tight. Wriggling in her seat on the couch, this was literally the best thing she could have ever hoped for. One more year with her girlfriend, full of fattening fun, where she could watch Bobbi get bigger and bigger, keeping stats of her and all her other special projects along the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, it was a lot of work for one person. Her grades weren\u2019t as good as she\u2019d like them to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut this was so, <i>so</i> worth it.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

just...urgh...finishing off\u201d replied Sheridan, obviously struggling over something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Urgh, it\u2019s so hot when she groans\u2019 thought Bobbi as she mindlessly paced in front of the sofa.<br>\r\nThat was a good thing really, given how much time Sheridan spent groaning these days, and tonight was going to be no exception.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter spending a long Summer apart with nothing but messages and the occasional picture being batted between the fiery haired lovers, Bobbi had big plans for their reunion night.<br>\r\nEver the temptress, Bobbi had found herself a matching set of red and black lacy underwear which was only partially concealed by her unbuttoned school shirt and clung to her natural curves. <br>\r\nThe pint sized redhead had also got herself a pair of jet black heels that added 4 inches of height which, in a rare turn of events, actually made her taller than her girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeight was Bobbi\u2019s only size advantage tonight though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the telltale approaching sound of panting, Sheridan appeared from her bedroom and stood in the doorway, eying her usually shorter girlfriend lustfully.<br>\r\nHer gaze didn\u2019t stay long though before wandering to the massively piled up table in front of the sofa housing all of her favourite foods which, for the record, was anything she could get her hands on usually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn keeping with the girls unconventional meeting it had not taken long for their shared passion for feeding came to the surface, one which they shared in their relationship as each girl doted their respective victims.<br>\r\nWhat did come as more of a surprise though, was Sheridan\u2019s request not long into their relationship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFeed me Bobbi\u201d Sheridan plainly requested as the girls had sat in their dorm on a quiet Friday afternoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d asked the shorter girl, somewhat bemused by the request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want you to feed me Bobbi\u201d repeated Sheridan \u201cI\u2019m always feeding other girls, I want to know what it\u2019s like\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure because, you know, I am pretty lethal with it and wouldn\u2019t want you to become a disappointed fat ass\u201d challenged Bobbi, even if the request did pique her interest.<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t the first time that Bobbi had questioned the irony of being a prolific feeder whilst dating a skinny girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I\u2019m counting on it\u201d purred Sheridan, looking over her glasses as she did \u201cI want you to feed me SOOO much and we do have all weekend after all\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Since when did Sheridan get so flirtatious and damn sexy\u2019 thought Bobbi, feeling her thighs start to burn<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI could be your queen Bob, the pride of your collection...make...me...fat\u201d<br>\r\nAs she had spoken, Sheridan had turned herself and crawled over Bobbi, placing herself face to face with her girlfriend as she finished speaking.<br>\r\nBobbi was beside herself at this point, flushing hot as Sheridan\u2019s already larger frame pressed against her, the smaller girls imagination firing on all cylinders imagining how big her girlfriend could get.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs long as you\u2019re sure\u201d managed Bobbi through her arousal, gazing into Sheridan\u2019s eyes.<br>\r\nThe strawberry blonde just nodded with a teasing bite to the lip before whispering in Bobbi\u2019s ear...<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m hungry Bob\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat day had sparked an unquenchable fire in their relationship and, now entering their final year at Buttercombe, neither girl could have imagined just how big Sheridan was going to get.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFilling the doorway she now occupied, Sheridan could feel Bobbi\u2019s eyes burning into her and the taller girl knew exactly what she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFour hundred and...fifty...seven...pounds\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobbi\u2019s knees visibly gave beneath her slightly, almost throwing her off balance in her heels, as she heard the numbers roll off her girlfriends tongue.<br>\r\nSheridan had gotten truly massive over the course of her Buttercombe career, partly due to Bobbi\u2019s attentiveness and partly due to her own voracious appetite.<br>\r\nContent that she had teased Bobbi enough for now, Sheridan stepped into the room fully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDominating her figure was her monumental ass which, catching both sides of the doorframe multiple times as she walked, expanded in every direction possible.<br>\r\nForming a vast shelf behind her and acting as the widest part of her engorged body, Sheridan\u2019s rear was near unrivalled in the school with every step causing a quake of fat to ripple through the exposed cheeks as great patches of cellulite wobbled away.<br>\r\nHer huge thighs left little to the imagination as well, with rolls of fat and cellulite defining their great length as they expanded to support her rear.<br>\r\nA vast triple belly filled out her front and hung heavily over her crotch making it unclear if she was wearing pants whilst her love handles pooled to her sides, contending with but never catching her hips.<br>\r\nFurther up, Sheridan\u2019s sheer size only continued with a rack that Bobbi was jealous of in size and perkiness, arm fat bigger around than her girlfriends thighs and a plump double chin swaddling her face.<br>\r\nFacially, the strawberry blonde had barely changed.<br>\r\nNaturally she had plumped up in the face department but minimally compared to the rest of her body and still looked distinctly like herself, glasses and all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou missed me?\u201d cooed Sheridan as she came close to Bobbi, the shorter girl looking completely beside herself with arousal after watching her girlfriend cross the room.<br>\r\nSheridan simply giggled before continuing.<br>\r\n\u201cWell I am absolutely starving after wasting away all Summer\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was a barefaced lie but Sheridan had Bobbi hook line and sinker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need your expert hands to feed me Bob, I\u2019m SOO hungry\u201d she continued to coo as she gently brushed her belly against Bobbi.<br>\r\n\u201cI spent all Summer feeding those other girls and now I need my reward\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pictures over the Summer could confirm that and, despite her shift towards eating herself, Sheridan never lost her nack for feeding others much to the testament of her friends back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBobbi?\u201d purred Sheridan, award that the heel wearing redhead was practically drooling over the great mass of girlfriend before her.<br>\r\nUnable to shake the smaller girl, Sheridan concocted a compromise.<br>\r\n\u201cHow about I get started and you join in later?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobbi could only nod as she continued to ogle her girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, because I\u2019ll need you for the funnel\u201d teased the huge girl before sitting down heavily, forcing a mighty groan from the furniture.<br>\r\nShe looked even bigger sat down as her fat spread further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFunnel feeding was one of Bobbi\u2019s side fetishes alongside feeding, but it had become a favourite between the couple as Sheridan\u2019s size exploded.<br>\r\nThousands of empty calories a week were attributed to that pipe and the girls loved it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis all looks so good Bobbi, I hope there\u2019s more though\u201d teaser Sheridan as she grabbed hold of the first thing she could reach, a triple chocolate cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah...\u201d replied Bobbi, still in awe and addled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood\u201d purred Sheridan before taking a huge bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBobbi? You in there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha...wh...oh yeah, sorry\u201d stumbled the redhead as Sheridan snapped her back to reality, the 180lb one that is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLost you there hun, you ok?\u201d asked the taller girl, a twinge of concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah, think you spaced out and it sent me off as well\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Damn, did Bobbi know I was fantasising about her?\u2019 thought Sheridan nervously, looking at her 132lb friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Hope she doesn\u2019t think I was being weird about her\u2019 thought Bobbi, biting her lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell as long as you\u2019re ok\u201d chirped Sheridan, attempting to move things on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m fine\u201d replied Bobbi with a weak smile \u201cyou?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep\u201d answered Sheridan quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018That was close\u2019 thought both girls simultaneously but separately.</span></div></div>",

And who better to reap the rewards of such a fine synergy than the Headmistress of the Academy herself? Shannon Polluck has positively swollen with the results of Yeng's direct input on how things are run. She's been given an assistant to handle her day-to-day tasks, and she has Fukuda to handle the technical know-how of her job. That leaves Shannon plenty of time for balls, banquets, feasts, and dinners with guests and benefactors! Which is good, because after years of kicking back and letting her lower staff members handle her job, eating is pretty much all our headmistress is good for these days!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShannon is a positively rotund woman, one of the largest members on staff at Buttercombe Academy. <br>\r\nShe wears her hair in a tight bee-hive, and it has begun to fade to platinum as she's aged.</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><font class=\"size35\" style=\"\">Dr. Fukuda Hinamizawa</font></b><br>\r\n<i>43, Black, 5'8\", 160lbs<br>\r\nVice Principal / Yeng Coordinator</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"right\">After providing years of quality service to her parent company, Dr. Hinamizawa was rewarded with the opportunity to prove herself at Buttercombe Academy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough her background in education is small, Fukuda has done a wonderful job more or less running the place. Her eye for detail and penchant for scrutinization serve her well in a job where she's more or less taken over for the headmistress. Meanwhile, she still serves her supervisors at Yeng by providing them in-depth analysis of the effects of their various products. Buttercombe Academy is her testing ground, and the students, faculty, and staff are her test subjects.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With her head lowered in total absorption of the meal,  Ms. Polluck continued to gorge on the massive spread in front of her. Her mind solely on the delicious food, she wouldn\u2019t have to think of all the problems she\u2019d soon have to deal with, most important of all, the fact that she still hadn\u2019t found a new assistant for this school year!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeeks ago she\u2019d though she\u2019d hired a great new prospect. Monica\u2026 Wade was it? \u2026Well her name wasn\u2019t important\u2026but Monica ended up having to cancel at the last minute, (some unbelievable story about winning a recall election in her home town as a write-in candidate,) either way Shannon was now without a helper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurthermore, no part time T.A or regular student would suffice nowadays, Shannon needed  someone she could count on during her full work day because she was always so darn busy <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">eating</span>.  Only a week into the school year and Shannon had passed her own paperwork onto the already quite busy vice principal, so even the diligent Doctor Hinamizawa was out of the question as a potential new assistant. Ms. Polluck looked to be truly on her own\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow lost in this last slice of chocolate cake, she\u2019d have a few more minutes to avoid deciding on what to do about a new assistant. <br>\r\n\u201c~Mmmm cake~\u201d she moaned aloud without a hint of self control, delving her tongue into the amazing chocolate essence\u2026She remembered her past few assistants over the years; Brittney Huan had been quite the dependable worker bee as her student secretary, and Brittney\u2019s classmate Hannah had been a wonderful T.A always there with a helping hand and a helping of doughnuts from the break room,  oh and she supposed there was that body guard from her first year, T\u2026something or other. Sadly, all those memories were in the past now, Ms. Polluck savored them as she savored the last few crumbs of her big brunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Vrrt! Vrrt! Vrrt!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Shannon was wobbling, and more than she usually did! She heard her ringtone and realized it was her phone! She slunk a fat hand into her barely reachable pocket, not before letting the device vibrate  against her thick pasty thighs one more time. (<i>Mmmm\u2026she wondered how long had it been since the last time she\u2019d\u2026-No she was on school hours at the moment! No time to dwell on  her current feeling of fullness and\u2026well\u2026hungers of another kind.</i>) Using all the will power and self control she still possessed, Ms. Polluck answered her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello? This is Headmistress Polluck.\u201d Said Shannon, wondering who exactly had called her on her personal number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi, Ms. Polluck. I\u2019m here\u2026for the assistant interview?\u201d said the voice on the other side of the call. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, oh, of course.\u201d Ms. Polluck had been completely caught off guard by this turn of events, and  fumbled for a name, none came to mind. \u201cWell, how are you?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m fine. I\u2019m just outside your office and wanted to double check\u2026you did say eleven this morning right?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShannon again fumbled through her mind, this time for an explanation\u2026\u201cOh! Yes, right. Right on my way too, just had  a bit of personal business to attend to\u2026Ha! Ha!  Ha!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh okay then\u2026Well I can\u2019t wait to meet you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSame here\u2026be right there\u2026\u201d Shannon said ending the call.  Shannon slowly got up from the table, leaving the mess she made for someone else to take care of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow?!\u201d She muttered a bit to herself as she racked her brain. How could she have forgotten this meeting with a prospective new assistant? In fact this was exactly why she needed a new assistant so badly in the first place! Then, anyone trying to reach the headmistress would have to go through her assistant first. Oh, and she\u2019d make sure who ever she hired would know to absolutely never schedule her meetings during her eatings! Shannon left the cafeteria and  began hobbling into her personal SSS cart, perfect for getting the headmistress around the grounds in speed and style. Enjoying the scenery that was Buttercombe\u2019s busy campus, she remembered how many of the young women here depended on her to keep this academy in tip top shape no matter how many business partner deals she needed to make, she would do whatever it took to make sure the students here had the most comfortable experience they could. Shannon felt her mood lightening a bit, reminding herself that just because the day\u2019s first chapter had gotten off to a bad start didn\u2019t mean she couldn\u2019t change things around, right? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brought her cart to a halt in front of the Office and Administrator\u2019s Building  and bumbled towards the semi-secret private elevator that led to her office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShannon gave herself a once over and adjusted her hair a bit as the elevator hummed to life. She then started concentrating, really concentrating, on what she could remember about this mysterious new assistant. She remembered going over resumes, favoring those that were available to move immediately rather than on previous work experience. Hmmm\u2026.Oh wait! She remembered  a few nights ago eating a large lasagna in her room late at night, and then some wine\u2026<i>well LOTS of wine</i>\u2026Focus Shannon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Okay so there was one resume she remembered that mentioned they and their partner could be there in a week; along with something about running a small bakery business in the past. That had been enough for Shannon to invite them to an interview\u2026but the rest of the night was a little hazy after that. She couldn\u2019t remember the name, and in fact, she wasn\u2019t sure but she might have also sent a few other random invitations that night as well after the bottle of wine had been emptied\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell if they weren\u2019t \u201cthe one\u201d, Shannon would just have to politely decline their offer\u2026It would be extremely hard to turn them down though considering they were right here, and how badly she wanted an assistant\u2026. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elevator gave a soft ding and its doors began to open, peeking out Shannon saw that new potential hire was\u2026</span></div></div>",

She drove out and straight to her door, hurrying to have the interview done ASAP. Sitting in her cart, she looked more like oversized blob, her overflowing pillowlike gut being the first thing anyone noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe candidate certainly did. She blinked, taking in the sheer size of her potential boss. Most likely she had never seen a woman of her size before but she rallied quickly. \u201cHello, Ma'am, I'm Penny Simon. Here to see Mrs. Polluck regarding my application.\u201d She grinned a tad nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was time for Shannon to study her potential personal assistant. She was such a tiny little thing! After years spent dealing with school employees or hobnobbing with other dignitaries who enjoyed all the benefits of associating with Yeng, she could hardly believe someone could be so thin. She could almost wrap her waist in her hands (if her digits weren't so thick).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, yes, yes, that would be me. Come in, follow me, have a seat.\u201d Penny Simon? The headmistress seemed to recall seeing such a name in the pile of resumes. She even vaguely remembered it stuck out for some reason, but why? Was it good or bad? It didn't matter now anyway. The main thing was that Penny was here now. Hopefully she was ready to serve\u2026 err, to assist her boss. She slid behind her desk and smiled widely, causing a little chinquake. \u201cSo you would be ready to start immediately?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I would.\u201d The girl (she was nothing more than that) rushed to her seat with enviable ease and pushed her glasses up her nose. \u201cWhat would my duties involve?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, just\u2026 organizing my timetable, keeping contact with school sponsors, liaising with the Vice-Principal\u2026 Generally assisting me in leading the school.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCould you be more specific? Regarding the working hours, remuneration and perks and so on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuch insolence! Luckily Shannon remembered the good Dr. Hinamizawa had prepared something of the sort back when they'd discussed this problem. \u201cActually I can. And I can also show you what your duties would include while we are at it. Pass me the file marked '<b>Personnel, Admin</b>,' over there,\u201d and she pointed to the upper row in the file cabinet next to her. Sure, she could take it herself but she'd have to stand up. Better use this opportunity to see how helpful the girl is willing to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny proved to be compliant enough. She jumped up and retrieved the file in a fraction of time it would take the humongous headmistress. \u201cHere you go, Ma'am.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Shannon took the file from her and nearly dropped it. It was so heavy! In this kind of situation her gut shelf came in handy. She rested it there while leafing through. \u201cAh! Here it is.\u201d As she pulled out the single sheet Fukuda had printed her back then, her stomach growled in displeasure. Possibly it didn't like being squished, probably it was feeling peckish again, most likely both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut first, would you be so kind and bring me a couple Yeng bars from the vending machine in the hallway? Here, take this,\u201d Shannon reached into her breast pocket gave her a bright pink bracelet, \u201cpass it by the sensor and everything'll be free. Take something for yourself too, if you like.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew she wasn't supposed to let the bracelet out of her sight but what harm could it do? Besides, she'd <i>told</i> dr. Hinamizawa to make it wider, it wasn't her fault it didn't fit around her wrist. \u201cGo on, what are you waiting for?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Shannon gaped. \u201cDid you bring all that for yourself?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no, no.\u201d Penny unloaded the calorific hoard on the desk. \u201cThat's all for you, Ma'am. I was thinking you might still be hungry after eating just two bars. And here's your bracelet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I see. That is farsighted of you. Thank you.\u201d As she greedily unwrapped her first Yeng bar, Shannon felt her initial wary attitude to Penny changing. She detested brown-nosing like anyone else but there was nothing wrong in proper deference. Besides, the girl was right \u2013 she might still be peckish afterwards. And such a clever judge of character certainly deserved to be rewarded. \u201cHere, take these and enjoy,\u201d she passed the minidonuts to her. Truth be told, there were much better \u2013 and bigger \u2013 ones just being made in Buttercombe kitchens so Shannon didn't regret giving them away\u2026 much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm, thanks but I shouldn't\u2026\u201d Penny's eyes involuntarily slid over the pillowy stomach avalanche settled on the desk opposite her, she gulped but didn't dare refuse. Unwrapping the packet, she took her first bite. \u201cWow, thefe awe good!\u201d she gushed with her mouth full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShannon allowed herself a small smile for her victory. Sure, they couldn't quite compare with Buttercombe ones but Yeng Mini-Donuts were still a treat. Then she recalled she owed the girl something and reached for Fukuda's list. \u201cThis is your complete job description.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026nk you.\u201d Penny quickly crammed the rest of her donut into her mouth, tried to lick her sticky fingers clean and took the paper. Browsing the text, she quickly got to the perks and benefits of her job. \u201cUh, may I ask you\u2026 ?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, dear?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFree room and board at the Academy premises, work attire tailored to fit free of charge \u2013 is that for real?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, of course.\u201d Shannon could not understand the girl's surprise; to her it seemed utterly normal that the Academy provided everything she ever needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, in that case, is the position still open?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d The Headmistress squirmed in her throne, looking for a more comfortable position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd\u2026 how many candidates are there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeveral.\u201d As much as Shannon enjoyed stringing her along, it was keeping her from more important things, namely eating. She cut it short. \u201cHowever none of them have yet shown up so if you are ready to start right away, you're hired.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I am, I am more than ready. Thank you for this opportunity, thank you, Ma'am!\u201d Penny jumped up, leaned forward as if trying to hug the behemoth in front of her, then she settled for a vigorous shake of Shannon Polluck's bloated hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo need to thank me, I expect you to live up to your today's promise. So\u2026 personal agenda falls into the purview of the Vice-Principal. Fukuda's in her office right now, go see her, sign her papers and she'll tell you the rest. And you may take the minidonuts with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe interview with the Vice-Principal went very differently. They started off on the wrong foot as Penny entered her office munching on a minidonut and holding the open packet. Dr. Hinamizawa, a cool, aloof middle-aged Japanese, raised her eyebrows at the sight, Penny blushed and it went downhill from there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny had to remind herself she wasn't to be working for this iron b*tch but for the Headmistress. Fukuda spent over a dozen minutes grilling her about every minor detail of her (a little doctored) CV, thoroughly interrogating her before she seemed satisfied that the new assistant would acquit herself well. Eventually she asked: \u201cDid the Headmistress give you the list of your duties?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, she gave me this,\u201d Penny showed her the paper, a little greasy from the donuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, good, I was worried she may have forgotten. Well, you can keep it,\u201d Fukuda frowned at the smears. \u201cYou may have noticed, your duties can be summed up as taking care of our esteemed Headmistress. As you have seen her mobility is a little impaired so essentially you shall be her hands and feet. You'll assist her in whatever way she deems necessary.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Ma'am.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood. Well, here's your contract, a non-disclosure agreement, a tenancy agreement, a health waiver, and some more documents for you to sign.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first Penny tried to read it, or at least scan the lines, but feeling Fukuda's tense look she soon gave up on the dozens of pages. The legalese was mostly beyond her grasp anyway. She signed it all, passing one copy of each to the Vice-Principal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly all tension was gone and Fukuda smiled. \u201cGood. Just so you know, your phone number is now in the school database and you might expect some other members of the staff to contact you momentarily. You are also slated to receive a Yeng smartphone in a couple days with upgraded safety features as a replacement for your current phone. And the most important thing\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Vice-Principal unlocked a safe partly hidden behind a row of monitors, and took out a strangely looking faux-jade bracelet, pressing its surface onto a chip reader. \u201cThis device is now coded to your person, please take it everywhere with you and do not let anyone else use it. Among other things it serves as a key to your accommodation. Given your position, you will be staying next door to the Headmistress and while you certainly aren't required to assist her outside your working hours, I would appreciate if you would go out of your way and help her sometimes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny nodded. \"Sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe bracelet also opens your office floor, our spa and many other rooms and corridors. You have Group D access rights which means you can go to most parts of the school \u2013 and as part of your duties you certainly will.\u201d The Vice-Principal smiled as if making a joke. \u201cMoreover, the chip lets you eat in the cafeteria and use all the vending machines for free. So don't lose it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, Ma'am.\u201d Penny slid it on her wrist. It was far too big and dangled loose. Fukuda's advice made perfect sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I am glad to welcome you at our fine Academy. I hope I'll see you grow here and find your place in our team.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, Ma'am.\u201d They shook hands again and Penny dashed out.<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><br>\r\n***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she left the Vice-Principal's office, Penny felt an immense weight fall off her shoulders. She was worried nobody would ever employ her again after that little misunderstanding at her last job. And yet here she was, a new personal assistant to the Headmistress of the most prestigious girl's academy on the East Coast!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue, it seemed the real power here rested in the hands of that formidable Japanese woman but if she played her cards right, Penny would surely be able to convince Fukuda she was a valuable team player. And as for the Headmistress, a steady stream of snacks might be enough to keep on her good side. And then\u2026 who knows? Little Penny Simon from the wrong side of the tracks might make it big here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment her cellphone beeped. What was her first duty going to be?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So she asked around, got lost, asked again until eventually she discovered the infirmary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello?\u201d she knocked. \u201cPenny Simon here. Sorry for the delay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, good. Come in, please.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they got over the initial awkward stage, the nurse's soothing voice and gentle mannerisms calmed Penny down. Ms. Fukiyama was another Oriental woman (which made sense given the much-vaunted Yeng sponsorship), even taller and thinner than Dr. Hinamizawa, with long, silky hair just like Penny that framed a somewhat rounder face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe asked her about allergies, health complications and the like (Penny had none), then she focused on her glasses. \u201cWould you like me check to your eyesight too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no, thank you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure? Do you know that the school covers <i>all </i>your medical expenses? Should you need new glasses, just say so. I'll write you a prescription, you can select frames you like online and when you next visit Wellington \u2013 the town next to the Academy \u2013 there's an optician there who has a contract with Buttercombe, you can pick your new glasses for free. I'll send you a link.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? Well, in that case, could you have a look at my eyes, please?\u201d Penny couldn't afford new glasses for ages, this was possibly the best news of the day! Or second best, after being hired here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiro Fukiyama was pretty thorough, making Penny read letters and shining into her eyes before she eventually declared: \u201cAnd that's it. You do need glasses a little stronger than you have plus the focus in your right eye is a little off so do not put it off  too long, OK?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, ma'am. And thank you.\u201d Penny rose, thinking it was time to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no, no, wait. One more thing left. I need your height and weight. Please step onto this,\u201d the nurse pointed at an industrial-sized scale next to the door. \u201cSo you are 5'3'' and\u2026 120 lb. Good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that, Penny sucked in her stomach. \u201cUmm, I know I should lose a couple pounds.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d The nurse gave her the once-over before handing her a clipboard. \u201cNo, not really. You're quite healthy, better focus on maintaining your weight. Now please sign here and you can go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***<br>\r\n</div><br>\r\nPenny stepped outside and blinked as the bright sun blinded her for a moment. What should she do now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi!\u201d A woman even smaller than Penny shouted in a voice surprisingly deep for her size, riding on some kind of an oversized golf cart towards her. \u201cAre you Penny Simon? I\u2019m Marcia Flannagan, the housing director of the Academy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh- oh, yes, I am. Hello.\u201d Penny shook the offered hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was told I could find you here. Are you ready to see your new accommodation?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm, I think so?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerfect. Follow me, please.\u201d The director brushed off her blonde locks and climbed off the golf cart. \u201cIt's some fifteen minutes drive but I'm sure you'll <i>love</i> the view. Ah, right,\u201d she paused and gave Penny a searching look. \u201cOne more thing \u2013 where's your luggage?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm, still at the gate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, we'll drive there to pick it up, it'll help you make yourself familiar with the layout. Come, start driving.\u201d And she pointed at the driver's seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? You want me to\u2026 ?\u201d Penny hesitated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure! After all, this is your scooter, assigned to you personally. I brought it along. Trust me, you don't want to walk all the way, every day. It's, like, miles! Plus there's been some scare with the lyme disease and whatever. Trust me, it's better to get used to driving about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, fine.\u201d Penny gingerly sat behind the steering wheel and after a couple false starts set off. The path soon forked. \u201cCan you tell me the way?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, turn right and drive straight on, down that valley ahead\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIsn't it weird that the campus is deserted like this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, it is indeed but the semester has already started last week, see? So most our students are busy with their lessons. So is the staff.\u201d Marcia leaned out to point. \u201cNow turn left, please.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drive uphill with her luggage was slow but steady, cabin was small but looked cozy. And the view was just as lovely as Ms. Flannagan promised. The valley spread out below them with all the Academy buildings in sight. Add the mountain air\u2026 Penny inhaled, enjoying its freshness. \u201cIt's nice here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe housing director smiled as if school grounds were her own creation (possibly they were?). \u201cIsn't it? This area is reserved for our most prominent employees. The Headmistress is housed right next to you.\u201d She pointed at the much larger mansion next door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh. So you- you live here too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, no, no, I couldn't. Too close to the cafeteria, you know,\u201d she chuckled, stopping abruptly when she noticed Penny's blank look. \u201cAnyway, your home may be smaller but it is just as smart as your neighbors', filled with top-notch appliances from the Watanagashi Automated Kitchen to the Himatsubushi 3D Audiovisual Network. The kitchen even has a full starting storage compartment, courtesy of our Yeng sponsor. Just have a look.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny parked the cart in a covered space next to the door and Marcia walked her through her new home. It was a little on the smallish side but Penny didn't mind, she was used to living small and this was the largest space she had ever had to herself. Moreover, what the cabin lacked in size, it more than made up in luxury. The furniture looked and felt sinfully comfortable, Penny was looking forward to testing her bed already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that's it. I suppose you're going to be busy soon, I certainly am, so sign here and enjoy your housing. And should anything happen, call me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, yes, thanks. See you.\u201d Plopping down into her kitchen chair, Penny watched the tiny tornado of activity leave. She was glad she would have some time for herself now after all the excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut would she? Not much later her rest was to be interrupted.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A bag with all her belongings lay in the doorway, reminding her she ought to start unpacking. Numerous sleek steel appliances around her called out to her curiosity, begging to be examined, tested. Didn't Marcia say the kitchen was ready to start? But for now she was content with simply sitting down and letting the stress of her last days slowly seep out of her system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ringtone of her phone was a most unwelcome intruder into her oasis of calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh.\u201d Penny looked around, driven by a subconscious desire to run away from the noise.

I need you here, stat!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny drove her cart back at a speed it likely wasn't designed for. When she rushed into the office, slightly out of breath, her worst fears were confirmed. Ms. Polluck's mood had significantly worsened since their first meeting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI expect my assistants to be available whenever I need them,\u201d she barked out. \u201cImmediately!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny was taken aback by the change of her tone. \u201cOf course, Ma'am. I was just checking in-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm not interested in any excuses. I'm hungry!\u201d The Headmistress leaned forward, upper folds of her gut bunching up on the desk, threatening to burst out of her honey-coloured blouse. \u201cAnd when I'm hungry, I want to eat!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Ma'am.\u201d Penny bent her head down to show how contrite she was. \u201cWould you like me to bring you some more snacks from the machine?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe behemoth's lips puckered. \u201cNo! When I am hungry I want a proper meal! Three courses at least!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny glanced at her watch. \u201cUh, should I go to the cafeteria then? I mean, it's not even 5 yet but they might have something ready\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, of course, you silly girl! Do I have to spell everything out for you?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, I'll be back right away.\u201d And Penny fled her boss' anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer new job suddenly didn't look as welcoming. Ms. Polluck must have been used to some kind of\u2026 routine that her assistant provided. But how could Penny find out, who could advise her what she was supposed to <i>really</i> do? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetter focus on the job at hand for now. Cafeterias tended to be downstairs, right? Penny took the elevator to the ground floor, hoping to find some clue there. And as soon as she stepped out, a mix of enticing smells wafted down from an adjacent larger building. Following it, she soon found the cafeteria, a huge busy hall, and behind another set of double doors, there was the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter meeting other, normal-sized members of the staff she was beginning to think of the hoggish Headmistress as an outlier, an anomaly. But the cafeteria was so filled with obese students it reminded her of a fat camp (not that Penny would ever visit such a place) and the kitchen was no better \u2013 cooks at various stages of obesity, were struggling to move around in the confined space between worktables, stoves and ovens. Now where was the head cook? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a bit of hesitation, Penny picked the largest of them, a woman so big she almost rivalled Ms. Polluck. She sat at the head of the kitchen, observing her underlings, ordering them around and taste-testing their products. When she heard Penny's steps, she turned her head as far as her chins let her. \u201cYes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm, hello, I am Penny Simon. The new assistant to Ms. Polluck. And she'd like to have a\u2026 an early dinner if possible?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe obese cook chuckled. \u201cLike she always does. I get you, girl. Whatever the Headmistress says, you do. Is that so?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, yes, ma'am.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEri Flatterly, happy to meet you. I'm in charge of this madhouse. Girls!\u201d she turned to her staff. \u201cPrepare a tray for the Headmistress as usual. And add some more for her assistant too. Is there something you'd like, umm, Penny?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no, no, there's no need to\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cook didn't let her finish. \u201cBut there is! You're so scrawny, only skin and bones! What would you like? What's your favorite?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny drew her breath in, thinking. \u201cWell, maybe pizza? Pizza pepperoni?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerfect! Girls, get the dinner cart ready and prepare a pizza pepperoni for Miss Penny! You'll like it, we make all our pizzas in-house. While we wait, you can have a sweet roll or two \u2013 here \u2013 and  tell me something about yourself, dear. Where are you from, how did you end up in Buttercombe\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, well\u2026\u201d thinking mostly how to leave out her dirty laundry, Penny took a bite. \u201cWow! That's\u2026 that's perfect. I've never tasted something so\u2026 so\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you've never had a homemade one, have you? Well, the secret's in good, honest ingredients. You mustn't scrimp on the butter\u2026\u201d and the cook got talking about her favorite subject which suited Penny just fine. Whenever it looked that conversation could steer back to her past, another bite, a compliment and a couple questions kept Eri Flatterly going until the cart was loaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, that's\u2026 a lot of food.\u201d Penny interrupted her hostess when she noticed it. \u201cAnd, uh\u2026 is that supposed to be my pizza? All that?\u201d She pointed at the extra-large ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure! You need to put some meat on your bones, girl.\u201d The head cook struggled to rise, an avalanche of her fat pushing Penny away. \u201cWell, it was nice chatting with you but I need to check how the lunch's coming along. See you around 9.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny was struggling to get the cart under control but now she looked up. What was this about? \u201cYou mean 9 p.m.? To pick up evening tea for the Headmistress?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight you are. Tea and everything else.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n/character limit again, sorry/<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the overloaded dinner cart rattled along the hallway, it was making a lot of noise despite Penny's best efforts. It was noisy enough that a chubby face peaked out of an office. \u201cIs it dinner already?\u201d she asked eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, not yet. Soon, I think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, blast. Ah! You must be Ms. Polluck\u2019s new assistant. I'm Gabby. Gabriella Rodriguez from the accounting.\u201d The door opened, revealing a Hispanic even shorter than Penny. She could still be called curvy if you ignored the potbelly fighting her voluminous chest for its place in the sun. She spread her arms to give Penny a soft hug. \u201cHi! Soo glad to see you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm, Penny Simon, hi. Uh, it's not lunch yet but I could share my pizza with you, if you're interested? I mean, I can't eat it all\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, really? You've made a friend for life, Penny!\u201d The accountant stepped eagerly aside to let her in the office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny took the giant wheel and cut it in half, marvelling how thick the toppings were. As she was splitting it, she could see an inch-wide layer of gooey cheese topped with a pound of salami. This was definitely no supermarket pizza! She hadn't been feeling hungry until now but the sight \u2013 and  aroma \u2013 were making her salivate. \u201cHere you are. Enjoy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks! And drop by soon, we need to chat. Maybe go to lunch together? Us underlings must stick together, eh?\u201d And Gabby bumped into her with her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, uh, sure. I mean, unless the Headmistress wants me to tag along to assist her\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, don't worry. When it comes to dinner our big boss doesn't like company. She's got her own private dining room next to the kitchens. Of course, people like Ms. Underwood or Dr. Hinamizawa get invited too but us plebes have to eat with the rabble- I mean students. Luckily there won't be too many of them left by then. Anyway, when you're ready, just knock on my door and we can go, OK?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. Bye for now.\u201d And Penny rushed to the cart, reminded that her boss wouldn't be happy with further delays.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was time to feed the beast. As soon as Penny knocked, she heard an angry voice: \u201cFinally! What took you so long?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, sorry, the cooks had to prepare everything\u2026 Anyway, here you are, Ms. Polluck.\u201d And Penny started unloading the dishes. She guessed that as soon as the Headmistress saw food, she would stop nagging and start eating and she was right, except eating wasn't the right word for the show. Shannon Polluck grabbed an oversized spork with one hand and a huge burger with the other, taking a big bite out of it and topping her mouth up with lasagna. And again and again, at a feverish speed. It was incredible how much she could fit into her mouth and how fast she could swallow. Penny wondered if she even chewed before swallowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny watched the hoggish spectacle with astonishment, almost forgetting to eat her pizza. Almost but not quite, a while later her hand searched in vain for another piece. <i>Did I really eat half a pizza without noticing?</i> If the lingering greasy aroma on her lips wasn't enough, a warm feeling in her stomach confirmed it. With nothing else to do, she watched her boss eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny kept staring at her for so long that eventually \u2013 when all the food was gone \u2013 Shannon Polluck noticed. \u201cWhat? What's wrong? Is there ketchup on my face?\u201d And the landwhale yawned, tired from the effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm, no, no. I didn't expect you to eat it all, Ms. Polluck.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, you can\u2019t run a school on an empty stomach,\u201d the Headmistress chuckled, her mood improved. \u201cNow you can leave me alone, I need to read up on some stuff. You can have a look at my tomorrow visitor list meanwhile. By the time I'm done reading, I expect my scooter to be ready for the trip to cafeteria.\u201d Another yawn followed and a wave of her hand. \u201cTake my private elevator. It's parked down there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, ma'am.\u201d She retreated to the front room, her new office, and sure enough, loud snoring soon announced that her boss was 'reading.' Meanwhile Penny was busy finding her way around the school system, by the time she finally found something resembling a scheduler, she could already hear heavy thuds from the office. Shannon Polluck was awake and getting ready for her main dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny dropped everything and rushed to the elevator, taking it down to an office converted into a parking space big enough for a particularly large, souped up scooter. She powered it up just in time as a double door opened and the Headmistress lumbered in, her gut stretching most of the way to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny tried to help her and almost regretted it when the behemoth leaned on her heavily. Smothered  by the wall of fat, she choked out: \u201cYou\u2026 you have only\u2026 one visitor\u2026 tomorrow, ma'am\u2026 A, um, Tetsuko Yeng?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, dear Tetsuko. I wonder what he'd bring me this time? I mean, bring to our school. Well,\u201d the Headmistress settled her weight in the seat and on the belly rest and seized the controls, \u201cthe boy's punctual. I expect you to alert me fifteen minutes before he's due to arrive. Until then you're free.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, ma'am.\u201d Penny watched the scooter drive out into the hallway before retreating back upstairs. She would go see Gabby and then it was time for dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***<br>\r\n</div><br>\r\n/and a sidenote: As you must have noticed by now, I got inspiration regarding the fate of little Penny Simon. If you want to return the focus back to Ms. Polluck, feel free to use the other option/<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When Penny saw all the food on offer, she nearly regretted eating half a pizza not yet two hours ago. Nearly but not quite, it'd been so good! And now, as all the enticing smells hit her, she was contemplating whether she would be able to fit all three main courses into her stomach and all the desserts on top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept there were plenty of warning signs around as to where this could lead. There weren't many students left just like Gabby said, but those that were present were uniformly humongous. Penny had never seen teenagers so big in real life before. At Buttercombe they looked to be the norm. The girl in front of her was a case in point, not much taller but with a waist that stretched her mustard skirt impossibly wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cModeration, girl,\u201d Penny whispered to herself when she saw Gabby piling up lasagna next to a cheeseburger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry? What?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, nothing. It all looks so delicious. I think I'll have the taco salad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, that's a good start,\u201d Gabby said absently. \u201cNow, should I have an ice cream float, an apple pie or some sweet rolls? Eh, I'll have all three.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA good start?! All three?! Evidently her new friend must have grown used to overindulgence at the Academy. \u201cSo how long have you been working here?\u201d asked Penny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I know how it must be for you, Penny. It feels like I've been in Buttercombe for ages but in fact I was in your shoes this time last year. New, stumbling along, unsure what to do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh.\u201d Penny's eyes shied away from the jiggling orb of fat that rolled out underneath her neighbor's chest. Did Gabby get this fat in a single year? No, no. She must've been fat before, that was it. Surely. \u201cWell, yeah, I do feel a bit out of my depth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't worry, you'll adjust quickly. Everyone does, although,\u201d Gabriella giggled, \u201calthough I'll say that you've got possibly the worst job at school. Handling old Polluck isn't easy. But don't give up, I can give you some tips. Anyway, now go left, that corner table over there's kind of reserved for us, I mean, for people from the Admin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight.\u201d Penny noticed that those few students who were still eating tended to avoid that corner despite it being close to the line. \u201cSo are we the only ones eating here from Admin?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way! But Amy and Becks'n Freddie and all must've already eaten. I'd've too, if you hadn't shared your pizza, I'd be dying of hunger by now otherwise.\u201d She plopped her overloaded tray on the table and collapsed into a chair, clearly exhausted from carrying it a couple dozen feet. \u201cI am hungry as it is so\u2026 bon appetit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, you too.\u201d At first Penny thought Gabriella was exaggerating but when she saw the frantic  verve with which the Hispanic attacked her burger, she had to reassess her estimate. For the next fifteen minutes the gabby girl was unusually silent, ignoring everything but her trough. Her voracious appetite actually affected Penny too. Despite her resolution she had quickly eaten her bowl of taco salad and after a little hesitation she rose again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was what made Gabby speak again. \u201cGoing for seconds?\u201d she asked with her mouth full of an apple pie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, yeah.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCould you be a doll and take me another apple pie? If there's any left?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK.\u201d And Penny fled before her bottomless companion would make her bring another full tray. However the words \u201canything left\u201d awoke old demons in the girl. Although there seemed to be no danger of food scarcity in here, she'd ended carrying an overloaded tray for herself. \u201cYou like sweets, right?\u201d she asked as she passed over the pie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I've got a bit of a sweet tooth,\u201d Gabby chuckled uneasily. \u201cWould you believe that toothpick we've got for a new nurse criticised me for gaining weight just last week? The gall of that girl\u2026 But anyway, you're staying in Brittany Huan's old shack now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhose?\u201d Penny asked, her mouth full of lasagna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Brittany was the Headmistress' assistant before you. We used to chat, do sleepovers\u2026 She'd stayed in a small hut right next to Polluck's palace.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, that's my cabin now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen, I just got an idea. How about another sleepover? I mean, <i>a</i> sleepover? We could have a good, long chat without all these interruptions,\u201d and Gabby waved around to indicate students, \u201chave a good time, just like the old days with Britt. Huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny hesitated. She'd always been wary of too friendly faces but on the other hand she did need allies in this unfamiliar environment. Plus the girl looked harmless and she promised her tips to handle Polluck. Should she agree to the sleepover or not?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

How long had it been since she could last enjoy a free evening with her girl friends? \u201cOK, let's do it-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah! Perfect!\u201d the Latina accountant pumped her fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c-but I need to get an evening snack for Polluck first. I should be free after 9.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I know. Brittany did it just like that.\u201d Gabriella Rodriguez stuffed the rest of her second apple pie into her mouth and stood up. \u201cEnjoy the rest of your dinner, I need to get ready for our girls' night in,\u201d she winked at her and strode away surprisingly fast, given how much food she'd just consumed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny was left with several courses she'd stacked onto her tray in her scarcity-driven panic earlier.<br>\r\nShe doubted she could ever eat all of that but she wasn't one to throw out food, ever \u2013 especially not if it tasted this good. She sighed, glanced around and when nobody paid any attention to her, she slid the belt below her growing food baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny was thankful for her new cart. She doubted she'd have ever made it home otherwise. As it was, she parked the cart, staggered inside the cabin and collapsed into the nearest chair, caressing her overworked tummy. \u201cI have to watch myself better from now on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that she no longer had to move, the unusual sensation of a full stomach actually felt kind of pleasant. It was making her feel cozy, warm and sleepy\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Penny woke up, it was getting dark outside and the pressure in her stomach receded. She yawned and stretched, feeling refreshed after her nap in the cozy chair. \u201cNow wasn't there something\u2026 Oh no!\u201d The kitchen clock showed her it was quarter to nine. She almost overslept! In panic, she rushed to the palace next door and knocked. \u201cMs. Polluck?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was told to bring you an evening snack, is that right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe disembodied voice took on a disgruntled undertone again: \u201cIt should've been here already, girl! Hop to it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Penny hopped into her scooter and as she drove downhill, she felt growing anger (or was it heartburn?). This wasn't in her contract! Was she supposed to serve this hog of a headmistress day<i> and </i>night?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then she thought back to her cabin with all its trimmings, to all the perks and bonuses of her new job. An extra food run every evening wasn't that bad a trade-off, even if it seriously hampered her private life. But then \u2013 what private life did she have anyway? And by the time matters improved, surely she would find a way to handle her new boss\u2026 As she was stopping by the cafeteria, Penny was smiling again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown in the main campus Eri Flatterly was already waiting by the door, ready to close the shop. \u201cAh, good, here you are, my dear. I was worried you forgot. Here you go,\u201d she nodded and her two helpers started loading a cart into Penny's scooter. Then she thrust a box into Penny's hands. \u201cAnd this is for you, my dear, some leftover apple pies. I noticed you took three for dinner,\u201d she winked, \u201cso enjoy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, thanks. Ah! When am I expected to come next?\u201d as Penny asked, she dreaded the answer would be \u201cmidnight\u201d or something similar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe huge cook noticed as well. She chuckled, patted her hand. \u201cNo sooner than mid-morning, dear. Say around 11? Our good old Headmistress can take care of herself, mostly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, fine! See you then!\u201d and Penny rushed back at full throttle, at the staggering speed of 8 mph. She was so focused on getting the food to her boss that she nearly overlooked a round figure standing by the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! Wait for me!\u201d It was Gabby with her arms full of snacks. \u201cI saw you coming and thought I could hitch a hike.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, uh, hop in. It's going to be a bit of a squeeze.\u201d Penny took the pie box from a smaller backup seat and put it into her lap where it collided with the bump of her stomach. \u201cOuch. Uh, Gabby, it's nice of you to bring all that food but I don't think I can eat another bite\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's OK, this is mostly for me! I can't watch movies without snacking!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she saw her new friend's hips overflow from the small seat on both sides, Penny had no trouble believing that. \u201cWell, I'll deliver the cart in the back to Ms. Polluck's and we can start.\u201d She turned onto the driveway, slid the cart from her scooter and knocked. \u201cYour evening snack, Ms. Polluck!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlocking her cabin, Penny put the pie box on the kitchen table and went back for her travel bag, still lying in the doorway. \u201cGabby? Go on into the living room, I need to sort this out.\u201d She solved the problem by stuffing the bag in the closet, opening it and taking out her other good suit as an afterthought. She should be smartly dressed tomorrow for the Yeng heir!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she was finished hanging it, the Latina's cheerful voice boomed: \u201cWow, you've got a pre-paid Netflix, Amazon <i>and </i>Hulu here- Britt didn't have that! I know what we're going to watch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, just pick something easy to watch. Some comedy maybe? I'm not in the mood for heavy thoughts.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight you are, Pen. Oh, I haven't seen this one yet! 'Lightness of Being' sound good?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess.\u201d When Penny finally made to the living room, Gabriella was already settled in, a plethora of snacks spread around in easy reach, and she was just opening a family bag of chips. \u201cWanna beer? I think I saw some in my fridge.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? I wouldn't mind having some.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood. Me too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly now did Penny fully realise how wound up she was from the strain of her first day at Buttercombe. It was nice to unwind with beer and snacks and idle gossip. She didn't remember much of the movies; even of the second one, a horror she chose on a dare. But that might have been because alcohol already clouded her judgment, making her laugh at the scary scenes. Alcohol also helped her forget her resolve not to overeat anymore. So what? Life was good, finally, so she could let her hair down and enjoy.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The evening was wonderful, what followed was less so. Penny spent half the night awake, listening to \u2013 and feeling \u2013 her intestines struggle with the overload. The overabundance of alcohol still circulating in her veins made it a bearable experience, even somewhat pleasurable despite the pain. But as time went on, her body was breaking alcohol down and she was gradually feeling worse and worse. \u201cAah. I'll never try to keep up with Gabby again\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny spent hours tossing in her sinfully soft bed before an idea hatched in her mind. The Academy had her the cabin fully supplied with everything she could ever need. Wasn't it likely that they might have prepared for her present predicament too?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as it occurred to her, Penny was on her bare feet, ignoring the cold as she hurried to the bathroom. She almost knocked over a lamp before remembering to switch the lights on, burst into the bathroom and tore the cabinet door open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes! There it was \u2013 a plain-looking bottle labelled <b>Yeng Stomach Aid; Adult Version</b>. Penny hesitated but then she pulled the cork out with her teeth, tilted it and let a couple drops fall on her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt tasted like most medical concoctions, sort of nice and yet she wanted to gag. She swallowed and returned to the bed at a more sedate pace, hoping it would do its job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt did. Her digestive system calmed down and Penny could finally shut her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven before she opened her eyes again, Penny knew there was something wrong. And a look at the (school-provided) alarm clock confirmed what she dreaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe overslept!<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no, don't panic, Penny,\u201d she tried to calm herself while she sprinted from her bed to get the business suit she'd unpacked yesterday. \u201cYou still have\u2026 ten minutes before the harpy headmistress starts looking for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily there was still an apple pie left on the kitchen table (only one? Where did the rest of them go?) so she took it along for the ride downhill. Penny drove with one hand, the other alternating between buttoning up her blouse and taking bites of the pie. She made it to the Admin Building with two minutes to spare, rushed into the lift and fifteen seconds early she knocked on her boss' door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNobody answered so she opened the door. \u201cI'm here, Ms. \u2026 Polluck?\u201d The snoring that resonated throughout the sound-proofed room told her all she needed to know. Penny carefully closed the door again and sat down into her chair, feeling drained after the morning scare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrained and peckish. Somehow one pie was not enough to sate her hunger so she stood up again to visit the vending machine and pick some caramel cakes to go with her morning coffee. A visit to the  bathroom to do her makeup took care of the rest of her needs and she switched on her tabletop to start the day.<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><br>\r\n***<br>\r\n</div><br>\r\nTwenty minutes before the Japanese visitor was to arrive, Penny knocked on the door again. \u201cMs. Polluck? You know you have a visitor coming, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe landwhale was awake now. She grunted, then she remembered her assistant was new. \u201cI know! Let the dear boy in as soon as he comes, do not let him wait.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, Ma'am.\u201d 'Dear boy?' This piqued Penny's interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever else he was, the Yeng heir was definitely punctual. Five minutes before the hour she heard the lift arrive on the top floor. Knowing it would not hurt to make the best impression, she jumped to open the door. \u201cGood morning, Mr. Yeng, welcome to Buttercombe Academy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTetsuko Yeng looked like a typical Japanese businessman, from immaculate suit to the slick black hair, probably oiled to stay in place. Penny would dearly like to know what set the Yeng heir apart from a run-of-the-mill manager, so she added: \u201cMs. Polluck is in and she is expecting you;\u201d in the hope of eliciting a response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo luck. \u201cThank you.\u201d He strode in and disappeared behind the soundproof door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny felt a little \u2013 well, a lot \u2013 snubbed by that. Still standing by the open door, she noticed the vending machine in the hallway. She deserved a treat for being treated so nastily, right? It was chocolate butter cakes this time and as she ate, she consoled herself not to expect anything better from such a self-important, self-absorbed\u2026 prick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would love to know what was going on in the Headmistress' office<br>\r\nTo her surprise he didn't breeze past. Instead he sat on the corner of her desk, giving her a good look at his expensively tailored pants. \u201cHello, we didn't have time to introduce ourselves. I am Tetsuko Yeng.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPenny Simon, pleased to meet you,\u201d she squeaked in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cSo, Miss Penny, how are you finding your new work?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you know how it is\u2026\u201d she was not going to elaborate but to her surprise, the Japanese heir  used several well-aimed question to get the whole story out of her. When she thought back to it later, she could not believe how smoothly he got her to talk about everything that bugged her in Buttercombe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe he sighed, patted her hand. \u201cI know from personal experience it is not always easy to get along with Ms. Polluck but she plays a key role in\u2026 in the Buttercombe Academy so if there are any hiccups, do not hesitate to call me and I shall do my best to correct matters,\u201d a calling card appeared in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks a lot!\u201d Penny smiled cheerfully as she took it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGoodbye then, Miss Simon.\u201d he shook her hand and started to leave. \u201cOh, and I'd lay off those cakes, if I were you. You'd better start watching your weight in this place...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you for your advice, Mr. Yeng.\u201d Penny almost managed to keep sarcasm out of her voice. She waited until the door closed and ripped the rest of the package open. There were still two butter cakes left \u2013 but not for long. \u201cThe nerve!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter throwing out the empty packing to the bin where it joined its predecessors, Penny licked her lips and hesitated. The cakes tasted good, incomparably better than the standard supermarket rubbish she was used to, but Buttercombe kitchen was much better yet. And right now she could go for something more substantial to get over the oily man. In fact\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rose and knocked on her boss' door again. \u201cMs. Polluck? I was thinking I could run into the cafeteria for your mid-morning snack.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood thinking, girl! I was just getting peckish. Hop to it!\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Fukuda.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny froze. This did not bode well for the recently appointed personal assistant but try as she might, she couldn't think of anything that might have offended the de facto boss of the academy. She knew she had to comply so she rushed across the hallway and knocked. \u201cIt's me, Penny Simon!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny's heart skipped a beat when Dr. Hinamizawa turned her face to her. If looks could kill\u2026 \u201cWhat did the heir want?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny pushed her glasses up to hide her confusion. \u201cExcuse me? Who?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am asking you about Mr. Yeng the Third. What did he want?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shrugged. \u201cUmm, I don't know? I wasn't there when he spoke with the Headmistress. I just let him in and\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh! I know that! Are you feeble-minded, girl?! What did he want from you? After he left Ms. Polluck!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would be interesting to watch Fukuda lose her icy calm, if anyone else but Penny were the source of her ire. So the vice principal somehow knew Tetsuko Yeng spent some time speaking with her? Never mind, now she had to mollify the fire breathing dragon in front of her. \u201cOh\u2026 oh, sorry. No, I mean\u2026 Well, he just offered help. In case something went wrong, errr\u2026 'in case of hiccups' were his words, I think, I am to call him and he 'll help me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFukuda's eyes narrowed. \u201cInteresting. Our boy promised to <i>help</i> you? Well, should any 'hiccup' happen, better tell me first. I shall provide you any assistance you may need <i>and</i> decide whether you may call Mr. Yeng too or not.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny shrugged again. What was the fuss about? It was all the same to her. \u201cOK, I will. Anything else?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strict matron took a deep breath before forcing her lips into a resemblance of a smile. \u201cAs it happens, yes. Since you are here, Miss Simon, I have a gift for you.\u201d She opened a drawer and paused, waiting for her reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite herself, Penny felt intrigued. \u201cYes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFukuda placed a sleek black rectangle on her desk and slid it across. \u201cI bet you haven't seen a smartphone of these qualities, much less owned it. am I right, Miss Simon? Well, courtesy of our most generous sponsor, the Yeng Corporation, it is yours. I hope you shall start using it right away due to its upgraded safety features, though I suppose you would be better motivated by other features, such as pre-paid fast internet, a high-quality camera, a long-lasting battery\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kept talking but Penny didn't hear, so entranced she was in the gadget. The pompous Oriental was correct; she had never seen anything like it. She kept turning it in her hands until some words finally pierced her bubble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, Miss Simon? I said that was all, Miss Simon!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, yeah, right. Thank you, Dr. Hinamizawa. See you, Dr. Hinamizawa.\u201d And Penny staggered out of the office still stunned by her precious gift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was closing the door, the vice principal noticed her vacant expression. \u201cDon't forget to bring the Headmistress her morning snack, Miss Simon!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Dr. Hinamizawa.

Her duties essentially consisted of managing the Headmistress (and her hunger) \u2013 that meant providing enough fuel for her appetite and adjusting her schedule accordingly. Penny quickly learned that the best time to schedule appointments was 60 minutes after a meal. Earlier the Headmistress would be grumpy that they interfered with her siesta, leave it later than 120 minutes and she would be hungry and ill-tempered to her visitors again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs long as the beast of her stomach was sated, her fierce temper never surfaced and Ms. Polluck was the best boss she could have. Penny wouldn't admit it to herself yet but she was beginning to like her job, well-paid, leisurely and undemanding. And the benefits! In fact there were so many that she would have forgotten about one of them, had Shiro not reminded her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Friday afternoon, Penny had just finished eating her share of the Headmistress' snack, now she closed the Yeng Social Network app and was lazily contemplating what to do next. She knew without checking that her boss would be in a food coma for the next hour and wouldn't object to her leaving early. In fact, there was only one obstacle to it \u2013 her own stomach, filled to the brim with leftover tacos, was making her sleepy too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo when she heard a knock on the door, she wasn't sure whether to feel angry or relieved that someone was going to keep her in the office. \u201cCome in!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe school nurse appeared to be in a good mood. \u201cHi! I hope I'm not disturbing anything important but\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSssh! Not so loud!\u201d Penny whispered urgently. \u201cThe Headmistress is, uh, resting her eyes. But come in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiro Fukiyama slipped inside and toned it down. \u201cAh, I see. I was just wondering if you've given some thought to your new glasses.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr would you prefer contacts?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, well\u2026\u201d It looked like Penny wouldn't get her well-deserved rest so she stood up with a grunt, picked her purse and smartphone. \u201cLet's go out. Trust me, you don't want to wake up the sleeping dragon.\u201d In the hallway, she could speak normally again. \u201cActually I've completely forgotten about the glasses.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dBetter not put it off anymore. As it happens, I am going to town tomorrow in my car to pick up some medicine samples. Want me to take you along? I could help you select the best model for you, health-wise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou're going to Wellington? That'd be cool!\u201d Thrilled by the offer Penny raised her voice a little more and it evoked an immediate reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA door opened down the hall and a round face peeked out. \u201cOoh, a town trip? Can I tag along? Can I? I'll show you all the best restaurants in town!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGabby?

I haven't really had a chance to look around on my way to Buttercombe. It looks\u2026 different.\u201d Penny thought she had gotten used to the rampant obesity at the Academy, to students and staff waddling along. Wellington brought it to yet another level. Here was a whole town full of fatties who went about their business as if their size was normal and it was Penny <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, the town looks this good because the locals benefit from several Yeng subsidiaries that set up shop nearby.\u201d Shiro's poker face hid whatever opinion she might hold about it. \u201cAnyway,  the mall is at the end of this street.

Right, Penny?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm, I've just had breakfast\u2026\u201d and yet pizza sounded good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Just?</i> We've been driving for over an hour, girl! It's high time for a midmorning snack.\u201d Gabby pushed on, seeing her doubts. \u201cBesides, don't you see that signboard? Doesn't it look yummy? Hey, Shiro! Stop! Why are driving us away? You could park right in front! OK, girls, this is just mean. At least gimme a hand, you two, help me get out of the car, I'm stuck here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tall thin girl turned back and grabbed her plush hand. \u201cSee? This is\u2026 why you\u2026 God, you're heavy! \u2026should give up\u2026 more than just one pizza.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith both Penny's and Shiro's help, Gabby's extra wide hips finally cleared the door, her face flushed with the exertion. She huffed. \u201cGive up?! Huh! It's not my fault you've got a dwarf-sized car! Oh, I get it, you're jealous of my plush curves, skinny. Penny, you settle it. What will it be? A yummy pizza or\u2026 glasses?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Besides, they weren't here to stuff their faces; she wanted to get all the benefits of her new job and she suspected that if they stuffed themselves silly again, Gabby could refuse to move \u2013 or worse, <i>she</i> would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am glad that someone has their priorities right,\u201d Shiro Fukiyama had a look at the round Latina and set a brisk pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh well,\u201d Gabriella sighed as she waddled after them. \u201cLet's go then, the sooner it's over the sooner we'll eat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiro led them to the optician, gave him Penny's prescription and strode away on her errand. Penny was a little worried Gabby would desert her for food and she would be left alone in there, without the benefit of a friendly advice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily her new friend soon forgot about her grumbling stomach as they browsed rows upon rows of glass frames. Her funk was replaced with bubbly enthusiasm as she pointed out her favorites. \u201cOh, these look good! See! Or these? And how about\u2026 Err. What would you prefer?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm\u2026\u201d Most of the frames Gabby liked were too gaudy to Penny's liking. \u201cMaybe something a little more conservative?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn that case perhaps you would like to have a look at the next section, ma'am? These are for our younger clientele,\u201d suggested the optician, leading them further inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you.\u201d The next display case was indeed more subdued. Penny started looking but her friend was faster again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOooh! Try these! This is a perfect look for you!\u201d Gabby snatched frames inlaid with mother of pearl and thrust them to Penny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hesitantly turned them around, they still drew attention to her more than she would have liked. She put them on her face and squinted to see herself in the mirror. \u201cYou think? I look like a secretary.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGabby chuckled. \u201cWell, that's what you do. Besides, you look like a <i>sexy</i> secretary. Am I right, Shiro?\u201d she addressed a person behind Penny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurse just walked in, carrying a large package under her arm and looking a little out of breath. \u201cGod, I'd swear the pharmacy was much closer\u2026 What? Huh, yes, these look fine. They make you look\u2026 responsible, competent, in charge. Is that the look you're going for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d Penny would have liked to try more options but her attitude changed when her stomach growled. \u201cGood. In that case, I'll take these.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, sir, my friend's covered by the Yeng Extended Insurance Policy, if you know what that is?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course. Most our customers have it, ma'am. Please follow me.\u201d They went to the counter and filled in the forms. Penny put her signature to it and the optician turned to her: \u201cWe'll fit in the lenses and send the glasses to your address, if that's OK?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, yeah, sure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd the address is?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny blushed. \u201cOh, right. It's Buttercombe Academy, Cabin 34, uh\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's fine, I can fill in the rest. We've had many satisfied customers from your Academy already, ladies. I hope you'll like your new glasses and come back for more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, I definitely will.\u201d <i>As long as it's free\u2026 I ought to ask Shiro how often I can use this benefit. It wouldn't hurt to have one pair of glasses for work, another more daring for clubbing, another\u2026 or maybe get contacts?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGabby's voice tore Penny out of her fantasies. \u201cAnd now can we finally eat? I'm dying of hunger here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, that would be a tragedy! We can't have you waste away, huh?\u201d Shiro chuckled but there was no malice in her words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on! That's mean. Besides,\u201d Penny inhaled the enticing smells wafting through the mall. \u201cI'm getting hungry too. Let's go see some of those best restaurants that Gabby promised us.\u201c<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><br>\r\n***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe list of 'best restaurants' that Gabby had promised was actually rather short. But her two friends gladly agreed that Epicurean Delights more than lived up to its name. They spent a very nourishing hour in there. And Becky's Bakery was shaping up to be even better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, my poor stomach,\u201d moaned Penny, cradling the swollen orb. \u201cI can't eat another bite!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen don't,\u201d Shiro shrugged, running her hand over the bulge in her midriff. \u201cI don't think I will either.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I want to! It smells so wonderful!\u201d Penny felt like a little girl in a sweet shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGabby looked at her with pity. \u201cYou have to show your stomach who is the boss, young padawan. The longest journey starts with a single step. Don't think about it, empty your mind of all distractions, take a spoon of the yummy cheesecake, put it into your mouth, swallow, and repeat. Slowly, step by step, you will beat your limitations.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Penny tried it\u2026 and it worked. The heap of cake on her plate grew smaller until she found herself scraping the last leftover bits off the porcelain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiro watched it with amazement. \u201cWant the rest of my tiramisu too? I'm too full to finish it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny had been too full as well, but it didn't stop her. Some laborious chewing and swallowing later she cleared Shiro's plate too. \u201cI did it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood job, girl, but you still got a long way to go.\u201d Gabby smiled smugly. She managed to demolish a whole chocolate cake in the meantime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wonder how the two of you will make it to the car.\u201d Shiro had claimed there was no need to drive \u201ca couple hundred yards\u201d to park closer to the bakery. Now all three were regretting it. The walk back to their car was pure torture even for Shiro who'd tried to hold back. \u201cNext time\u2026 I'll pay more heed to your advice, Gabby,\u201d the tall girl sighed after first few steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo avoid wondering whether her stomach could really explode, Penny looked around for a diversion. And she soon found one. Watching stuffed Gabby walk was\u2026 educational. She was leaning backward to compensate for the heavy load in her gut, her legs spread wide apart and feet at 90\u00b0 so as to better carry it. She was making short steps, her foot always made a little circle before stepping down and sending shockwaves all over her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis puzzled Penny until she noticed that the girl couldn't properly see the ground over her voluminous chest. She was essentially walking blind. And that searching motion of her feet was apparently so ingrained in her that Gabby was doing it subconsciously. Her conscious actions were limited to sipping a milkshake she took 'to go,' bemoaning the heat and wiping perspiration off her forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that Penny would fare any better, despite being much lighter on her feet. When they finally reached Shiro's car and stuffed Gabriella in the back, she collapsed into her seat, her face red from all the exertion. She did not envy the nurse who now had to drive them back all the way to the Academy. And she'd helped with the optician\u2026 Perhaps Penny should pay it back to her somehow? \u201cUh, Shiro? We're having a movie night with Gabby today. Wanna join us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiro turned to her and paused, thinking. \u201cWell\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

It'll be a blast, you'll see.\u201d At least Penny hoped so, although Gabby's dark look from the backseat promised a blast of a different kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe'll see.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough the trio could see the buildings of the Buttercombe Academy rising in the hills before them, sunlight reflecting off the dome on the main building. \u201cHome, sweet home,\u201d joked Penny, except it was not quite a joke. She'd been here what- a week? - and yet she already felt more at home here than at any her previous post.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I can't wait 'till we get there,\u201d agreed Gabby. \u201cOh, Shiro? Could we stop by the gate? I need to pick up my mail. Could we do it on the way back?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiro stepped on the gas to climb the last hill. \u201cGood idea. I ought to do drop by too. Even if it's probably just junk mail. All right, ladies, get your bracelets ready, we're here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen their car stopped at the gate, an enormously fat guard waddled out of the guardhouse. \u201cGetting back from town?\u201d she huffed as she tried to steady her tremendous olive coloured gut, pouring out of several sizes too small white uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. Good afternoon, Rio.\u201d Shiro opened the glove compartment and Penny was astonished to see her take out the biggest chocolate she'd ever seen. \u201cHere's something for your trouble.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard beamed as she snatched it. \u201cAh, good! You may drive in, Nurse.\u201d And she slowly turned around. \u201cI'll lift the bar\u2026 in a minute.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, and we'll also be picking up some mail!\u201d Gabby shouted at her slowly retreating back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood\u2026 Come inside\u2026 to the counter\u2026 you know\u2026 the drill. I won't be\u2026 lugging it out\u2026 for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiro drove to a small parking place just behind the gate and turned to Penny. \u201cDon't get me wrong, please. As a medical professional, normally I'd never offer empty calories to someone as morbidly obese as Ms. Ayala,\u201d she lowered her voice to a whisper. \u201cBut the last time I drove back from Wellington she made so much fuss about it. I almost had to strip naked! And when I complained to Dr. Schwartz, she told me \u2013 well, she literally <i>ordered</i> me\u2013 to appease the guards with something sweet. The bigger the better. So\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo now we'll have to help Gabby get out, huh?\u201d Penny stood up, slid her seat forward and reached to grab Gabby's hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, it's not my fault that someone has too small a car,\u201d she complained when she made it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine,\u201d Shiro shrugged. \u201cYou can walk the rest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rotund accountant halted. \u201cOh, please! Don't you see I was joking?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two went inside still bickering. With nothing better to do, Penny trudged after them. Perhaps she ought to intervene? But there was no need, they stopped as soon as they saw the guard \u2013 Rio? - was already waiting at the counter, catching her breath after the hike. \u201cNow as you know, ladies, I need to see your IDs, please. Bracelets won't be enough.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, right,\u201d Gabby fished in her purse until she found her identification badge. Penny knew what it looked like from her own \u2013 three separate holograms, three identification codes for various on-campus services as well as her picture and start date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard now looked at it and sighed. \u201cMs. Rodriguez, how many times have I told you that you have to update the photo? I cannot accept this as your proof of identity.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, OK, I'll update it,\u201d Gabby sighed heavily and took a Yeng bar from her purse. \u201cCan you make an exception, just once?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bar disappeared as if by magic. \u201cBut only once. The next time you have to have it updated. Here you go, Ms. Rodriguez, I'll fetch your mail.\u201d And the guard started sliding across the floor in her heavily reinforced chair rather than walk a couple steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGabby was turning her ID in hand, frowning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLemme see\u2026 Wow!\u201d Penny saw a slim, conventionally beautiful face. <i>That </i>was supposed to be Gabriella a year ago? She looked at the familiar face of her friend, dominated by plump cheeks and ringed with a thick second chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I know, right? I looked like such a child. Thank you, Ms. \u2026\u201d Gabby glanced at her nametag, \u201cMs. Ayala. See you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiro collected her mail without any hitch and as they went back to Shiro's car, Penny suddenly had a horrible thought. Did she miss a delivery to Ms. Polluck? She froze for a moment, let out a sigh of relief. \u201cGirls, you don't know how happy I am that it's the weekend.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nBehind her, Gabby shrugged. \u201cThat goes for all of us, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo- Well yes but it's more than that. Saturday and Sunday are the only days of the week when I don't have to wait on our Headmistress hand and foot, you see?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo this is my humble abode.\u201d Despite her words, Penny actually felt proud of her home for the first time ever. And Shiro's open admiration made her feel good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, it looks beautiful, much better than my own shack. Oh, you've even got a shake maker. That's\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwesome, right? I wish I had one in my cabin too. So, I know Penny loves caramel milk shakes-\u201d Gabby started punching orders \u201c-I'll have chocolate one, of course and which do you prefer, Shiro?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut we've just eaten\u2026 Oh, uh, mint, I suppose.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, I'd eat something. It's been a long time since lunch.\u201d Not really; an hour sitting in the car, fifteen minutes sorting out the mail and stopping at Gabby's and Shiro's cabin. But Penny was already under the Buttercombe spell and she was feeling peckish again. \u201cJust a small snack. You always need snacks for watching movies, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took three family-sized bags of chips from the pantry, regularly re-stocked by Buttercombe caretakers, and put them on the coffee table next to the shakes, adding a carton of cookies as an afterthought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, everything's ready except- What are we going to watch?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, I don't know.\u201d Gabby has already made herself comfortable in the loveseat and was opening the first bag. \u201cMaybe look at Netflix or Hulu what's new? Shiro, can you imagine? Penny's got all the networks, everything fully paid for! Can you imagine?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh, well,\u201d Shiro finally joined Penny on the sofa, \u201cI don't watch TV that much. But I suppose it is a big deal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou joking? That's da bomb!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway, back to my question.\u201d Penny tried to steer the conversation away from yet another stumbling block. \u201cIs there anything you'd prefer, Shiro?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot really, no.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then, let's have a look what's new on Netflix. Hopefully it's something good\u2026\u201d and while she handled the remote, her other hand grabbed first chips.<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><br>\r\n***<br>\r\n</div><br>\r\nTwo hours later and half an hour into their third movie, Penny shrugged. \u201cWell, this one is a dud too. Anyone wants to see more?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLess, if it were ever possible,\u201d Shiro sighed. \u201cA pity that some things cannot be unseen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI feel like I've forgotten something,\u201d Penny looked around, hoping something might jog her memory. \u201cOh well, better tidy up in here, the room is a mess.\u201d And she started picking up empty wrappers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know!\u201d Gabby suddenly piped up. \u201cIt's time for dinner!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDinner? I feel like I've just finished my snack.\u201d The nurse's blouse was strewn with chip dust. It may have been the first time the thin girl indulged like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExactly. That means it's time for dinner,\u201d the tubby accountant agreed, chuckling. \u201cI mean, seriously. It's half past six and you know the cafeteria's closing earlier today since they don't cook for students over the weekend. It's high time to order, especially since it's Italian Night today and you know what means!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah! Pizza!\u201d Recalling the taste of homemade Buttercombe pizza Penny almost forgot how her stomach churned, processing everything else she'd eaten today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually I planned to go for lasagna today but\u2026\u201d Shiro sighed. \u201cI am too full to go there and they refuse to deliver by phone.\u201d She shared a look with Penny across the sofa. Neither of them wanted to go all the way downhill, even if it were to dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly the biggest of the trio was the most mobile (or at least the one most eager to get more food). Gabriella stood up and waddled to the door. \u201cSo that's one pizza, a pan of lasagna-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust one portion!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNonsense. We'll want to have a taste too. Right, Penny? Pizza, lasagna, some mozzarella sticks, I suppose there'll be Italian ice cream- oh, and I need to take something for me too\u2026\u201d Her voice slowly faded away, muffled by the puttering of the scooter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two Buttercombe novices shared an uneasy look. \u201cWe don't have to eat it all, you know? You've got a huge fridge.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, yeah, I do\u2026\u201d Neither of them wanted to admit she didn't trust her willpower anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***<br>\r\n</div><br>\r\n/character limit strikes again/</span></div></div>",

Even Harrison Ford running away from the Nazis on the extra-wide TV screen received little attention as all three girls focused on their stomachs. Silence was occasionally broken with moans and groans, half from pain, half from pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd no wonder. Every horizontal surface within reach was full of  empty dishes. There were two large pizza plates, a lasagna pan, an empty tray with cream smears (all that was left of tiramisu), three bowls that used to contain ice cream floats. Only Gabby's hand was still moving, operating on autopilot as it stuffed more mozzarella sticks into her mouth at regular intervals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she watched her friend, Penny wondered where the girl was putting it all. She gingerly caressed her stomach. \u201cOof, I ate too much again!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, right?\u201d Shiro sighed. \u201cI don't get this school. Everything seems to be designed to push more food on you. And it's so delicious it is hard to resist.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIsn't it awesome?\u201d Gabby finally stopped munching. \u201cI've never eaten so well in my life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, yes, me neither. It is but what about the consequences?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean like weight gain? Screw it! All this eating is worth a couple pounds.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA couple pounds? Can you hear yourself? I warned you against this attitude during your check-up, Gabriella.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGirls, girls,\u201d Penny intervened to stop the impending quarrel. She frantically thought what could make the two shut up. \u201cHow about we have one last dessert and call it a night?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlready? The night's still young.\u201d Gabby<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe night may be young but I feel as old as the hills,\u201d Penny sighed. \u201cAll that bustle and excitement in the town wore me out. Sorry. Uhhh\u2026\u201d she groaned. As she stretched to grab a package of cupcakes on a shelf underneath the coffee table, she pressed her sensitive tummy into the sofa cushion and for a moment she was sure she would burst. \u201cOomph. Here you go,\u201d she offered a cupcake to Shiro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, no, thanks. I am FULL.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'll have one. Or two. Can I have Shiro's too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, here you go. Thank God it's Sunday tomorrow,\u201d Penny sighed as she tore into her cupcake. \u201cI won't leave my bed all day. I need to relax sooo badly, today was sooo exhausting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou tell me. I am going to read all the medical journals I brought today and not even think about food.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight.\u201d Penny punctuated her consent by slamming the empty cupcake wrapper on the coffee table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh? So I can't count on you to come with me to the cafeteria, Penny? You know it's Burger Day again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh\u2026 well, maybe. But I'll only have something small.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChatting about their plans \u2013 or lack thereof \u2013 they polished their last cupcakes and looked around as they tried to gather the strength to stand up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs expected, Shiro was the first to succeed. \u201cNo need to stand up, Penny, we'll find the way out. Right, Gabby?\u201d she turned to the Latina and tugged, dislodging her huge behind from the loveseat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, thanks, girls. Only, could you bring me something from the bathroom before you go?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure. What is it?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, just a small vial labelled Stomach Aid?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, good idea, Penny. Mind if I have a go too?\u201d and the tubby accountant waddled to the bathroom at a remarkable speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conversation left Shiro puzzled. \u201cWhat the hell were you two speaking about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don't know, Shiro? Aren't you the nurse around here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat I am but\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's no rocket science, look.\u201d Returning Gabby took a big swig before giving the vial to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeng Stomach Aid? Ah, I see, a digestive. I never needed it before.\u201d Shiro turned the vial around. \u201cInteresting. Never heard about it before either. I must have a look at it, when I have some free time.\u201d She passed it to Penny. \u201cAnyway, good night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026 g'night.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny emptied the rest of the bottle and made herself comfortable on the sofa, unwilling (or unable?) to move any further. As she watched her stomach rising high, stuffed full with all the yummy Buttercombe food, a mix of shame and curiosity overtook her.<i> I overate so much today. I wonder if I would be able to fit in even more tomorrow?</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>On Sunday shortly after noon loud ringing tore Penny out of her slumber. She swallowed a swearword and looked at her phone display. \u201cHi, Gabby. Yesterday girls' night was good, eh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was, only too short. Coming to lunch with me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm\u2026 How about we invite Shiro along?\u201d Penny's suggestion was not entirely selfless. She noticed that with Shiro present she tended to hold herself back a tiny bit more. More importantly, the tall girl soaked up calories that would otherwise end in her stomach. And her sweatpants were feeling a little snug today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? I don't know.\u201d Gabby sounded like she <i>did</i> know. \u201cI don't much care for her barbs. Why must she always harp about my weight?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, it wasn't so bad yesterday. In fact, the longer the evening went on, the less she harped, remember? Maybe we could tame her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGabby chuckled. \u201cHuh, well. That's not a bad idea actually. OK, let her tag along. If she wants to at all, eh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn hindsight it wasn't so strange that Penny, Shiro and Gabriela bonded. True, they didn't share much in common personality-wise. Shiro was cold and aloof, Gabby just as talkative as her name suggested and a little childish, and Penny mostly silent and guarded. However, circumstances conspired to push them together. In a place where everything else was about education and students, their jobs set them aside and their youth and relative inexperience set them apart from more senior members of the staff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving said that, their new friendship did have its hiccups too. It was inevitable \u2013 they were three different women, with very different upbringing, lifestyle and hobbies. Nowhere else was it as apparent as when the trio went to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGabriella Rodriguez seemed determined to help her friends enjoy Buttercombe to the fullest, literally so. Like the following Wednesday: she opened her door as Penny was hauling Ms. Polluck's lunch cart along the hallway. \u201cAh, good, here you are! Come with me to the cafeteria! It's lunchtime!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I'm still full from our midmorning snack.\u201d As she said it, Penny subconsciously licked her lips. Gabby made her eat a whole apple pie and now that she recalled its taste, she felt getting peckish again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what? Today it's German Cuisine Day! You can't miss that! Dr. Schwartz is always overseeing the cooking, <i>personally</i>! It's to die for!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou say that about every meal here. Besides, I need to deliver Ms. Polluck's lunch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo? That'll take you ten minutes and you told me you have two hours free after that. Pleease. I don't want to go to cafeteria all alone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, OK, fine, I'll go. But I'll have only something light. And we'll stop in the infirmary to take Shiro.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say 'something light' turned into a grilled two-pound bratwurst with sauerkraut and a huge bagel. Later, as Penny watched her two friends still eating, thirst (and renewed hunger) made her go for some juice, and a second helping of marble kuchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn another occasion all three women were sprawled in their cafeteria seats, busy digesting their large dinner, when Gabby stood up. \u201cI'm going for another dessert, girls. Want me to bring you some too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer friends shared an amused look. \u201cNo way, I'm stuffed!\u201d protested Shiro. \u201cI couldn't eat a single bite-\u201d and Penny finished her declaration with a burp smelling of garlic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGabby shrugged and a while later she returned with another full tray so heavy that she barely managed to carry it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you going to eat all that, Gabs? Are you bottomless or what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, no, no.\u201d And she placed a bowl of chocolate pudding with all the trimmings before each girl.  \u201cThat's yours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought you might get peckish soon. Don't tell me  \u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Gabriella ate the rest of her tray, both puddings were gone too. She grinned at her groaning friends, \u201cSee, what did I tell you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd sometimes Gabby's attention was simply unwelcome. \u201cOooh, are those stretchmarks?\u201d she asked when they were leaving Penny's cabin after another girls' night. \u201cLook, Shiro, you are an expert!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? No!\u201d and Penny quickly pulled her shirt down over the annoying love handle that peeked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, that's nothing to be ashamed of, everyone has them. I can give you the perfect cream that makes them disappear\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told you I don't have any stretchmarks!! But I'll take your cream, just in case.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, a friendly Shiro Fukiyama did not lose her focus on healthy living just because she befriended Gabriella Rodriguez. She did mellow out and sometimes her advice sounded just a little bit hypocritical. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuch as when they were resting after another major meal in Penny's house. Shiro caressed her stuffed tummy as she addressed them: \u201cRemember, girls, when you are past 25, your metabolism starts slowing down. Even if you eat the same, you start putting on weight. You need to watch what you eat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGabby winked at Penny. \u201cYou mean watch like this?\u201d and she poured another box of truffles into the bowl that Shiro just emptied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, I shouldn't\u2026 I mean, really!\" Even before she said it, she poured the first handful into her mouth. \u201cBut they're divine!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother time she said gravely to her friend: \u201cGabby, I don't need a scale to tell you're still gaining. And do not think you are spared either just because the number on your scale does not rise,\u201d she turned to Penny. \u201cIt is pretty obvious that you are losing muscle mass and replacing it with fat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm\u2026\u201d it probably wasn't the best moment to say that the number on Penny's scale <i>was </i>rising. She chose to counterattack instead. \u201cThen I suppose you alone are immune to weight gain? Since you've just polished an entire bag of bacon-flavoured chips? A family-sized bag?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, uh, but- but that doesn't make it any less true!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't get your pants in a twist, Shiro. After all, I clearly remember you telling me I ought to watch myself eat. So I do, all day long.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said watch<i> what</i> you eat!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShiro? Another bag of chips? Bacon-flavoured, your favorite.\u201d And Penny threw the bag on her to stop the nascent quarrel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny Simon liked to think of herself as the voice of reason, moderating both extremes. However, as time went on (and her stomach stretched) she found herself drifting ever more towards Gabby's viewpoint: more pie? Yes, please! Exercise? Ugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiro must have noticed the change in their group dynamic too, judging by the fact that her pleas were turning into demands. She was getting more confrontational every day, driven to frustration by her own expanding waist. Still, Penny couldn't care less about her weight. She was enjoying the day, this was a problem for tomorrow, now bring the cake!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were other shadows in her paradise though, most notably\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Penny had never had it so good. Never before had she felt so welcome. At Buttercombe she had an easy job, amazing food, good friends, an incredible house, wonderful food, plenty of free time, so many benefits and the food was to die for\u2026 and if (when) she overate, there was the Yeng digestive to make everything better. In short, Penny took to life at the Academy like a duck to water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was not to say there weren't any shadows in Penny's paradise. Her clothes, for one thing. Sometimes her body felt like a bowl of dough, rising higher every day. And yet she could not afford to splurge on new things for the time being so she was forced to wear her ever-tighter wardrobe every day to work. She consoled herself she wasn't alone in her plight, Shiro and Gabby were in the same boat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut an even bigger shadow in her garden of Eden, the biggest one \u2013 literally \u2013 was her boss. Dealing with the Headmistress Shannon Polluck often felt like trying to tame a hungry dragon. Yes, Penny had learned that as long as she kept her boss' stomach topped up at all times, everything was fine. But God forbid if she ever let her guard down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike that one day a couple weeks after she settled into her comfortable routine at Buttercombe. She awoke with a start again. She had been spending most evenings with her BFFs lately and her sleep periods had shrunk to 4-5 hours at most. She enjoyed those evenings but every morning after she was paying the price for her nightly indulgence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh! Oh my head.\u201d Penny rolled over on her bed to see her alarm clock. \u201cWhat time\u2026 ? Almost nine already?! Oh no, I can't be late again!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHopefully she wouldn't. But Penny needed a quick pick-me-up. She was constantly craving sugar these mornings to keep her awake and alert. Like so many times lately, she started her coffeemaker, dashed to the bathroom, threw on her business suit and grabbed the finished coffee along with some cookies from her endlessly restocked cupboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe unloaded the armful onto the other seat of her scooter, sipped her cream and started driving downhill, praying between munches to make it on time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh. So you've finally made it!\u201d a cranky voice greeted her when she rushed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm\u2026\u201d A quick glance at her phone told Penny she was twenty seconds early. But she knew there was no point arguing with her boss when she was in this mood. She bent forward, hands on her thighs, trying to catch her breath. \u201cYes, Ms. Polluck\u2026 What's wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't you see, girl? My scooter's broken.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny looked the behemoth all over but she could not see anything wrong. \u201cWhere?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you bloody blind? My bellyrest's all but collapsed! Why am I even paying you if you're so useless, girl!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh.\u201d Ms. Polluck's incredible gut did appear to be sloping a little to one side but it was hard to tell what was wrong \u2013 the bottom shelf designed to prop it up was buried deep in an avalanche of flab. As she tried to come up with an idea what next, Penny's thoughts were rudely interrupted. Her stomach growled, demanding sustenance after so much exercise and stress. That settled her priorities. \u201cUmm, how about I drop to the kitchen for some snacks and then we'll order an upgrade for you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe behemoth blinked. It was obvious she was working up to another outburst but the prospect of more food had taken an edge off it. \u201cWell, fine,\u201d she grumbled for the sake of it. \u201cBut hurry up, girl, I'm starving here.\u201d<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><br>\r\n***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end the two spent all morning picking up a new, personalised SSS cart with all the bells and whistles Watanagashi could provide, perfect for getting the Headmistress around the school grounds in speed and style. Then Penny dashed down to the cafeteria (well, drove down in her own decidedly downgrade scooter) for her boss' first lunch while the said boss fiddled with last details.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour meal is here, Ms. Polluck.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, good. Give it to me and finalise the purchase,\u201d her boss turned her computer over. \u201cHere you are. Make sure to tick 'express delivery' and pay it from the special expenses account.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny paused in the middle of unloading food from the cart. \u201cUh, what account?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know which! The one Yeng keeps open for us for exactly this kind of accidents.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, uh, but I've never\u2026 I mean, I am working here only for what, five, six weeks?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh! And do you want to keep on working for me? Just take this card,\u201d a swollen hand rummaged between empty wrappers on the table until it resurfaced, \u201cand don't disturb my lunch.  The password is 'password1234'.\u201d And Ms. Polluck buried her head in a turkey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, ma'am.\u201d While she did as she was instructed, Penny again reflected on how much easier life was when you had money to burn. \u201cThere! I've finished your order, ma'am, your new scooter should be delivered some time tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, good.\u201d Temporarily sated, the landwhale smiled at her gofer. \u201cYou did well, girl. I'll make sure you get a special bonus with your paycheck. Now go tell Eri Flatterly to send me a girl with one more turkey and some desserts, and you can have the afternoon free. It's been such an exhausting morning\u2026 we'll call it a day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes ma'am!\u201d Just then Penny felt an itch on her side so she reached there to scratch her ribs. Except she couldn't, they were hidden under an inch of fat, possibly even more. \u201cHuh, maybe Shiro is right,\u201d she grumbled as she walked out of the office. Her boss was the biggest warning sign about dangers of unbridled gluttony there could be and Penny knew she was putting on weight. She was not living in denial, no way! \u201cMaybe I should start watching what I eat, just a little.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then her phone rang. \u201cHi, Gabby! Lunch? Sure! Right now? I'd be happy to!\u201d And Penny waddled out, all restraint forgotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, I loooove turkey day,\u201d confided Gabby as they walked to the serving counters. \u201cThere's no reason why we should eat turkey only on holidays, huh?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExactly.\u201d Penny felt she was salivating as she looked over the heaps of food. There was turkey salad (not exactly a diet food), turkey subs and sandwiches, turkey tortilla wraps and obviously plenty of turkeys with stuffing and mashed potatoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGabby's voice tore her out of her reverie: \u201cHey, Penny, how d'you feel about sharing a turkey?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA whole one?\u201d It sounded like a lot, on the other hand\u2026 \u201cMy boss already ate two, can you imagine? Well, not yet but she'll have eaten the second one soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGabriella chuckled at the thought. \u201cHeh, well, we can hold back. Half a turkey's enough, no?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight! And maybe some tortillas\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd a cake! Every lunch needs a dessert!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExactly.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After sating it with an early pre-breakfast snack she decided to use this break in her routine for a bath. It was enjoyable but the alarm cut it too short. And while she was grabbing her towel, she noticed her reflection in the mirror. \u201cOh? Is that me?\u201d In the shadows her bottom looked so big!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe image set Penny's mind ablaze. She couldn't shake it off as she wiped herself dry. There was no way she could properly see her body in the relatively small bathroom mirror so she went to the closet for a better look\u2026 and gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly cow!\u201d the girl looking back from the full-length mirror looked like her twin, sure, no doubt about it. But it was a well-fed twin, with fuller chest, wider hips and the hint of a tiny belly. It must have been at least 30 new pounds. With the way they spread evenly all over her body, from plumper cheeks to fuller thighs and upper arms, the real damage may have been even worse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Penny Simon did not want to know, her scale was the only appliance in her cabin which she studiously avoided. Probbing the soft flesh, she promised:<i> I'll diet and lose this flab again\u2026 even if it doesn't look so bad yet. It's not like I was the size of Gabby.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shifted her weight uneasily, noting how it made various parts of her body jiggle. She wouldn't mind getting bigger up top but when she made a pirouette the mirror revealed her behind jiggling as well, for several seconds after she stopped moving. <i>Oh, well. I'll just wear something looser until I lose weight and nobody will notice a thing. If I can afford it.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last bit reminded her of another unpleasantness she had to deal with it. Inwardly cursing her boss, she plopped down on the sofa and opened her Y-Pad to have a look at her account. \u201cBloody-!\u201d she swallowed the rest with a wary glance at the not-quite-hidden camera in the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny had every right to feel angry. The bonus which the Headmistress had promised for arranging her new ride still failed to materialise. <i>And probably never would, that selfish hog Polluck must have forgotten all about it as soon as she started stuffing her face again,</i> Penny thought acidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened the tab she'd saved yesterday, the one at Boutique Fabrice for a business suit she'd fallen in love as soon as she'd seen it. It was lavender with details in dark mauve, sexy and yet professional, and now that she checked, it was available in her new size! A pity about the price, she could barely afford it on her current Buttercombe income. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Penny stared at the Order button, she wasn't sure whether to cry or swear. It was all the fault of that fat hog! Except\u2026 her finger moved almost on its own and clicked. After all, she still had the card to the special expenses account. She could correct Ms. Polluck's oversight and the boss wouldn't be any the wiser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen a confirmation screen popped up, she paused. <i>This is the same shit that got you fired last time, girl. Are you that stupid?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hit enter and a while later the app informed her that the money transfer was executed. <i>I may be stupid but I refuse to be forever poor. Besides, I doubt these accounts are ever checked, </i>she reasoned. <i>Ms. Polluck's free to do whatever she wants with it\u2026 and I can take advantage of that. And look at the leftover balance, it's huge! Nobody will miss these money, it's just small change.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rush of adrenaline made her hungry again. Penny took out leftover lasagna from the fridge and ravenously attacked them with a spoon. <i>Revenge is a dish best eaten cold, after all.</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But she'd never had a particularly strong willpower and two months in Buttercombe had further eroded it. No wonder that she used the special expenses account again a couple days later while browsing her favorite fashion pages when she found another outfit to her liking; and then for some impressive-looking flats the next day (high heels were getting so uncomfortable lately!) and\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she was just looking at a nice silver necklace with rubies when the door opened and her boss drove in. The XLR-8x was a beautiful piece of art. A sleek tricycle, all streamlined chrome in front, a wide upholstered belly rest jutting up in the middle to accommodate the Headmistress' dominant body part. Its wheels were small but wide to better distribute its weight on the floor \u2013 Penny had seen this quote at least a dozen times as she'd pored over the specs a month ago. A plush purple settee occupied all the space available on top, with a large chrome hump behind it housing the engine and essential engineering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn short it looked awesome but its enormous occupant looked fearsome right now. \u201cWhere's my first lunch, girl?!\u201d she scowled. \u201cI've been starving here!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecently Ms. Polluck stopped coming to cafeteria altogether, sending her assistant to lug it all up instead. In fact she barely left her office at all these days, except for various banquets with Academy partners and sponsors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt meant more work for Penny and more insults to swallow. Filled with rightful anger (and several muffins) she made another transfer before shutting down her computer. \u201cYes, ma'am. I'm going now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome more days later Penny had already served the dragoness her midday sacrifice and now she was seated with her friends at a table full of empty plates. As she leaned back to give her stomach more room to digest, a cold sensation on her neck reminded her of her newest acquisition. \u201cGabby, look! See this necklace?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOooh, shiny! Pretty! And looks expensive. Are those rubies genuine? You sure you can afford it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh, well, it's a bonus for helping Ms. Polluck pick her new scooter.\u201d Which it was, more or less, Penny argued with her conscience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow! I wish my boss was so considerate. All day long I take care of students whining about indigestion while she sits on her fat butt stuffing her face,\u201d the only one still eating, Shiro paused in her diatribe to take a bite of her blackberry pie, \u201cand what do I get out of it? Nothing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe've picked a wrong profession,\u201d sighed Gabby. \u201cSecretaries have it so easy. Just suck up to your boss and you're set for life. Oh, well, some more pies, girls?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot for me, thanks.\u201d The still slim nurse looked ready to burst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny licked her lips. Her new skirt didn't pinch or choke, it was stretchy, nicely hugging her tummy and letting it expand. \u201cI could eat one more\u2026 or not,\u201d she corrected herself when her phone rang. \u201cYes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss Simon? To my office. Now!\u201d It was the Vice-Principal's voice and she did not sound happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf looks could kill, Fukuda Hinamizawa would have murdered Penny as soon as she showed up. Instead she waited in icy silence until the the poor girl collapsed into the chair, red in face from all the running on full stomach. \u201cDo you know what an embezzlement is? You deserve a nice, long vacation for your efforts, Ms. Simon. All expenses paid. All expenses paid by the taxpayers,\u201d she smiled grimly at her own joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny's worst fears were fulfilled. She scrambled around for an excuse. \u201cBut\u2026 but\u2026 I was just taking what I was entitled to! Ms. Polluck's promised me a big bonus and never delivered! So I thought\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? Stay where you are, Miss Simon.\u201d Doctor Hinamizawa donned a headset and turned to her computer. Her fingers flew across the keyboard, in a moment she found what she was looking for. Penny, peeking over her shoulder, could see a smudged view of Ms. Polluck's office. So the Vice-Principal had it bugged?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe formidable Japanese took her time verifying the claim. She watched several more recorded videos before turning back.  \u201cThis is unexpected,\u201d she admitted grudgingly. \u201cIt appears your claim indeed holds up to scrutiny, Ms. Simon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, of course! I'd never lie to you, Dr. Hinamizawa!\u201d Unless she had to. Penny took off her glasses \u2013 she knew it made her look young and vulnerable. \u201cBesides, I <i>needed</i> those money. None of my clothes fit me anymore!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed? What shall I do with you now?\u201d The look Fukuda gave her was still stern but a lot of the ice melted as it slid over the bulge in Penny's lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHope swelled in her chest \u2013 or was it the burritos she'd had for lunch? \u201cPlease, don't kick me out, I'll be good. I'll- I'll make it up any way you want, I'll do anything!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dTruly anything? Well, in that case I believe we can write off your expenses, past and future, as school representation.\u201d <i>And future?! </i>Penny felt a huge boulder fall off her chest. \u201cHowever, that does not solve the issue of your own future at our establishment. Namely, your job description.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou see, you are here to assist Ms. Polluck in every way. She is a symbol, a leader who should not be bothered with the minutiae of running a school. Moreover, our partners and sponsors have certain expectations from a living embodiment of the Academy spirit. However, her ascent to greatness has recently been, umm, slowed. Therefore we would like you to help her along.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Do you mean\u2026 Are you speaking about her size?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFukuda wasn't finished yet, though. \u201cAnd given your, uh, present financial situation we can offer you the best kind of incentive. You will be paid $1000 for every pound our esteemed Headmistress gains. Are you in?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrivately Penny thought it to be a ploy by Dr. Hinamizawa to completely eliminate Polluck from the running of the Academy but whatever. That selfish hog definitely deserved it, she shouldn't have treated Penny like garbage. Besides, beggars can't be choosers. \u201cYes, I am.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood. You show some promise, young lady, it would be a pity if you wasted it. I hope I will be seeing more of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Penny shook the offered hand, she was frantically thinking about her chances. Should she blindly trust Fukuda and go along with her far-fetched plan? Or should she check some alternatives first?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Ethical aspects aside, she knew from personal experience that when managers quarrelled, it was usually their underlings who suffered the consequences. And she wouldn't want to lose such a cushy job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she sat down in her office with a mug of hot chocolate and some donuts to help her think, and considered her other options. The obvious one was to tell the boss. Ms. Polluck would definitely be interested to hear that her supposed second-in-command was trying to sabotage her diet (even further). However\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny's thoughts were rudely interrupted by the said boss' summons. \u201cGirl! Where's my second lunch?! Run to the cafeteria, stat!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe poor secretary couldn't run even if she wanted. She rose with a grunt, her full stomach weighing her down. <i>God, how many donuts have I eaten?</i> A quick glance at her plate told her the answer.<i> All of them.</i> She stepped inside the main office. \u201cYes, ma'am! Right away. I'll hurry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou'd better!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis latest encounter reminded Penny that Ms. Polluck's gratitude was definitely lacking. But she needed someone powerful if she were to stand up against the de facto ruler of Buttercombe. Actually even the Hog Headmistress may not be good enough... While she was thinking, her eyes slid over the chrome on Ms. Polluck's new scooter, until they stopped on the logo, prominently positioned in front. Of course, that was it! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat young Yeng heir, what was his name? Tetsuo? No, Tetsuko? <i>He gave me his calling card, where'd I put it?</i> Penny rushed back to her desk. <i>Ah, here it is. Should I trust Ms. Polluck after all that or turn to Tetsuko?</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Penny was very busy that afternoon, ferrying a cart after cart loaded with delicacies from school cafeteria to the Headmistress. She wanted to make Dr. Hinamizawa believe she was going along with her plan. She was certain her movements would be followed and wanted to make the impression of a worker bee diligently fulfilling her task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she did so, she was frantically thinking how she could contact Mr. Tetsuko Yeng without alerting the formidable Vice-Principal. That is, she came up with a way in the first five minutes but she spent the rest of her afternoon trying to think of something that wouldn't require her to go outside, especially now that it was cold and drizzling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut nothing else came to her mind that would be fast enough, so Penny went on a hike around her cabin \u2013 her very first since moving in. She knew it would look suspicious but making<i> this</i> phone call within the reach of school cameras would be plain stupid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she waded through the autumn leaves, their pristine state made it obvious she wasn't alone in ignoring the outdoors. Actually, she did not even know her neighbors, apart from Polluck. She'd never seen anybody outside, unless they zipped past in their scooters. Well, at least nobody would see her on the phone - her private one which she fished from the bottom of a drawer. It laid there for over two months, buried under a growing heap of clothes that shrunk in the wash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe picked a nice secluded spot away from the roads, leaned on a tree to catch her breath and waited before dialling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTetsuko Yeng speaking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a deep breath and plunged in. \u201cHello, Mr. Yeng. I am Penny Simon, the secretary from Buttercombe Academy. We spoke earlier this year and you said I should call\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis tone changed from disinterested to wary. \u201cYes? Did something important happen?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, yeah, something you should know about, I feel. You see, the Vice-Principal, doctor-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, I know,\u201d he interrupted her again. \u201cNo names, please. No specifics either.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, she had a really weird request regarding the Headmistress. I thought it would be best to run it by you first\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, really, did she? In that case we should meet in person, this seems like a too sensitive issue to deal by phone. Wait a second,\u201d Penny heard tapping on the keys. \u201cCan you come to, uh, that small town nearby, Wellington? This Saturday?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood. And do you know the restaurant, uh, the Belt Buster Buffet? No? Well, it is in the only mall in that town. You know which?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood. Be there at 2 p.m. and sit down next to me 'by accident.'\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBye.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny felt as if her entire stomach was trying to climb up through her mouth. She gulped down the bile and rushed back to her cabin to calm her nerves with something sweet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***<br>\r\n</div><br>\r\nHaving made the first step, now Penny needed a good pretense to go to Wellington on Saturday. The first time she went there for her new glasses so\u2026 maybe she could claim she was going shopping for contact lenses? Or perhaps<i> buy</i> new contacts? The more she thought about it, the more she liked it. Her new glasses made her look professional but she also felt they added half a decade to her age. Perhaps contacts would rectify that. And since they would be free, why wait any longer?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving settled on the reason for her visit, she had to find the means. She knew Shiro would gladly drive her again but that would mean she \u2013 and Gabby \u2013 would insist on tagging along. And Penny needed privacy for her meeting with Mr. Yeng. In the end she wrote an e-mail to Marcia Flannagan asking if she could borrow an Academy car.<br>\r\n<b><br>\r\nYou can take the Polluck's car, it's not like she is driving anywhere farther than the cafeteria,</b> Marcia replied promptly. <b>At least someone will clean out the cobwebs. Come to my office, sign the papers and I'll give you the key. </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny chuckled at that, checked that her boss was still sound asleep after her last meal and visited the Housing and Services Department. Having signed the liability forms, she got a shining new key from Marcia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, come Saturday morning, Penny enjoyed a leisurely drive in the comfort of a Mercedes limo as she made her way to the Belt Buster Buffet in Wellington. Contacts first, she made sure to reserve an appointment at the optician, but then the buffet. Just thinking about it made her tummy growl in anticipation.</span></div></div>",

It felt like someone transported her to New York or Atlanta, was this establishment really in a podunk mountain town? There were so many theme sections around. Driven by her nerves, Penny stopped for a plate from each: Italian, French, Chinese, Indian, Thai, Mexican, Japanese\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly when there was absolutely no free space left on her tray, did she park it down in a corner at one of the last empty tables; empty apart from a sleek Oriental guy politely watching her approach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello, I am\u2026\u201d She got no further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello. Bon appetit.\u201d And Tetsuko Yeng went back to his laptop, typing busily along. His plate held several dainty little sushi pieces and nothing else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny shrugged. If he wanted to play a stranger, that was fine with her. She pulled her tray closer and dug in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was really good. In fact it tasted just as good as Buttercombe cuisine did, possibly for the same reasons too. But she didn't think about the whys and hows, filling her mouth with one exquisite morsel after another, losing herself in the pleasure of eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny ignored the whole world, focusing on moving as much food from the plates to her stomach as fast as possible. Only when most her plates were empty,  was she brought out of her reverie by an unpleasant pressure. Her full, taut tummy was pressing into the new stylish belt she had bought recently (courtesy of the Buttercombe Academy, of course). It would be unfortunate if The Belt Buster Buffet name were to be taken literally. She slid it below the stuffed orb, sighing with relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTetsuko watched her with unreadable expression. \u201cSo, what prompted you to request our randezvous, Ms. Simon? What did Dr. Hinamizawa do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, in a nutshell, she asked me to, uh, well, fatten up the Headmistress?\u201d She kept warily watching the prim Japanese manager as she explained the situation to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see\u2026\u201d he nodded, slowly and deliberately, when she finished her tale. \u201cYou did well to turn to me, Ms. Simon. I believe we can work with this- this 'plan' and turn it to our advantage. Ours <i>and</i> yours, Ms. Simon. For the moment please go along with Fukuda's plan and if you play it right, you can be the one who ends in charge, de facto if not de iure. Does that appeal to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Penny nodded, he went on: \u201cGood. We shall keep in touch- actually, no, we can do something better. I can provide you with, uh, experimental bulking powder if you are willing to go that far?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure.\u201d She had nothing to lose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFrom what I recall, it is usually served in milkshakes with flavouring \u2013 chocolate, mint\u2026 But I believe I can leave finding the best delivery method up to you. I'll send you the details tomorrow by e-mail.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks. Is that all? I'm still feeling a little peckish and that cheesecake over there looks so tempting.\u201d Penny rose, careful not to squish her full tummy against the table. Then she recalled their first conversation. \u201cAren't you going to tell me to watch my weight again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can see you can take care of yourself, Ms. Simon. I wouldn't want to get between you and your\u2026\u201d was he going to say cake? \u201cGoals. Goodbye.\u201d He picked up his laptop and left, leaving one piece of uneaten sushi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGoodbye.\u201d A wave of relief washed over Penny. As she walked to the desserts section, she felt her nerve-induced hunger return. And there were so many enticing smells wafting towards her\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe licked her lips and sped up, her tummy wobbling in anticipation of the treat.</span></div></div>",

She could see what more or less amounted to the entire campus. A few buildings escaped her eye, namely the dormitories, but the view could hardly be called spoiled. Natural light filled the vast, apartment-sized office, reflecting off of the sheen from the newly installed hardwood floors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind her, artwork hung from the walls of her native Japan. Not exactly priceless, but certainly expensive enough to impress. The recent addition of a set of wooden masks had arrived not long ago, and stared off into the view with her. The decor, she liked to think, was a nice mixture of Eastern essentialism and Western comfort. A very minimalist approach to decorating was important in playing the part of a humble, overworked Vice Principal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe picture that the two of them painted\u2014her and Shannon\u2014helped complete the image. Ms. Polluck, headmistress and decadent to the extreme, where Dr. Hinamizawa was rather svelte and modest. Shannon was loud, satisfied by the material. Fukuda was quiet and approached problems with a more subtle approach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost importantly, Shannon was fat. And Fukuda was not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe headmistress of the Academy was a greedy piglet, suckling on the teat of the Yeng corporation til she'd burst. The partnership between the two of their organizations, at this point, existed largely as a formality. Everyone, she'd like to think, knew who really ran things around campus. While Headmistress Polluck was stuffing her face with the finest foods that money could buy, shirking her responsibilities to nap at her desk, or busying herself with what little public relations work she bothered herself with these days, Dr. Fukuda Hinamizawa was busy running everything else. On the administrative side of things, she'd address any issues of student and staff, negotiate prices for things like textbooks, classroom amenities (whatever Yeng couldn't provide for the school itself without raising too many eyebrows.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd on the <i>business</i> side of things...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at them all.\" Dr. Hinamizawa watched a gaggle of particularly overweight girls plod slowly along the sidwalks of her courtyard. The three of them were so broad in their backsides that they had to walk in a V, lest their pillowy pillars of legs or fleshy thigh meat collide and bump them into the grass. \"They're coming along so nicely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could recognize them from here. Abby Ackers, Bianca Boulevardez, and Callie Comacho. Sophomores, all of the same graduating class. Part of Group X3-94\u2014experimental group B, given hormones that stimulate growth in the rear, as well as appetite. Placed on SSS upon enrollment, given a steady diet laced with aforementioned chemicals. All three were up nearly a hundred pounds since their enrollment, with their natural fat distributions overridden to coincide with that of the compound they'd been given. Her supervisors would be pleased with the results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeng was happy to provide Buttercombe Academy with funding. It was happy to shill out money for equipment, food, furniture, anything that fat hog in the office across the hall could dream up in her greediest wet dreams. But it had assets to protect. And after a twenty year career in protecting those assets in Daven's Port, Dr. Hinamizawa had more than proved she was the woman for the job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since she'd taken over administrative duties, the school had never run more quietly. Shannon was the triply-chinned face of the school, but Dr. Hinamizawa had quickly become its heart and soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a sip of her wine. Viscous red liquid sloshed lazily in the glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was good to be in charge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dr. Hinamizawa?\" her assistant's voice pierced her silence from the intercom, \"Call for you on line one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" Fukuda said with a practiced smile in her heavy accent, \"Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho's on the phone?</span></div></div>",

I have a nice presentation ready, some snacks\u2026 You know I wanted to practice my spiel with you before going to the powers that be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, right. Been so busy it slipped my mind, sorry.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo can you find the time for it? Are you coming?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCertainly, I wouldn't want to miss it. I am on my way. See you.\u201d Dr. Schwartz had her office on the same floor so it took Fukuda only a couple minutes to get there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello again, have a seat, have a bite,\u201d there was a spread of snacks and sweets next to the reinforced armchair for the doctor's guests/patients.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFukuda sat down, feeling a little lost in the double-wide chair, and sighed. \u201cOh, Helen, how many times did I tell you I am not one of your charges? You know these tricks don\u2019t work on me, don\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, sorry, force of habit, you know. You don\u2019t have to eat anything, just leave it here for my next visitor.\u201d Helen gave her an unrepentant grin, knowing that lately even the formidable Fukuda Hinamizawa started having a bite here and there. \u201cAnyway, to my presentation. Errm, as you know we finally received results from the first weigh-in of our new school year.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pressed a button and the large screen on the side lit up. \u201cFirst of all, the first-years. And new arrivals in general. The trend continues with newly enrolled students being slightly ahead of the curve, weighing some 15 pounds more than the average teenager of their age. This trend is especially pronounced among daughters of our alumni, with 41 excess pounds per girl, and the paying students, weighing in at 18 plus. Merit students, on the other hand, arrive with their weight 7 pounds below the norm. It is therefore recommended to increase the allocation of funds for \u2018merit\u2019 or scholarship students for the next school year to ensure a representative sample group.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFukuda chuckled. \u201cOh, just admit it, Helen, you want more pawns to play with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not admitting anything,\u201d the portly doctor shrugged, \u201cand my argument is perfectly legitimate.  We do need a representative sample with enough girls to take all the new compounds as well as to make up a sufficiently large control group each year. So\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let the sentence linger before going on, as another graph appeared, \u201cto our returning students. It appears even our run-of-the-mill products have improved their long-term lingering effects as even in the control group, only 16 percent lost some weight over the summer, 39 maintained their weight and full 44 percent gained, an improvement of 8 percent compared to last year.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d normally Fukuda would be eagerly probing new statistics but today it felt just like another boring day in the office. How to enliven this? \u201cUh, can you show any specific examples?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, sure. Wait a second,\u201d Helen peered into the files before displaying before-and-after shots of a student. \u201cThis is Kayla Williamson, a sophomore, gaining 16 pounds over the summer completely unassisted \u2013 apart from off-the-shelf Yeng products she keeps eating \u2013 on top of 47 pounds she put on in her freshman year. A true success story.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d this drew Fukuda's interest. \u201cYou swear you did not have a hand in it, by any chance?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNein! I don\u2019t have time to personally feed every girl at our school! Like I said, it was completely unassisted. Caused purely by environment and peer pressure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood. Uh, could you send the data to my private account? I mean, the raw data. I prefer to do my own\u2026 analysing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCertainly.\u201d Dr. Schwartz made a few clicks and hit enter. \u201cAnd now to the compound testers. The formula Y-39Z, designed to increase cravings and assertiveness, did especially well; the group gained an average of 19 pounds. Your favorite Camela Mencia excelled, putting on full 28 pounds.\u201d And without prompting she put the Latina lardball on screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh\u2026 not bad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plump doctor paused at that bland reaction and gave her a searching look. \u201cIs anything wrong, mein liebchen?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFukuda noticed her host slipping into her shrink mode. She bristled, pushing her glasses up her nose. \u201cCertainly not! Just\u2026 tired, that's all. I have too much on my plate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see\u2026\u201d Dr. Schwartz glanced at the open packet of cupcakes, now half empty. \u201cIs that why you left Daven's Port, dear? Left the Yeng management to come here? Sorry for prying but we have never covered this so if you don\u2019t mind me asking, why did you give it all up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me? What do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou had a whole city, the whole world as your playground, why give it up and limit yourself to a single school?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFukuda hesitated. Maybe Helen did have a right to ask. After all, they had been working together for nearly two decades\u2026 Except they hadn't, not really. They had worked alongside, usually not at cross purposes, but seldom together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould Fukuda confide in her anyway?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

While oversized, it was quite comfortable. She slouched a bit, her soft stomach folding beneath her purple blazer. Fukuda rarely ever let her employees\u2014Yeng appointed or otherwise\u2014see such a bend in her normally rigid demeanor. For whatever reason, Fukuda couldn't say much as to <i>why</i>, she suddenly felt the need to unburden herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever insidious (and frankly, <i>scary</i>) Dr. Schwartz could be... she was still a therapist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\" the round woman waddled to her desk and took her seat, \"Go on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I was offered my position here, to be the Vice Headmistress, and all that entailed...\" the phrase had become shorthand for affiliated characters so as to avoid openly discussing Yeng-related matters. Even in private conversation, the habit still lingered. \"I saw it as a reward for my hard work. Perseverance. And it was, please do not misconstrue\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would never.\" Helen said with a little smile, \"Please, continue. Do not edit yourself <i>sch\u00e4tzchen</i>, feel free to be honest with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonest with Dr. Schwartz. The thought was laughable. Seeing what she had done to some of their most prized assets, knowing her skillset, made it almost impossible to think about being so trusting. Her skills in manipulation and double-think were unparalleled; it's the precise reason why she'd been stationed at Buttercombe Academy as the guidance counselor. The less that their charges would fret about the changes that they were being subjected to, the better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What we are doing here is very important, you no doubt agree.\" Dr. Hinamizawa turned to her colleague, temporarily her therapist, with an open palm, \"It's just... I have been stationed here for ten years now. Far longer than I was ever the head of the R&amp;D Department in Daven's Port.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you are bored then, ja?\" Helen blinked, \"Ach, to say it as if it were some big mystery.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bored, perhaps.\" Fukuda searched the ether for a more fitting description, \"You are not a native English speaker, so you must understand the difficulty of when you want to <i>say</i> a word, but\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it does not sound right in English.\" Helen chuckled, her double chin bobbing, \"I am quite familiar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Man-neri</i>.\" Fukuda answered with a rare smile, \"I am... caught.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ach\u2014you are in a rut, <i>mein liebchen</i>.\" Helen said with a confident click of her pen, \"You are not bored, simply dissatisfied. Day in, day out, you feel as if you do not experience anything new.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is much closer to what I meant to say.\" Fukuda said with a small sigh<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is good news, and a simple solution.\" Dr. Schwartz said, clapping her chubby hands together. Her wide arm wings wobbled with the motion, and her round cheeks bunched into a pleased smile, \"All you must do is to find a way to break your routine.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry?\" Dr. Hinamizawa looked up at the doctor, right into her eyes, \"I'm afraid that you do not understand. I am, effectively, the headmistress. I do not have time to\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dr. Hinamizawa, you are not listening to me.\" Helen said more sternly, her big hypnotic eyes widening, \"<i>I said, in order to break out of your rut, you must first find a way to break through your routine.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd somehow, that seemed to sink in a little better. Dr. Hinamizawa sunk back into her chair, processing the diagnosis of one of her longtime colleagues. After all, she was a doctor. This was her field of study. She had come to her in the first place, and, if anyone would know how to get her feeling back into sorts, it would be Dr. Schwartz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see your point.\" Dr. Hinamizawa said with a resigned huff, \"But how do you suggest that I do such a thing? I have almost no free time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense, you will only have time if you make time.\" Dr. Schwartz said, her chipper tone of voice returning, \"Might I suggest...</span></div></div>",

She was precisely on time, perhaps even a little early if the microwave timer was to be believed; a trait that Dr. Hinamizawa had always appreciated in her coworkers and personal company. Tonight, they would overlap, as Dr. Schwartz... Helen... attempted to help her break through the rut that she had driven herself into. If she was going to learn how to cook, it might as well be on her time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dr. Schwartz was a bit more experience in these matters. Like Fukuda she knew far too much about what went into the food to trust anything served at Buttercombe or any Yeng Facility, but unlike Fukuda she could not afford to eat out as often and as extravagantly as Fukuda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Today she arrived with some garlic, some sausage, a few pieces of flank steak, and an onion, and she hoped Fukuda would have anything else she needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIs something wrong with it?\u201d Fukuda simply asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s one of Evie\u2019s.\u201d The plump little doctor opened up the bottle and took a sniff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAddictive?\u201d Fukuda asked with trepidation, not having really expected an answer to that question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Helen shrugged. \u201cA bit. But more importantly, fake. It\u2019s not fermented, it\u2019s adulterated.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDoes that matter?\u201d Fukuda said, curious what Helen was getting at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWell of course it matters. It tastes different. Stay here, I\u2019ll be back with the real thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Fukuda was uncertain what to do while she waited, looking at the steak awaiting marination. She reached for the bottle, and prepared to just do it herself. After all, what difference did it make? When Helen came back in proudly holding a large bottle wrapped in simple white paper, with Kanji markings on it. Fukada inspected it carefully. Kishibori Soyu, it was a kind of soy sauce fermented with toasted wheat. The level of craftsmanship in the bottle alone convinced Fukuda this was soy sauce made as it had been in Japan for centuries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhere did you find this?\u201d Fukuda marveled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cShopping online.\u201d Helen smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI didn\u2019t realize you had such an appreciation of Japanese Cuisine.\u201d Fukuda said appreciatively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d Helen said bluntly. Fukuda turned away from her, and Helen realized that once again German directness had gotten her in trouble with Japanese subtlety. \u201cI mean, I would like to have such an appreciation\u201d she amended. \u201cBut I have rarely had a chance to try authentic Japanese food. I just sometimes use the sauce when I want something different.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThen why something sourced carefully?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBecause anything worth doing is worth enjoying.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou cannot find joy at Buttercombe because you draw most of your happiness from the pride you take in ignoring or suppressing your needs. You\u2019ve grown tired of that, but you\u2019re still...blocked up. Unable to open yourself to new joys.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI see. There may be some truth there but...how can one draw happiness from suppressing their needs? That seems like a very rare problem.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh, it\u2019s very common. We have a term for it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAnd what is that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThe technical term is anal retentive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Fukuda sat in her chair, hands gripping the rests, her back straight as a rod. Helen and food in the same room set her on edge. Helen either didn\u2019t notice, or chose not to acknowledge her fear as she sat cutting up the sausage into bite sized pieces, then the apple, then the cheese, and finally the fresh black rye bread. She stuck the fork through a single piece of sausage, and held it in front of Fukuda\u2019s mouth, like playing airplane with a toddler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The toddler was fussy. Fukuda pulled her head back. \u201cThis is one of your plots. You\u2019re trying to make me fat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Helen chuckled. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not. If I was, you wouldn\u2019t know it.\" Helen could see her dark humor didn't put her boss at ease, so she quickly shifted to a different tact. \"I\u2019m your friend, and your therapist. This is not an exercise in eating more, it is an exercise in mindfulness. A joie de vivre doesn\u2019t make one fat, and a philistine relationship with food doesn\u2019t make one skinny...otherwise our customers would be.\u201d Helen joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Fukuda closed her eyes, tightly, and bit the bullet. Or sausage, as it were. She chewed it hard and quickly. This was how Fukuda took most of her meals. She ate as quickly as etiquette would allow, so she could finish her meal and move on to more important things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cGood.\u201d Helen encouraged \u201cChew slower. How does it taste.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt tastes fine, I suppose.\u201d Fukuda said, sounding distracted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNo, no.\u201d Helen shook her head. \u201cHow does it taste. What does it taste like, describe it for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Fukuda swallowed the last of it. \u201cIt tastes like sausage.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDescribe it to me. In as much detail as possible. What tastes are there.\u201d Helen said, holding out another piece playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Fukuda gave the piece of meat a hard look before she decided to continue. \u201cFat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cGood.\u201d Helen nodded, encouraging her to keep going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cPork fat. It dribbles down my throat, in a way that\u2019s not unpleasant.\u201d She slowed her chewing to think about the question. \u201cBut there\u2019s also spices.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cCan you make them out?\u201d Helen asked. Fukuda was starting to enjoy this. It had becoming challenging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHmmm, I\u2019m not very good at spices. I don\u2019t know anything about cooking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s okay to guess. Or describe them.\u201d Helen said, guiding her along the baby steps of this challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWell...there is Pepper, I think. It has a little heat. There, there is definitely Ginger in this. I can tell because it\u2019s not used in as many western dishes, and it\u2019s a familiar taste.\u201d Her caution gave way to optimism and excitement, it was like a floodgate was opening. \u201cThe other spices are very earthy. I cannot name them but they taste...green.

I will return shortly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, Fukuda was tempted to ask the small doctor to not go. She couldn't quite explain why. She and Helen had been having... fun? Was that the appropriate word? It had been so long since she'd associated with anyone outside of the office setting, and Helen's cooking was so sublime. Yes, fun. They'd been having fun. And the thought of Helen walking out the door seemed, in a juvenile way, to threaten the existence of the small levity that she'd gleaned from Helen's visit to her cabin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully for Fukuda's momentary lapse in maturity, Helen was not in fact gone forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, far be it from me to suggest that sausage should go with anything other than a good stout ale.\" Helen said jovially as she entered Fukuda's cabin with a small corked bottle, \"But in preperation for our little <i>zusammenkommen</i>, I thought to get you a... erm... house warming present! <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">that's how you say it in English, ja?</font>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chubby woman held in one hand a fine bottle of sake. As Fukuda would later learn, it was from the snowy region of Niigata. Helen had procured it in a small brown bottle with a tag describing its make, content, and distillery in kanji. It was obviously imported and far from Helen's taste. Honestly, Fukuda couldn't remember the last time that she'd had alcohol from her home country instead of the viscous red wine that she so frequently partook in during her time in America...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You brought me a bottle of sake?\" Fukuda asked, feeling more touched than suspicious for the first time in a long time, \"Helen, that's so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thoughtful, I'm aware.\" the little blue-haired psychologist snorted, \"I thought to myself, how often does Doktor Hinamizawa invite me over to her cabin? I might as well make it a very special occasion indeed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor once, though not for a lack of trying, Fukuda was at a loss for words. For most of her career, she'd disregarded Helen's presence. Then, upon learning her great talent and skillset, she'd done her best to stay on her good side while maintaining a professional distance. To think that she'd be given such a simple gift, but one that struck her so deeply for some inelegant reason... Fukuda was honestly baffled at the thought. They weren't friends by any stretch\u2014but here, Helen was treating being invited to her home as such an event!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, doctor.\" Fukuda defaulted to her typical Japanese politeness, \"This is... very thoughtful. I will be sure to savor every drop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You obviously don't know how Germans like to drink!\" Helen wrapped an arm boistrously around Fukuda's shoulder, \"I would consider it a personal insult if we didn't reach the bottom of the bottle by the end of tonight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFukuda's face grew flush at her coworker's invasion of her personal bubble, not to mention the idea of getting hammered. Sake was strong stuff\u2014she could smell it through the cork and the bottle! No doubt if they got to the bottom of the bottle, they'd have quite the hangover to deal with in the morning...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah... it is... late, yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Friday, ja?\" Helen piqued an eyebrow provocatively, already pouring a cup for the two of them, \"Come, <i>frau doktor</i>! Let us enjoy ourselves! Do away with... what did you call it in your language?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Man-neri.</i>\" Fukuda said, holding back a smile as her shot was being poured<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. Man-neri.\" Helen did her best, but faltered on the pronounciation, \"Let us dig you out of your rut!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clicked glasses, and tilted their heads back...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the night was... spotty, to say the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been a long time since Fukuda had partaken in something so strong. She had never possessed a particularly strong tolerance in the first place, and Helen's sake had been exceptionally strong. No, it wasn't developed by Yeng as Fukuda was ask at least three times during her drunken escapades, but in fact hand-grown in Japan and yes, she <i>was</i> just a lightweight. No additives, no anything. Which, for a Fukuda without inhibitions, seemed strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's so odd for us to deal with real things, isn't it?\" she slurred, taking another shot of the half-emptied bottle, \"Doing what we do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it is.\" Helen was only buzzed, not long-gone like her fellow doctor, \"Although, they're not to blame for your low tolerance!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha.\" Fukuda stuck out her tongue, like a schoolgirl, before downing her last shot, \"Don't pretend that you are not satisfied with yourself. Seeing me in such a state.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would be lying if I said I wasn't.\" Helen smiled, \"You are kind of cute when you're drunk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFukuda smiled in an exaggerated fashion before pouring herself yet another shot. She had been responsible for at least half of the bottle being emptied, which meant that only a fourth of the bottle had been sloshing around in her belly on top of the sausage. Whether it was a testament to the alcoholic content of Helen's gift, or her inability to drink anything stronger than cheap red wine, she could not especially guess. However, in her drunken state, she concurred that this was a far better alternative to her evening meditation and going over reports.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did not always used to be so... <i>Eigo de d\u014d iimasu ka?</i>\" Fukuda tapped her chin, \"Uptight. I was not always so uptight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ach! I cannot believe it!\" Helen put a hand on her full chest in mock surprise, \"Fukuda, you devil!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's true, I was quite the devil.\" the Asian doctor smiled as she poured herself yet another (!) shot of sake. She was beginning to lose herself now. Her inihibitions had faded into the very back of her mind. She was running entirely on alcohol now, for better or worse, \"I still am, to some extent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When necessary.\" Helen added slyly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Always</i>.\" Fukuda winked provocatively, \"I will always be the sixteen year old girl in Namba flirting with old geezers for free drinks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fukuda!\" Helen exclaimed in genuine surprise, \"I would have never guessed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You would be surprised about the things you learn about me.\" Fukuda giggled dimly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a slight pause as Dr. Schwartz's honed instincts came to a head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" the small, blue haired woman steepled her fingers, \"Tell me Frau Doktor... Fukuda... what would surprise me so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Fukuda giggled drunkenly, \"What if I told you, that...\"</span></div></div>",

And this program set up through the Yeng Corporation was wonderful because it allowed her to get practice in her field while also getting paid. Her cabin was free of charge so she could save up her money, and almost everything that she would require was taken care of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut looking at the medical chart in front of her\u2014clipboard feeling heavy in her hands\u2014she could help but question the <i>ethics</i> of it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe may have only just started over the Summer, but this was the fourth student today who had come into her offices on recommendation for the SSS program. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only the first day!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAccording to her charts, Ginny Cutter had come to this Academy weighing one hundred and ten pounds\u2014a perfectly reasonable weight for a girl of her height and age. She was a young and developing woman, after all. But the girl in front of her looked to be almost twice that! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTwo hundred and\u2026 eight pounds.\u201d Shiro clicked her pretty pink pen, circling the number on her chart, \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 a little higher than what you weighed in at this time last year.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou would have thought that the young doctor-to-be had just told her she\u2019d never walk again. Poor Ginny looked down at her soft, flabby belly with the utmost disappointment. It was clear that she had been hoping for a lower number\u2014Shiro could hardly blame her. Almost doubling her weight in just two short semesters and a Summer vacation\u2026 that was unreal!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept it wasn\u2019t. The other three girls that Shiro had seen today had been more or less the same. One girl had gone the extra mile and put on an extra thirty pounds to what the red-faced little Buddha in front of her had gained. How was this real? Four girls, all at once\u2026 practically back to back! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026\u201d she squeaked, her voice was high and tinny, \u201cDoes that mean\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gulped, looking up at Shiro with big doe eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes that mean that you have to put me on SSS?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiro\u2019s thin lips tugged to one side. This one didn\u2019t seem too pleased with the prospect, unlike some others that came to mind. Honestly, Shiro wasn\u2019t too big of a fan of the SSS program in general. At least, how it was handled\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now wasn\u2019t the time for sternness\u2014what Ginny needed was comfort. A little bedside manner. And <i>that</i>, Shiro thought with some pride, was her favorite part of the job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put one of her long elegant hands on the poor girl\u2019s fluffy shoulder. Bent down just a little to accommodate for the difference in height, and smiled as warmly as she could manage to the sitting, sniffling patient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, of course not.\u201d Shiro hummed, \u201cYou\u2019re still a way\u2019s away from needing the next tier up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiro was exaggerating, of course, to make the girl feel better. Truthfully, Ginny was just a mere 10 pounds away from qualifying. But that seemed to help her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am?\u201d Ginny sniffled hopefully<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, you are. But you do need to start exercising more. And eating less.\u201d Shiro offered in as benign a way as possible, \u201cJust keep taking your medication and you\u2019ll be fine. Maybe\u2026 I don\u2019t know\u2026 do any of your friends jog?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny snorted\u2014of course they didn\u2019t jog. That\u2019s what was wrong with this place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d Ginny said a little less hopelessly, \u201cMy friends are all lazy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 then you could always go by yourself.\u201d Shiro countered, \u201cBut like I said, if you don\u2019t want to wind up on Tier 3, then just keep taking your meds and cut back a little. You\u2019ll be fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer problems momentarily alleviated, Ginny hopped down to the floor with joy. Her whole body quivered and quaked with the impact of her weight to the hard linoleum floor. Shiro refilled her prescription, one last warning, and sent the poor little plumper on her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHopefully she wouldn\u2019t come back next year another hundred pounds heavier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Sixteen and over 200 pounds\u2026</i> Shiro gulped, <i>That\u2019s nuts\u2026</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t any of her business, of course. Yeng and Buttercombe paid her to do her job, and that\u2019s what she did. She doled out the medication and operated within their prescribed limits. But something about all these girls, gaining upwards of a hundred pounds in a year\u2026 it didn\u2019t seem right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe she should talk to somebody about this?</span></div></div>",

Obviously she didn't have people coming in to her office all the time but she still had to be ready for emergencies, and she had learnt that lunch was one of those times where the staff and students were too busy eating to have any time to come to see the nurse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though she had free time she had made a habit of spending it alone in her office eating her self-made lunch. She did this mainly to avoid the large quantities of food the academy \"offered\" and also she hadn't really been able make friends with the other staff at the school, mainly because she felt out of place and kinda uncomfortable around the heavily obese women of the Buttercombe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around the now empty room while picking up some pens that had fallen when Ginny had hopped down. After getting up and placing down the pens she had a quick glance at one of the pill bottles on her desk. She had been giving these to the students and staff who've come to her office ever since she started working here but didn't really know what exactly they were. The only thing on the bottle was the Yeng Corporation logo and the instruction that they should be used for digestion problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly looking away from the bottle to her bag where she had her container of food. Thinking that if she wanted to get anything done today she needed to eat something.  The food she had made for herself today was a sandwich with a side of some salad. It was getting surprisingly hard to make her healthier foods with her lack of free time and Buttercombe's restriction on getting food from the outside, but she had managed this far. While getting to her bag she took a quick look at herself on the mirror that stood opposite of her desk. She looked so thin on the massive mirror that usually was hidden behind the massive students who came for checkups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore opening her bag Shire started thinking about of her coworkers and how she only saw them when they came in to the office for mandatory checkups. She didn't really know any of the teacher or the other staff that well, but some of them had seem very nice when she had the change to talk to them. She remembered how some of them had even asked her to get something to eat with them, but she had declined at the time. Maybe if she went to lunch with them she could learn more about them, then just their weight. Like did anyone here have any hobbies or talents other then getting fat. Some of them might even stick to their diets if they were friends with the nurse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiro took a look at the container of food and thought that if she went to the cafeteria for lunch instead maybe she could socialize with someone. It couldn't be that dangerous to eat the food everyone was pigging down, right? Or she could just stay in her office like she had done everyday before. </span></div></div>",

How could so many of teacher be so fat. I can't really be the only member of staff who's under 150 lbs</i>\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiro stopped thinking to herself when she looked around her. There were so many students and members of faculty headed for lunch. Each one of them larger then Shiro. Some of them were already eating something and getting food from the vending machines. It didn't surprise Shiro how these girls had put on so much weight. Once she arrived in the cafeteria she stood in shock for a second. Many of the students were packing so much food in front of them you'd think they were getting food for the whole week. But Shiro knew all that food was going to be eating in just one sitting. Then looking at the amount of food that the teacher had. Most of them had even larger amount of food then the students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiro got out of her shock and headed for the line with a tray. \"<i>Maybe some of the faculty could lose some weight if I was around them. Honestly they need more then just a nurse but with my help they might at least not gain more.

But instead of commenting on peoples weight while their eating on the first day and making enemies, I should focus on getting to know people and making friends</i>\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the immense amount of not so healthy food in front of her, Shiro wondered what could she eat without going into a food come.

I'll try some</i>\", Shiro replied kinda surprised after being snapped out of her thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>You're Shiro right?</i>\", the person continued. \"<i>You can call me Em, by the way</i>\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Shiro a second but she recognized the woman. Em, or Emily Whitestone, was one of the new teachers of Buttercombe who had been to a mandatory check up few days earlier. Emily was a 26 year old, 5'7 woman weighing around 190 pounds from a small town in Oregon who taught mathematics. She had auburn colored hair that cut off just before her shoulders. Even though she had some weight on her she was still quite attractive, mostly due to her slim and pretty face and most of her weight being around her butt and thighs. Emily appeared very cheerful and bit silly. Shiro had noticed her personality when having her check up, as Emily had been one of the few people who tried to start a proper conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I<i> didn't spook you, did I?</i>\" Asked Emily. \"<i>You looked kinda lost in thought</i>\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>No it's fine.

But don't worry about it</i>\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the lunch period Shiro and Emily spend talking about the academy. During the talk Emily had gotten seconds and thirds while Shiro was still trying to eat her first plate that was filled with food mostly because Shiro wasn't able to refuse when Emily had offered her whatever she thought was too delicious not to eat. Shiro tried to bring up health issues that the amount of food available in the school might cause while Emily was more focused on talking about the size of the school and all the benefits the teacher got. Both of them still seemed to enjoy their little chat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I think I need to leave</i>\", Shiro said after noticing how close it was to the end of lunch time. \"<i>There are still some students that haven't been to see me\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>But you still have some food on your plate</i>\" Emily replied,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I'm way too full to finish all this</i>\" Shiro said, which was very true as she had eaten probably more food then she had eaten in the previous two days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I can finish it for you then. My mom did always say you shouldn't waste any food</i>\". Emily said while she happily went to grab Shiro's plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That woman definitely fits in with the rest of the people here if she can eat so much</i>, Shiro thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Hey, if you ever want to hang out just find me, alright</i>\" Emily said to Shiro as she got up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Will do, Em</i>\" Shiro replied as she headed for her office feeling full from the meal.</span></div></div>",

Helen Schwartz was 45 years old. She lived alone with her cat. She hadn\u2019t been on a date in years. Most women would dread being in her position. But Helen greeted each day with new excitement and joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0How? Well, she kept her stress levels low. Despite her size, she kept in shape, mentally and physically with a strong Yoga routine. Her job and lack of children allowed her a great deal of self-care, bubble baths, trips to visit her parents in the Yucatan in the summer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And, oh right. Bending and breaking the entire staff and student body of Buttercombe\u2019s Academy for Growing Girls to her will, and sending them spiraling further into obesity. That kept her happy. And she was looking forward to doing that today, same as every day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She poured a pot of tea into her thermos, and headed out, letting her cat lick what it liked out of her breakfast bowl. Her trip through the halls to her office was a joyous one. Even at 250 pounds, Helen was one of the most physically capable members of the faculty. She headed to work with a spring in her step and to move circles around her more sedentary coworkers. Like Marsha Alberway, for example. Helen spied a sliver of the coach\u2019s belly hanging out of her new jersey, and smiled. Or Carrie Porter. She swore that woman looked more like her sister every day. Oh how she missed Cerys Porter\u2019s presence on campus!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And the students! Camela Mencia! How Dr. Schwartz loved conversing with her in Spanish during their meetings. And how she enjoyed how many treats out of her candy bowl Camela would have during those meetings. And how those treats padded out her behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Even the new ones! Hunter Black. Helen had such a fondness for the Black Family! All of them, but especially Hunter\u2019s sister. Her letter of recommendation helped ensure Hunter\u2019s acceptance, and she intended to do her best to mold Hunter into her own ideal of a young woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Yes, there was endless opportunities, and endless pleasures waiting for her at her desk every morning. When her close-minded, so-called \u2018superiors\u2019 weren\u2019t getting in her way. So she sat down to get to work, took a sip of tea, and checked her answering machine with a smile.</span></div></div>",

Her mother Harper had been her secretary for a while (and put on a good clean 40 pounds to even out her hourglass figure that seemed to have stuck to this day) and the oldest sister Parker had interned there for a few weeks before being... let go.

Like, not only was she the first person in her family to get into this kind of ritzy school, but it almost felt like she didn't earn it.

Of course not!\" Hunter hastily corrected herself, \"I just... I mean...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter looked so very much like her sisters when they were her age. Olive skin, dark hair, and perfectly sculpted features. The women of the Black family tended to be gorgeous, Helen had noted over the years. From Harper to that freeloading older one to Piper, even as she continued to swell up. <i>Especially</i> as she continued to swell up, Helen corrected herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow much had Piper weighed before she left, all those years ago? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel like my Mom's just putting so much pressure on me.\" Hunter continued, oblivious to Helen's inner monologue, \"Like, okay, I get it, Parker dropped out of college.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Despite the familiarity that Helen held for the younger girl, it wouldn't have been all that difficult for the good doctor to twist her into something that far better filled the holes she'd come to know since taking her assignment at the Academy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunter's mind was young and sharp, she reminded her so much of Evie\u2014her old partner in Daven's Port. The way her brown eyes cut curiously and her keen observatory skills for those around her, it made Helen wonder what Hunter might be like if she helped encourage that side of her. The poor girl would no longer be afraid; she could take command. She would even excel in a place like Buttercombe, where the girls were softer in willpower than they were in the bellies. If Helen could teach her how to manipulate and poke and prod, instruct her on how to push all the right buttons, Hunter would go so very, <i>very</i> far during her academic career. Ach, but Hunter was such a sweet girl. So quiet. It would be a shame to see that side of her give way to the cruelty that Dr. McCarthy wore on her sleeve back then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, there was always the more predictable route\u2014she <i>was</i> Piper's sister after all. There was a simple, yet not unsatisfactory pleasure to be found in helping Hunter find another way to fit in. With Helen's \"help\", she'd have Hunter molded into a real Buttercombe girl in no time. Fat and soft, the fattest and softest if Helen had her say, with not a care in the world except for her next meal. Hunter would be placed on SSS in no time, filling doorways and rolling around on a motorized scooter... She'd certainly have more friends that way, but to see her beautiful mind go to waste, Helen wasn't quite willing to abide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unpleasant truth was, despite her eagerness, Helen was of two minds. For now, Hunter would have to continue on her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHopefully, the solidification of her character led the chesty freshman back through her doors...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Schwartz's busy schedule of listening to whining students and teacher temper tantrums had three periods of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne was in the morning, around eleven 'o' clock. The other at one, for lunch. And the last was right before classes concluded at four. Helen argued that all of the teachers had a similar schedule, why shouldn't she? And while any other woman in this academy\u2014this monument to decadence and overindulgence\u2014would no doubt spent that time in service of her appetite, Helen used it as a way to reconnect and center herself. Sometimes through quiet tea times, sometimes through meditation, and others (though infrequently) she used it to connect with old friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Evie McCarthy was her old colleague back at the Yeng Research &amp; Development center back in Daven's Port. Whereas Helen had been promoted and reassigned to the Testing Area, Evie had been promoted to Head of the Department. In a few words, she was one of the great minds behind the wonderful gadgets and gizmos that helped keep their pool of test subjects in varying stages of comfort depending on their needs. In theory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd one of the main reasons that Dr. McCarthy had become so enamored with the idea of meshing her love for biochemistry and modern household appliances was... well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Increase vibration seventeen percent, rotary motions go counterclockwise.\" a thick, slow voice commanded, \"Concentrate power in the lower abdominal region. I have a stomach ache.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen had always known of Dr. McCarthy's buried desires to indulge. For years she had kept them so restrained, made it so impossible for herself to let herself enjoy her lust for decadence, that those desires manifested themselves as an outward hostility towards the obese. And it had become clear that, since her promotion, Dr. McCarthy had finally learned to forgive herself for the immortal sin of wanting to be fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a <i>large</i> woman, as evidenced by the image on Helen's desktop. Evie had the webcam in her lab mounted on the wall so that  her desk would be free for various robotics, hydraulic parts... snacks. Helen was sure that it was so Evie could ensure everyone got to see just how obscenely fat she was getting. Her mobility was a non-issue with Yeng's breakthrough in limited hovering technology. McCarthy had pioneered it for the sole purpose of never needing to walk again, and as evidenced by how low her seat hung to the ground, she intended on getting the most out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvie's stomach took the brunt of her obesity. Hanging low, dimpled with cellulite and split into three distinct tiers of tonnage, its only support was the massage heads that had been installed at her behest. Her arms sat uselessly on the upper puffs of her belly blubber which mushroomed over the armrests built into the chair. How she'd gotten a lab coat on, much less that tarp of a sweater, was anyone's guess. Perhaps Yeng had made headway in the spray-on clothing department sooner than expected? Helen would have to inquire further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Evie?\" Helen clicked her tongue, \"Are you paying attention to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm...\" Dr. McCarthy's beady brown eyes closed as her head leaned back into her neck rolls, moaning as the massage heads did their work<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't make me.\" Helen laughed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Dr. Schwartz, I'm just...\" Evie sighed heavily, \"Not in the mood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pudgy blue-haired woman rolled her eyes. Of course. She'd never get something for nothing, not with this greedy hog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you're not in the mood.\" Helen said in a low sort of voice, playing at Dr. McCarthy's fetish, \"All you want to do is eat\u2014isn't that right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All that blubber must be going between your ears. You're absolutely running out of room everywhere else. Look at you! You're so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Saaaay iiit...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're so <i>fat</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Schwartz giggled as she recognized the tell-tale signs of a micro-orgasm. Evie had become very well acquainted with her inner glutton, that was for sure. Such a great mind, buried beneath hundreds and hundreds of pounds of pampered, piggish pudge. Just like the women that she used to take such pleasure in torturing not all that long ago...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm... it sounds so different, coming from you.\" McCarthy said in a half-facetious flirtation with her old friend<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only because you miss me.\" Helen returned the favor, \"Now, Evie... how are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them almost never got to talk anymore. Every time they spoke, it was usually work related. Dr. Hinamizawa kept them both busy with their respective projects, so any personal time was usually spent with Helen in her cabin or with Evie in her lab. With how different their lives had become, and in not such a long stretch of time, it was important that they managed to keep each other updated as much as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm well.\" McCarthy answered simply, \"I'll be a lot better once I finish this project.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm working on something of a project myself.\" Dr. Schwartz thought back to young Hunter Black...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll bet my project is more fun.\" Dr. McCarthy's fat cheeks bunched up in a smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For you, I'm sure it is.\" Helen laughed, \"Incidentally...\"</span></div></div>",

As soon as Evie started feeding, she wouldn't care to talk anymore. And these days, periods of her not eating were getting shorter and shorter. \u201cAnd it was Piper who told me her little sister was looking for a good school. So I pulled some strings and little Hunter ended at Buttercombe. But now I am not sure which route to take with her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d The landwhale was so puzzled she even paused in ordering food. \u201cHow do you mean it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I'd love to see her go down the same path as Piper, to see her curves blow up, to grow a belly to support that chest of hers and a behind to balance it out\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean, Hunter could almost be Piper's twin, they're so alike\u2026 Except she's also got a brilliant mind and I don't want to lose that.

Just look at me, big and bright. Who says your Hunter can't be both? Just introduce her to all the joys that Yeng can provide and let nature take its course.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh, maybe\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd stop bothering me now, I have a third lunch to take care of. Or is it first supper? Anyway, see you later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBye.\u201d Dr. Schwartz folded up her hands on her belly in contemplation. Evie didn't help her much.

It was the first day of a new year, and unless someone seriously injured themselves, she basically had the morning off. But rather than join her fellow staff in the main dining hall for the welcome feast, the hefty nurse sequestered herself in her office, preferring the peace and quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJocelyn wiggled in her chair, finding a slightly more comfortable position as her plump sausage fingers retrieved a candy bar from her desk-top and brought it up to her lips. She had her sister send them via post; Jocelyn tried to avoid eating local, she knew that the Yeng stuff was terrifyingly addictive; after all she not only worked for Yeng but got to see its effects first hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had seen lithe freshmen slink through her door at the beginning of the year, only to struggle with the frame before even reaching their senior one. Not that she really cared all that much; if Yeng wanted to create a school full of obese students that was its call; so long as Jocelyn got paid she didn\u2019t mind. She wasn\u2019t a cruel person mind; just ambivalent to their weight-based problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing an especially large woman herself, Jocelyn had struggled with her excess girth as a child, but the marvels of modern medicine and technology that these kids had access to made being fat much less of a chore. They could take being a bit plump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was why Jocelyn was not all that keen on getting too much bigger. She knew Yeng well enough that if she got large enough, it wouldn\u2019t just put her job at risk, but it might also make her a perfect Yeng test-subject. The absolutely colossal behemoths she had to deal with, once they got big enough they were pretty much sequestered in their rooms all day, their limited mobility and extreme size putting Yeng tech to the test. Jocelyn was not a fan of ending up like that herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNevertheless, Jocelyn was a <i>big girl</i>, and <i>big girls</i> gotta eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as the second bar of chocolate passed her dark brown lips, her pager began to buzz, sending ripples across her supple swollen middle. Grunting like a sow in heat, the porcine woman pressed her chubby arm between the limited space between her flabby flank and the arm of her chair, retrieving the long-suffering pager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlipping it to the screen, she saw a message from\u2026</span></div></div>",

Jocelyn rolled her eyes before cleaning the last residue of chocolate from her fingers, and began the arduous task of rising to her feet. Being so big around the belly, it was very easy for Jocelyn to get herself weighed down into her seat, with her big sloshing belly anchoring her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes of shuffling her near four-hundred pound body on her seat, the hippo-shaped woman reached the lip of her chair and managed to roll her body upwards. Instantly she felt her girth taxing her limbs, years of obesity had taken its toll on her fattened limbs and they almost audibly groaned under the pressure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPheeeew.\u201d Jocelyn wheezed, \u201cMan I gotta drop some weight\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she may have audibly wished to lose some pounds, Jocelyn\u2019s habits were not helping her. As she waddled out of her office, the bowling ball woman rested her round rump on one of the school mobility scooters and was off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe <i>should</i> have walked, but that required effort that Jocelyn didn\u2019t posses right now. So instead she rolled in style, past the new and returning students herding their way towards the welcome meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cGod they get fatter every year\u2026\u201d</i> Jocelyn mentally took note, as she watched a pair of four hundred pound-plus seniors amble past. Good thing one was top-heavy and the other was bottom-heavy, or their collective girth would have blocked the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she reached the outer reaches of the school grounds, the way became clearer for Jocelyn\u2019s kart. As she approached the school counsellors office (now conveniently relocated onto the ground floor), she slowed her approach and parked her ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweat coated her brow as the big bowl of human pudding lifted one leg over the seat and waddled towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*knock knock*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome!\u201d A voice inside replied. Pushing the door open, with both hand and belly, Jocelyn entered the office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr Schwartz\u2019s office was an odd room; filled with all sorts of nick-nacks and souvenirs she had collected over the years; mostly from South and Central America. But there were some from her home country of Germany as well. It certainly made for an odd blend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd to aid the odd d\u00e9cor was the good doctor herself. Helen Schwartz had cropped bright blue hair, a vibrancy that didn\u2019t match the duller colors of the office at all, like the dull yellow wallpaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello herr Rose.\u201d The doctor greeted as Jocelyn made herself known.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning Helen, you wanted to see me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes yes. I have a little problem that I think you would be perfect to help me with.\u201d Dr Schwartz began to rummage around in a drawer as Jocelyn watched, before producing a vial. \u201cZis is a compound that Yeng went to great lengths to obtain. It is an incredibly strong appetite enhancer and metabolism suppressant that was tested some years ago, and eventually perfected.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs this the perfected version?\u201d Jocelyn asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d Helen replied with a broad grin. \u201cThe version put on the market was much weaker; so as you can imagine it took some time to acquire the beta sample.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJocelyn frowned, why would Yeng try to obtain something that had been outlawed before? \u201cThere is a <i>but</i> coming isn\u2019t there\u2026?\u201d She replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow astute!\u201d Helen cooed. \u201cZe original had a\u2026 copious list of side-effects. Side-effects we have tried to mitigate; we think we have it down to these\u2026\u201d Once again Helen went into her drawer, this time producing three smaller vials, each with differing labels. \u201cHere we have three different versions of the enhancer, we could not remove all the side effects at once; and we want to test them in a less clinical, more natural environment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want me to give them to some girls here.\u201d Jocelyn bluntly stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat a fantastic idea!\u201d Helen answered with a grin and a wink. \u201cSince you offered, yes I will take you up on that.\u201d Placing the vials on the desk in front of her, Helen then began to give Jocelyn her instructions. \u201cWe only have enough here for one subject each; so you will need to find three students to test them on. And I mean three, don\u2019t go giving them all to one, we need to know exactly what side effects happen with each vial. I chose you for zis, as the students seem to open up more to you; and would be less likely to hide the side-effects from you than say\u2026 me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJocelyn then leaned forward to take her three tasks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOther than that, you can do as you wish. I trust you find the perfect test subjects, and to monitor them as you see fit. Just use your judgement and request physicals as often as you think they are required. Periodically I will ask you to present your findings to me, which will be passed on to the Yeng R&amp;D, good luck herr Rose.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in her office, Jocelyn set herself to work. She had learned not to ask too many questions when it comes to Yeng, so as to exactly what side-effects she was supposed to be looking for, she didn\u2019t know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn front of her, Jocelyn had her issue Y-pad out and was scrolling through the list of students. Owing to the nature of the task, she had filtered the search to only include the thinner girls; those weighing one hundred and fifty pounds or less. If she was supposed to be putting these girls on a crash-course with appetite stimulants, going from thin to fat would look better on the results. Plus the little shrimps could do with some meat on their bones anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScanning through the list, Jocelyn\u2019s eyes rested on\u2026</span></div></div>",

She was the tallest of the three, and as such had a slightly higher weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext up was Hazel Reed, hailing from the other side of the states she was a lot closer to home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd lastly was Tsuru Tanaka, also from Japan.

She wasn\u2019t a scrounger, but free was free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she turned a corner, flicking her mane of black \u201crocker chick\u201d hair out of her eye, an announcement suddenly boomed across the intercom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWill Hazel Reed, Tsuru Tanaka and Futaba Nakamura please make your way to the nurse\u2019s office on the ground floor east of the main hall please!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u3046\u3093\u3053!\" Futaba cursed under her breath. She had just got here! How was she already in trouble!? Was there something about no pictures? Had taking those selfies at the front of the building broken some hidden rule? Whatever it was, it seemed several other girls were in for it as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe office was just a little beyond where Futaba was walking anyway, so she continued on her set path. As she passed the hall, the rocker-girl peeked inside. Everyone seemed to be having a great time, and here she was missing out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn approaching the nurses office, Futaba spied a pair of figures. One was another Japanese girl, like her, who was already dressed in her Buttercombe uniform. Her hair was straight and immaculate, and her makeup was minimal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girl was Caucasian and kinda short, wearing a generic slightly baggy t-shirt and a long skirt. She had glasses, slightly curled chestnut-brown hair and was looking around nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou got called out as well?\u201d Futaba asked as she approached. \u201cNot sure what I did this time\u2026 don\u2019t really wanna get sent back home after coming all this way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe talk of being punished seemed to set the smaller girl off and her eyes widened. \u201cAre\u2026 are we in trouble!?\u201d She stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course not.\u201d Snapped the scholarly girl. \u201cThey don\u2019t send you to the nurse if you are in trouble.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen what do you think it is?\u201d Futaba asked. But before there was an answer, the door clicked and unlocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome in come in!\u201d Jocelyn beamed, her wide figure engulfing the doorframe, \u201cDon\u2019t be shy!\u201d The wide woman waddled back to her desk, beckoning the three to follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud oof passed Jocelyn\u2019s lips as she sat back in her chair. As she gazed across at her three subjects, she saw the fear in Hazel\u2019s eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry dear, you\u2019re not in any trouble.\u201d This seemed to calm her down a little. \u201cYou just need a quick jab.\u201d And now she was panicking again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJab?\u201d Futaba queried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes\u201d Jocelyn replied, \u201cThere is a local\u2026 tick problem going around. And I wanted to give you girls an immune-system booster, as you are all transfers from out-of-state you would be most vulnerable to their bites.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis seemed to produce nods of understanding, apart from the haughty-looking one, she seemed to just glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight, well if you would all give me your left arm, I can start with the jabs.\u201d Jocelyn continued, still under the skeptical gaze of the haughty girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFutaba was first up; and since Jocelyn didn\u2019t know of any difference between the vials contents, just the label, she grabbed the first one to hand (labelled B) and decanted it into a syringe. A quick swab and one very sharp needle later, and Futaba was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext up was Tsuru who still looked doubtful. She got vial A.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd lastly (with a bit of prodding from the other two girls) Hazel was up, and got C injected into her arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow before you go\u2026\u201d Jocelyn interrupted as some of the girls turned to leave. \u201cTo make sure that you have suffered no adverse reactions to the injections, I will ask you to return to me for health checks within the next two weeks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, really?\u201d Futaba huffed, snorting so hard her long fringe flew upwards again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut as an apology, we will offer all three of you one of our limited three-person dorm rooms. It comes with a lot more space and slightly better facilities than a usual one\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWa-hoo! Look at this place!\u201d Futaba yelled as she span around her new home away from home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt certainly is roomy.\u201d Tsuru commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on! Gather round, gonna take a selfie here!\u201d The rocker-chick grinned as she beckoned the other two over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*click*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the picture Futaba noted how Hazel and Tsuru were actually smiling in the pictures. Probably the first time she had seen either of them smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoo!\u201d The punky girl noted as her eyes caught the site of the welcome basket. Running over, Futaba practically dived into it with glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you mind not acting quite so piggishly?\u201d Tsuru commented snottily as she dragged her suitcase over to one of the bedrooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh lighten up Tsuru! I didn\u2019t eat anything for dinner!\u201d Futaba yelled over her shoulder. \u201cHmmm Tsuru, bit of a long name. Can I call you Tsu?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. It\u2019s Tsuru.\u201d The studious girl snapped, shutting the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmmph, you\u2019re no fun.\u201d The hungry girl huffed, before turning to the remaining member of the group. \u201cHey Hazel, wanna have a bun? It\u2019s really good!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I think I am just going to go to bed\u2026\u201d Hazel mumbled, dragging her suitcase away as she blushed shyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFutaba huffed again. \u201cUgh, what downers, hope the rest of this place is more lively\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next morning passed without incident. All three transfer students managed to wake in time for breakfast, got dressed in their new uniforms and headed to their first class of the day. Everything had been such a blur on their first day that they hadn\u2019t had time to take much stock of their surroundings, especially with the trip to the nurse\u2019s office; they hadn\u2019t even seen much of their fellow students\u2026 until now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the trio arrived at their first English class (early as well), they had been baffled by the sheer size of the desks. They were much wider than any they had encountered before, and set with a concave center. All was made clear when the first girls arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three girls hadn\u2019t arrived early, it was everyone else who was late, and for good reason. The first girl who entered the classroom easily looked like she was clear of the three hundred pound mark, with a great wobbling gut that swung across her knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of the transfer students had time to drink the sight in when they were then greeted to a second morbidly obese student waddling her way in, her gigantic hips slightly catching on the doorframe. Then a third, a fourth, a fifth\u2026 there was not a single girl in their class below two hundred and fifty pounds! And there were quite a few that were reaching well beyond that threshold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the sight of the gigantic nurse should have prepared them for such an onslaught of blubber, they had collectively shrugged the rotund Jocelyn off as just matronly and her bulbous figure borne of a lifetime of sitting in her office chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully their teacher was of a much more slim build; a rather busty blonde woman who smiled a lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello girls! I\u2019m Ms Morrison! And I will be your English teacher this year!\u201d She positively squeaked. \u201cNow, this is my first year teaching at your wonderful school, so if you know any tips tricks or shortcuts around here, just give me a little whisper after class, k? It seems we also have some transfer students as well, so don\u2019t forget to share your tips with Hazel, Tsu\u2026Tsuro\u2026 oh no another difficult one\u2026 Footaba\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsuru scoffed; of course the teacher was still thin, she was new. Something wasn\u2019t right around here. While Futaba and Hazel didn\u2019t seem to be questioning just why the class had a 10/1 ratio on obese pupils, Tsuru was, and she was going to get to the bottom of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am telling you, something is up with this place.\u201d Tsuru hissed between bites of lasagne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo shit.\u201d Futaba replied, \u201cI deliberately asked for no mayo in my burger and they loaded t with the stuff!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsuru eye-rolled at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? I\u2019m hungry!\u201d The rocker chick replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it! Everything here is about food!\u201d Tsuru pointed out, \u201cThe portions, the size of the desks, the size of the <b>students</b>!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre\u2026 are they going to brainwash us?\u201d Hazel mumbled, \u201cbecause I saw a horror film\u2026 it had a school full of brainwashed kids and and and\u2026\u201d The brown-haired girl could barely get the words out before she panicked and started munching on a poptart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cWho let you watch a horror film\u2026\u201d</i> Futaba thought to herself. But as she picked up her soda to take a sip, there was a rumble, and her drinks surface rippled like a tremor hit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was no geological phenomenon, as a big shadow loomed over the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi!\u201d Came a friendly voice; \u201cI\u2019m Amy! We were in English together!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe transfer students remembered Amy, they certainly remembered Amy. She was the one who literally didn\u2019t stop snacking through class; granted most girls were eating throughout a lot of it, but Amy was the only one that figured out a way to keep eating even when she had to take notes using both hands. She was also one of the largest girls in their class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy was very \u201capple-shaped\u201d with a pair of colossal breasts, perkily pressed upwards by a big round ball of a stomach, itself perched upon some thunderously large thighs. Her black hair was cut into a pudding-basin fringe, while the rest flowed over her shoulders (dyed a rich purple) and ended in a straight cut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMind if I sit? Ms Morrison said you were new; I\u2019ve been here a while and thought I might help you out?\u201d Amy beamed nervously at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe would love for you to sit with us.\u201d Futaba offered, patting the empty section of the bench next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks!\u201d Amy replied as she gingerly lowered her bulk, the frame holding despite her immense bulk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo this is Hazel\u2026\u201d The punky girl introduced, \u201cThis is Tsu\u2026\u201d Futaba stated, grinning wickedly at the long-haired girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b><i>IT'S TSURU</i></b>!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m Futaba!\u201d She finished, ignoring the fuming girl on the other side of the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice to meet you\u2026 does this mean we\u2019re friends now?\u201d Amy asked, cocking her double-chinned head slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOooo! Then it\u2019s selfie time!\u201d Futaba cheered, looping an arm around Amy\u2019s plush shoulders and drawing her close, spending a few moments first fixing her hair, and then taking several snapshots. \u201cNo no no\u2026 yes! Perfect! And uploaded, let\u2019s see how many likes my new bestie can get.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell thanks for leaving us in the dust\u2026\u201d Tsuru huffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry! Amy's more my style...\u201d Futaba teased, as a gurgle cut her off, her stomach was growling like mad. \u201cUgh, Amy you know what food\u2019s good around here? I\u2019m starving here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m really hungry as well\u2026\u201d Hazel added, nodding towards her now-spotless plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs am I.\u201d Tsuru remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy smiled a big cheesy grin, \u201cGreat! Food is kinda speciality of mine!\u201d She chuckled, patting her big dome of a belly, causing ripples to spread out like the surface of a pond. The three transfer students stared at the mass of fat jiggle, just what was going on here\u2026</span></div></div>",

Complete bliss!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*knock knock*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShit!\u201d The obese woman cried out, her relaxation thoroughly interrupted. She had totally forgot that the girls who were unknowingly taking part in Dr Schwartz\u2019s little project were coming in for their checkup today!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne moment sweeties!\u201d Jocelyn called out as she flung the bag of candy unceremoniously into her draw, straightened her uniform and wiped away a chocolate smear from her lips. \u201cThere we go\u2026 the door is unlocked!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Jocelyn smiled as she watched the three subjects walk in. She had spent long enough at this strange academy to have an eye for how and where people were getting fat. She instantly spotted that tummy poking out from under Hazel\u2019s blazer, or how Futaba\u2019s pants skirt was lifting upwards, or how Tsuru was walking awkwardly to avoid getting chub-rub on her thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSooo, how are we today?\u201d The heavyweight nurse greeted with her trademark warm motherly smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright\u2026 I guess\u2026\u201d Futaba replied, her voice a little more despondent than usual, and her eyes flitting down towards the buttons around her chest, stretched quite tight over the white undershirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other two kinda nodded along. Jocelyn could hazard a guess as to what was going on, but she wanted to be sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, you are in here for your first routine health-check to make sure your medication isn\u2019t causing you any problems\u2026 are any of you suffering side effects?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHazel mumbled something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry dear, I couldn\u2019t quite catch that.\u201d Jocelyn asked politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe said we\u2019re getting fat!\u201d Futaba snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe African-American woman jumped what little she could from the outburst. \u201cRiiight, so this weight gain is not normal for any of you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been fat in my life!\u201d Tsuru snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just have to be sure,\u201d the nurse replied, jotting it down in her y-pad. \u201cIf that is the case, do you all mind getting up on the scales?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne by one, each girl got up and weighed themselves on the scales by Jocelyn\u2019s left wall, each result being read-out by the worryingly-cheerful voice. As they came though, Jocelyn wrote each result down on her pad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:verdana, sans-serif\">Futaba: 133 pounds<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsuru: 128 pounds<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHazel: 127.5 pounds</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks to the original data sheets, Jocelyn knew that each girl had put on roughly about fourteen pounds, with Hazel creeping up a little more with fifteen and a half. For just two weeks that was astonishing, it seems the stimulant had increased their appetite and neutralized their metabolism enough that they were putting on roughly a pound a day!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNevertheless, she had a fa\u00e7ade to keep up. \u201cDon\u2019t worry Tsuru, you\u2019re not fat. A hint of chubby perhaps, but nothing a bit of diet and exercise wouldn\u2019t solve.\u201d Jocelyn comforted, knowing full well that nothing in the school grounds was remotely healthy enough to help anyone lose weight here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they were sat back down in front of her, Jocelyn tried to do a little more probing. \u201cAny other side effects you might be having?\u201d She asked, \u201cDon\u2019t worry if it\u2019s a bit embarrassing, just us girls in here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe result was a resounding no; that was good, meant the chemical was doing its job right on target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if there is nothing to report, than I can let you all get back to class then! Just to make sure nothing develops though, I will ask you come and see me again. Perhaps three weeks this time?\u201d Jocelyn pulled that number out of thin air, she didn\u2019t want to say two weeks again in-case the girls thought it seemed a bit odd. \u201cDon\u2019t want you losing too much study time if you keep coming down to my neck of the woods too often.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA pound a day you say?\u201d Dr Schwartz remarked as she contemplated the results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbout that, one of them seems to be slightly above the curve.\u201d Jocelyn explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue-haired woman scratched her chin, \u201cInteresting, we will want to keep a closer eye on that one.\u201d Dr Schwartz then made a sucking motion through her teeth; \u201cBut if I am honest Frau Rose, I was expecting more. Yeng put a lot of money into obtaining this chemical, we were hoping it was something special.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJocelyn\u2019s left eyebrow rose. \u201cA pound a day in excess fat isn\u2019t exceptional?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHohoho\u2026\u201d The doctor chuckled, \u201cMy dear, if you knew what Yeng had stored in its vaults, you would have to redefine your definition of <i>exceptional.</i>\u201d The plump woman leaned back, \u201cBut I am nothing if not patient, perhaps it takes a while to take full effect. But if we don\u2019t start seeing results relative to what was spent on this sample, we might have to double their dose.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJocelyn thanked the doctor and began to leave. What was so special about this chemical that made it so pricey to get hold of? What were the kind of effects Dr Schwartz was looking for? Surely she didn't expect the girls to just blow up into humongous heifers instantly? And what kind of side effects would a creepy psycho doc like her deem unacceptable?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did she know, Jocelyn would soon be finding out\u2026</span></div></div>",

Perhaps it was the nature of that side effect? Perhaps Hazel\u2019s constantly high stress levels set it off prematurely? Whatever the causality was, Hazel was about to feel very different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer weight gain may have only been a stats change to Jocelyn, but to Tsuru and Futaba it was visible; Hazel had developed a serious snacking habit. She ate the same at lunch dinner and breakfast, but during the time between classes, it seemed that Hazel couldn\u2019t go without nibbling on something. Their new friend Amy didn\u2019t seem to notice, but that might have been the distraction from her own snacking at work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen one morning, things started to get really strange\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsuru and Futaba were already up; the former going over her notes for the lessons ahead, and the latter making sure her hair was flicked just the right way, when they heard a yelp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuys! Little help!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of her bedroom wandered Hazel, halfway through her uniform, unfortunately literally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think my clothes have shrunk or something!\u201d Hazel squeaked, pointing at her middle. Her dorm-mates looked; Hazel\u2019s white undershirt was looking woefully small. The material stopping only an inch onto her belly, refusing to be pulled down over the round mass in the middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought that was just an urban legend\u2026?\u201d Futaba commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause it is.\u201d Tsuru replied sharply. The studious girl then took a minute to look over the situation, investigating the material in detail. \u201cIf your clothes shrank Hazel, then why do your arms fit so well?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHazel pulled at the material, Tsuru was right, it did fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe long-haired girl\u2019s investigation continued, looking at some angry red stretch-marks that were running up the sides of Hazel\u2019s stomach. She knew Hazel had been getting fat lately (hell, they all were), but none of them were sporting something like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tsuru lightly placed a finger on one of the markings, there was a sudden lurch and she swore that Hazel\u2019s skin swelled outwards all of a sudden. Not to mention, the stretchmarks turned an even brighter shade of red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Eeeee!</i>\u201d Hazel screamed. \u201cIt moved!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was worrying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m blowing up!\u201d Hazel continued to weep, as Tsuru stood back to her full height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe need to see the nurse, now.\u201d She remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about Nurse Jocelyn?\u201d Futaba suggested. \u201cWe were supposed to report to her if we noticed any side effects, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone agreed, and grabbed their keycards to head straight for the boulder-shaped-woman\u2019s office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they ran, Tsuru had a thought, it seemed weird for Hazel to have such a delayed reaction to the medicine. Plus, shouldn\u2019t the swelling be happening where she was injected, not in her middle?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully Jocelyn was able to help. Hazel was quickly moved to the schools better equipped medical facilities, where she was looked after in the best of care. But once Hazel had been pronounced stable, and there was no real danger to her health, Jocelyn had some questions, and there was only one woman who had all the answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello herr Rose, how may I help you?\u201d Dr Schwartz greeted, as if nothing in the world was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think you know\u2026\u201d The obese woman replied as she heaved her bulky body into one of the good doctor\u2019s chairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have no idea as to what you might be refereink to\u2026\u201d The blue-haired woman replied, barely hiding her grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJocelyn was not really in the mood. \u201cA girl starts swelling like a balloon, and you don\u2019t think I might be asking the woman who supplied the dangerous untested chemical about it?\u201d She snapped a little more coldly than she thought in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr Schwartz\u2019s expression soured. \u201cVery well; what would you like to know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirstly, what happened to Hazel?\u201d Jocelyn asked, rolling out one chubby finger for emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSubject C?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHazel.\u201d Jocelyn was starting to find Schwartz\u2019s cold inhumane tone annoying now. \u201cI at least need to know so I can treat her, should this happen again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine. Her stomach lining has began creating new cells, it\u2019s quite fascinating.\u201d Schwartz seemed to look off in the distance as she spoke, her smile re-emerging. \u201cZe human stomach is generally the size of a fist, but Hazel\u2019s has enlarged to several times that. Ze bloating she has been encountering is actually her stomach wall pressing against her skin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJocelyn held her disgust, and continued to press on. \u201cWhat of the rest of her organs? Won\u2019t they be crushed if it keeps on growing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot at all!\u201d Schwartz answered with a smile. \u201cA woman\u2019s organs can tolerate a lot of stress; during pregnancy most of a woman\u2019s organs are shifted up into her ribcage cavity. Hazel is not that big yet, so no cause for alarm. Plus she seems to be expanding to the side, rather than just to the front or upwards.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJocelyn continued driving to the point. \u201cAnd what would I have to prescribe?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh nothing special, but she will need to eat a lot more now, if she wants to feel full zat is.\u201d Schwartz suggested. \u201cSo if she comes to you with hunger pangs, tell her to eat more, that will sort her out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight\u2026\u201d Jocelyn replied, worried as to what path Yeng (or at least the good doctor) were going down. \u201cNow answer me, what is actually in this chemical?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZat is above your pay grade.\u201d Schwartz hand-waved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen I think I need a raise... handling unknown medical emergencies wasn\u2019t in the job description\u2026\u201d Jocelyn stated in a low, slightly threatening voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor\u2019s nose crinkled distastefully. \u201cFine, if you wish to know\u2026 but I am only telling you this so you can prepare a diagnosis for the subjects should more complications arise.\u201d Schwartz took a deep breath, and explained; \u201cWhen I said zis was an appetite enhancer I was telling the truth, just missing a slight detail. It was made for cattle, not humans.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJocelyn\u2019s eyes bugged out of her head. Schwartz was giving animal medicine to people!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo not give me zat look\u2026\u201d Schwartz hand-waved. \u201cWhen the original product was released, some stupid girl took a bunch of it. The company had tested to see if there were side-effects in humans if they ate beef that had taken the stimulant, but not if someone guzzled down the damn stuff raw!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWas the girl ok?\u201d Jocelyn asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEventually\u2026\u201d Helen teased. \u201cBut you should have seen her right before the doctors had a look at her, what a mess. But I would have given anything to have been able to study her at ze time\u2026 but oh well. After the incident, the company recalled all versions of that product to destroy them, and then released a safer version later, which was also much weaker.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can tell there is a but coming\u2026\u201d Jocelyn added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCorrect! Not all of the formula was destroyed, very little remained and turned up on the black market. Which is where Yeng acquired it, through several other proxies of course. The stimulant was incredibly powerful, and if we can create one without the\u2026 intense side-effects that girl inflicted on herself, then we stand to repay the price we paid many times over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what, I need to be looing out if those students start eating grass or mooing?\u201d Jocelyn remarked, not really joking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmm, somezing like zat.\u201d Helen replied with a wink. \u201cNow, if you don\u2019t mind, I have a lot of work to do with these test results\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Jocelyn slowly got up to leave, none of this was sitting right with her, but with the kind of creepy stuff Helen had just revealed, she didn\u2019t exactly feel safe backing out now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile; Tsuru and Futaba were happy to have their best friend back safe and sound. Hazel had been given both the all-clear and a new uniform tailored for her bloated mid-section.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy had texted them, suggesting they celebrate their friend\u2019s return with a big meal\u2026 and Hazel was very quick to say yes to that\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But I\u2019m doing so well!\u201d complained Lauren, subconsciously pushing her cleavage together in a move she often dropped with guys to throw their attention off or to carry favour.<br>\r\nDespite her life of luxury, Lauren\u2019s academic ability never did compare with the wealth of money her parents had spent on her education and, now she was in an environment that wasn\u2019t so cheaply influenced, the cracks were starting to show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy no means was Lauren lacking intelligence, rather she lacked application or any kind of drive to apply herself properly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that\u2019s not strictly true Lauren but you can fix things yet\u201d mused her tutor, brow creases easing slightly as he flicked through a scattering of paperwork before him.<br>\r\n\u201cEverybody always tells me you have a strong compassion for people and a willingness to help, occasionally at the cost of your own academic progress...ahem...so I\u2019ve come up with some ideas to channel that ability\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA long and frankly boring conversation transpired but eventually it was decided that Lauren would offer her services as a T/PA at Buttercombe to gain some extra credit and she was quite excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drive had been long and she had had to make a number of stops, mostly for food, but finally she was making the last climb to her newest venture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone she had spoken to on the lead up to her arrival seemed very friendly so the young college student couldn\u2019t ask for much more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI love this song!\u201d cheered Lauren as she cranked the volume, taking one last corner to the sound of Little Mix as the heights of Buttercombe Academy pierced the sky before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNavigating the academy grounds, Lauren finally found her way to the visitor parking she had been directed to in order to partake in her orientation meeting, allowing her car to crawl to a halt before knocking the engine off and taking a deep breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is it girl\u201d whispered Lauren to herself \u201cmake yourself proud\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one last deep breath Lauren swung her door open and stepped from her Mercedes, the suspension groaning slightly as her full figured frame departed the driving seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren cut quite the hourglass shape that had expanded in just one year of college life and assisted by an unbridled appetite befitting of her addictive personality.<br>\r\nWith a snug pair of high waisted jeans hugging her thighs and wide bum/hip combo as well as the full bulge of concealed tummy Lauren looked bottom heavy to say the least as her thighs rubbed together with each heeled boot step.<br>\r\nHer top half certainly kept up with her bottom though as a plump bosom strained her top a smidge too much as a slither of chubby stomach poked out between her short top and jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer figure had certainly worked in her favour at college to garner a huge helping of the attention she craved even as she befell the freshmen 15 and then some.<br>\r\nHer natural curves aside though, Lauren possessed the kind of beauty that just hooked people from her piercing blue eyes to the shapely lips beneath her button nose combined with cheeks just chubby enough to not look gaunt even before her college calorie intake.<br>\r\nCombined with a flirtatious nature and tendency to exhibit herself in all the right ways, Lauren was the full package that only helped to fuel her need for attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt did cross her mind that she would be without her friends for a great deal of time but there was always social media to stay in touch and she was confident she would develop a new circle of adoration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she strode from her car to the reception building Lauren began to notice people milling around her, some students and some staff, and a familiar warmth bubbled inside the grey haired student.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018I could get used to this place\u2019 Lauren thought as she entered the intricate double doors to her next adventure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell yes Miss Garner, you\u2019re all set on our records here\u201d gushed the bulbous receptionist, a radiant smile bursting through chubby cheeks \u201cI can see here too that your welcome pack is already set in your residence and it includes instructions for your first assignment as a T/PA\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat!\u201d cheered Lauren, her spirits elevating just from the happy presence before her.<br>\r\nAs her tutor had rightly identified, Lauren was enthusiastic to a fault even if her motivation and direction failed her sometimes but she had an energy right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s get you sorted with a key then and you can concentrate on settling yourself in\u201d smiled the receptionist as she awkwardly pushed herself from her office chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren couldn\u2019t help but, rather hypocritically, smirk at the tight squeeze the buttery woman before her had to remove her rump from her chair but the notion was intended harmlessly.<br>\r\nAgain, Lauren lacked motivation not intelligence but her own princess complex afforded her a slight naivety to her own weight gain whilst she garnered that all important attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk here we...huff...go Miss Garner\u201d announced the receptionist, posting a single key through to Lauren who swiped it up eagerly, taking a moment to cautiously tug on her shirt in a futile attempt to cover her plush middle \u201cjust straight ahead down that corridor, take a right and then up a floor in the elevator and you\u2019ll find your way from there\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you so much!\u201d purred Lauren politely as ever as she turned on her heels and made to follow the directions she had just been given.<br>\r\nShe would come get her bags later but first things first was to find her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith little effort with the clear instructions Lauren easily found the floor she was on and made her way down the corridor to find her room which came with its own realisation...</span></div></div>",

The memories came pouring back as Fuschia continued to stomp through the gradually parting sea of younger, and generally fatter, girls all dressed in yellow as the frightened looks of intimidation met Fuschia\u2019s own stern, unyielding face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDressed head to toe in black, Fuschia couldn\u2019t have been in greater contrast to the brightly dressed girls with her shoulder length black hair, a tattered and long-faded band shirt with holes showing her trim midriff and black bra, and the leggings enclosing her legs and plump rear.<br>\r\nTo add to her intimidating air Fuschia also sported a lip ring that she often chewed for a multitude of emotions alongside her jet black lips, a nose ring through the left side of her button nose and a collection of tattoos spreading her svelte body from her wrists to her ankles with her limbs and back taking a share of her ink collection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she made her way through the halls towards Dr Hinamizawa\u2019s office, a place she had been a couple of times during her school life, students continued to part before her; some subconsciously, some out of fearful respect for the dark girl approaching them and, rather proudly, one backed away in tears following a particularly vicious sneer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018The doctor better have a good excuse for bringing me back to this stupid place\u2019 groaned Fuschia as a familiar smell of cafeteria wafted to meet her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*knock knock knock*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome in\u201d mused Dr Hinamizawa, not looking up from a diary she had before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSup doc\u201d harped Fuschia as she slid through the door and, without invite, practically threw herself into a high-backed mahogany chair opposite the doctor whilst swinging her legs up in one smooth motion allowing her heavy boots to land loudly on the broad desk between the former student and her vice principal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh, Miss Sinclair\u201d announced Hinamizawa as she looked up from her work, managing to bite back a harsh telling off aimed at the boots level with her eyes \u201cit\u2019s...good to see you again, how are you keeping?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot so bad\u201d shrugged Fuschia, picking her teeth with her tongue \u201csaw a few killer shows last month and got a new tattoo behind a merch stand so can\u2019t complain\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was not the kind of person that Hinamizawa made a habit of spending time with but needs must.<br>\r\n\u201cLovely dear\u201d forced the doctor out of politeness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuschia smirked sensing the Vice Principal\u2019s discomfort.<br>\r\nIt had become a favourite past time of hers to garishly flex her alternative lifestyle in front of \u2018normies\u2019 just to watch them squirm and this was no different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re curious as to why you\u2019ve been summoned back to your alma mater\u201d continued Hinamizawa as professionally as she could manage as a want of smoke permeated from Fuschia from across the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuschia simply nodded as she idly glanced at her black finger nails, fiddling with a ornate silver skull ring around her right forefinger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we would be honoured if you would be willing to rejoin us here at Buttercombe as part of our new Teaching/Personal Assistant scheme\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough the basics had been outlined in the letter she had received, hearing the actual words did half Fuschia in her fiddling.<br>\r\n\u2018Why the hell would they want ME to be an assistant to anyone?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll take your silence as consideration\u201d smirked Hinamizawa before continuing \u201cyou would be assigned to either a teacher or a student and basically assist them in anyway that they may require\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk doc, let me stop you there\u201d interjected Fuschia, swinging her legs back down to the ground in order to lean towards her superior \u201cI\u2019m gonna guess something has gone a little wrong here because I am not the girl you want helping anyone, I barely made it out of here for starters\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Fuschia, you are a hoot\u201d smiled the doctor with an almost sickly laugh \u201ctruthfully, you were picked by our high tech algorithms based specifically on your personal traits and academic achievements\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Pfft, doubt that\u2019 thought Fuschia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, but all of the students are shit...sorry...terrified of me, a girl literally cried as I passed her today\u201d responded Fuschia, even more confused now than when she first arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI doubt that, I\u2019m sure she was just...crying over something else\u201d placated Hinamizawa \u201cbesides, I\u2019m sure it would do the school good to have a former student back with us who is so outgoing with her lifestyle\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuschia could barely believe what she was hearing at this point, Hinamizawa really was giving her some bull squirt now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, I\u2019m totally flattered but I don\u2019t think this is for me, there must be some better candidates for...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind Fuschia, the office door opened and a slender red-head poked her head through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry doctor, I just wanted to let you know that the kitchens have called and want your lunch order\u201d purred the girl at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh thank you Felicity, I\u2019ll just have my usual\u201d replied Hinamizawa with a smile \u201ccan I get you anything whilst you\u2019re here Fuschia?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no, I think I\u2019ll be heading off soon so...\u201d tried Fuschia before being cut off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNonsense, you always were a fan of our cheeseburgers if I remember rightly? Felicity, a cheeseburger for Fuschia here please\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbsolutely\u201d smiled Felicity before ducking back out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018That was a little weird that she remembers I like cheeseburgers...\u2019 thought Fuschia as the door clicked shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMhm, this is definitely as delicious as I remember doc\u201d mused Fuschia around a mouthful of cheeseburger as she clumsily wiped her lips with the back of her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGlad it\u2019s gone down so well\u201d smiled Hinamizawa as she far more delicately dabbed at the corner of her mouth with a napkin she had pulled from her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuschia smiled as she swallowed the last of her meal and slid her plate onto the desk in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, where do we stand on my proposition now? We really would love to have you be a part of our team\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuschia internally groaned as the question resumed, she really didn\u2019t want to do this stupid job. If nothing else it sounded like a lot of work and Fuschia really didn\u2019t need that in her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, I can see you still have some reservations so what about this\u201d proposed Hinamizawa \u201cyou can stay here for a month or two and see how you fit back in, we\u2019ll try you out with some basic duties and then take things from there, no obligations at the end\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm, I don\u2019t know...\u201d sighed Fuschia, still not sold on the idea. She had a lot of shows coming up and she was pretty sure this time she would finally finish her Slipknot signature collection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe do already have somebody lined up who is very keen to work with you if that helps\u201d suggested Hinamizawa, elbows on her desk with fingers clasped together under her chin now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuschia sighed heavily, her lunch sitting a little heavy now that it had settled combined with the very pushy doctor, this really was the last thing she expected to come out of her life two years after leaving Buttercombe...<br>\r\nMind you, her parents were sick of giving her a free pass (or so they said) and there were worse places to mooch from than her old school...<br>\r\nOh, what was the harm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m very pleased to hear you will be joining us Fuschia, I\u2019ll be in touch shortly to get you fully inducted back into the school and we can take things from there\u201d smiled Hinamizawa with a hand on the small of the metal head\u2019s back, just north of the curve of her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem...I guess\u201d muttered Fuschia as she made for the door to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, and don\u2019t forget your keys\u201d purred the doctor as she produced a small set of keys and placed them into Fuschia\u2019s dainty, ring filled hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Jeez, still don\u2019t get why I\u2019m here\u2019 moaned Fuschia as she left the office ready to start the next chapter of her life, oblivious of the wide grin adorning the doctors face behind her.</span></div></div>",

Though we strive to make the storytelling experience as diverse and enriching as possible, the main goal behind most every story line is to satisfy a fetish based around <i>weight gain</i>. If the thought of women of varying ages getting fat offends you, personally morally or otherwise, then I'd suggest turning back now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving on with that same spirit in mind, this is a story about <i>female weight gain</i>. No boys allowed! Male characters are allowed to appear off-campus, but they are not permitted to be the main focus of any story line. The minimum age requirement is 15 years old. While this interactive is designed to be less restrictive creatively than its predecessor, the basic spirit remains the same. No exponential weight gains in the blink of an eye, no magic potions that make characters fat, so on. There will be odder, stranger, topics explored in this setting, but we're going for quality storytelling here!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that in mind, I implore you to add. Please, add! This is an entirely community-driven interactive, capitalizing on <i>years</i> of storytelling throughout my portfolio from lots of authors just like you! As long as you follow the rules and do your best, I'll be happy to host your chapters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow then, I hope you enjoy your return to Buttercombe Academy. You might find it a bit different from when you last left it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b><font class=\"size45\" style=\"\">\u2014INTRODUCTION\u2014</font></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">For those of you unaware, this interactive serves as a direct <i>sequel</i> to Buttercombe Academy, one of the largest and most popular interactive stories on this website. That being said, it also involves plot threads and story lines that have premiered in other interactives from my portfolio as well.

And in that time a lot of things have changed! <br>\r\nThe staff has seen a lot of shifting around, there have been many new classes of students to wander the halls, and a partnership with the enigmatic mega corporation, Yeng, has finally put an end to budgeting issues.<br>\r\nThings have changed for Buttercombe Academy alright, but folks always seem to come out bigger than when they came in!</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b><font class=\"size45\" style=\"\">\u2014YENG &amp; YOU\u2014</font></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">Since its debut in the States, the Yeng Corporation has grown immensely. In just 15 years it has become a name synonymous with progress, ingenuity, and innovation. They produce any number of products designed for the comfort and efficiency of their busy clientele. They provide appliances, electronics, and even their new pharmaceuticals to the school in exchange for detailed and important data on how the lives of the faculty, staff and student body are enriched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, not all is as it seems with the seemingly benevolent megacorp. Since their involvement in the school some time ago, the average size of the student body has increased exponentially. The pandering devices and coddling technologies they pad Buttercombe Academy with are enough, but those who find themselves directly under their microscope may have a hard time fitting into their uniforms than anyone else...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhether or not you choose to peel back the layers of the Yeng Corp. conspiracy are entirely up to you. However, some characters will be rooted firmly in this story line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><font class=\"size45\" style=\"\">\u2014ALL-NEW &amp; IMPROVED SSS PROGRAM\u2014</font></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the many improvements that the Yeng Corporation has been working on since the inception of their partnership with Buttercombe Academy is some greatly needed changes to the SSS program. Previously known as the Special Services for Students program, the name has now been changed to Special Services for Stipendiaries program, to better reflect an emphasis on helping <i>everyone</i>. That means Teachers &amp; Faculty are now eligible for SSS!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>If you have any questions about the program or are curious as to whether or not your character becomes eligible for one of the leveled tiers and any accommodations that might bring, please consult this helpful guide!<br>\r\n</b><br>\r\n<div width=\"100%\" onmouseover=\"showMine('cItemItemID6');\" onmouseout=\"hideMine('cItemItemID6');\"><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"position:relative;min-width:400px;\" width=\"95%\" class=\"citemTable\"><tr><td width=\"55\">\u00a0</td><td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\" width=\"59\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a style=\"padding:0px 0px 0px 0px;\" target=\"_top\" href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/view_item/item_id/2171376-the-SSS-Brochure\"><img src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/icon-15000.gif\" border=\"0\" width=\"30\" height=\"25\" valign=\"middle\" align=\"center\"></a></td><td align=\"left\" rowspan=\"1\" class=\"norm\" style=\"padding-left:15px;color:#000000;\"><a href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/view_item/item_id/2171376-the-SSS-Brochure\" target=\"_top\" class=\"blue2roll noSelect\" style=\"font-size:1.3em;font-weight:bold;\">the SSS Brochure</a>\u00a0<a title=\"Open Item in new window.\" href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/view_item/item_id/2171376-the-SSS-Brochure\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a> [<b><a class=\"sblueroll\" href=\"javascript:LaunchPop('https://www.Writing.Com/main/tools.php?action=pop_rhelp&amp;crating=10',%20'crhelp10',%20'500',%20'350');\">E</a></b>] <div id=\"cItemItemID6\" align=\"left\" style=\"align:left;overflow: hidden;float:right;display:none;visibility:hidden;\">#<b>2171376</b></div><br>a world-building guide for those with questions regarding SSS!<br><nobr>by <span class=\"noselect\" style=\"cursor:pointer;\" oncontextmenu=\"uport_ajax_rt_opts (event, this, 'psuedophobic', '', '', '', '10', '', 'ON', '100565841'); hide_uport (); this.shown=1; return false;\" onclick=\"uport_ajax_opts (event, this, 'psuedophobic', '', '', '', '10', '', 'ON'); hide_uport (); this.shown=1;\"><a title=\"Username: psuedophobic\r\nMember Since: November 11th, 2007\r\nClick for links!\" style=\"line-height: 1em;font-size:1em;font-weight:bold;cursor:pointer;\">Bobo the Hobo</a></span> <span class=\"noPrint\">(<a title=\"View psuedophobic's Community Recognition\" class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"javascript:LaunchPop('https://www.Writing.Com/main/authors/action/overall/user_id/psuedophobic',%20'CommunityR_100565841',%20'400',%20'650')\">83</a>)</span> <a class=\"imgLink imgPortLink\" onmousedown=\"if(event.which == 3) { event.preventDefault(); var mywin = window.open('https://www.Writing.Com/main/portfolio/view/psuedophobic','_blank'); mywin.focus (); event.stopPropagation(); return false; }\" href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/portfolio/view/psuedophobic\" target=\"_top\" onmouseover=\"uport_ajax2 (event, this, 'psuedophobic', '&lt;span style=\\'color:#990000;font-weight:bold\\'&gt;Offline or Private&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt; Last On:  Private', '', 'November 11, 2007', '', '', '10', 'Registered Author');\" onmouseout=\"hide_uport ();\"><span style=\"padding:0px 2px 0px 0px;vertical-align:middle;\"><img src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/costumicons/ps-icon-regular-10.gif\" width=\"30\" height=\"15\" border=\"0\"></span></a></nobr></td></tr></table></div></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b><font class=\"size45\" style=\"\">\u2014WHAT IF?

Sometimes these choices involve something character based like weight, sexual orientation, or off-the-wall interactions, and sometimes they're story-based like, what if the least expected thing were to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're of course free to create your own What If? scenarios! However, I'd recommend going lightly! Too much of a good thing turns into a really lame storytelling device! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">If you find yourself itching to add to a story line, but don't have any clue as to where to begin, let me know! I'm happy to facilitate additions to this story. In that same spirit, if you require an edit to something you've posted, or perhaps want me to alter a chapter choice option so that it better fits the story line that you want to create, send me an e-mail! It takes me like, five seconds to do it and I'm happy to do so as long as it helps keep the story going!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>ENJOY YOUR RETURN TO BUTTERCOMBE ACADEMY</b></div></div></div></div></div></td>",
