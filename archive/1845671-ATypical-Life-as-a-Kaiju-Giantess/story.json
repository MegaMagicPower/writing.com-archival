Well let's go back to where this entire story begins. Her parents worked at a science company and one day they brought their daughter to work when they were experimenting with some new DNA sample, somehow an accident occurred and the sample tube broke right on Matilda. Suddenly, she ended up growing to gigantic height and was able to breathe fire as well. At first the entire population of Diamond City was terrified, but they soon grew to adore and like her when she showed that she was still friendly and such, and now she helps out with construction works, demolitions, and other things across the city as a creature known to all as Matildgon. She is also a huge Japanese giant monster fan, so she does act, roar, and stomp around like a kaiju all the time, but thankfully is careful where she goes and lands her stomps. She is going through some issues like being forced to live in the mountains (although the scientists grow foods and her swimsuits as clothes as the others don't work for some reason), having to wear a bikini all the time, being homeschooled, etc. <br>\r\nAdditional Info: None<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what do you wanna do with her?</span></div></div>",

The scientist plan was to use the young kids and turn them into giant monsters that would help him rule the Earth. He used various technologies to make the children monstrous, but also teach them how to speak and such... just when he made his entire army of several giant children girls with powers to attack Shinzo, Japan... he was arrested by the government and was sent away to a prison. However, the girls were already turned into monsters, and there was nothing they could do to reverse the effects. With a little bit of hope, one person in the government of Japan came up with an idea where the girls can live as giant monsters in Shinzo, Japan. They made buildings not far from the main city that the girls can live in, and provide many activities that use their monstrousness in very creative and fun ways. Several girls have buildings in the heart of the city in an area where they can burst out of a human size building and come into the real city to hang out. There is a lot of things I can get into about this city, but let's just say they love the giant monster girls so much, they want to have the experience of having monsters in the city, that don't destroy of course. And there is even a theme park where the people can play with the giant monster girls, and even see them rampage in a virutal city.<br>\r\nAdditional info: Koyuki is a total monster and appeal nut, so she dreams of being the greatest giant monster icon in the world, a girl who can bring terror to cities, etc. She is the pure opposite of Helga, want to be seen as a monster, loves being in bikinis, etc. But she is a kind girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere do we start with Koyukizilla?</span></div></div>",

She was initially shocked and scared for others' safety when she grew like this. No known cure was available at the moment. Authorities found the scientist and placed him in charge of the girl. The scientist, Manami, and her family moved to a gigantic island near the city where she lives to this day.

It seems that the love of the giant monster girls was so great, that the city of Japan decided they needed one more. Now how they did this, with a contest to see which girl has the most desire to become the biggest and most monstrous girl of them all. Well it turns out that this little girl name Soya has won that contest. She has been an avid giant monster and giantess fan when she was just young and her mother introduced her to their movies over the years, but her favorite was the crossover Shinkzukazilla vs Harukagon as her two favorite monsters battle it out in Tokyo, and immense destruction was cause. She loved it so much that she desired to be the third monster girl, and the most monstrous of them all. Well the government saw that so they used the formula created by both Haruka and Shinkzuka's DNA (at their approval) to make the girl into a giant monster as well. The city also really celebrated having another monster girl so they gave her the monster treatment (we will get into that in future chapters.). There is so much that I can get into this character that we will just have her just being started just to give her character depth. Not much but enough to get started. Shinkzuka is glad to have another giant girl to be a monster with, and while Haruka likes having another friend, she does feel the love for the giant girls is getting a little bit overhand so she tries to teach her the more easy things. Shinzuka is going to make Soya into a real monster however.<br>\r\nAdditional Info: She has big breast for a girl her age, and she is in training so accidents will occur like crushed cars and what not. Also, Haruka and Shinzuka are big parts of the story so refer to them as well. Now we got 3 monster girls now. She is also the most monstrous of the 3 girls with her roars and immense strength. The whole city will know her as a true monster.</span></div></div>",

Maybe we should save the energy bursting thing for later for now let's just focus on the easy stuff.\" Shinkzuka said firmly <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,right okay first thing pretend you're in a populated city stuffed with people who just noticed you appearing over the horizon and they just started running and screaming now what do you do?\" Harkura asked <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh? Try and convince them that I mean no harm?\" Soya said both other girls exchanged eye rolls <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh no! You can do that a big later! Right now we're just starting out well the first thing you do is simply take your first steps into the city,roar a few times and....\" But Soya interputted her <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those things I already know I mean come on its basic Monster lesson 101 isn't it? I thought you guys were going to teach me something really useful about this whole 'Kaiju' thing?\" The other girl spoke up <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are! But we're starting at the bottom of the barrel so to speak so you can get the hang of it now as Harkura said following a few stomps and a couple of roars to spook the crowd a bit then you want to unleash a few fiery blasts at buildings and.........\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem.....\" Said Harkura clearing her throat <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean just continuing walking down the street scaring the folk for a bit then just for fun unleash one or two fire blasts......\" But once again she was interputted <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was wondering for a while now girls what exactly does a Kaiju do? I mean what is the purpose?\" Soya asked <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er you take this one I'm not sure how to explain it!\" Shinkzuka said to Harkura \"After all she's your trainee isn't she?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're kidding right? You watched plenty of Godzilla movies haven't you? You've been a fan of our work(gesturing to her and Shinkzuka)? There's a lot more to being a Kaiju or giant monster of any kind or species than just rampaging and destroying stuff we can be good or evil or a mixture of both depending on our personalities so in other words we can either choose to be the city or town's savior or destroyer now as for our powers well it all depends on the source of our origins or creations basically we can possess every type of power or super-power under the sun okay? You understand the basics of what it means to be a Kaiju now?\" Soya nodded <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I guess so alright after the rampaging and roars and energy blasts what happens next?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's normally around the time when the military shows up and a stand off begins between the Kaiju and them being that you're a Godzilla fan you probably know what happens then either we can surrender to them or resist and try and destroy them in the process or often ourselves.\" Harkura explained <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's it?\" Soya asked feeling a bit let down <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah pretty much unless we forgotten something did we?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope I don't think so....oh wait one more thing if another giant monster shows up and a fight breaks out between the two the best thing to do is to either fight like mad or just try and get out of there especially if the other monster is more experienced than you but that's always not the case remember that bigger doesn't always mean better or stronger!\" Soya nodded understanding <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay I think I got everything crystal clear! Now what can we do?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well how about.....\" Shinkzuka suggested......</span></div></div>",

A loving family, a great school, and a great city that she loves to visit. It seems everything was perfect for her, well here is one thing that makes that a bit difficult. She is a 9 year old 200ft bikini clad kaiju girl with King Ghidorah like powers. How it happened though, well her father and mother where both military scientists that were trying to make a kaiju be used as a weapon, and an accident caused the DNA to hit the mother who was pregnant. She then gave birth to a girl name Haruka, and she seemed to be normal for a few years, but during those years she begun developing powers and her height. At age 6 she was called Queen Haruka or Harukagon for her powers, and the people seemed to fear her and such, but she was a nice and gentle soul, so their issues were settled. The city of Japan help made the city livable for her, like letting her still go to school outside as her hearing lets her pick up important things and such. She also helped the city in many other ways, like demolition, modeling, and such. She couldn't fit in her home, so the government made an island near Tokyo be her home where she has a virtual city and many other things. It was known as Haruka Island.<br>\r\nAdditional Info: She has C-Cup breasts and her bikini also reflects her looks. She also takes her studies seriously before she plays or anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what now?</span></div></div>",

Today, she is just wanting to have a nice and quiet day, away from all the people giving her alot of buzz for her looks, her immense size, powers, and monster icon. As a matter of fact, it is a bit of an issue that she suffered when she became so big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see, for starters, she had to wear almost swimsuits entirely as making clothes for Haruka would take alot of supplies and money, and while it could be worth the effort, it was just decided to be simple and just have her be in a swimsuit all the time, just covering her private parts. This was a bit of an issue for Haruka as she isn't used to being exposed all the time, every day, and eventually it became an issue for her. Boys would easily tease her for her big breasts and dressing. She can get pretty embarrassed most of the time as a result. Luckily a time where she isn't embarrassed when she wears bikinis is during monster movie shoots and modeling, and that leads to another issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe is always being seen as a giant monster icon, and that is why she is always called in public Harukagon, and sometimes Queen Haruka, because of her abilities and size being that of King Ghidorah. People view her essentially for that and not for the gentle and kind soul that she is, though she doesn't mind them calling her that, she just wants to be called Haruka inspite of it. Sometimes people call her a monster so many times it makes her conflicted, and while she doesn't go on a rampage at all in Tokyo, she can only imagine herself doing that if she ended up snapping at the present time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least one time that she is able to be of total use for the government is testing for the Tokyo Monster Exterimination Unit, as they can test various weapons on her to determine their effectiveness, and she actually likes it, as she wants to help them. Perhaps she wants to find a weakness in her so it can prove she isn't invincible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, a doorbell rings and Haruka opens the door, she sees that it is....</span></div></div>",

Has also wore other clothes her followers made and what not.<br>\r\nPowers: Similar to Sakura and Luna with near immortality (never aging what not), but can shoot lasers from her eyes that can cause massive destruction, roars, regeneration, but she is really well known for her destruction powers, as she can destroy buildings and stuff with ease with her body better than anyone. Not really a power, but a certain talent she has. Her actual goddess ability is influencing and having control over people of her city with her towering presence, as she feels like a true goddess.<br>\r\nWhere they live:  Tokyo, Japan<br>\r\nBio: Soyumi Loza is a Japanese model and actress that really makes headlines at a very young age for surprisingly her slim body and huge DD breast for a girl her age, starring in many commercials promoting clothes, but she was also a movie actress, with her favorite roles being giant monster movie roles where she plays as the giant monster. She just loves the feeling of towering over buildings and interacting or destroying them in various ways, and this was particularly inspired by the Goddesses that live among them in Tokyo. She is a super fan of Sakura herself, and even takes some of her methods into account former acting. So Soyumi was just one day a normal young mega hit actress, and then suddenly the next day... she was then in a towering height of 200ft tall and then discovers she has Goddess powers. Suddenly everyone was then really noticing her being gigantic for real, and at first she was confused at everything and that is where Luna and Sakura came in, and soon she understood why she is a goddess, and the goddess of influence and power. She would then have a full on blast with her new life being pampered by like a full on goddess, so much so that her legal name becomes Soyumizilla. She still acts, etc, but now on a big scale, and the people would do anything to please her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdditional info: She is going to be kinda of a tsundere character as she takes on her goddess role full on, acting and stomping like a monster full on, with almost every routine like waking up, entering the city, traveling through the city, etc being monster like, but she is otherwise a gentle soul once she gets used to everything, and that is because she is a goddess in training, so she is bound to cause accidents, but no one is killed. She is a really great friend of Sakura an sometimes they both act like monsters for their fans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere is a link to Sakura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/1845671-ATypical-Life-as-a-Kaiju-Giantess/map/1552\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.writing.com/main/interact/it...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere do you wanna start?</span></div></div>",

She has enhanced vocal cores that lets her roar like a monster. Also, her roar can cause EMP waves. Finally, she can fire an atomic breath from her mouth like Godzilla.<br>\r\nWhere they live: in the mountains not far from Denver, Colorado<br>\r\nBio: Molly had a very special life growing up, and I mean a very special life. You see, she was cursed by an evil witch when she was a baby to her very rich parents, that she would grow up one day to be a titanic destructive monster that would ravage the earth. The parents did something to the witch that she didn't like, and also wanted to take over the world. Over the years, the child begun to grow to immense heights, and developed monster like abilties. Her parents was for sure frightened, as many of the people were, but they would do anything to help her once they found out the gentle and nice soul that she is, and also playful as well. She was for the early years kept in a military base when her powers were discovered, and during that time, scientists and the public all help to make Molly's life as a monster a good one. Molly actually is a fan of giant monster movies, and she could imagine herself as a good monster to the public. Roaring for her fans, destroying buildings for them, etc. It takes alot of people to help her, and of course she has a normal teenager life, like high school where she sits outside the school, romances, etc. All that typical stuff. She made lots of friends, but she made a very known friend in Kei, a friend she grew up with when she was only 6. Kei was a friend to Molly, and loves it when Molly acts like a monster, and the two developed a close friendship, and it might just be a romance one day. She lives in the mountains of Denver, Colorado in a private built home that comes with all her normal teenager life stuff, and even a virtual reality game where she can protect the city, or be a monster and destroy it. More on that in the story...<br>\r\nAdditional info: She is a really nice person, and doesn't mind at all the people calling her all those giant monster name she like Molly the Meance, and Mollzilla, actually she kinda likes it as she is a powerful force of nature. She can though get pretty defensive at times if she feels violated and she isn't afraid of using her immense size and powers to prove that. Tough on bullies for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere do you wanna start?</span></div></div>",

You see, before she became the famous giant and even kaiju, she was already that. Her mother was an actress and model for magazines. Her mother in a very young age introduced her to her career and she was a major child star. Not just in family movies and such, true Japanese Kaiju movies... as the Kaiju. She has several series where she plays a giant girl who rampaged Tokyo (Attack of the Giant Schoolgirl), a goddess where she rules over people (The Titaness Child), and her most famous role, a young girl who lives in Tokyo as a size of monster (A Kaiju Life). All of them has giant monster related elements, with her being a giant in the city, and occasionally causing destruction to miniature city. She was a major icon in the monster industry and life was really good, until one day a small meteor hits her and covers her with some sort of alien like energy. You know how this goes, she grows massive and gains powers. Obviously the people were terrified at first as she was a true Japanese giant monster icon and could go all monster on them. But she was still a kind and gentle soul, and soon the city got used to having a Japanese monster living with them. She helps with demolitions, plays with children all the time as the monster she is, and is seen as a Hero rescuing people from various accidents, all while roaring like a monster, moving like a monster, and even being a monster. Even to the point from her private island she goes into the ocean and rises from it and roars like a beast. The city of Tokyo soon adjusted to her and even gave her a virtual city to play with. She even became a landmark and icon in Japan. One thing she is wanting truly in life is to be the best monster in the world that the people want, so she practices her monster movements every day and what not. She is also trying to get love, and other stuff. Well we will get into that story later. The fact is... she is a true monster. She also is still awesome in the movie industry.<br>\r\nAdditional Info: She is a total giant monster nut so she acts like a beast all the time. She also adjusts height when fans want her to and such. Also since she is a monster but, almost everything on her island is a Godzilla miniature city to where she can be a monster one and have that monster feel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet's do this.

The director asked her to go to a model city and proceed to destroy it. Yumi said, \"IT WILL BE MY PLEASURE, SIR!\" Yumi stomped over to the city, causing a small earthquake with each step she took. She began stepping on cars and knocking down buildings, roaring a little bit as well. \"RAWR!!! HERE I COME, LITTLE CITY!

She was so big that the citizens of Featherbeak City had to clear a large space in the middle of the city just for her to sleep. However, sleeping became a tad bit difficult for her, because she would be woken up in the middle of the night by tiny little cars driving by. She also hasn't been eating very much. Due to her size, she's been eating trees from a nearby forest. She hates it, and wishes she could eat real food, but she hasn't been able to in 2 weeks. She's been beginning to starve. And another thing. Nobody will go anywhere within 5 feet of her. They're just too afraid of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day however, a young man named Kyle moved to Featherbeak City from Seattle, WA. He had read stories about giantesses on the internet, and was brave enough to walk over to Cassie and try to talk to her.</span></div></div>",

Cassie tried to move her large foot out of the way, but it was too late. The freight train crashed into her foot and came right off the track.

Stephanie is at a goverment facility for now.<br>\r\nBio: Read on to find out<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Stephanie is sitting inside what can be best described as a warehouse. It has some of her basic needs, a place to sleep and a bathroom. But the biggest problem is that she can't stand up straight because of the thirt foit high ceiling, a problem because she is fifty feet tall. Het shirt and skirt are just large pieces of clothe that are wrapped around her body. Beingbtold that better accomodations are being made for her. But when she asked about shoes for her bare feet, she was told it was too expensive to produce shoes in her size. So she has to go barefoot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Stephanie sighs as she pulls her legs up to her chest, missing her husband and her daughter. Unfortunately, the government wants her to have limited contact with them until she has a better understanding of her fifty foot stature. She understands, as she is able to cruah a car like it was a paper cup, not to mention that it is very easy for her to step on something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie looks down at her, curling her long, thick toes. When she was five feet tall, her feet were already sizeable at a woman's thirteen and a half. Now, at her current height, they are ten feet long, On her first trip over, she accidentally stepped on and crushed two cars. Thank God no one was in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie thinks back to when she first changed. Even though it was only a week ago, it seems like so much longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Stephanie was walkingbdown the street with her fourteen year old daughter, Becky. The day was nice, so a walk was very enjoyable. The next thung she knows, she hears tire squealing as a truck is losing control. She instinctively pushed her daughter out of the way as she was coverd in a chemical mixture. She expected to suffer third degree burns, but instead jt just felt warm. Then that's when it happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe remembers how her clothes started to feel tight on her body, her shoes feeling snug on her feet. Then shebsaw her daughter, who should have ben eye level with her, but wasn.t She was shorter.The moment her sock clad toe burst through the fronts of her shoes and the buttons of her blouse started to pop of, she knew what was happening to her. She was growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer capri pants started to grip her legs, almost like a second skin, the seams tearing as her flesh bulged outward. Her shirt fared no better, tearingbalongbthe back as her widening body pushed it outward from th inside. Once her shoes gave way, her socks started tearing, her long toes protuding through the fronts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     As Stephanie's clothes fell away, she covered her ample, size F breasts with her arm, while she covered her womanhood with her free hand. As she rose up higher and higher, people continued to stare, as her daughter called out to her. Once she stopped growing, they all stood and watched, wondering if she would rampagenot not. Their minds put at ease when she sat down in the road, uxing her legs and long hair to preserve her modesty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an hoir of waiting with her daughter, her husband rushing to her side fifteen minutes after her growth, the Kaiju Specialty Forces, or KSJ for short, arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe general approached Stephanie, the thirty year old woman, drwarfing Stephanie's six foot tall husband by a foot and a half. She made an offer, supplyinng stephanie with all her basic needs and relocating her family so they can still be together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt been a week since then, and Stephanie's progress has been slow. Sha has been codenamed Momzilla, since that is what everyone has been calling her. She looks over as a door opens up, as General Alice walks in. She wonders what kind of training she will endure today.</span></div></div>",

That is actually a great advice there. But let me ask you all this, especially the girl. If you were this big and everyone sees you like a monster, how would you feel?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that depends if they are scared of just love me.\u201d The girl replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess you have a point there... I mean, I just want to be useful for a change around here. But... I wish they can see me for the real me, and not just some towering monster sized girl like they do with Sakura and Soyumi and many others, and if by some means y\u2019all were giants, don\u2019t you want to be seen for the kind person that you are, or just some monster?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOurselves.\u201d They said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Remember they are no male giants, but I figure I state a question here for them in order to get Luna to teach a good lesson.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSay, you should go out every so often and try being more open?\u201d the girl then said, hoping to get Luna to go out for a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes it succeed? </span></div></div>",

Deep down she wants to be a friendly and helping, but also an awesome goddess who will take their rightful place as rulers, but let\u2019s just say she is going to have a blast while she does it. She and her mother over the young years have watched plenty of monster movies like Godzilla and Gamera as she imagine herself as a kaiju and wants to take a spin on her time as goddess while also still being friendly as well. Her mother is extremely supportive of her and being a fan of the Goddesses herself, she can see why she is one day hoping for that. Then one day it has finally happened, and Sakura became a goddess herself and awakens her powers. But one power she finds interesting other than her giant monster like ones like roars and fire breath, is how she can adjust her age and body appearances, letting her change her height as well in the process. She imagined her self as a kid one day and then suddenly she is then a kid again in appearance and height wise, getting her dream in the process. Then she adjusts back at her own choice, and it does. Well, the rest of the story comes soon so let\u2019s get into the writing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdditional info: She is a really fun loving girl, but is lucky to be careful with what she does as a goddess, but a part of her fun is acting like a giant monster attacking the city. So she stomps around and roars like kaiju a lot, and even rises from the ocean or makes big monster openings as well. She currently has lots of fans, especially children who she is a sucker for as she wants to bring joy to the world, and sometimes uses her younger forms to be like a kid monster to them. She does plenty of favors around the city also, like demolitions and stuff,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig note, this story takes place in the same universe as Luna\u2019s, so refer to this link here for more details.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/1845671-ATypical-Life-as-a-Kaiju-Giantess/map/1551\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.writing.com/main/interact/it...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo where do you wanna start?</span></div></div>",

Well in this new giantess story, you get to see a new side of life that you have never seen the girls before. The girls by some means grew to gigantic monster like sizes and you would think they would become good or evil, but in actually, they are just trying to go through the same thing we do in life. Go to school or work, learn or work, go to bed, sleep, etc. Well imagine having to do all of that as a giantess with giant monster like powers and is known to the people as a giant monster, either accepted and loved by the public, or feared and trashed by everyone. The difference in this story is that they don't go suddenly on a huge rampage and kill everything and everyone, here they are trying to solve this life problem without violence. Hence the title of this new giantess kaiju interactive... \"A Typical Life as a Kaiju Giantess\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow of course it ain't all typical, sometimes they can be well known and liked as a celebrity. But the difference in this kaiju giantess story is that they are going through life issues, but on a whole another scale, one that is gigantic sized. And also they have other issues like how to get around the city without destroying stuff, clothing they were, where they live, and etc. I kinda want to go for that type of feel in this new story. Slice of Life Drama Sci-Fi Fantasy kaiju adventure. Who knows, maybe some romance even.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, all of the giant girls in this story will have a kaiju name, and if you want to be simple, just add a Zilla at the end of the name. The government will register that being as a kaiju.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlright, time to get to the rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo Male Giants<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo Vore since this is not an evil story as I am focusing on life issues on this one, and other stuff, don't want this turning into an eating story<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sexual content for the younger than 13 crowd, please, I will get in real trouble for this<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo unbirth<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo switching genders<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo nudity<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease make your additions at least a paragraph long, as I will delete those who break this rule<br>\r\nNo scat<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can make more than one giantess in a route<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeave more than one option for the other guys so they can make their characters when you use the open slots (which will be made soon)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe format must be completed in its entirely for the character to be made, now if you have a photo of the girl you want to use, you can ignore the hair style, skin, eye color, and clothes part, just put a link of the photo at the end, and make sure it's workable<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScale-wise, 12 inches is a foot. Perhaps for Kaiju size, time it by 40 or 50.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHave fun<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the format to make your character<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName:<br>\r\nKaiju Name: <br>\r\nAge:<br>\r\nHair style and color:<br>\r\nEye color:<br>\r\nSkin:<br>\r\nHeight:<br>\r\nClothes:<br>\r\nPowers: (This is a kaiju story so they will have some)<br>\r\nWhere they live: (Can be a fictional city)<br>\r\nBio: (Explain how they grew, and their whole background story)<br>\r\nAdditional Info: (This is optional, but any other details we should know)</td>",
