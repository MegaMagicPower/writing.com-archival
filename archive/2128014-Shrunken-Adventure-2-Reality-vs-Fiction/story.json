So, I hope you don't mind if I treat you like a mouse~\" She opens her maw wide and pins you down with her paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to struggle trying to break free from Luna's grasp.

You heard the inside Luna's belly as there was a few groans and gurgling sounds around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna then curls up on Usagi's bed and sighs calmly \"I'll help myself to a nice catnap now, I'll be seeing you later on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pout as she said that, you had to find someway out and her Usagi to come home early or you can kiss everything good bye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you find a way out or does Luna keep her word about keeping you for lunch</span></div></div>",

Thanks, Tim!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slid down Ami's throat as you heard her humming and felt her pat her stomach, you then eventually arrive inside it as you looked around her spacious stomach. \"Well, that was actually fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad you enjoyed the ride down!\" Ami sits down on her couch and massages her tummy some more \"After all, if you're going to stick around here, this certainly won't be the last time I eat you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kinda bizarre, isn't it?\" Rei sits down beside her \"This little guy just popped up today, and now we're all... well, snacking on him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't mind more snacks...\" Usagi grins and stares off into space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you don't Usagi.\" You said from Ami's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" Ami pats her tummy \"While he's in there, shall we work on some homework?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm?\" Usagi looks up \"Oh, well... usually I just put on the TV for a while, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should get it done now, Usagi,\" Rei flicks her friend in the forehead \"Not that I have the same workload as you guys, but I'll stick around to help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, they set about working on their homework and studying while you rest inside of Ami's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou listened to what the three talked about more as you rubbed the walls of Ami's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an hour or so in her belly, it jiggles around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's it going in there, Tim?\" Ami asks \"You've been quiet for a while now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, just listening to what you girls were talking about, I did hear about more missions but that's about it.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, well, at least you're alright,\" Ami pats her tummy \"Do you need anything while you're in there? We'll probably be at this for another couple hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe some food please.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay! I'll gulp down a couple candy bars,\" she gets up and heads for her kitchen \"I'll keep them in the wrappers so you can have them fresh.\" She opens her cabinet and grabs a couple of mini Twix bars. She opens her mouth wide and swallows them one after the other. They land in her belly beside you after a couple seconds. \"Oof...\" she sighs after shutting the closet \"That alright, Tim?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled. smiled and take them. \"Thanks Ami.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi returns to the living room to resume the homework session.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Tim!\" Usagi perks up and pats Ami's belly \"You recall when I said said you could get Chibiusa to eat you, right? I think she should be off school soon, so we can arrange for her to snack on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could hide you in a bag of snacks~\" Rei chuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That might work.\" You said. \"Have her be unexpected about me until I start talking to her after I'm in her tummy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, gonna spook her?\" Ami asks \"Alrighty then. I'll send her a text to meet up at my place. We'll have some business to take care of this evening, anyway, so it all works out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You might spend the next mission in her belly,\" Rei laughs to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then.\" You said. \"But you three are cool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heheh, thanks, Tim!\" Ami replies, stroking her tummy \"You're pretty cool too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool? He's a snack!\" Usagi smirks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's cool for letting us eat him~\" Rei adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Wanna come out and hide in her snack?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think for a moment and had to admit this was pretty fun getting to know the girls even if you didn't like how things went first hand and looked up. \"Yes, though I will miss you three, but that doesn't mean I can't see you lot again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you'll probably rotate staying at each of our houses,\" Ami notes as she stands up \"So you'll see plenty of us!\" She heads into the bathroom and, as your previous predators have done, lies face-down in the bathtub.\"Alright Tim, ready when you are~\" Ami opens her mouth and waits patiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make my way out of Ami's body as you reach the inside of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi reaches up to grab some tissues and spits you into them, gently wiping you off. \"Hah...\" she stands up and takes a breath \"Better going down than coming up... do you want me to wash you up, real quick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod your head. \"Yes please Ami.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotcha,\" she steps out of the tub and plugs up the sink, filling it with lukewarm water. Unlike Usagi, she gently removes your clothes for you, though she does avert her eyes, somewhat politely. She snaps off a piece of soap and, after turning the water off, proceeds to gently scrub you using the miniature bath she's filled for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush a bit and smile. \"Thanks Ami.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, Tim,\" Ami nods, draining the sink and grabbing a washcloth to dry you off \"Ah... there we are. Go ahead and get dressed.\" She then sets you back down, next to your clothes.\"So, what snack do you think you'd like to hide in?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well knowing ChibiUsa she would go for a bag of candy.\" You said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about a bag of gummy worms?\" Ami smiles and carries you into the kitchen, and opens up her pantry to inspect her selection of candy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod in agreement. \"Okay then just hope she doesn't chew me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax,\" Ami takes out a bag of gummy worms and opens it up \"Just get down her throat as fast as possible, okay? Here, I'll cast a little charm to make you bite-proof.\" She waves her fingers, causing you to briefly glow. \"There, you'll still feel pain, but your body will be completely fine,\" Ami nods, dangling you over the opened bag \"Heheh, good thing you're so small. I don't have to use nearly as much magic while I work with you.\" She then drops you into the bag, letting you land comfortably on the chewy treats. Ami waves her fingers again, then draws them over the opening of the candy bag, causing it to seal up as though it'd never been opened. \"Heh, I could get used to this,\" Ami laughs, then reaches into the fridge to grab a juice box \"Welp, Chibiusa should be here any minute now. Hope you're ready!\" With that, she heads back into the living room and sets you on the other end of the coffee table from Usagi and Rei, who only chuckle as they see Ami set you down for Chibi to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It's a weird story, but we've dealt with weirder.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tim?\" Makoto took you into her hands \"That's... an odd name. Do I know you from somewhere? Because that does sound like one of my old boyfriends names.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but long story short or as short as I can make it. I wounded up here in your guy's world, and I was at Usagi's place, so one thing led to another, Usagi ate me, then Rei did, followed by Ami, and a few hours or so it was ChibUsa, but I'm cleaned however so, as Usagi would say, can't let a good snack go to waste.\"You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Usagi <i>would </i> say that,\" Makoto chuckled \"Alright, well... if that's the trend, then I guess I'll... eat you... now?\" She opened her mouth, still a little wary of you. Nonetheless, she set you on her tongue and swallowed you down. \"Ah...\" she sighed, smiling \"Kinda sweet... wish I'd savored you more.\" She follows the bulge in her throat with her finger down to her gut, stopping as you land in her tummy. \"Uh, so...\" she pats her belly \"Enjoy the ride?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did yes.\" You said. \"It's roomy in here like Rei's and Ami's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat?\" Makoto pokes her tummy \"You callin' me fat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh,\" Rei chuckles \"No, he means we don't eat as much as Usagi does.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well...\" Makoto laughs too \"Glad you're comfy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah that was a complement.\" You said relaxing as you smiled a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What have we here~?\" she bats away the toy and spots you \"Gotcha, mousey!\" She swipes you off the ground and holds you up.<br>\r\n\"Heh, that was almost too easy!\" she chuckles \"Now what? Do you want to play again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually.\" You said looking at Rei's face. \"Rules are for the game if the cat finds the mouse it eats it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Eat you?\" she asks \"...well, I am the cat, and you are the mouse, in this game, so... well, it's only fitting, isn't it?\" She chuckles playfully and opens her maw up.<br>\r\n\"In ya go, mousey~\" she slides you gently onto her tongue, sealing her lips up behind you. You hear a euphonious hum all around you as she enjoys your flavor. Seeking more of it, her tongue starts to dance underneath you, trying to roll and swish you around to get at every last inch of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lightly chuckle as you got tickled by Rei's tongue and smirked a little knowing she was enjoying the taste, which was odd for you to enjoy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm...\" she tilts her head back, letting you slide down into her gullet before she simply swallows you whole \"Ah... yummy mousey~\" She traces your bulge in her throat down until it disappears behind her chest. As her esophagus unceremoniously drops you into her stomach, you feel it shake and vibrate as she pats her tummy on the outside. There's some leftover rice from lunch surrounding you, but her belly is otherwise relatively empty.<br>\r\n\"Comfy, Tim?\" she asks \"I have to admit, I enjoyed you more than I thought I would!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I'm comfy oddly enough Rei, I think your stomach is more roomy aside from having been inside Usagi's but yeah I like it\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's not a compliment you get every day...\" she chuckles awkwardly and pats her tummy \"But, I'm glad you enjoy it! Just holler if you need me, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" You said. \"By the way Rei, are you and the other girls going to do anything else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUh, that depends how the day goes, but otherwise, I don't think we had anything else planned besides the usual talks we have...\" Rei scratches her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see, well I did tell Usagi that I would have to be in one of your bellies if you all had to go out and fight.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I don't see why you couldn't just stick around at home, but I guess there's no harm in it...\" she shrugs and heads back for the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou  waited a little bit before saying something else to Rei, and heard commotion outside her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Rei! You're just in time,\" you hear Ami say \"Look what's on the news!\" Rei looks at the TV and gasps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodness! We oughta go help,\" she pats her tummy \"Well Tim, looks like you're in for a rough ride already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...You ate him?\" Ami asks, bewildered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah...\" Rei chuckles \"Kinda comes with the cat-and-mouse game... y'know, cat eats the mouse...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, make sense,\" Ami shrugs, then pokes Rei's belly \"Tim, do you think you'll be okay in there while we go off to fight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be fine yes.\" You said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then,\" Ami shrugs, as does Rei \"Let's go!\" The sailor scouts rush out of Usagi's house to the scene of the ensuing debacle. As Rei runs, you bounce around her shifting, shaking belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wait it out as you relaxed the best you could inside Rei's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ensuing fight takes about a half-hour before it's all over. Once they head back for home, Rei pats her belly.<br>\r\n\"Ah, are you alright in there, Tim?\" she asks \"Hope that wasn't too rough for you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it was kind of fun odd enough getting tossed around in here.\" You said hugging the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Well, I'm glad to hear that...\" Rei pats her tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a strange guy,\" Ami chuckles \"Not only does he like being eaten, he likes getting tossed around while he's at it! I'd almost say he's got a penchant for being food... Tim, did you get eaten like this back in your homeworld?\" She bends down and pokes Rei's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm no that's never happened, this is a first really.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No? Well, that only makes things even stranger...\" Ami shrugs \"Ah well, I suppose we'd better head home for the evening. I guess you'll have no problem sleeping in Rei's tummy, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Rei blushed \"Um... well, I guess that's no problem for me, but... wow, that's weird...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? Would you prefer he sleep in mine, instead?\" Ami patted her own belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean... if he wants to?\" Rei looked down \"Which do you prefer, Tim?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Usagi does want to see if you all like me in your tummies so.....I'll go with you Ami.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, well, guess I oughta let you out...\" Rei shrugs \"Alright Ami, guess you're coming home with me. Usagi, care to join us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure! I don't have anything else to do!\" Usagi skips over to the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides your homework?\" Luna mumbles quietly, following behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou waited as you sat in Rei's belly wondering if things well be okay later on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlright, so...\" Rei pats her tummy as they arrive at her house \"...how is he, uh... getting out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're gonna have to spit him up,\" Usagi slips off her shoes \"Go and lie down somewhere with a napkin so he can crawl up your throat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, okay,\" Rei sighs calmly \"Thought I'd have to gag myself...\" She heads for the bathroom and acquires a paper towel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Tim, c'mon up,\" she lies down flat in her empty tub and opens her mouth over the towel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make your way up and out of Rei's body and get onto the towel, you then looked around as you then looked up at her. \"That was nice.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei clears her throat and sits up.<br>\r\n\"Glad you enjoyed it...\" she lifts you up in the towel and offers you to Ami \"Here ya go... wash him off first...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Righty-o!\" Ami happily accepts you and brings you over to the sink while Rei hops out of the tub. She turns on the sink, creating a moderate stream of warm water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready to be washed off, Tim?\" Ami asks with a cheery smile \"I'll be nice and quick with it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod. \"Yes I'm ready to be cleaned Ami.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Very short I know, but this was how much Rei had time to shine in the rp I'm doing for the stories, go back and pick Ami's part)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Who said that?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In your belly.\" You said hoping she heard you or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, okay, that\u2019s enough messing around,\" Chibiusa stands up and looks around \"Who are you? Are you in the closet or something?\" She starts walking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chibi\u2026\" Ami covers her mouth as she laughs \"He\u2019s not lying. He\u2019s really in your stomach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! When did you get in there?!\" Chibi pats her tummy and stares at it for a bit \"You better not be plotting anything! I\u2019ll drink a hot chocolate if you are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa feisty little one.\" You said with a chuckle. \"I was in your snack bag.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And just what were you doing in there?\" Chibi pats her tummy again, sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, Chibi,\" Rei nods \"We put him there. It was just a little prank.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's very funny,\" Chibi looks up at Rei, not amused \"So he's just in there, now? Is he even going to be okay? Am I going to get sick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a worry-wart,\" Ami laughs \"Hard to believe your Usagi's kid! You'll be fine. He's indigestible, and clean. He doesn't mind, either. Isn't that right, Tim?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, I don't mind at all, even if it took a good while to get used to the idea.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... you sure?\" Chibi asks \"What kind of person doesn't mind being eaten?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That kind!\" Ami pokes Chibi's tummy, much to the latter's chagrin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Time? Is he related to anything like the Silver Crystal?\" Chibi continues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Far as we know, no,\" Usagi shakes her head \"He just appeared in my house, that small. Luna found him first, and since then, we've...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've found out he quite likes to be eaten,\" Rei adds \"And apparently, he's from a dimension where we, and our adventures and stuff, are all an anime to him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An anime?!\" Chibi asks \"Where's the camera?\" She starts looking around the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silly, you don't film an anime,\" Ami chuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's right,.\" You said. \"Think of it like a cartoon you would watch ChibiUsa, and you were pulled into that certain cartoon and you told them the same they'll be confused like how everyone here was until it gets to a understanding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you put it that way, then...\" Chibiusa scratches her head \"Well, it doesn't matter. You're here now, and I don't know about sending you back to your homeworld. Besides...\" She pats her tummy.<br>\r\n\"I think I rather like having you in there,\" she smiles softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this has been quite a day,\" Usagi stands up and yawns \"I think I've had enough studying for one day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Much as I'd make fun of you,\" Ami checks her watch \"It is getting late. We oughta head home for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then,\" Rei shuts her notebook \"Thanks for coming, guys!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you tomorrow~\" Usagi packs her stuff up and heads for the door, with Chibi and Ami following suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled a bit  as you heard what Chibiusa said as you got comfy and snuggled against her stomach wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm, this is gonna take some getting used to,\" Chibi patted her tummy as they walked down the sidewalk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm? Yeah, he's just getting comfortable,\" Usagi shrugged. In time, they arrived at their house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how long were you planning on staying in there?\" Chibiusa asks as she gets settled into her bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, well Ami did say that I'll have to stick around in here for a bit when it comes to fights, but I think at the next group up you can let me out so I can go to Makoto or Minako.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The next group-up?\" Chibi raises an eyebrow \"So... you know that means you'll be in there until tomorrow afternoon, maybe evening... right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, not like he's got anywhere else to be...\" Luna jumps up on Chibi's bed and gets comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I know, I'm sure your stomach wouldn't mind some company for the whole day.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean...\" Chibiusa shrugs \"Well, alright then. As long as you behave yourself, okay?\" She smiles and proceeds to change into her pajamas. \"Ah...\" she slides under her covers and gets comfortable \"Well, good night, Tim.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night Chibiusa.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spend a restful night inside of Chibiusa's stomach. In the morning, you awaken to the sound of her showering. After finishing, you hear her brush her teeth for a few minutes and exit the bathroom. Your surroundings tremble as she pats her tummy from the outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You awake in there, Time?\" you hear her ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I'm awake Chibiusa, did you sleep well last night?\" You asked nuzzling the wall of her belly. \"I slept peacefully in here I can tell you that much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I slept well, thanks,\" she nods \"Still a bit weird to carry you around like this, but... well, it's also nice, in a way. I don't have time for breakfast, so I'll just have a protein bar and some juice. Look out below, alright?\" She enters the kitchen to pour herself a glass of juice and opens the pantry to find a bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou moved to another part of chibiusa's belly to be out of the way so I wouldn't get hit with the protein bar and juice<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breakfast comes down momentarily, while you stay safely off to one side. Her tummy quakes as she pats it outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm heading to school now. Do you need anything before I go?\" she asks \"I can't talk to you while I'm out of the house, and... well, try not to move around too much, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take some of the food and eat. \"Hmm no I don't need anything else ChibiUsa\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alrighty then,\" she gives her belly one more pat before heading for the door \"I'm off!\" With that, she departs for school. She walks at a leisurely pace\u2014evidently not excited for classes\u2014, which makes your ride quite smooth and comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She makes her way home, but on the way, she's interrupted as someone taps her shoulder from behind.<br>\r\n\"Usagi?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No time to explain!\" Usagi runs ahead \"Follow us!\" You hear a few other girls run past Chibiusa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on tight, Tim,\" she pats her tummy, takes a breath, and dashes off to follow the girls to wherever they were headed. You hear some fighting outside, but you're too busy being shaken and jostled around inside Chibiusa to make out exactly what's happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got sloshed around as you could hear all of this going on, it didn't help much as her belly was small and tight as you made small bumps in her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fight subsides in time, the sailors recuperate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's that,\" Usagi dusts her hands \"Anyone wanna hang?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm down to relax for a bit,\" Minako says \"My place is free, if you guys wanna come.\" The sailors all more or less nod in agreement, and set off for Minako's house. Chibiusa rubs her tummy as she carries you along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I go to her next huh?\" You asked Chibiusa<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her, or Makoto,\" Chibi whispered \"Your choice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll save Minako for last.\"You said. \"Makoto can be next.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then,\" Chibi nods quietly and continues following the other sailor scouts. In time, you arrive at Minako's house. Everyone gets settled in the living room, except for Chibiusa, who heads for the bathroom. \"Ready to come out?\" she asks quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm ready to come out.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChibi lies prone in the bathtub and taps her tummy.<br>\r\n\"Alright, crawl up when you're ready,\" she says, bracing herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start climbing up to Chibi Usa's throat as you go inside it and kept climbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as you arrive in her mouth, she spits you into her palm and stands back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eugh... I imagine you'd taste better going down,\" she shakes her head \"Anyway, let's clean you up...\" She heads over to the sink and washes you off. \"Alright... so, how would you like to introduce yourself?\" she asks as she dries you off \"I imagine you didn't surprise Usagi or the other girls, like you did me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's a long story really.\" You said. \"I'll just show myself to Makoto and knowing her, she'll see me as one of her old boyfriend's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Go back to the Makoto option.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
