You have been chosen to test out as many new lives as you want. All you have to do to find this place is open any door while willing the hallway to appear. You will notice that every door in this hallway has a name on it. Whichever door you go through, that is the person whose life you will take. Those around you will treat you as though you were that person. You will notice that the first door on the right has your own name. Although the other doors will be random, this door will always stay the same, in case you want to return to your own life. Remember, you are not the only one who has access to this hallway. Meeting someone else living another's life is unlikely, but you will be able to see each other as you really are. Take care, and have fun!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInteresting, you think. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor starters, in your real life, you are...</span></div></div>",

You\u2019re a thirteen year old girl who dreams of being a big Hollywood star. Your agent, Diana, had managed to get you on a new tv show on a kid\u2019s network. You had just finished filming all of your scenes for the first episode, and Diana was coming to congratulate you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile at her. \u201cThanks Mrs. Jones. You were a big help!\u201d Somehow, that just felt like what you were supposed to say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana hugged you, then turned to leave. \u201cI have other work to do, honey, but I\u2019ll talk to you again soon. Say hi to your mom for me!\u201d And with that, she went on her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you\u2019re an actress on a tween sitcom now. Do you decide to stay in this life for a while, look for a new one, or go back to being plain old Jess Randolph.</span></div></div>",
