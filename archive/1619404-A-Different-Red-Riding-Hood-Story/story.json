She could smell fresh bread and cooked meat.  \"I went for a walk,\" Red said briskly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've been gone all afternoon!\" her mother scolded.  \"The washing needs to be done, and the garden needs tending.  You don't have time for walks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed glared at her as she reached the steps.  \"I'm sorry,\" she said, but she didn't sound sorry at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No husband will ever want a woman that disappears for afternoons when the chickens need feeding, and the clothes need mending.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll make up the lost time tomorrow, where is Pa?\" she asked, deciding that changing the subject would be best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Out hunting, he should be back soon,\" her mother turned away from her to glance out the window, worry spread across her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed's heart sank a little.  \"Out hunting deer?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" her mother said quietly.  \"The wolves, they stole some of the O'Connor's sheep last night, and you know how upset your father is about how they killed your Grandmother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told him, it wasn't the wolves, the old bat probably died of a heart attack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You haven't been talking to them again have you?\" her mom asked sharply and grabbing her by the shoulders.  \"You know your father has forbidden it!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed struggled to get free.  \"No! I haven't!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mom dropped her grip, but Red could see that she was inspecting her cloak for any signs of wolf hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to bed,\" she said, turning away from the sharp woman's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't forget to wash,\" her mother said absentmindedly staring into the tree's, searching for her father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed washed her hands and face and changed into her night dress before climbing into bed.  Her little brother was already asleep in the small bed next to her, his warm body curled up in a ball.  His soft snoring filled the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed closed her eyes, wondering where life may take her.  Will her father return soon?  Should she run away?  What will tomorrow bring?</span></div></div>",

Two days had passes since their departure from home and one night since they were wed and Red never thought what it would be like to wake up next to such a furry man, but after her wedding night came, she never wanted to think about another person ever again.  Wolf was of similar mind.  Though his wife was \"fragile\" compared to those in his old pack, he didn't care.  Her intelligence, genuine care and affection  surpassed anything on a merely physical level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow he slowly opened his eyes to see the lush red hair before him.  He took in his wife's scent and cherished it.  But then he heard a giggle from a face in his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's funny Red?\" Wolf asked quietly.  Red pulled her head away from her husband's furry chest and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I was just thinking of our wedding last night,\" Red replied, \"Did you ever think a dwarf and a troll could be so accommodating?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Wolf replied, \"And our priest was of good humor as well, considering he was blind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it's not like he cared what we were, just that we were truly in love with each other,\" Red said.  She took a deep breath.  \"So same plan as before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, we head to some land far far away where we can live together in peace,\" Wolf replied, \"So let's get ready.\"  Red nodded and left her husband's embrace and dressed in her red clothing.  She paused as she pulled the cloak on, remembering her mother had made this for her, her last birthday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish they could have accepted us and let us be,\" she muttered, before looking back to the man she would never be with out.</span></div></div>",

Also, as part of the agreement, the village hunters wouldn't go after the wolfmen, as the village called them, as they seemed to be half man/woman and half wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuposedly, the agreement had been made because of the fact that, at the time, there was a large group of bandits that threatened both the Pack and the village, until the two groups decided to work together to ensure their own survival. This agreement had been made when Jason's father was the mayor, and the father of the current leader, Blackfur, was the leader of the pack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Jason hated the agreement. He wanted to get rid of it, as he felt that the Pack were nothing more than animals that could walk on two legs and speak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, everytime that he tried to put it on the table with the council, which was comprised of the head of each family, someone would say, \"The Pack prevents groups of bandits from entering and establishing themselves in the surrounding woods. If we get rid of the treaty that we have with them, or decide to fight them, some group of bandits will move in, and next thing you know, you'll wake up with your throat cut, your wife and children kidnapped, and your livestock stolen. Also, the Pack has never broken their promise with us, so why should we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, despite their own dislike of the Pack, this would cause the rest of the families to vote against his idea. This is why he only brought it up on occassion. After all, he didn't want to lose his position as mayor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now though, he and every other hunter had but one mission, find the two and bring them back. He had told the others that Wolf had kidnapped his daughter and taken her from the woods. There was no way that he would have a wolfman as a son-in-law.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, one of the men said, \"Mayor, there is someone up ahead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is it?\" Jason asked, as he looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems to be a messanger,\" said the man. \"And by his outfit he must be from...</span></div></div>",

He looked to his men.  \"You and you come with me.  The rest of you get tracking my daughter.\"  The hunters nodded and Jason led the two men with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short time later the trio came to a large open field with two stumps in the middle.  It was here the alliance was first made and like his father before him, Jason saw the leader of the pack, a tall strong wolfman with black fur on his hands, feet and tail, waiting for him with two guards as well.  The leader snarled slightly as Jason approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's my son, human?\" Blackfur asked, once  Jason had sat on the stump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was going to ask where my daughter is, considering your son of a bitch kidnapped her,\" Jason replied acidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My mate is no bitch and your daughter is a harlet,\" Blackfur replied.

I want to know where my son is and why he is with that, \" Blackfur replied, but caught his tongue, \"Daughter of yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know where they are.  We were just to look in the woods for them,\" Jason replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already have my hunters looking for them as well,\" Blackfur replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And commands did you give them?\" Jason asked darkly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To find and bring back my son,\" Blackfur answered, \"Your daughter could be left where ever she was.  And what were your orders?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To find and bring back both, so I could put try your son for kidnapping my daughter,\" Jason replied, \"And he'll probably end up hung for the crime.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlackfur stood up quickly and snalred at the human, who did not flinch at the sight.</span></div></div>",

Kursch stepped from the crowd, small puffs of smoke escaping his mouth as he smoked a pipe. He was the tallest among all the men, with arms the size of tree trunks. Not only was he the only man there to have ever served in a militant force, but he held the most human lives under his belt. He was therefore respected and feared for his experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you saying?\" piped a voice from silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I am saying is that we have only found the wolf boy's tracks, but he has Red with him now, doesn't he?\" His question was yet again met with a silence. \"Don't think wolves move as slow as humans. He's probably carrying her away right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's right,\" came a more calm voice from the crowd, \"Chances are, they'll be in the next land by the end of tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one asked you, Kai.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold your tongue, Trevor,\" snapped Kursch, and the man sank back into the shadows. \"It is true that their probable destination is the land beyond the Kingdom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caused a mutter to arise from the tense crowd. \"How would they get past the knights? He is a wolf after all.\"<br>\r\n\"Don't forget, he has a human with him, and a woman at that. They could slip by right under their noses.\"<br>\r\n\"We cannot go that far! We are only villagers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And by villagers do you also mean cowards?\" Kursch shot a fierce glare at the crowd of men almost all of whom backed away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are already well beyond the boundary of our village!\" protested one of the men. \"We're in danger as it is and we have families,\" his final words filled with sorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKursch's face seemed to twist with anger, his fists clenched tight and his eyes slowly closed. Everyone was in fear of what this hulk was about to do, but he drew in a breath and released it with a sigh. The anger from his face melted away and his fists unclenched. His eyes opened and a smile spread across his face. \"Yes, you have families.\" Kursch chuckled to himself, shaking his head as if ashamed. With that he turned around and started to walk into the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you going?\" called one of the men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where do you think?\" replied Kursch. \"Those two aren't getting any closer to us than we are to them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne again the party was left in silence as they watched Kursch's silhouette disappear into the shadows. The striking of flint against stone and the hiss of a torch being lit caught the attention of everyone. Kai's torch was burning brightly as he stepped forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going too, outsider?\" spat another man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He'll kill someone if no one does,\" Kai replied and began to follow Kursch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it'll be you if don't keep your trap shut!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother man left the crowd to follow Kai, and the other man burst out laughing. \"You going too, ya drunkard?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell you what, Toomey, If you don't pipe down right now I'll break your jaw when I get back,\" the man smiled while shaking a fist at Toomey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If he goes, then I should go.\" Yet another man parted and followed the trio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They'll probably need help, right?\" said Trevor, approaching Toomey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not you too,\" chuckled Toomey, \"I thought you'd be sharper than that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's face it, we'll never have this much fun in a long time and it'll be interesting to watch,\" Trevor said with a mischievous grin. With that he turned and raced down the path.<br>\r\n\"Wait up you idiots!\" called Toomey and followed Trevor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the men stood perplexed at what had happened. The sun was setting and a group of six men left to search for two runaways in a very dangerous part of the land. It seemed foolish to them, that a man such as Kursch would risk his life to bring two rebels to justice, and drag five other men to death along with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all turned their backs and left for the village, their thoughts telling them that that would be their last sight of the six men.</span></div></div>",

In exchange for not hunting them, and keeping the King's men away from them, the Pack would keep bandits from entering and setting up camp in the forest. Also, they left the better hunting areas alone for the humans to use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis agreement had been made when the Pack, after leaving their old home due to the King's men burning that forest down, had tried to settle down in their current home, and was attacked by bandits. Also, these bandits attacked a nearby human village. In order to ensure their groups' respective survival, the then leader of the village, the father of the current leader, Jason, and the previous leader of the Pack, Blackfur's father, had made their agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Blackfur hated the agreement. He felt that the humans were weak spineless cowereds who could only survive in their special caves that they called houses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, every time that he tried to bring it up to the Elders, which were the oldest members of each family in the Pack, one would say, \"The humans may be weak physically, and not as good at hunting as us, but they keep the King's men away from us. If we break the agreement, or decide to fight them, the King's men are sure to come and the next thing that you know, you will wake up, after being skinned alive, and your mate and cubs turned into pets and slaves. Besides, once a wolf gives someone their word, it is as sacred as Law, and the humans haven't broken theirs, so why should we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, this would cause the Elders to tell him to not break the word of his father, or HE would be removed as the leader of the Pack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the moment though, Blackfur and every other male wolf were in the forest, searching for Wolf and the human called Red. He had told them that Wolf had taken someone, other than his intended mate, to be his female, a crime that was punishable by having both parties being torn to pieces. He would not allow the human female to be his son's life mate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, one of the others said, \"Alpha, there is someone up ahead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is it?\" Blackfur asked, as he looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a messanger,\" the wolf said. \"And by the skins he wears he's from...</span></div></div>",

We ask that you bless these two and allow them to be joined together as a wedded couple.\u201d  When she was done speaking, It was as if the full force of silent as the pool of water began to glow green. \u201cThe spirits have spoken.  You are now joined for life.

Glancing down at his quary, Reed departed with a humorous, \"I'll be sure that mum gets the quilt back in one piece.\". He grinned as an amused scoff reached his ears, and he shut the door behind him, taking one last look at the woodsy cottage before he set on his way back into town. It was something of an inside joke, the last few words Reed gave his grandmother - his mum's mother hadn't been the least bit disheartened to see her own quilt being returned to her gravely injured, simply stating that it would give her a chance to finish what mistakes the tatterer had started to fix. The red head himself was surprised by the senior's reaction to the long gashes made in the hearty blanket, expecting some kind of sadness, or a gasp, or even a question of how it'd happened, only to get a small chuckle and a cookie to nibble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHumming to himself as he started down the icy path, crystals crunching under his boots, it took Reed all of three seconds to prepare himself for the annoyed roughness that he'd been half anticipating the whole visit. \"I'll be sure mum gets it back in one piece? Why don't you just admit that it was your lover who made those gashes and let her have some peace at night?\", the great figure bitterly asked, stalking out from under the evergreen he'd been crouched under, brushing some snow from his shoulder which he wanted no more than the branch that had deposited it there. His reaction filled the young man's cheeks with some not so subtle amusement, which quickly matured to laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, is the big bad wolf frightened of the kindly old grandmother becoming scared? That she'll bring out her shotgun and shoot the future furbag that damaged her hard work?\", he chuckled teasingly, ignoring the angry steps that were being made towards him, \"It's okay Meign, I'm sure that grandma has some idea of what did it, and she's not the kind to worry on that sort of stuff.\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man only recognized the instinct to run when the thick pelt of black blocked out the sight of the white mud path, and by the time he jerked back the black beast had already seized his pink jaw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I am, and if I've told you once Red, I've told you a thousand times, never refer to that story as it is with my race.\", Meign growled down, stepping in time with his retreating partner till they were surrounded by tree limps, rough bark under the human's back and limbs. The wolf leaned down with a leer as he paired his silver moons with the other's round shamrocks, their breath clouding up between them, sandwiching the clothed one with his hulking frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well haven't I told you to stop stalking me to my grandma's house, big wolf?\", the man talked back while quirking a brow, not affected in the least by the innate danger in his position, feeling the callousness of the paw still on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I suppose we've both not been listening, little man.\", came the reply, gleaming teeth revealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose not.\", Reed finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mutual annoyance on the pair was the same as two generals staring each other down, neither of the two even blinking lest it give their foe an advantage. Of course, it didn't last for long, more of a hoax than anything else; the human's features softened as his peepers were the first to be hidden by his lids, a smile slowly prevailing over the strict glare he'd put on, and he didn't need to look to know that Meign was doing the exact same thing. Reaching up to behind the shaggy head, Reed accepted the kiss whole heartedly as it was given, pale lips sliding over the black pair as they met, tongues lapping among one another in greeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few drops of saliva remained on the man's chin as their heads separated, the string between them falling to be lost in the snow. What had once been irritation was now comfort, and the expression one bearer wore complimented the other's without question, the wolf's paw cupping the exposed, red cheek as Reed started again, \"I missed you.\". There was happiness in those words, if loneliness as well, for the weeks they'd been forced to stay apart, of good times and bad missed together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe padded thumb ran over the soft skin as the wolf replied in kind, \"I missed you too.\", gently resting himself against his love's own, smaller form, the tree behind the clothed back relatively generous to the pair. Meign nuzzled the exposed ear as those mittened fingers stroked as well, warm jets from his wet nostrils warming the cool flesh in a way he knew was pleasant. He could just barely feel the human's own as the pointed rosy nose poked into his fur coating, taking in the slightly wet, woody scent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's cold out.\", the human stated simply, allowing the basket to fall to the drift, its contents protected by the wooden weave. The now free hand wrapped itself around the furred back, fingers brushing away errant ice crystals that had formed some night before in the tangled fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not.\", Meign replied, smiling despite himself, \"'Comes with the fur.\" That incited a similar look from his lifebound other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm clothed.\", Reed said, the human looking up with a subtle victory in his sights. The smile on his face widened when he realized he was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not for long you aren't.\", the wolf swiftly countered back before darting his head into the fluffy collar of the dark jacket, his partner laughing uncontrollably as he felt the velvety tongue run along his collar bone, lapping away at the delicate skin beneath all those cloths. The laughs died down as their source drew away again, both males kissing once more under the tree's cover before Meign drew himself to his full height before Reed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really missed you Red, more than any other time we've been apart.\", he told his furless mate, the indirect message in his words being read loud and clear by the one before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.\", was all that was said, and indeed all there needed to be said, as the mitten that had been on the wolf's head was placed on his paw, keeping the cool appendage where it was on the warm cheek.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>More warm blood rushed into Red\u2019s soft, rosy cheeks as a blush filled his face. Even in this blistering cold, Meign made him feel so warm and light, like a feather. His mitten covered hand kept the wolf\u2019s huge paw against his face, where it covered the whole side of his face. As cold as that rough, leathery appendage was, Reed liked the feel of it against his soft warm skin, especially as he looked at that rugged face, his eyes running up that muzzle and locking with Meign\u2019s. Those icy steel eyes, like gleaming gray moons, seemed to pull him in, the slightest hint of reflection visible on their glassy surface as clouds of hot breath wafted from their open mouths. Then that last few inches of open space vanished, and he pressed his soft pink lips against those rough black lupine lips, his tongue slipping out to playfully dart across that coarse and yet pleasant flesh. Then that rugged, wet wolf tongue burst free, wrestling with his soft human tongue. Like a small microcosm of their constant wrestling and mischievous banter, big, bulky wolf dominated soft, gentle human in the passionate embrace of tongues and the tender, loving lips pressing as tightly against each other as possible. When his tongue was finally let go and his lips broke away, a soft squeak of happiness escaped Reed\u2019s lips and a shudder of delight shook his whole body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGods, he was perfect. Everything about Meign reeked of masculinity. Quite literally, actually; the wolf\u2019s natural musk was rich with testosterone, the smell of pure wilderness, and, more often than not, male lust. His body was an eight and a half foot colossus of thick, black fur and coarse, leathery skin, the mixture of which was somehow soft and rugged at the same time. Those deep eyes were incredibly beautiful, and he loved the way they gleamed in the light like silver pools. Those lips, so perfectly rough and delicious, were a mysterious pleasure to explore with his fingers, his lips, his tongue every time they met. Those thick arms, rich with muscle and coursing with power, so often embracing him or pulling him closer or tracing across his soft, milk-white flesh, occasionally raking scrapes with those strong feral claws of his. That broad, bulky chest, equally rippling with muscle under that soft yet rugged black coat, so warm and comfortable; he remembered many afternoons with his head resting on the vast plain of ebony pelt, listening to the wolf\u2019s powerful heartbeat. And of course... that thick, engorged sheath he had, on occasion, grown so familiar with. Even now he could see a bit of pink wolfhood peaking forth from the furry black cover, and he knew that he was about to get very familiar with that part of Meign again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReed\u2019s emerald eyes flickered up to meet those beautiful silver spheres again, and a soft smile split his lips. He whispered quietly, \u201cYou are so heavenly... Gods, I really missed you, Meign.\u201d His blush deepened. \u201cLet\u2019s go off of the path and find somewhere private.\u201d Or at least a little further away from right outside my grandmother\u2019s house, he thought, hoping like crazy that Grandma had not looked out the window anytime in the last few minutes... or had it been hours? Time was meaningless around Meign. He could spend a hundred years just admiring his marble-sculpted figure and not get bored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat familiar, throaty, gravelly chuckle rumbled forth, and those great burly arms all but scooped him up. \u201cI knew I liked you for a reason, human,\u201d Meign responded with a playful, impish tease, embracing Reed\u2019s tender little hand with this thick burly wolf paw. He led his human lover away from the cottage and into the woods. Even as the smaller of the two scooped up his basket with his free hand and stumbled after him, the wolf was thinking of secluded little spaces they could sneak off to. Not too close to Reed\u2019s village or other forest cottages for humans, but not close to any wolf dens or caves either; they couldn\u2019t risk being found by members of either race, because of the hatred between the two species.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d Reed asked with a curious glance around. As much as he knew these woods, there were still places he\u2019d never been, while Meign had spent his whole life in these French forests, exploring the land and living on it. \u201cNot far,\u201d was his only response, and the human accepted it, knowing after all these months of running around that he could trust the wolf with his life. It was hard to believe that they\u2019d only known each other that long; it only seemed like yesterday when he\u2019d twisted his ankle in the forest and the wolf had found him. He\u2019d feared for his live, imagining a slow death of being eaten alive or tortured by such a savage and cruel beast, but received kindness instead. They met a few weeks later when he\u2019d recovered enough to really walk on his own, and it had been pretty awkward at first, mostly small talk. Reed would never have believed it if anyone told him he\u2019d be secretly courting a wolf when he and his mother came to this village, he\u2019d laugh them off and think they were the village loon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis train of thought was interrupted as water cascaded over him, drenching him from head to toe. He spluttered for breath, taking a few deep gasps as the sound of Meign laughing at him filled his ears. He tossed him an angry look for a moment, then he looked around. They were in some kind of cave, just behind a waterfall. He had to hand it to the wolf; he knew plenty of places to hide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShivering in his cold and now drenched clothes, the human\u2019s teeth chattered as he tried to warm himself up. Meign\u2019s blasted laughter continued, and then the wolf spoke.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Content that his request was being acknowledged, Miegn backed out from the embrace the evergreen had provided for him and his lover, the human following like he'd been before, keeping the paw on the rosy cheek till both were out and in the open again, not even pausing while he retrieved his basket from the snow covered roots. Even then, Reed was reluctant to release the weathered appendage from his grasp, the black pads held firmly in the red knitted garment, though he eventually complied and released it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing as he took a step down the beaten path, the man was surprised as he felt a tug on his sleeve, looking up to the canine to see what was wrong. Meign's smile was more than enough explanation, and the human's face split into an apologetic smile, though he went on with a, \"Sorry, I wasn't thinking there.\", not going any farther when he caught onto the slight shake of the other's head. Settling with a cold induced blush, Reed changed his path and fell into step with the wolf of the woods, taking a path through the trees and ferns that no man had plotted before. Suppressing a giggle as he felt soft needles brush against his face, Reed didn't have any warning before a patch of snow was tossed his way, and though it struck his face without much force, it left a beard that was chilly to the touch. \"Meign, you're starting something that you shouldn't be...\", he warned with a raised brow, getting a matching peak of snow atop his head as a response. \"En garde, monsieur lupine!\", the man cried playfully, grinning even as he protected himself from the newest swipe of snow sent to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next half hour was spent much more lightly than their initial greeting had been, the wolf bounding from snow drift to snow drift, lifting and tossing unpacked snow to his lover's exposed face, while the man in red boots packed as fast as he could, and laughed as his efforts either hit a humorous spot or missed by a mile. Meign had only paused when he saw the stutter over taking the frosty jaw, and allowed himself to be hit as the play drew to a close, though by no means was it any less fun for the pair. Winter's cold was slowly banished from the pale lips by the wide tongue, and the white that would otherwise hide such a proud chin was brushed away by the smaller one's practiced methods. After a brief embrace, more to signify the truce than to bring any further romance to the moment, Reed picked up his basket, wolf retrieved the wallet that had slipped from the other's pocket, and the pair set out once more. At times, Meign would slouch down and walk on all fours, lumbering like a great bear or some other kind of beast, which brought more than a few the locals' stories to the young man's mind. Meign's eyes asked why his love snickered when there was nothing to be laughed at, though nothing parted his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lupine briefly led the boy off course for a bit, trying not to be obvious about the misdirection, letting out a mighty bark to scare up the quail in the trees, the air fluttering with frightened birds and a quiet admiration. After that it was the frozen maple that would fall come spring, a natural leaning Pisa that wasn't in Italy, mud frozen beneath their feet. By the time they reached the wide river, however, Meign knew he'd gone too far, and that his love was aware of where they'd been headed. Before the wolf could make an apology, however, a pair of arms wrapped around his chest, and a, \"Thank you\", was mumbled into it, confusing the canine with the conflicting conundrum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNevertheless, the pair started back, the wolf sheepish and the human red, following the river as another subtle way to make time pass them by slower. It seemed to work for a while, and as the freezing rapids rushed beside them, down the bank, Reed picked up on a few conversation points he'd so curiously been withholding till then - what Meign had been eating, what he did when he wasn't hunting or resting, or even if the wolf had a place to go at night - getting mostly blunt answers that did little to warm his heart. Strained as it was, though, the human knew how things were going to be, between him and his wolf, and he honestly couldn't have asked for anything to change between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least two hours after the pair had left grandma's house, on what should have been a fifteen minute walk, the triangle shaped house hold came into sight, the metal fence gently pushed apart by the willow that had grown through it long since before the previous owners had left. Taking the moment to give the wolf one last kiss goodbye, which was extended a great deal when he was pressed against the smooth bark, and those paws ran around to \"check for injuries\", Reed quietly slipped into his yard, silently watching Meign pad away, alone. When the wolf was out of sight, Reed finally unlocked the door, and slid through the doorway. Listening carefully, he heard a pair of voices he'd had rather not heard, their words spoiling what good mood the canine had instilled in the human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Diae, why won't you come with me to dinner tomorrow night? Reed's old enough to take care of himself for one evening, and we haven't been out in a good few weeks.\", came the deep voice connected to the \"local lumberjack\", trying to coax Reed's mother out for the hundredth time that day, or so it'd seemed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, Leon, I know my son well, enough that I'm sure that he could care for himself if he needed to, but I'm just wanting to try and eat somewhere other than these fancy places we keep going to. I'd like to try something more down to earth...\", his mother assured, trying placate the obviously irritated wood cutter, her Irish accent very well hidden by her years in the town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll that Reed could do to contribute was sigh to himself, keeping himself quiet so as not to spoil the argument; no matter how much he thought of the man, Reed just couldn't see Leon as anything other than too blunt for his mother, and yet the pair continued to see each other. 'And he's too light footed for his own good, rushing around back like he did last week...', the teen thought to himself, setting the basket back down onto the floor.</span></div></div>",

Be it a frying pan, a bowl of fruit, or even the oven door, Reed just wasn't able bodied enough to keep himself from catching something in the worst way possible towards the concept of stealth, each item making a protest that belied his presence. Therefore, it was no surprise to the boy that, when he managed to make his way though the admittedly cramped space, his mother was looking at him like an important lifeline in a gameshow, a person to be called upon in a time of need for some fact or another. The red haired lad was more annoyed at the analogy than the truth behind it, really, considering who it was that she needed saving from. Even if she was the one who'd brought it upon herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello honey. How did things go with grandma?\", she welcomed warmly, her eyes betraying her confusion towards the extended time, in a way that her wavy hair just couldn't alter. Though he didn't say anything, the built man beside the widow raised his hand in a short wave to the lad in greeting, which the recipient reluctantly returned from the doorway. \"Um, just, fine mum, just fine. Stayed for a while and talked about a few things, you know.\", he shrugged to the ginger woman, his explanation oblique so as to leave out the truly dicier details, \"Her hip was acting up a bit, but nothing else has really happened worthy of regret.\". As he spoke, Reed edge towards the stairs with the basket in hand, shifting the wooden handle as the cold was slowly replaced in his palm, but the weight reminded the boy of the promise he'd made during the packing of such an item. Holding back the guttural groan that threatened to break face, the teen drew close to the couple at the couch to set the basket down, flipping up the wicker lid in order to sift through the folds of cloth as the others were pulled in a tad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She made a few things that she wanted us to have, actually,\", he continued, lifting up a fold to reveal the scented candle, \"Like this, and that.\", he continued as various things were removed from the article of cloth. As the number of small items, such as a repaired scarf and a carefully wrapped pie, were removed, Diae frowned at her boy, and took a tissue to wipe away at his chin, cool spittle remaining from the lover's last kiss together that day, though she was - apparently - unaware of what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reed, what took you so long in getting back? Grandma didn't keep you for so long, did she?\", she asked, concern washing over her features like a wave. The teen pulled back a tad late for her liking, and the red haired youth knew that he couldn't brush it off easily. However, that didn't mean that he needed to reveal <i>everything</i>...</span></div></div>",

That was a whole batch of secrets he didn't want getting out any time soon. Luckily, he had a fallback he'd thought of beforehand; it was important to have an alibi when you're secretly courting a creature of the woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... Well, I ran into a friend I haven't seen in a while, and I guess I just lost track of time. Sorry, mum...\" He muttered, putting on a sad face as he looked at her. Man, if Meign could see him now, he'd probably make some joke about him trying to look so cute and innocent. He could practically hear the wolf's deep-throated, gravelly chuckle in his head; there'd be a few teasing comments, and he'd shove his lover right in that bulky, furry, handsome chest of his. They'd start wrestling and roll around in the fresh snow, batches of icy white clumping to their bodies as they grunted and growled and tossed teases and comments back and forth. And finally, they'd roll to a stop, right under the thick trunk of a huge oak, and he'd look into those deep, luminous, icy silver orbs and lean in, their hot breaths fogging up and forming clouds that melted away into the winter air. Their lips would get closer and his cheeks would flush with hot blood and red color; maybe Meign would blush too (it was almost impossible to tell under that thick black fur of his). He could almost taste those warm, almost leather-like black lips against his soft, pinkish lips as Meign's rough, padded hands would slip down the back of his pants and-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe snapped out of his daydream and back to reality, blinking as he looked back to his mother, who looked just as confused as he was disappointed that his daydream wasn't real right now. He put his innocent face back on and smiled sweetly. \u201cUh, sorry, mum, I was just thinking of something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI asked you who you were with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, um, it was, uh, Thomas Candle. You know, the baker\u2019s son? We met when I was on my way home and he was out collecting firewood. I stopped and helped him with the chopping and carrying it back.\u201d Thank the gods for a quick wit. Luckily, he\u2019d covered for Thomas sneaking off with the mayor\u2019s daughter for a very obvious roll in the hay, so he could call in this favor to cover his tracks. \u201cUm, in fact, I\u2019m actually a little tired. I\u2019m just going to go to my bed and get some rest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled away from his mother and walked off to his room, leaving the basket for the two of them. As much as he loved his mother, he really wanted to have some privacy at the moment, and he was actually quite tired from all that playing. Meign might be huge and... incredibly masculine, but damned if that wolf didn\u2019t have the energy and mischievous playfulness of a puppy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked away, his mind tuned out their voices as his mother and Leon. He walked through the kitchen and climbed the ladder in the short alcove between the kitchen and his mother\u2019s bedroom. He took off his red coat, folding it and affectionately setting it down on a small table beside a half-spent candle and a small bag of coins. It was the only thing he had from his father, who died a few years ago, before they even lived in this village. He remembered warm summer days spent hunting together and cool autumn evenings where he would be taught how to navigate by the stars or which berries were okay to eat. In fact, most of what Reed knew, he\u2019d learned from his dad. The hooded crimson cloak was a gift on his twelfth birthday, shortly before that terrible fire, and it had been made a bit bigger by his dear mother from time to time to suit his growing body. At seventeen, Reed was starting to look much like his father, and he wondered whether he was going to grow that beard that he remembered so well. His mind occasionally wandered to what his dad would think of him and Meign. He didn\u2019t know what his mother would think, either, but he definitely knew what kind of reaction the rest of the village would have. All those stories he teased Meign about, all that hate circulating around the differences and hatred between the wolves and the humans...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed and gently patted the coat. \u201cI miss ya, dad...\u201d He collapsed on his bed, a huge pile of straw, and looked out the small crack in the ceiling at the sky as it began its slow change from a hue of warm bursts of reds and yellows and purples to a white-speckled sheet of deep, dark blue. And as Reed closed his eyes and slowly drifted into the warm embrace of sleep, he wondered where Meign was at that very moment, and whether he was thinking of him...</span></div></div>",

Unlike our southernly cousins, we northerners take trespassing very seriously.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spirit bowed to his level, frowning at him. She seemed displeased with the state of affairs; he didn't satisfy her taste of rebel, perhaps. But, she continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found you, luckily. A life worth saving, I hope. But, the other...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, the nymph's personality changed entirely. She sunk to her knees, begging and pleading with him! Her eyes welled with sap tears, yellow and thick like honey. Those leaves that crowned her shivered, threatening to wither up and die completely!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, oh please, sir, don't follow this course! I beseech you, never search for your companion again. The Northern Woods have no tolerance for lovers like you. She is one of their own--!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slapped her hand over her mouth, exciting Wolfgang! One of their own? So Isa, she belonged to the North Woods? Not for long!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, good sir, I know you intend to chase after her and rescue her, but it'd would most unmistakably be in your best interests to stop this!\"</span></div></div>",

He was shocked to see there was no camp or fire, or even a hunter for that matter. Instead Icefen found in the center of the clearing, the origin of the scent, a small basket, seeming to overfill with some red cloth as it moved. As he approached the basket slowly, he found inside a small pink creature that he recognized from spying on the village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A baby? What are you doing here?\" The wolf growled as he went on all four and leaned into the basic for a closer look at the infant.

Her mother, who had been a witch employed in the king's court, had taught her much about magic, where her Father, a famous beast hunter, taught her how to hunt and tame beasts. With both skill sets, she was one of the best in the beast hunting business, and had quickly made a name for her self. Currently Red was standing in the former town of Tryleaf, a small farming town. All that had been left where several burned homes, and a few slightly scorched sites scatted here and there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed had come here hoping to find clues on where the dragon had gone, or if  it whas still in the imidiat area, but so far she hadent come across  more than a few burned bodies which she buried, sighing, Red saw no point in contiuning to search. It was obvious she wouldn't find any clues here.

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">We have all read Red Riding Hood, girl goes through the woods to go to grandmother's house, meets the Big Bad Wolf, who tells her to take a longer route while he gets to grandma's first, eats her, pretends to be her, tries to trick Red, tries to eat her, only for some woodsman to save her, and grandma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, what if things really didn't happen that way. What if in actuality Red and Wolf were really friends, or even lovers. What if gender roles were reversed? What if they were of the same gender (gay/lesbian here)? Heck, what if the species was really the other way around, with Red being a wolf and Wolf being a human. What if it was a mixture of these other things? Either way, this won't be the same story that you read as a child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere are the rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Sex is allowed, but try to limit it to casual, gay/lesbian or straight, it doesn't matter. If it gets too explicit, it gets deleted. So try to stick with casual, or leave it up to the reader's imagination.<br>\r\n*Note, there is going to be an \"E\" section for when they are just childhood friends, so no underage activity guys.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. The person who is a wolf is to be an anthro, be it Wolf or Red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. The person who is a wolf is not allowed to eat the one who is a human, so no vore, soft, hard, or otherwise. In fact, they cannot seriously harm the other, except for maybe a slap or two when one of them says something inappropriate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. Red doesn't have to visit grandma, as that could just be an excuse for Red to go see Wolf, as Red's parents may not want the two of them to be friends/lovers. *Note, this could be the same for Wolf too, so that they could meet without raising suspicion. (Forbidden friendship/love perhaps)*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. Setting must be in the woods, or in a clearing in the woods, or along the path through the woods, at least during the first chapter of your story. After that, you can take them anyplace that you want. They can even leave the forest behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. Like I said earlier, things can be a combination of differences, and things can even crossover into another category. For instance, your lovers could become married within a few chapters after running away from the forest or something. However, they are all to have one thing in common, Red and Wolf are friends, you chose the level of friendship, like if they are just friends, Boy/girlfriend, Boy/boyfriend, Girl/girlfriend, lovers, married, whatever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHave fun making your own version of the Red Riding Hood story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, a little something for you to check out.
