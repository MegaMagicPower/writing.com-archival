trap his soul in something said oynixia <br>\r\ntrue but how will that help in keeping him obedient said sintharia<br>\r\nsimple if there is one thing he has is the fact he needs to survive so he won`t risk his soul being destroyed said oynixia <br>\r\ntrue but who here can do that said blackwing <br>\r\ni could said oynixia <br>\r\nthen it is settled said sintharia <br>\r\njust as they said it rex appeared dropped the huge carcass and went up to his cage to rest but he sensed a threat and dodged it he looked confused at this and looked with confusion at his master with the agony he usually had during conflict here she just looked back at him but his eyes then changed to sheer determination to live oynixia also saw this and laughed at this rex`s eyes were now full of hate he saw the thing attacking him it was blackwing he immediently took form as blackwing missed once he received a big amount of blows from rex oynixia was in shock at this blackwing charged again just to get hit down but it showed fatigue on rex and a few more blows and he would be shattered blackwing hit him with his tail rex went onto the floor blackwing thought he would be beat but rex just got up and continued his wave of attacks finally knocking blackwing against the wall sintharia remembered how others had sheer determination and they would survive this he was about to fly off but his wings were damaged so he could not fly he just came back down and limped over to sintharia in the utter agony and fainted next to her <br>\r\ntime to finish you maggot said blackwing charging he got up instantly and bashed him against the wall he was going to charge him when his mind became full of agony he limped back to sintharia and fainted again with no signs of agony <br>\r\ni think i know what causes him agony said sintharia<br>\r\nwhat said oynixia<br>\r\ni think it is this area and being away from his master said sintharia<br>\r\nhe looked up at her and sent her a dream it was seeing deathwing kill his brothers <br>\r\ni think it was deathwing killing his brothers he must be thinking that as well has increased said sintharia <br>\r\nwell what is happening now said oynixia <br>\r\nrex was going human he still was not conscious oynixia looked at him in disgust a staff appeared in his hand and he gained some energy and got up from this height his master was even more terrifying he jumped back and went and drew a sword in caution but when he did agony went on him again he crawled towards in pain and recovered a bit of strength  <br>\r\nwhat is doing this rex said sintharia <br>\r\nhe blasted a bit of magic at the shard in oynixia`s hand and destroyed it his mind had recovered and he went back to his cage <br>\r\nwell that was odd said oynixia <br>\r\nwhat was said sintharia <br>\r\nthat he became human and that you actually tried to comfort him said oynixia <br>\r\nwell he is half decent at his jobs and the fact that the shard was taking his energy kind of seemed unfair <br>\r\nwhat is happening to me thought rex as he tossed his head about <br>\r\nwhat if i can`t kill these guys  i would be branded a traitor to either side i fight against <br>\r\nshe silently entered his mind to see him convening with malygos <br>\r\ni can`t kill them said rex<br>\r\nand why not deathwing killed your family said malygos<br>\r\nyes it was deathwing not his flight i am sure sintharia will understand that an attack will be useless now said rex<br>\r\ni would like to see how it goes said malygos leaving <br>\r\nrex just went into one of his dreams followed by sintharia who saw him looking at a worn torn battlefield <br>\r\nbrother said a man going up to rex<br>\r\nwhat is it sapphiron said rex<br>\r\nthis was our home why would you come back here said sapphiron <br>\r\nbecause i think the answer to this was the arrogant kirin tor said rex<br>\r\nwe were kirin tor remember said sapphiron <br>\r\nyes but if they were not so arrogant then none of this would have happened said rex<br>\r\nyes now we are servants to the alliance said sapphiron <br>\r\nwhy did we bother trying to rebuild our homeland it will just be destroyed all over again said rex <br>\r\nbecause we will die trying to bring back those who died defending it said another man     <br>\r\nwhat do you want wolfblade said rex <br>\r\nsimple we need to recover our strength said wolfblade <br>\r\ni sense like this war will not be between the horde and alliance i sense another foul force playing this brothers said rex <br>\r\ni sense it to the king is to arrogant to accept our council since he thought we are power hungry said another man<br>\r\nwhat is it now wolfblaze said rex<br>\r\nthe king will fall by the dragon i told him and he said no dragon can best him said wolfblaze <br>\r\nwell our council was listened by many but this king is arrogant i hope he rots in hell said rex leaving <br>\r\nyou know sintharia entering a persons mind without permission is not easy congrats said rex<br>\r\nso they were your brothers who my husband killed said sintharia<br>\r\nyes that dream was to nasty for me to go to said rex <br>\r\nso why does malygos want you to kill us said sintharia <br>\r\nwell i would have to tell you sooner or later that i decided to do all this after you captured me said rex<br>\r\nso you told them of our plans said sintharia <br>\r\nyes i was keeping balance as much as possible but everything backfired on me said rex <br>\r\nso everything went wrong in your whole life how she said <br>\r\nsimple i have always hated the alliance ever since i was born i was stuck under commanders who are incompetent my brothers the only people who were always there for me were killed i was broken in my mind and body twice now and i am stuck between so many goals that i can not even think much said rex <br>\r\nso who broke your mind and body the first time she said <br>\r\ni will show you he said taking her into another dream<br>\r\nrest in peace my brothers you deserve it said rex <br>\r\nrex the king wants you on a mission said a guard <br>\r\nwell tell him i am busy you tosser said rex <br>\r\nthen you will be broken said the guard <br>\r\nthey had attempted to destroy my freedom when said rex<br>\r\nthey were in another dream this one was him leaving the city <br>\r\nwere are you going said a guard <br>\r\ni am leaving stormwind said rex <br>\r\nwho says said the guard <br>\r\ni do said rex getting out his staff and casting a fire spell which killed them <br>\r\nfrom that day on i was declared a traitor and the

with this black dragon <br>\r\nslave come down said oynixia <br>\r\nrex knew that she was serious so he landed near her he saw the thing he detested looking at him it was the black dragon durim <br>\r\nwell well well you was right rex is here and he is a slave said durim laughing <br>\r\nwell i was still recovering from our last encounter oh and are you still using mortal races and that carcass as a trick said rex in a calm voice <br>\r\nwell lets see how strong you have got rex said durim <br>\r\nfine but can we do it in mortal form because i am still recovering from my fights with blackwing said rex<br>\r\nfine said durim going into a forsaken while rex was still human durim cast a spell which missed then rex cast a barrage of spells at him from all sides then in the confusion he hit him in the stomach with the back of his sword but he was tired and looked to someone to support him his master was watching as where the others in the amusement his eyes went on blackscale who he usually saw before he would go hunting he gave him a nod and rex gained some hope durim had recovered and started baraging him with spells rex put up a shield to protect him he then cast a fire surge spell at him when he got past it he had disappeared he then sensed a voice behind rex had casted a strong spell which broke his defense he was about to cast a final spell when oynixia bashed him again this time it was harder due to him being human she had bashed him against the wall his mind was thinking kill her but his body had faltered again and she had whacked him again his eyes changed from hate to fear as the agony came back durim had gotten back up to finish the job but rex just stood up bearing the agony as he saw furywing nod as well he recovered a bit of energy rex was battered and could not do much more harm he used what little strength he could muster to disappear they heared flapping and rex went into his cage to heal <br>\r\nwhat the said durim<br>\r\ni resign you win durim but i don`t think you deserve my full praise said rex<br>\r\nand why not said durim <br>\r\nif it was not for oynixia then you would be beaten said rex <br>\r\nrex said blackscale <br>\r\nyes said rex <br>\r\nwe going go hunting then said blackscale <br>\r\nok i have recovered i will show you where those creatures are said rex<br>\r\nas they flew off <br>\r\nwhy on earth did you challenge him durim said oynixia<br>\r\nbecause me and him have a score to settle said durim<br>\r\nrex and blackscale came back with a batch of carcasses <br>\r\nthere was enough for each of them to have one including rex who had grabbed one <br>\r\nafter they finished there meal sintharia spoke<br>\r\nnow as you all know some seek to keep balance she said <br>\r\nrex thought she was going to mention him as one of them but she just said<br>\r\nmany have failured to keep balance but this one did he alerted the other flights to our plans and either way i will not allow my flight to die in a war so we should rest and recover this man if he is hearing this should try to keep the balance the flight was appaled at her new suggestion intent on keeping his master safe he flew down and went in front of her in protective way which the other assumed meant that to get to her you will need to get by me the others new that rex would hit them hard the only one he feared out of this lot was his master and oynixia oynixia went up to him to help keep things in control he did not like being near one who would beat him easily but he knew if she wanted to kill him he would have done it by now eventually they all calmed and left back to there caves rex flew back to his cage to rest <br>\r\nshe entered his mind again <br>\r\nwhat is it master said rex<br>\r\nwhy do you protect me when my husband killed your family she said <br>\r\nbecause like i said before and as my master khadgar said if one human was bad does that mean all are my answer was yes if they hold power they will cause chaos i knew this but the council had been a pain and with all the chaos my brothers did some research on things that would help us plus you have revealed you have concern for my wellfare on more then one occasion he said<br>\r\nso what happened to the rest of your family she said <br>\r\nwell i only knew my farther other people never knew her either some said i was born by magic and called it unorthodox so we checked everything for it would be wierd to have four brothers born of magic at the same time he said <br>\r\nso what happened to him she said <br>\r\nhe was betrayed as was my whole family i was there he said <br>\r\nso do you know what happened she said <br>\r\nwell i heared my farther die as did my brothers we ran near to see him killed by the same weapon he used then we all blanked out and we ended up at our house 2 days later he said <br>\r\ndid you ever think of going into the memory to see what happened she said <br>\r\nto tell you the truth i don`t like going in my memory it opens old wounds but this memory i think is safe he said walking threw to the dream <br>\r\nthey saw his farther die then looked on the perch him and his brothers were <br>\r\nfarther thay said <br>\r\nwhoa said rex as he saw what happened him and his brothers had turned into dragons and had mauled the man who killed there farther it was the brother of current king of stormwind <br>\r\nnow i am full of
