Who will you be?<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Joseph, age 14. Land: Naxia. He\u2019s a fairly bright boy with a quick wit, fast hands, and an amazingly fit body. He also has an impressive reading skill, despite never actually learning how to read. He has an amazing intuition, bordering on premonitions, which have never failed him. That would be an impressive statement if he had any memories before the day he first woke up. Joseph woke up alone, but how long will he remain lonely in his forest home?<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sophia, age 20. Land: Shelken. She\u2019s not too bright but she\u2019s got street smarts. Little Sophie tends to get her way through the subtle or not so subtle manipulation of both sexes, as she somehow knows what everyone wants, and how to get it for them. She has many \u2018friends\u2019 and few enemies. Sophia woke up 8 years ago with no memory, along with about 400 others. Population growth is slow in this suburban land, but the people are hard working. How will Sophia affect their chances?<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Martin, age 22. Land: Valve. Martin has awoken with 3 other males and 4 females, all around the same age. He is attracted to a girl named Zoey who doesn\u2019t exactly return his feelings. However there is little time for romance as the wilderness is full of predators. The group is constantly on the move in their disproportionately large jungle environment.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Joseph had awoken in, of all things a bed. A nice comfortable bed with 3 layers of blankets, 2 pillows, and a quilt on top. Realizing that you had no idea where you were or who you were, you cautiously pulled yourself up. Upon seeing that you weren\u2019t wearing anything, you made an attempt to cover yourself, but after listening to the birds singing outside, you figured that there was no one around to see you. You survey the room for anything of interest.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Various appliances and furniture are scattered throughout the room including a boom box with a small collection of music, a dresser, large empty shelves a large television, and a computer sitting on a desk. There is a window with the blinds shut, two closed doors and one open one. After trying the light switch you discover there is no power, so you decide to get dressed and explore.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When you go to the dresser, you find that none of the drawers will open. The 2 closed doors and the shades won\u2019t open either. This prompts you to go out exploring the house. After surveying everything possible in the house, you discovered that nothing closed will open; not the doors, windows, or even cabinets. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The only other open door is what you presume to be the back yard. Despite sunlight shining through the blinds in all other windows, the back yard was surprisingly dark. It is probably due to the presence of so many trees out there. Since you had nothing better to do, and a warm breeze is blowing in, you figure you might as well go outside. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0About 50ft from the house you decided to look back at the place you had woken up in. The house itself was fairly normal, but the surprising thing was directly on top. An enormous metal fence with an array of opaque lights shooting out above it. The Fence stretched out endlessly in either direction; or at least it would have if all the trees hadn\u2019t blocked your view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Venturing along the Fence for almost 2 hours your throat was becoming quite dry. Finally you came upon some water. The Fence ran straight through a fairly large and clear pond. Not letting your thirst replace common sense, you find a long stick and poked it into the water, testing the depth. After finding a sufficiently shallow pool, you dipped your hands in for the long awaited drink.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0There came a splash from out in the pond, causing you to jump back and fall on your butt. You scan the surface of the water for any movement. About half way across the lake, approaching the land, were 4 small heads poking out of the water. As quietly as possible, you move into a crouching position behind a tree. Poking your head out you see the creatures crawling out of the pond are some kind of bat faced otters. The largest of them isn\u2019t much larger than 8 inches tall and 16 inches long. The smallest, being half the size of the largest.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You think to yourself that if critters this small and seemingly helpless had come from the center of the pond in broad daylight, it might mean that there may not be any predators around, at least none that these otter things were concerned with. This means that you can probably bathe in the pond without any worries about being torn in half. With the stick still in hand, you decide to follow these critters.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After 3 hours of playing \u2018follow the leader\u2019, you gave the otters a silent \u201cthank you.\u201d They had taken you all over this part of the forest, showing you which berries were and weren\u2019t safe to eat and all manner of neat things. Apparently there is a colony of ants that eat dung.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0About midday you come across some large carcass being devoured by crow-like birds. The otter family simply walked around it. The animal must have only recently died since its body was fairly intact. Up close it resembled a fat pink pig. This thing looks like it could reach up to your waist, making it a possible threat. Peering inside its open mouth reveals all flat teeth and the absence of tusks. \u201cThank the gods. Another herbivore.\u201d <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Another hour passes and another discovery is made. The otters stop at a fairly large rock and proceed to lick it for a few minutes. When it came your turn, you brushed your finger across its surface and taste. \u201cSalt!\u201d the instant the word popped into your head, a long stream of images poured into his head. These images depicted how one was supposed to properly gut an animal and then salt the meat to dry it out for storage.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Remaining discoveries included a patch of plants that the otters dug up. They had apparently eaten the large round purple roots. Mustering up the courage to give them a try, he picked up one of the half eaten roots and, nibbling at its clean center, decided it tasted good. Joseph\u2019s journey following the otters finally ended upon the appearance of a solitary predator about half the size of the pig. It had a wolf\u2019s head, monkey\u2019s body, long arms with half inch long claws, and fairly sharp teeth, all of which it used to swipe up one of the otters and break its neck with relative ease. \u201cShould I avoid it and not make any enemies, or steal the dead otter for myself?\u201d</span></div></div>",

The creature slowly stalked toward you and bared its cruel fangs. You had no weapons, so you decided to create as much ruckus as possible in hopes of scaring the beast away. You unleashed the most terrifying growl in your repertoire, but the wolf-monkey only barked harsh laughter, and began to charge you. Thinking quickly, you reached behind you to the salt rock, scratched away small crystals with your fingernails, and flung them into the aberration's eyes. The family of otters watched in horror and fascination as the wolf-monkey howled in anguish, and ran off into the forest. The otters ran to their fallen companion, and reared up on their hind legs in an effort to keep you away from the body. However, your plan was never to use the dead otter for a snack, you were simply defending a nice creature that had helped you when you needed it. You told the otters to back down, and that you meant them no harm, and in a strangely human manner, they nodded, as if they understood your words, and crawled away with sullen gaits.<br>\r\n       You carried the dead otter for hours until you found a spot you thought would be good to bury your fallen guide. The other otters still trailed, and you could feel their defeated spirit. You thought the otter that was killed may have been their father. With their help, you began to dig a small hole, and in a matter of minutes, a shallow grave was created. You gently placed the deceased otter inside, and listened to the chirps and growls of its family, singing their last words in a heartbreaking manner. You shoveled the dirt back over the body, and packed the earth with your bare feet. You turned  around to see two of the otters carrying a beautiful green pine-cone, and they pressed the seed into the top of the loosened soil. \"What is going on here?\" you asked, \"What was that thing? Where did it come from?\"<br>\r\n        The otters stood on their hind legs once more, lifted their little furry paws, and pointed behind you over the tree-line. You saw a large plume of unhealthy smoke, and heard a faint grinding of gears. You also heard the faint sound of human voices. You thanked the otters, and they scampered off, back into the water, and swam in the direction of the forest. One last otter was left behind, and it grabbed your leg, as if beckoning you to follow it.</span></div></div>",

Suddenly it grew louder and Joseph watched as one of the trees began to fall. His immediate observation was that the tree wasn\u2019t heading his direction, so he decided not to run. Joseph watched as the tree fell upon the distracted beast.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As the mighty wood hit the ground with a thud, two screams were let out. One came from the animal as the tree crushed its lower half, the other came from Joseph. He clutched his head with both hands, clenching his to prevent another scream. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When Joseph finally came to, his mind was overflowing with images of people, places and things that previously he could not even imagine. He did his best to hold onto these fantastic images, but it was futile. No matter how hard he grasped at them, they all just slipped away into the recesses of oblivion.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Joseph was brought out of his mental trance only by the sound of the gralder\u2019s whaling. \u201cGralder, is that what they\u2019re called?\u201d he thought to himself. \u201cHow did I know that? Did that flash\u2026?\u201d The creature called out even louder than before, bringing Joseph back to his senses. Making his way over to the source of the whaling, he saw that the gralder had dropped the megel as it continued to writhe on the ground. He approached the creature with a solemn expression on his face. He met eyes with the creature as is stopped struggling. At that moment, an understanding came between the two. The gralder\u2019s back leg was being crushed beneath the tree. It was fully aware that Joseph could find a large rock, smash its scull and eat the remains. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Amongst the twigs, leaves, and brush there was a fairly thick, five foot long, white branch. He knelt down to examine it, gently caressing its rough surface with the tips of his fingers. Along its length, every few inches, he tested its strength by applying minor force to bend it. When at last he was satisfied with its strength, Joseph lifted his uncut spear and with the blunt end, he stabbed the ground as if posing for a painting. <br>\r\nThe gralder cried out again. Joseph couldn\u2019t tell if it was calling for help, begging for mercy, or just crying in pain. As Joseph approached for a closer look on the flailing yelping creature, he couldn\u2019t help but pity the poor thing. Trying to get closer proved too hazardous as the thing slashed its claws at him. Even injured the damn thing\u2019s dangerous, Joseph thought to himself. Well of course it is you moron. He rebuttled. Frightened animals are always dangerous. That\u2019s why venomous snakes strike things they can\u2019t eat.<br>\r\nPulling himself back to reality, Joseph realized that the tree wasn\u2019t that thick. And from what he could see, the gralder didn\u2019t appear that injured. It could limp away and hunt otters until it healed. However, left in its current state it would probably attract all manner of predators looking for an easy meal. Joseph met eyes with the creature and marveled at its defiance against certain death. <br>\r\nIt was decided. Joseph found a suitable rock and placed it beside the tree. Then, jamming the branch beneath the tree to use as a wedge, applied all his strength onto the branch, and finally forced the tree to move. </span></div></div>",

She rose to her maximum height and immediately noticed that her right leg had reflexively pulled itself up. Knowing that she needed to test the extent of her injuries, she swayed from side to side, and rolled her shoulders. These movements were done with such a surprising rhythm that it could easily have been mistaken for dancing. Finally, she decided it was time to test her leg. With the will of a coyote who chews off its own captured leg and the bravery of a child going in for their annual shot, she lowered her leg to the ground. Placing her weight over it for all of an instant, she immediately pulled the broken leg back into the air with a yelp. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Joseph, who had been watching amusedly as the wild animal did it\u2019s jig, couldn\u2019t help but give a light chuckle at this new development. Especially upon the discovery that the creature was in fact not an it, but a her; given that nothing shook between its legs as it danced. Not to mention the six nipples on her chest that never shows up on males.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0This caused the gralder to look up at Joseph. Its face was blank as its eyes surveyed the man whom spared her. Her eyes darted between him and the tree branch that he held between them. She realized that even if she weren\u2019t hurt, this was not a beast that she could hunt. Confused that he had not yet attacked, and even more confused that he had saved her, she turned from him and began sniffing through the twigs and found her way to the place where the otter had dropped. Picking it up with her still firm jaws, she turned back to face the naked beast with the large stick.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With seemingly intelligent and humble movements, she approached the large pink thing. Seeing the stick lower in his relaxing hands, she assumed that he had guessed her intentions. However, this did not mean that he had ever stopped aiming the sharper end of the stick at her. She continued her approach until she was mere inches outside of the stick\u2019s range. Opening her mouth slightly, she let the otter drop from her lips and hit the ground with a light thud. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The naked pink thing almost completely relaxed his stick. He was in the process of pulling it out of its threatening position, when the gralder did something to make them both very nervous. She took another step forward.</span></div></div>",

She flinched at the sound of his voice, but otherwise didn\u2019t react. She just kept winning their little staring contest game.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0At first she seemed to be offering the otter out of gratitude, or some manner of peace offering. If she had just dropped the damn thing and left, then things would have been fine and dandy. Joseph thought to himself. But no, the stupid beast had to take that extra step. They were in each other\u2019s territory now; her within reach of his spear/club, and him within reach of her claws. She\u2019s weak, injured. Even if she does attack, the best she can hope for is to knick me before I bash her brains out. What the hell could she be doing?<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Joseph got his answer as the gralder lowered her head and crouched submissively. If I didn\u2019t know better, I\u2019d think this bitch was offering herself to me. If this weren\u2019t the first day I could remember, I\u2019d have to say it was the weirdest day of my life. With his spear still trained on her head, Joseph pondered this for a few moments. Finally, he decided to do the only practical thing he could think of. Very slowly, Joseph lowered his spear, its tip descending from her forehead to her nose, her throat, chest, stomach, and at last falling upon the long dead otter. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With a single motion he jabbed at the otter, piercing its flesh before jumping back, ready to fight off the gralder should this all have been some manner of trap. She hadn\u2019t moved a muscle. Joseph took another step back then another. Once he had reached twelve foot distance, he decided that it was safe to turn his back. Almost immediately the gralder lifted its head from its submissive pose and started following him, limping the whole way. It didn\u2019t take long for Joseph to notice. When he stopped she did as well. When he turned around she bowed her head. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0This game of stop and go continued for almost an hour before Joseph decided to take pity on the poor beast yet again. He slowed his pace significantly so that she didn\u2019t have to hobble at top speed. He found another berry bush, eating his fill and then some, since he was unable to carry any with him. Then, looking at the dead otter still in his hand he confessed \u201cI\u2019m gonna make you into a berry pack.\u201d Joseph walked far enough forward so that the gralder stood where he had squatted to eat the berries. He waited a moment to see if she would eat any. To his relief she did.  At last the house was in sight. Still walking, Joseph decided it was time to name the gimpy beast. Turning his head to face her, he called out \u201cHurry it up Gimp. Or you\u2019ll be late for supper.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0That evening, Joseph patrolled the area around the house, collecting as much fire wood as he could. He even found an impressively strong vine and a stick that looked like it would make a suitable splint. Another stick looked like it would make a good spit. He also found stones that would make excellent spark rocks. After he completed his foraging outside, he pointed at Gimp, telling her \u00e2\u0080\u009cGimp. Stay.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Joseph then stepped inside to see if there was anything he could use that he had missed from this morning. To his great surprise, there was. At first figured that it would be fruitless to check the drawers a second time, but it was still a necessary precaution. But when the first drawer opened, he practically leapt for joy.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Only a total of eight cabinets and drawers had opened across the house. This might have been disappointing, had it not been for the fact that almost everything he found was of use. Joseph\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new treasures included four boxes of matches, eighteen kitchen knives and two that could be useful in a fight, a bag full of various medicines, rags, towels, twelve spoons, two tool belts with holsters, a sewing kit, an ax, and much more. The final treasure he discovered was book containing detailed illustrations on the plants, creatures, and minerals of the forest. The title was Survival in Naxia. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Once Joseph had come down from his present high, he remembered that he was hungry. The growls of his stomach grew ever louder as he began his work. He started by designating a spot for the fire by setting a circle of rocks and filling it with most of the dried wood he had collected earlier, with the exception of the pieces he had labeled the spit, splint, and the support for the spit which he set on either side of the fire pit. To Joseph\u00e2\u0080\u0099s immense pride, it only took him four tries with the spark rocks to start the fire. Following the fire, he bled the otter, followed by skinning it with one of the more peculiar shipped knives. Once the skin had been cleaned and the meat gutted, Joseph proceeded to jam the spit through the otter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mouth and out the other end. With the mutilated corpse of a once living animal fully prepared and set atop the supports, the only thing left to do was wait.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Gimp sat a few yards away from the fire, but with each gust wind she was reminded of the delicious smell of cooked meat and inched her way forward. Joseph noticed this and considered the ways he could hide the smell from any unwanted guests. Setting his spear on the ground next to him, Joseph picked up the book read to the fading light of the setting sun. Apparently the various occupants of Naxia were categorized according to their environment, diet, and level of intelligence. Before reading up on the goodies of Naxia, he decided to first look up its dangers. There were few venomous plants or animals and no threatening aquatic creatures. The chapter on the otters described them as adequately nutritious. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The meat finally seemed ready. Placing the book down, Joseph grabbed one end of the spit and brought it to his mouth. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDelicious!\u00e2\u0080\u009d The book failed to describe how good they tasted. As Joseph finished off the last bit of flesh, he thought to himself that it could have use a tiny bit of salt, but that could be handled tomorrow. Joseph used the remaining meat to lure in Gimp so that she could be properly splintered. After wiping his hands on a towel, he poured dirt onto the fire, packed up his gear and made his way back inside, inviting the now splintered Gimp to follow. Joseph climbed into bed while Gimp curled up beside him and they both enjoyed a nice long sleep.</span></div></div>",

A distant roar caused the ground beneath to rumble as the pat pat of rain continued to knock on the door, asking to be let in. But Joseph knew better than to open the door, especially on this of all nights.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The only lights in the house came from six candles and an oil lamp in a room with drawn curtains. Joseph insisted that they needed more light but the patient was too stubborn. She said that the creatures that did this to her had poor night vision and that lights would attract them, and that it would be best to work by daylight anyway. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Joseph, a boy of little more than fourteen, had just come back from the bathroom to the side of his patient, stopping by her side to consult his little book on medicine, confirm the materials he had just set down, and reexamine the patient. As hid did so, Joseph thought to himself that if a stranger were to walk in and ask what this woman was, and if he were to say \u2018cat girl\u2019, how easy it would be for the stranger to nod their head in acceptance. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0At her present height, Felecia was approximately six feet tall. Her mid twenties body covered in a thin layer of indigo fur. A long slender tail extended from her lower back, its origin hidden as she rested on her back. Joseph had to continuously avert his eyes from lingering too long on her exposed chest. This task was aided every time he saw those dangerously sharp triangular nails extending from each of her ten toes and ten fingers. Every now and then she would give a light grown out of pain and expose a mouth full of carnivorous teeth. She would also exude a light gust from her mouth that smelled of day old road kill. Although her eyes were half shut, he knew that beneath those quivering lids were the most beautiful pair blue eyes he had ever seen. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Upon confirming that her body hadn\u2019t physically changed in the thirty seconds or so he had been gone, Joseph\u2019s eyes fell on her wound. Although her body was covered in light and deep scratches that stained her fur red, it was the gash on her side that was most concerning. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Amidst the panic, worry, and determination in his mind, Joseph managed to formulate the first of many relevant questions. The first was why a room that he could not open until yesterday would be so well stocked with medicines, and why all the glass containers in the front were not only appropriate to his current predicament but conveniently arranged in order of use. The second was how exactly he had fallen into this predicament. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Realizing that she was drifting, Joseph knew he needed to do something to keep her awake.  \u201cHey Felecia.\u201d He inquired. The cat woman groaned in response. \u201cDid I ever tell you about the first day I woke up here?\u201d Joseph had indeed told her this story before, so he wasn\u2019t sure if her next groan was done out of pain or annoyance.</span></div></div>",

A nice comfortable bed with 3 layers of blankets, 2 pillows, and a quilt on top.\u201d He did his best to recount as much detail as possible to keep the story going. \u201cRight away I knew that I had no idea where I was or who I was, so I pulled myself up. Once I saw that I wasn\u2019t wearing anything, I tried to cover myself up, but after a couple minutes of listening to the singing birds outside, I figured that there wasn\u2019t anyone around to see me. I knew that the first thing I needed was to get my bearings, so I surveyed the room for anything of interest.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAll in all, there was a dresser, three large empty book stands, a chair, desk, and two windows with their blinds shut. There are still a few contraptions in there that I haven\u2019t quite figured out yet. Maybe when you get better you could give them a look-see.\u201d Felecia drifted in and out of consciousness, but Joseph knew he could keep her with him with the sound of a familiar voice. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI noticed that there was some kind of switch on the wall to my left. I gave it a flip, but nothing happened. There were three doors, but only one was open. I got up to test the closed doors, but they were all locked. After trying the dresser and a few other cabinets around the room, I started thinking that maybe everything closed was also locked. Once I had finished a brief expedition of the hall way, living room and kitchen, I found that my theory was correct in every regard except one.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThe only other open door was to the forest. Looking through the glass windows, the word \u2018backyard\u2019 came to mind. Not sure why but it seemed appropriate. Despite sunlight shining through the blinds in all other windows, the backyard was surprisingly dark. I guess it\u2019s due to the thickness of the canopy. Anyway, since I had nothing better to do indoors, and a warm refreshing breeze was blowing in through a partially opened window, I figured I might as well go outside and enjoy the day. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAfter about fifty feet of what some might consider stalking, probably not you, I decided to look back at the place where I had woken. The house itself seemed fairly normal, but the really freaky thing was directly on top. An enormous metal wall with some kind of glowing array of opaque lights shooting out above it seemed to run right through the house. Seriously though, part of that damn Fence makes up a huge barren dead end of a wall. I swear it\u2019s like we\u2019re cut off from the other end of the house. But I digress, the Fence stretched out endlessly in either direction; or at least it would have if all the trees hadn\u2019t blocked my view.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cRemember when you told me about the Fence?\u201d Joseph inquired while he set various items beside his patient as per the directions in the book. When Felecia didn\u2019t answer, Joseph just continued talking. \u201cYour right. I guess it\u2019s not really relevant to this part of the story anyway. You don\u2019t come in until much later. I\u2019m just letting you know that I haven\u2019t forgotten you.\"</span></div></div>",

The only thing to grab my attention was throat becoming quite dry. Finally I found myself some water at Gigigly. We\u2019ll get into how that place is relevant a bit later. Anyway, the Fence ran straight through clear sparkly pond. Regardless of whatever you might think, I am not now, nor was I ever <i>completely</i> devoid of common sense. I found a long stick and proceeded to poke into the water. I wasn\u2019t just testing the depth; I was also making sure that there wasn\u2019t anything lurking beneath the surface. Once I found a sufficiently shallow pool, I dipped my hands in for several refreshing gulps.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhen a splash came from out in the pond, it made me jump back and fall on my butt.\u201d Joseph smiled to himself as he watched her eyes move beneath their lids, \u201cYou know, if you were awake right now you\u2019d be laughing too. Anyway, I scanned the surface of the water for any signs of movement. About half way across the lake, were four small heads poking out of the water and swimming towards land. I hid behind a tree until I saw that the creatures crawling out of the pond were some kind of green otters. They were really small, so I saw no harm in stalking them for a bit.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI figured if critters that small were moving around in broad daylight, then surely it meant that there were no predators to worry about. It would be nice to bathe in the pond without any worries of being torn in half. With the stick still in hand, I followed the otters for most of the day.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou know,\u201d Joseph began as he filled a syringe with a pink liquid \u201cfollowing a gaggle of otters through a forest, buck naked for several hours sounds pretty exciting. But after a while, I gave the otters a silent \u201cthank you.\u201d After all, they had taught me so much about the place I now call home. I got to see which berries were safe to eat. I saw some weird ants that apparently like fecal matter. At which I thought: <i>Nice. Now I don\u2019t have to worry about stepping in anyone\u2019s crap, especially my own.</i> I even saw a boar carcass, which was a lot more interesting than it sounds. Based on its flat teeth, I managed to deduce that I could hunt them if I managed to get a better stick. Don\u2019t get me wrong, but those things are pretty damn big. No offense.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As Joseph injected the pink liquid into Felecia\u2019s forearm, he couldn\u2019t help but marvel at his own skills. It was as if his hands instinctively knew what to do, and were operating independent of his own mind. He had the hands of a forty year medical veteran even though stubble was just beginning to grow on his chin. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAnyway, the remaining discoveries of the day included a patch of plants that the otters dug up. I gave em a try and they weren\u2019t too bad. There was also a rock that they licked. I used my finger to give it a taste. It had this really weird flavor. It was nowhere near as weird as what went on in my head. A moment after the stuff had dissolved in my mouth, I thought the word: salt. A flood of images then poured into my head, showing me things like how I could grind up the salt rocks and use them to preserve dead animals for later use. It was easily the trippiest moment of the day.\u201d <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Taking a moment to catch his breath, Joseph followed the next few steps in the medicine book. He grabbed two small rags. The first he folded and maneuvered into her mouth. The second he soaked in alcohol.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI might have kept on following those cute little guys were it not for what happened next. A solitary predator about half the size of the pig, jumped out of the bushes, grabbed an otter and snapped its neck all in the blink of an eye. It had kind of a wolf\u2019s head, monkey\u2019s body, long arms with long claws, and fairly sharp teeth. As I sat there and watched the thing fling the corpse around, giving little roars of victory, I wondered what to do next. Should I avoid it and not make any enemies, or steal the dead otter for myself?<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cBy the way, I take no enjoyment in this whatsoever.\u201d Joseph concluded his speech as he gently placed the alcohol drenched rag against her wound. Felecia\u2019s eyes flew open, her screams muffled under the rag. Upon seeing such a powerful creature reduced to relying on his care, Joseph gave a quick snicker before continuing.</span></div></div>",

As her body slowly began to relax, her half closed eyes wandered the room before falling on Joseph. Upon seeing Joseph\u2019s face, she was greeted with a relieved smile. \u201cHey there sleepy head. Welcome back to the world of the living.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Felecia moaned groggily and made muffled sounds through the rag that sounded vaguely like \u201cWhere are we?\u201d Her voice was deep and almost sensual. Taking into account the rag in her mouth and her severe loss of blood, her voice might as well have been a whisper compared to her usual volume.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Continuing to apply pressure against the rag on her side, Joseph asked \u201cWe\u2019re in my house. Are you feeling any better?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Using her left and severely less bruised arm Felecia removed the cloth from her mouth.  \u201cThere\u2019s less pain, but my head\u2019s all fuzzy. Why am I here?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Joseph grabbed her right hand and placed it over the cloth on her wound, telling her to keep up the pressure while he got something out of a med-kit. \u201cYou were attacked, remember? You said that you were ambushed on patrol so you came here looking like that. I managed to walk you to this room and started working on your injuries. We\u2019ll be talking about how you look later.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThank you\u201d Felecia wheezed as she rested her eyes.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYeah, cause right now we got more pressing issues. Tops on the list: won\u2019t they be able to track you here? Why didn\u2019t you go back to your cave?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Doing her best to formulate words despite her loss of blood, Felecia did her best to answer his questions. \u201cMy cave was too far from where they ambushed me. Even if it wasn\u2019t, it\u2019s not the most defendable of positions, especially in my present state.\u201d Felecia hissed as Joseph applied medicine soaked cotton balls against her various scratches. \u201cBesides, this is the most secure place I know of.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAre you fucking kidding me?\u201d he asked, extending his arm in the direction of the living room. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a wall that\u2019s made up of mostly glass. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve heard but glass is pretty flimsy.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Felecia gave a light chuckle. \u201cThis place may have the look and feel of wood, glass, and carpet, but trust me when I say that this place is impenetrable.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAre you sure?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Lifting her eyelids slightly to see Joseph\u2019s stress, Felecia answered \u201cI nearly dislocated my shoulder trying to smash through that \u2018flimsy\u2019 glass not three months before you appeared. It\u2019s likely that nothing short of a falling tree is capable of breaking through these walls.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWell\u2026ok\u201d Joseph said.

Looking back he instructed \u201cjust keep putting pressure on that cloth and you should be alright.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As he walked out the archway to the room where the weakened Felecia still lay, Joseph began going over the configuration of the house in his mind. To his right was the room where he use to sleep. He gave a quick peek inside. Satisfied that there were no predators small enough to hide in there he turned his attention to the left. After seeing no immediate danger, Joseph made his way down the hall. At the other end of the hall was the living room and the only door in and out of the house. Between him and the door rested a large couch and two recliners. They would provide decent cover to approach the door unnoticed. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The problem lay in uncertainty; the uncertainty as to whether or not the door was already locked, and the uncertainty about the condition of the blinds. Normally Joseph left the blinds open during the day to help warm the house. As per Felecia\u2019s advice, he started closing the blinds at night to keep his privacy. It was a new habit that had yet to completely sink in. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Finally coming to the end of the hall, Joseph knew his next step would be to peek around the corner to check on the blinds and the door. If the blinds for the window wall were closed then he could probably head straight for the door without pause. Open blinds would call for a much more subtle approach, especially if there was movement outside. However, the biggest issue wasn\u2019t whether or not the door was locked, but whether or not it was closed. Even if it wasn\u2019t locked the only way to open it was to turn the handle and the only predators in Naxia with opposable thumbs were him and apparently Felecia. If he hadn\u2019t closed the door completely and it had been blown open by a gust of wind, then something may have already wandered in. something that Joseph wasn\u2019t confident he could take with just a spear and knife.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The moment of truth.</span></div></div>",

In this poor light, the door seemed as closed as it could get, but the blinds were open. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cCan\u2019t move fast\u201d Joseph muttered to himself as he ducked down, ready to jump behind the couch. \u201cGotta be cautious.\u201d The storm continued to rage outside. The songs of nocturnal birds drowned out by the constant thud of raindrops and the occasional boom of thunder. The dangerous part was the lightening. If he peeked out during a flash then he might be able to see outside movement, but if anything was out there they\u2019d certainly be able to see him, flash or no flash. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Staying as low as possible, Joseph tucked and almost rolled behind the couch. Still in crouching position he moved swiftly behind the couch. Arriving at the edge, weapons still in hand, Joseph made another jump, this time for the first recliner. As he did so a flash of light filled the room. While taking a moment to catch his breath, Joseph felt the rumble of thunder move through his entire body, accompanied, shortly after, by distant howls.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With each breath, Joseph\u2019s heart seemed to beat faster. At this point he was actually to the right of the door. Directly in front of him was the brick and wood part of the wall. He continued to hide behind the recliners until he was completely against the wall. Pressing himself against it, Joseph made good time to the door. Confirming that it was indeed unlocked, he considered the next challenge.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Joseph still didn\u2019t know whether or not the predators were near yet, the door was half made of glass, and the door-knob. He would have to reach out across almost two feet of transparent glass, provoking anything within twenty meters to charge.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Fearing that the sound of his racing heart could be heard over the sound of the storm, Joseph attempted to calm himself. \u201cThey\u2019re just dumb animals you moron. Even if they do see you they don\u2019t know how doors work.\u201d Starting to laugh a bit, Joseph continued muttering to himself. \u201cBesides, if the door\u2019s closed enough to endure the wind then it could probably take a direct hit from a charging rhino. Right?\u201d <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Making up his mind, Joseph discarded the notion of reaching slowly across the door. Instead he dropped his weapons and made one last jump in front of the door, turning the lock until he heard the click.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As he stared outside, the constant splatter of drops continuing to bombard its glass, Joseph felt a wave of relief wash over him. Bursts of laughter were interrupted by brief but deep calming breaths. All was right in the world as lightning flashed again, illuminating the swaying brush outside and covering it in an instant with a mass of fur and teeth.</span></div></div>",

The giant wolf\u2019s body and face was covered in long black fur, a pair of horns as thick and long as a human arm protrude threateningly from its head and eyes, as bright and yellow as the sun, glared level with Joseph\u2019s. The monster\u2019s long fangs had such strength and sharpness that they made Joseph\u2019s spear the equivalent of a tooth-pick. This thought provoked a most unpleasant image in Joseph\u2019s mind. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The latest resident of Naxia might have gone on to examine other intimidating features of this vicious beast; he might even have noticed an entire pack pacing back and forth just behind it. However, Joseph was far too preoccupied with the rows of flesh rending teeth that were revealed by the drom\u2019s partially opened mouth. There were also the drom\u2019s eyes to consider; those deep golden eyes that seemed to consume all those who lost their way in them.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Out of nowhere the beast moved, opening its mouth several inches before closing to its original position, almost like a silent bark. A startled Joseph took several steps backward. The scare tactic had effectively broken him out of thed trance. Able to think again, Joseph started remembering Felecia\u2019s teachings. The first was in regards to large predators and how to never look them in the eye. After that, the dam in his mind collapsed and al his lessons came rushing back. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Joseph recounted one of Felecia\u2019s earliest lessons. He remembered the way she would stare out across the forest as she lay sunning on one of the large rocks outside her cave, her cat like tail swaying from side to side. A gust of wind brought with it a flurry of pollen, causing Joseph periodic sneezes. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Without even glancing at him, she said \u201cShow no fear. It is the defining feature of prey when they are afraid; especially in the minds of the scavengers. To show fear is to admit weakness to a harsh and unforgiving world. A beast may not have fang, claw, or horn to boast of, but if they are not afraid then they likely have just reason to be so. Be it out of ignorance or confidence, it is a dangerous gamble to charge the one who is not afraid.\u201d It was then that Felecia turned her head and looked him straight in the eye. \u201cProve yourself and do not blink\u201d she said as she continued staring right through him. \u201cShow no fear. Show no weakness.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Joseph had failed the first test, but after weeks of practice all his hard work seemed to have paid off. Just as Felecia told him, Joseph stood his ground, choosing to stare between the beast\u2019s eyes rather than into them. He crunched his brow, tensed his muscles threateningly, and bore his teeth with a low growl. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The drom attempted another bark, this one less silent. It took every ounce of Joseph\u2019s will power not to budge as he stared past the razor sharp teeth into the gaping maw that could swallow him whole.  The beast stared into Joseph\u2019s eyes in an effort to lock him in another trance, but to no avail. It could find no fear to latch on to, only courage. Slowly it began to dawn on the drom that perhaps the naked pink creature it stared at wasn\u2019t prey. No prey could stare into his eyes without shaking in fear. The over-fluffed puppy lowered its gaze as he cautiously backed away.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Satisfied that both he and Felecia were safe, and that he had stood his ground, Joseph started to move again. Without ceasing to stare through the glass, Joseph collected his weapons, confirmed one last time that the door was locked and proceeded to close the blinds. With everything set and secure, Joseph used the remains of his strength to move himself out of the living room and into the hallway. There he collapsed, tears of fear flowing from his eyes. Joseph remained this way for several minutes.</span></div></div>",

As he fell to his knees by her side, Felecia looked up into his red watery eyes. Without needing to ask why, she reached out and touched Joseph\u2019s knee. \u201cNice job kid.\u201d Felecia said proudly, giving him the necessary strength he needed to continue.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Wiping away the remains of his tears, Joseph smiled back at Felecia. \u201cRight. Well, I hate to leave things unfinished, so why don\u2019t I pick up where we left off.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWonderful\u201d Felecia said rolling her eyes and pulling her hand back.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Trying to remember where he had last stopped, Joseph dived back into his tale. \u201cUm, this next part\u2019s a bit fuzzy, but I\u2019ll do my best.\u201d Joseph said hesitantly. \u201cAs I weighed my options I noticed some mysterious crackling sound that seemed to reverberate throughout the woods. It grew louder and louder until it sounded like thunder, and I watched as one of the trees started to fall. It wasn\u2019t falling towards me and that was good, especially since I was so freaked that I couldn\u2019t move. The creature I was watching seemed to be in the same boat. The only difference was that the tree fell on her instead of me.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThis part is also a bit fuzzy. All I can really remember is this unbearable stabbing headache. I pressed my hands against my head for all the good it did me. The only other thing I remember before passing out was some kind of flash inside my mind; so many lights and shapes.\u201d Joseph had to look away for a moment. Every time he thought about his headaches, he seemed to cause them to come back.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhen I finally came to, I saw that the creature was writhing underneath the tree. I looked at her and immediately the word \u2018Gralder\u2019 came to mind.\u201d Joseph smiled exhaustively and shook his head. \u201cI started wondering how I suddenly knew what the gralder\u2019s name was when I hadn\u2019t a clue only a couple minutes ago. The only thing that really came to mind was that flash in my head. Thankfully before I could put in any serious thought and cause a relapse, the gralder decided to cry out and snap me back to my senses. I walked over to the squirming monkey-thing and noticed he saw that she had dropped the otter a few feet away. As I got closer, I met eyes with her and she stopped struggling. I can\u2019t really explain it, but I think we share a little moment of understanding. The gralder\u2019s back leg was being crushed beneath the tree and there was no way for her to escape. She was fully aware that I could find a large rock, smash her skull, and eat the remains. </span></div></div>",

And to make a long story short I broke off a thick branch from the fallen tree and used it as a lever to move the tree just enough for the gralder to escape. All the while a voice in the back of my head kept screaming at me, calling me an idiot. So you see, I really don\u2019t need your help in that regard.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOnce she was free, I immediately took several steps back. She rose to her maximum height and started stretching her various extremities. For some reason she felt the need to start doing a little dance, it was like she was celebrating her survival. Eventually she decided to test her leg. She put her weight on it for barely an instant before immediately pulling her broken leg back into the air. She gave a light yelp. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI think I must have laughed or something, cause then the gralder looked at me. Her face was blank as her eyes seemed to survey me. I watched her eyes dart between me and the tree branch that I held between us. I guess she was confused at the fact that she was still alive, and more so that I had spared her. She turned away from me and buried her face in the brush on the ground, sniffing through the twigs until she found her way to where the otter had dropped. She picked it up with her jaws and turned back to face the naked beast with the large stick.\u201d Joseph\u2019s eyes darted to Felecia\u2019s face. He could have sworn that she had just smiled, if only for a second. Joseph continued telling his story, confident that his words were indeed getting through to her.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWith seemingly intelligent and humble movements, and the otter still in her mouth, the gralder started moving closer and closer to me. Guessing her intentions, I lowered my stick a bit as a sign of good will. But I never stopped aiming the sharp end at her. If it was a trick, I wasn\u2019t going to fall for it. She continued to approach until she was mere inches outside of my stick\u2019s range. She opened her mouth a bit and let the otter drop from her lips and hit the ground with a light thud. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt could have ended there, but it didn\u2019t. I had almost completely relaxed my stick and everything. I was even in the process of pulling it out of its threatening position. That\u2019s when the gralder did something to make us both very nervous. She took another step forward.</span></div></div>",

I even yelled \u2018Back\u2019!\u201d Joseph raised his voice a bit to try and match his original volume. \u201cShe flinched a bit at the sound of my voice, but otherwise didn\u2019t react. She just kept taking baby step after baby step.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI thought to myself: If she had just dropped the damn thing and left, then things would have been fine and dandy. But no, the stupid beast had to take that extra step. We were in each other\u2019s territory then; her within reach of my spear, and me within reach of her claws. She\u2019s weak, injured, I said to myself. Even if she does attack, the best she can hope for is to knick me before I bash her brains out. What the hell could she be doing?<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI got my answer when the gralder lowered her head and crouched submissively. If I didn\u2019t know better, I thought, I\u2019d think this bitch was offering herself to me. If that weren\u2019t the first day I could remember, I\u2019d have to say it was the weirdest day of my life. With my spear still trained on her head, I pondered this for a few moments. Finally, I decided on the only practical option available. Very slowly, I lowered my spear past her until it was pointing at the dead otter. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWith a single motion I jabbed at the otter, piercing its flesh before jumping back. I was ready to fight off the gralder if it had turned out to have been some manner of trap. She hadn\u2019t moved a muscle. I kept moving back until I was about four meters away, and decided that it was safe to turn my back. The instant I did so the gralder lifted its head from its submissive pose and started following me. She limped the whole way. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt was pretty weird. When I stopped she did as well. When I turned around she bowed her head. We played this game of stop and go for almost an hour before I decided to take pity on the poor beast yet again. I slowed my pace significantly so that she didn\u2019t have to hobble at top speed. I found another berry bush and ate my fill since there was no way to carry any with me. I even let the gralder eat her fill after I had walked far enough forward. It was kind of relieving to see her eat. Once the house was finally in sight, I decided it was time to name the gimpy beast. Turning around to face her, I called \u2018Hurry it up Gimp. Or you\u2019ll be late for supper\u2019.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I even found some material that looked like it would make a suitable splint for Gimp. I also found stones that made excellent spark rocks. Once I was done foraging outside, I told Gimp to stay put while I ventured inside to find anything of use that I might have missed earlier. Surprisingly, there was plenty. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOnly a fraction of the cabinets and drawers had opened around the house. This might have been disappointing, had it not been for the fact that almost everything I found was of use. My new treasures included four boxes of matches, kitchen knives, two of which looked like they could be useful in a fight, rags, towels, silverware, two tool belts with holsters, a sewing kit, an ax, a small case full of various medicines and bandages, and much more. My final treasure that day was book containing detailed illustrations on the plants, creatures, and minerals of the forest. The title was Survival in Naxia.\u201d Pausing for a bit, \u201cYes I know, we\u2019ll be getting to the book in a bit.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI finally remembered that I was hungry. The growls in my stomach were growing ever louder as I began my work. I started by designating a spot for the fire, setting the rocks in a circle, filling it with most of the dried wood I had collected earlier, and set the other pieces in their respective locations. It only took me about four tries with the spark rocks to start the fire; I was so proud. Then I bled, skinned, cleaned, gutted, and finally roasted the otter. With the mutilated corpse of a once living animal fully prepared and set atop the supports, the only thing left to do was wait.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWith Gimp sitting a few yards away from the fire, and my spear resting next to him, I picked up the book and read to the fading light of the setting sun. It was a very detailed book; with its categorizations and big words that I still don\u2019t fully understand. Apparently the various occupants of Naxia are categorized according to their environment, diet, and level of intelligence. I didn\u2019t make it very far that night, but I did skim through some of the edible and poisonous plants. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOnce the meat seemed ready, I put the book down, grabbed one end of the spit and took a big bite.\u201d Joseph paused for a moment as he recounted that first bite. \u201cIt was freaking delicious. After I had my fill I used the remaining meat to lure in Gimp so that she could be properly splintered. After putting out the fire I packed up the gear and made my way back inside, inviting the now splintered Gimp to follow. I climbed into the old bed while Gimp curled up beside me and we both drifted off to sleep.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The full impact of everything hit me like a ton of bricks. It wasn\u2019t that I was clueless about my current situation or the content of my dream. My amusement and laughter came from a gut feeling I had. A gut feeling that told me that I\u2019d likely spend every night this way for the rest of my life.\u201d</span></div></div>",

And once again, thank you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cRight. Now let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s try and set the mood. The smell of fresh rain and blooming flowers permeated the air. Chirping insects, singing birds, and the occasional howl in the distance, gave the forest an overwhelming and almost soothing thrum. I could hardly keep his eyes open as I sat up against the red tree. I sat beneath an exceptionally large hole in the canopy, enjoying the feel of the warm sun against my wet skin. I had just finished a nice swim in the pond. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cEven the rumble of a nearby snoring Gimp was lulling me to sleep. She had been so relieved at having her cast removed that she wore herself out in celebration.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Joseph smiled as he recounted how the fuzzy creature had galloped and bounded around the pond while he swam. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cI was on the verge of taking a nap, but I managed to pull myself out of it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Joseph shuddered. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI had kinda made a commitment to sleep only as much as my body needed and not a second more. I looked around to find something to keep my mind occupied. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cA newly carved and hardened spear lay by my side. It seemed to be waiting impatiently for the next hunt when it would again taste blood.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Joseph smiled as he noticed the empathy in Felecia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s expression. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHanging from a nail directly overhead was my old pack holding a few pieces of red fruit, the guide book, a cutting knife, about 20ft of poorly crafted rope if I do say so myself, and a pair of trunks I had made from that first pig. I could have taken the trunks swimming with me, but they itched something awful. So they were left hanging while I got my bare ass dirty again.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was about that time that I thought of the book.

He knew that he had power over her, at least in this particular situation, and he was going to milk it for all it was worth. Felecia averted her eyes, signaling that he had permission to go on.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo. As I flipped through the pages of my personal bible, I recounted what a marvelous and useful tool it was. It had taught me what I could and couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t eat, which things were poisonous, some crap about fertile soil, and a lot more stuff that even you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell me. The opening two pages held a detailed fold out map of all Naxia. As you might have already known, this land was shaped like a perfect square. I was able to make out where my house was in relation to trails, bodies of water and a suspicious labyrinth of stone in a place called Naxia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Teeth. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe bulk of the book seemed more like one giant glossary than a guide. It was divided into several volumes. Each detailed the different species in Naxia. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cHowever, amidst sea of words of the first few Volumes, I discovered some highly unusual marks. While the majority of the book was quite readable, every now and then a string of unfamiliar symbols would replace words, sentences, and even whole paragraphs. At first I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think much of it cuz I was still shocked that I could even read. But these marks really got my attention when I noticed a substantial increase within the chapter on deadly diseases.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t let it bother you too much\u00e2\u0080\u009d Felecia comforted. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve read that book and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen those grey areas. Trust me that I can fill in most of those gaps through life experiences. After all, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been here a lot longer than you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Joseph sarcastically. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe almighty Felecia rushes in yet again to save the day. Anyway, Volumes Three and Four described the fungus and plants of the forest. I skimmed through this section rather quickly, so the only things to catch my attention were a picture of a patch of long grass with a large rock resting behind its rows and an orange moss with the ability to decompose fecal matter. If I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m using too many big words, it means that you can crap on it one day and come back the next to find a bigger clump of moss.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Joseph laughed to himself as he remembered the first time he read this and how he had found a patch of moss near his house and tested it.</span></div></div>",

While they had neither teeth nor venom, they secreted hallucinogenic mucus from their skin when frightened. A quote from the author directly following this fact still confuses me. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even think about it.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Weird huh?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Felecia chuckled to herself, gaining Joseph\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attention. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIs there something you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not telling me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Felecia shook her head. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOf course there is.

Rather than do the same back to him, she merely gave him a look that said that she could but chose not to. Staring into her deep golden slit eyes, Joseph was the first to back down. \u00e2\u0080\u009cJust don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go sticking the damn things in your mouth without cooking them first.

I practically threw that book to the ground and screamed like a girl at the sight of those scaly heads. It took me a little while to recover, but I managed. I found the place where I left off and immediately folded the page over before continuing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Laughing to himself \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd I thought the nightmares were bad.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cNext came the birds. While the beautiful and bizarre fouls of Section Four were pretty to look at, I was growing ever more fretful at the increasing frequency of the unreadable glyphs. It seemed that the closer I came to the end of the guide, the more they seemed to creep up on me. The other unnerving detail of this section was the final entry depicting a very large bird. The five foot Kresht had brownish green feathers for camouflage, could reach speeds that surpassed the any other land creature thus far. It could certainly give you a run for your money. And it had a sharp beak for rending the flesh from its prey. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cReading that, I was so freaked out I had to put the book down for a sec and take a look around. When I was satisfied by the unbothered stir of the forest and the still resting Gimp, I pulled my spear in a bit closer and uneasily resumed reading to Section Five. Looking back, I guess I failed to consider the distant warning cry of the zimzim; easily the brightest and loudest bird in all Naxia.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was almost laughable that something as dreadful as the kresht could be followed up by the most adorable little mouse anyone had ever seen. At the time, I thought it was some kind of positive omen for the rest of the volume. Or rather, I tried to think of it that way. As I read through the remaining creatures, a sense of unease was growing in my gut, almost like I could feel time was running out.</span></div></div>",

The third and final beast was some manner of big cat with long fangs extending below the roof of its mouth.

If I remember correctly, it described the creature as an Utek, or Panthera Sapien. It also said that this giant cat was more physically powerful than any human on record with the exception of three, and then came more glyphs. Wonder who they might have been.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelecia gave a light chuckle at his words. Joseph decided not to push the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn-between the glyphs were all kinds of useless footnotes; a lot of which included it enormous size and weight. Apparently an Utek can stand about 3.5 meters tall with its head fully raised. Go figure, huh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOthers talked about the fact that since the Utek seemed like such a freakishly powerful super predator that it probably originates somewhere other than Naxia. What do ya think of that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelecia had been looking away from Joseph ever since he started this subject. Clearly it was making her uncomfortable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI remember thinking to myself, it\u2019s like the damn books deliberately avoiding whether or not this \u201csuper predator\u201d eats humans. I was so wrapped up in my reading that I failed to notice the once distant warning cries of the birds grow ever closer before finally falling silent.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last he had regained Felecia\u2019s interest.</span></div></div>",

Low and behold all remaining text had been replaced with the glyphs. But I didn\u2019t notice this until much later. My attention was focused on the second appearance of a second picture in a single entry. Damn that thing was freaky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt seemed like an unremarkable sketch of some kind of dark rock partially hidden behind layers of a familiar batch of long grass. After pondering this for a few seconds, I finally realized where I had seen it before and turned back to the Volume on plants. I skimmed through the pages a bit before finally finding it. It was little more than a photo of a common kind of grass called Emel. I was holding the pages with his left thumb and forefinger so I could hold my place. I flipped back and forth between them in an effort to compare the two images.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe image in the plant Volume, like every other picture in the guide, was a photograph. While the Volume Five version was the one and only sketch, and a pretty well drawn sketch at that. As I continued to stare at the sketch trying to deduce its purpose, I gradually became aware of two small yellow blotches on the rock. Pulling the book closer, the blotches becoming ever clearer, I at last he noticed their symmetric positions and shapes. As I drew the book ever closer to my face, I was able to make out lines that seemed to take the shape of a nose. From there an image of a face was formed, followed soon after by teeth, a lower jaw and a crouching body. But always I kept going back to those yellow hypnotic cat eyes.\u201d Joseph\u2019s heart continued to race just as it had done that very day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA sudden nearby rustle caused me to jump. I fumbled to recapture the loose book, but to no avail. Turning to the source of the sound, I saw that Gimp had woken from her nap. She was sitting up, her ears perked, fur standing on end, and eyes glued somewhere off in front of her and I. As I stared at her, at last it dawned on me that the forest was dead silent. Not a chirp, squawk, or squeak for miles. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cTurning my head to face the same direction as Gimp, I immediately noticed a small rustle in a patch of Emel not 30 meters in front of me. And in that Emel were those same cold yellow eyes as depicted in the sketch.\u201d</span></div></div>",

How the hell would you have felt?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Felecia crunched her brow. \u201cI felt scared. If you recall, I was no older than you are now when I first woke up in this place. My early years were filled with running, escaping, and glares from hungry predators. It wasn\u2019t until much later that I became strong enough not to run.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Joseph calmed down and continued. \u201cIt didn\u2019t take a genius to figure out what I was looking at. But I wasn\u2019t exactly in a thinking state of mind. Those eyes\u2026 it felt like they were swallowing me alive. I might have stayed lost in those eyes if it weren\u2019t for Gimp. And you\u2019ll never guess what she did,\u201d Joseph said sarcastically. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh I don\u2019t know\u201d Felecia answered acerbically with a false smile. \u201cDid she do the only intelligent thing and run away?\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYeah\u201d Joseph exhaled. \u201cI heard a rustle from where she was lying which broke me out of that trance. It took me a bit but the sound of claws scraping against wood forced me to look up. The bitch was half way up the damn tree by then. Course, in her position, guess I would\u2019 a done the same.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI quickly faced forward again to see if the Utek had come any closer. It hadn\u2019t. It just stayed in the long grass in what I assume was a crouching position, ready to spring up and pounce on me in a second. Fortunately, I knew better than to get myself trapped in its eyes again. I glanced down hastily and immediately remembered the spear. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cThe gears started winding in my head. The Utek outmatched me in strength, speed, and size, but there was a chance that I had a superior intellect. I could use my small size and low center of gravity to my advantage. If I could manage to get the spear in just the right position, then it might be possible to use the beast\u2019s own momentum against it; essentially I would make the Utek impale itself. It wasn\u2019t much of a plan, but I knew that it was my only chance.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cPlacing my hand just over the spear, I looked back up and faced the Utek. I guess my expression gave away the fact that I had a plan, because it was then that the Utek decided to show herself. It wasn\u2019t her full height mind you, but the grass she stood in, the grass that could conceal my stomach, barely brushed her elbows. Disregarding this I grasped the spear in my hand and got to my feet. I turned backwards for all of a full second before I found a suitable notch in the tree in which I could use as leverage for the spear. As I turned to face forward again, a short, heavy, warm gust hit my face. A dark fuzzy wall eclipsed my view as the air around me suddenly reeked of fresh animal carcasses. And when I looked up, all I could see was that giant maw surrounded by teeth.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Although I was close.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The two shared a brief laugh together before Joseph resumed his tale. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy eyes slowly fell from that great maw. The beast\u00e2\u0080\u0099s body covered in that dark violet, almost black fur. Finally I saw my spear. The tip was barely an inch away from her fur, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d guess two inches from her skin. It must have been about here,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Joseph said while pressing against the soft gap at the front of his collar bone, \u00e2\u0080\u009cjust below the voice box, where the neck meets the torso. In theory, it should count as a weak spot on most creatures. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cI knew I had her,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Joseph said, recalling his racing heartbeat and tensed muscles. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI knew we were at a stale mate. If she made the slightest move then I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d un-lodge the spear\u00e2\u0080\u0099s base and pierce her windpipe. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099d probably have strength enough to give me a good swipe and take my head off before she died, but there was no way she\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be able to survive a wound like that. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s when I looked back up, past the teeth, into the beast\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes. I looked for any sign of fear or hesitation; anything that might indicate that we could both walk away from this. I might as well have been trying to spot birds under the dirt. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to say they were empty, but they were deep; as deep as the deepest sea and just as full.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a sea?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Felecia interrupted. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou were on a roll there and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sorry to interrupt, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never heard that term before.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Naturally, Joseph was upset that his chain of thought had been broken, but that didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make her question any less valid. Once he began thinking deeper into what he said and how he had said it, he gave silent gratitude to the gods that the light was dim enough to hide his blushing cheeks. After pondering for a few seconds, finding the best combination of words, Joseph was satisfied that he could give an adequate answer.</span></div></div>",

The last remnants of the morning dew fell from the tips of leaves down to the forest floor. The grass shook as animals of all shapes and sizes stalked, scurried, and foraged. The gentle lapping of a nearby stream flowed into a nearby pond filled with the croaking of rainbow frogs.

She enjoyed their company, since she had been completely alone until she found them wandering helplessly in her part of the jungle. When she found them they were without shelter during a powerful thunderstorm and looked like they haven't eaten in days, she has taken care of them ever since. They were lucky that it was her that found them and not a big cat or poisonous snake. They also happened to be in  the relatively safe part of the jungle that Megan called home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeighboring this oasis of safety was a hostile world. To the south the jungle grows denser and is populated with predators, until the jungle suddenly stops and massive metal and glass structures climb into the sky, she knew the area was populated because the spires would light up at night from electric lights, like the ones in her home, but because of a gut feeling of dread and the alien look of the buildings she stayed away. To the north was a different matter. After a weeks journey through a  inhospitable swamp the jungle was filled with an evil amazon tribe, that would kidnap any that dared enter their land, or so Megan had seen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she had also seen was that the hunters of the amazon tribe were only 6 feet tall at best, suggesting that Megan was the tallest person in the land at 9 feet high. Megan also saw that the amazons wore animal skins around their chests and over their pelvic areas, as opposed to herself, Kate, and Mark lacking any such fabrics to cover themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn these last months she has learned much about her guests, they were both barely adults with Kate just a year older than Mark. Kate was like Megan in having dark hair and deep blue eyes, though being much smaller and standing only 5 and a half feet tall. Kate looked up to Megan wanting to be as strong and independent as the amazon and hardly left her side. Her brother, as Kate referred to him, was taller than Kate and had short black hair, though having only seen a few Amazons, the first thing Megan noticed was that Mark was unlike herself and Kate. She later concluded that there were probably other males like him in the city to the south, and that there wouldn't be any in the amazon ruled jungle, although she still couldn't figure out what males were for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan stared of into space at the table, reflecting on the time the three had spent together, fishing, hunting, teaching them how to survive, and just staring up at the night sky looking at the stars. She is suddenly brought back into reality by a loud bang in the distance. Megan ran out of the cabin and onto the deck and scanned the horizon to the south.  the sky was lit up with fire and columns of smoke towered into the sky. After a few moments another bang echoed through the jungle and another fire appeared, this one closer than the last. As the night went on the sound of explosions and fleeing animals filled the air, and the fires grew closer. Megan held Kate and Mark close as the two watched the inferno.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate looked up to Megan and in a confused voice asked, \"What's going on? What's causing all this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's the people to the south, clearing the area to expand were going to have to leave the area it won't be safe for much longer. The only question is where should we go.\" Megan said as she carefully considered her options.</span></div></div>",

Megan embraced Kate tightly and comforted her. \"Stay calm Kate, if you lose your nerve you won't make it far. We're going to follow the animals' lead and head north, then look for a new home after we cross the swamp. This is dangerous territory so I need you to stay strong for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate stared into Megan's deep blue eyes and was filled with hope from the confidence in the amazon's expression. \" I'll be strong for you.\" Kate said, the fear in her voice now replaced admiration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two women break their embrace just as Mark enters the room. Megan motions towards the door and they take the first steeps of their long journey. Outside they are greeted by a completely different world. Smoke clouds their vision, with what little they can see tinted in a red hue from the fires. The peaceful sound of birds now replaced by the screaming and growling of animals and an metallic inhuman screech growing louder. Megan lead the group away from the fire, walking at first then frantic sprinting as the screech grew closer and closer. Moving north was difficult with no cleared path the group was forced to push through dense jungle, resulting in minor bruises and cuts on their bare skin. After clearing a few miles of rough terrain and climbing a steep hill the group turn around and and look at their former home. Near the cleared land, that the cabin was built on,  the tip of a metal object could be seen above the tree line. The object slowly walked into the clearance, each step causing the earth to shake slightly. The object now stood exposed, A large spherical body held up by six large spider like legs, a portion of the sphere  opened  revealing a large blue crystal. The crystal glowed bright and in a flash a red beam of light appeared and scorched the earth everywhere it touched. The group watches in awe as their home is devoured by fire. They were so entranced that they failed to notice as a large figure slowly  creep towards them.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the group watched the mechanical being burn the jungle, a large black panther watched them from the shadows. Megan had unknowingly lead the group straight into the panther's territory. Unlike the other animals this predator held its ground against the advancing threat, and considered the group's trespassing an act of aggression. It moved slowly and silently until it was within striking range. Letting out a low growl  the panther pounced.  Megan heard the growl and turned around, and she saw the beast leaping through the air towards Mark, with little time to act Megan was able to knock Mark out of the way. Mark was now safe, however Megan was now in the panther's path. Megan hit the ground with a loud thud, as her vision focused she saw  the beast's massive maw lowering towards her. Megan quickly jabs the wooden shaft of her spear on the panther's neck to keep its razor sharp teeth away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdrenaline pumped through Kate as she watched the powerful amazon struggle underneath the panther's weight. Kate let out a roar of primal fury and ran to Megan's aid, driving her spear into the panther's neck.  The panther recoiled in pain, giving Megan an opening to kick the colossal beast off her. The panther cried out in pain before returning to its feet and darting away.  Now standing in clear sight for the first time the group saw the behemoth in all it glory, standing as tall as Megan showing teeth that could easily be larger than a normal man's face. Megan picked herself up off the ground just as the panther circled around readying itself for another attack. The beast jumped through the air once more, but this time Megan was prepared, she dropped to one knee and thrust her spear forward  causing the beast to impale itself. The spear drove straight through the panther's chest striking the heart and killing it immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Megan are you alright?\" Mark asked as he ran to help her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm fine thanks to Kate, she is turning into quite the amazon.\" Megan said while smiling at Kate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate's face turns red and she averts her eyes away from Megan. \"... I... just didn't want you to get hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dusting herself off, Megan once more leads the group north wanting to stay as far away from whatever the machines from the south. The next few days pass without incident, but as they reach the border of the swamplands they come across the remains of a camp site. The fire pit is cold and empty, only one tent stands, wrecked though it may be, yet marks on the ground indicate more tents once stood, the most disturbing image however is the drag marks and trail of dry blood that start from the wrecked tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened here?\" Mark asked as he raised his spear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan held her spear tight and slowly followed the trail of blood. \" I'm not sure just be rea...... oh my god.\" Megan finished. At the end of the drag marks the half eaten carcass of a man laid on the ground still rotting, tightly clenching a book in its hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate puts her hand over her mouth in disgust, but overcomes the gruesome sight and retrieves the book. \"It's a diary, detailing a trip into a cave down the road.\" Megan said while pointing then began reading from the last entries in the book. \" Day five and we're still lost, we thought this could be a safe route past the marsh of the dead, but its a damn labyrinth down here and I fear we are going in circles. Took make matters worse some of the guys are losing their grip on reality, claiming to see a monster stalking us its probably just the near black lighting  playing tricks on overactive imaginations. Day six, We should leave, we should turn back and exit the way we came in, but something is drawing me in, A voice in the back of my head calling to me from the center of this maze. I'm seeing it now too and hearing a growl, It's watching us waiting for a moment to strike. I shouldn't be taking my eyes away from the shadows even to write, but I find it is the only thing that can calm my nerves.  Day seven, oh god oh god, their dead all of them, I know it. It sprang from the shadows and started to rip us apart, and ... and I ran, I just left them. The only thing keeping me going is a light in the distance I must reach it. Day eight, I've made it out, I'm safe now. However it's as I feared I came out the way we entered, and whats worse I can still feel that thing's eye burning into my soul, watching me, waiting. \" At this point Kate looks up with a grim look and said \" This next part is written in his own blood....., It followed me out, and started to eat me alive, before leaving me to die a slow painful death. I write this now as a warning to all that may find this, if you go into it's lair it will never stop hunting you... Abandon hope all ye who enter here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The marsh of the dead, that's what the swamp is called! So are choices are this swamp of the dead or, from how that book describes it, the gates of hell, that's just wonderful.\" Mark says hysterically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter seeing the gruesome corpse Megan wanted nothing to do with the cave, but just like the dead man, a voice in her head beckoned her to enter.</span></div></div>",

Megan takes one last look at the body, before leading everyone away from the cave and towards the marshland. As they get closer to the swamp, the jungle becomes less dense until it reaches the point where the only vegetation is patches of tall grass and everything became silent after they reached the border of the swamp. Fog clouded their vision, but from what they could see showed how inhospitable the landscape was. The water was murky and near black, and it was devoid of life, with the exception of plants Megan recognized as poisonous. Megan walks into the murky water and continues forward with ease, but for Mark and Kate the water reached their waists. Mark kept his spear ready to strike, and attempted to scan the water as he moves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't like this the fog is limiting our visibility and the water is to dark to see into. Anything could be out here.\" Mark said quietly in case anything dangerous was near by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I've crossed this swamp before nothing lives here. The swamp's water is toxic if you drink it, so there are no crocodiles, panthers or anything else out here. Are biggest danger here is dehydration so speed is more important than defense here.\" Megan said before picking up her pace. Mark lowered his spear and speed up to keep up with Megan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So when did you come through here Megan, I mean you haven't left our side since you found us. How long ago was it?\" Kate asked as she speed up so that she could walk side by side with Megan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure exactly when, but it was as far back as I could remember. I just woke up remembering barely anything, I only knew my name and that I wasn't always like this.\" Megan said motioning to her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you didn't always have that amazing amazon body.\" Kate said shortly before turning red, realizing how her statement could be interpreted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan looked down at her young companion and smiled innocently before continuing her story. \"No, but I'm not sure what changed me. Then shortly after gaining consciousness I was hunted through the jungle by other amazons. They finally stopped chasing me when I reached the swamp\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group presses forward as Megan details how she crossed the marsh, explored the jungle and, built her home. Three days have passed and the three continued to struggle forward despite their lack drinkable water. At this point even the disgusting, black, murky water seemed welcoming, the only thing holding the group back was the knowledge that drinking it would cause an agonizing death. The thirst had lead to conflict in the group, Mark having grown angry at the situation blamed Megan for taking them into the swamp. Kate stood up for Megan leading to the two to grow distant and causing the group to continue in tense silence. As the group approached a sandbar Mark saw something small dart through the water and over a near by hill. \"I just saw something over there.\" Mark said raising his spear,\" if we catch it it will help us a little.\" Megan and Kate nodded and followed Mark over the hill on the sandbar. As the three cleared the top of the hill they moved right into a pool of quicksand, and were quickly pulled in up to their chests. The three struggled but they soon realized they couldn't get free on their own. Then when the group seems to have lost all hope, a wooden object is lowered to their arms. One by one they grab on and are pulled out, Megan looks up at their savior and sees that the wooded stick was.</span></div></div>",

He was conceived by a fairly wealthy couple in a civilization over 200 years old. The population is large but education is restricted only for the wealthiest of merchants. Everyone else is either a servant or a menial worker. Grond is a vast valley that lies in a crossroads of several other lands, making it a prominent land of trade. However, Alexander, son of a merchant couple, has never been content at the bartering table.

Because both Glame and humans woke up 60 years ago, and worked together to build civilization, the Glame have equal rights within their own land. However, as the Glame have not appeared in any other land that the Dren people are in contact with, they are not so well treated by foreigners. Rosh has human and Glame friends, but how long can his life of peace last while being surrounded by bigots?</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">If you add a quality chapter to this story then I will do the same for one of yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><u><b>Think of the following as game instructions.</b></u></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeep in mind that this is a giant game. The players are not aware they are playing and aren\u2019t allowed to find out unlit a story has achieved a sufficient length. Whatever force or forces controlling the game are generally referred to by the inhabitants as gods.<br>\r\nThe beginning of each level (not chapter) has a display of the game\u2019s primary objectives. Completion of the objectives and bonus challenges awards the players with some manner of prize or prizes and an increase in overall difficulty. The nature of bonus challenges is hidden from players. Players may only be faintly aware of their game objectives, like a voice in the back of their heads.<br>\r\nCompleting an objective and winning a prize isn\u2019t as obvious as hearing \u201cBlue Team, Flag Returned\u201d, and having a crate fall from the sky. It is often the case that an immediate prize is indistinguishable from the normal environment. In some cases the prize might simply be the unlocking of the next objective or perhaps nothing more humble than an idea. Residents may receive prizes for completing the same objective multiple times, with the nature of the prize reflecting the nature and severity of the specific objective accomplished. For example, if the objective is to find food, the award for killing and eating a small animal is less substantial than cultivating a plant for food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery now and then, one or more people wake up in a strange land with no memories of their lives beforehand, if they ever existed. In some cases with those who appear, there are some residual memories. Nothing about their personal lives; these memories refer to general things such as the concept of electricity, how to use most household tools and appliances, and perhaps something about the land they awoke in.<br>\r\nThe number of people who appear in any given Awakening has been known to vary anywhere from 1 to 1000. There is no consistent pattern in regards to the nature of those who awaken; with one exception, since all inhabitants of a single land speak the same language. The only thing anyone ever remembers is their own name. Most people who awake are not blank slates. They have personalities, fears, values, and desires that reflect whatever world or era they might have come from. This does not mean that all new Residents are from 21st century Earth. New Residents may hale from any place or time in the known or unknown universe.<br>\r\nThose who wake are not always human since animals of various species have been known to wake up alongside people. Some people who wake aren\u2019t entirely human. These non humans tend to be in the minority of whatever land they live in. All humans and non human people are genetically compatible, allowing the possibility for mix breeding.<br>\r\nIt is also common for more than one Awakening to occur in a single land. The time between Awakenings can be anywhere from 1 to 400 years. Those that appear in a land are called Awoken while those who are born are called Born. All Awoken people have some pre existing knowledge of some mysterious gods. This knowledge rarely goes beyond simply being aware of their existence and the fact that they created the lands.<br>\r\nEach land varies in population capacity, pre existing buildings, tools, and various resources, vegetation, wildlife and weather patterns. The size of the lands varies from a few acres to a large island. Some lands are completely devoid of sentient life and exist only to be given away as prizes, but all lands are capable of sustaining some human life. The lands are all sealed off from one another by enormous metal walls with a 50ft shield of energy above them that prevents anyone from seeing over them. All attempts to peak over the Fences have resulted in that section of wall drastically increasing in height to prevent any looky lues.<br>\r\nSometimes a section of the Fence disappears, allowing lands to make contact with one another. Once lands are connected, their weather patterns mesh together and new resources are awarded to both lands. The space where fences used to stand is quite obvious as, for example: jungle dirt drastically ends and becomes ocean, with no shore in between. Some lands have mysteries, such as locked doors that won\u2019t open until certain objectives are achieved by the players. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis section is reserved for any additional rules I come up with. Overall I\u2019d like to encourage as much freedom as possible. If the description of the environment seems a little vague, feel free to fill in the gaps with whatever seems reasonable.<br>\r\nMy only real complaint is that everyone hates one line chapters. I'm not saying that they are forbidden, just keep them to a minimum.<br>\r\nAlso, respect the (Reserved) signs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecent change: we allow vore now.</td>",
