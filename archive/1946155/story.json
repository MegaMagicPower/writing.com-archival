You get to spend months wolfing down the delicious cooking of your new wife, and trust me, it's delicious, you get to hang around the house all day doing nothing, and you also get thousands of minions to command! All fun, all games, no work. Come on, boy, I've been sitting on this for years already. Kids aren't getting their presents.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou once again wrinkle your nose as you take another look at the manila folder sprawled out on the table. This could be you. This could be your life. But it's <i>not you</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... could I have something else?\" You look upwards, seeing the content smirk on the Broker's face quickly vanish, soon replaced by a sharp grimace. If only looks could kill. \"It's just... this is not me. This is not who I am. I don't just want to take the place of some old man. I want to be me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe this!\" The Power Broker exclaims, throwing his hands up in mock surprise, as the candlelights on his desk flicker, causing the shadows of his fingers to dance rapidly and wildly. \"First they tell you that they are not satisfied with their life. That they want to start anew. Then when you actually offer them something, they throw it back at you! All needy and picky. Selfish, all of them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can only uncomfortably shift from one leg to the other as you awkwardly squirm in the chair, dodging the disappointed gaze that the Broker is throwing at you. This is even worse than dealing with your mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er.... um... sorry?\" is the only thing that you can mutter in response as your eyes shift downwards in shame. Perhaps this was a bad idea after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lingering silence fills the air as you examine the floor, the lacquer paint more thick on several wooden panels than on the others. You finally grow restless, raising your head to see the still and stiff Broker sitting in his chair, jaw agape. He slowly closes it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you just say to me, boy?\" He growls in a low tone, gaze piercing right through you as if you were transparent. You flinch. Did you somehow upset him one way or another?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er... sorry?\" You repeat, backing away into your seat as your body forms a contour in the leather, the elasticity giving in to your weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you repeat it to me?\" His voice is now softer, almost like a whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. Sorry.\" Your voice is now firm, without hesitation, as you repeat the word for the third time. You aren't quite sure why the aged man is so interested in this, but you sure as hell aren't going to let this chance go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.</i>\" The Broker mutters, repeating the word ad nauseam. It was as if though he was bewitched by the word, carelessly chasing it along a narrow path as it enticed further and further into itself. His repetitions last an entire minute before he snaps out of the spell, and upon realizing the smoke of the burnt out candles wafting at him, he quickly snaps his fingers as the wax seems to rebuild and light itself anew. Almost as if though it traveled back in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. Now <i>that's</i> a word I haven't heard in ye-... no, decades. People always come to me, demanding powers as they incessantly bargain for more and more power. Yet do they ever thank me? No! All they ever say is 'me, me, me'. Yet what about myself? Listen kid, I like you. What is it that you're actually looking for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scratch the back of your hair as you thoughts float through your brain, your nails rustling through the stubs of your growing hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't really know.\" You finally admit, shrugging your shoulders. \"At first I just thought that I wanted to be someone different. You know, to get rid of this life. But now that I think about it, I kind of want to change myself instead. To... improve myself? A better me, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Broker nods his head in a short manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understandable. Humans always desire the sense of accomplishment, even if it dwells deep within themselves. Unfortunately, I cannot create such powers. I am a Giver, someone who trades. I simply cannot fulfill that wish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatching your dismayed look, he quickly interjects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But! What I can do is give you something. Not a power, but an item. Even though it is imbued with the essence of others, it's raw. Completely unnurtured. You can take it and make it your own. Become a new hero. It's possible, though it might take a milennia... or a couple thousand. What do you say, kid?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes gleam. You get to become your own superhero? To leave your name in myths and legends? To maybe even fight against other superheroes and gods themselves? You definitely don't want to miss that opportunity as you quickly bob your head in an approving gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! I have a couple of items left over. What do you say about... oh, this one will be perfect for you! It is...\"</span></div></div>",

People scurry back and forth. Curiously, most of them seem to be the same person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Techno, erase everything on those hard drives,\" the Broker snaps at one of the underlings who moves quickly to the nearest computer, reaching into the long cloak that shrouds his body and drawing out a long, fleshy cable from the base of his neck. His body stiffens as he slides it into the computer port. \"Electro, fry everything the second those hard drives are wiped.\" Electro, a woman wearing nothing but dense bright-yellow fur, grins, and the room instantly comes alive with static charges. \"Folk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir,\" half the room says in unison, the duplicates snapping to attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe points at four with rifles slung over their backs . \"You, you, you, and you, get up on the roof.

Anything at all. All you have to do is wish it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA massive thud like a bomb going off brings you lurching back to reality. Lumps of the ceiling crash down around you and dust fills the air. The building is shaken violently as something impacts against the outside again and again. It sounds like the place is being shelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clay-faced man grabs the Broker by the arm. \"We go now!\" He resists, pushing the other man away, drawing the pistol from within his jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn alien language booms through the air. \"What's happening? What the hell is that!\" you scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those things are the Monitors of reality,\" the Broker bellows back. \"They're like multiverse police. They seek out and destroy threats to reality.\" He levels the gun at your head. \"People like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What! But I'm not - \" Realization dawns. \"You bastard!

With your eyes squeezed tight shut, it is a long time before you realise you're not actually dead. Slowly you open one eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're standing in the Broker's office. It is peaceful, serene, quiet except for the sound of a car passing outside. The ceiling is intact. The stacks of fried computers and torched paperwork are gone. The paintings on the walls aren't even crooked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Time travel?</i> you wonder. Then again, he had mentioned something about your powers being reality-based.

A young woman scarely out of her teens is on her knees beneath the desk. She's dressed like a secretary, or at least a slutty interpretation of one - pair of shiny, needle-thin high heels are strapped to her feet, her legs are constrained within a pencil skirt that hugs her beautiful backside, and her tits spill out of a frilly cotton blouse. She has dark, red-brown skin and copper-coloured hair tied up in a bun, which bobs up and down as she works her plump lips up and down the Broker's shaft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moans softly but deeper than you'd expect, while her mouth makes wet, smacking noises. She looks like she's done this before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww yeah...\" the Broker groans. \"I'm draining your power. I'm sucking it all away. Now you're stuck in that slut body. Now you're stuck as my slut secretary forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe secretary removes her mouth from around his cock. When she speaks, her words sound as flat as if she's reading from a script, and have a distinctive accent. \"No, master. Please. I do anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything, eh?\" the Broker cackles triumphantly. \"In that case... bend over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything for you, master,\" she drones in a bored, monotone, dutifully bending herself over the desk. As the Broker pulls the skirt down over her hips, her eyes fall on you, going suddenly wide. \"Hayir! B\u0131rakmak! Stop! Stop!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Broker merely sees that as encouragement, enthusiastically plunging himself into her. She screams in frustration, trying to fight him off, but he merely holds onto her hips and rides. Then, suddenly, she changes. Her sultry face seems to slough off her skull into a collection of angry jowls. Her breasts are sucked back into her blouse as they deflate rapidly. Her skirt is torn to shreds as her slender legs swell to become muscular and hairy. A large, flaccid penis pop out from inside her -his- body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Broker has gone completely stiff, his face a mask of perfect horror as he stares at the burly, middle-age Eastern European crossdresser he is currently penetrating. A weak moan of anguish escapes his mouth. \"Never...ever...do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look!\" Hardcore roars, jabbing a finger at you, still unable to move by the weight of the man pinning him to the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Broker notices you and quickly pulls out of his bodyguard. \"Who the hell... Well don't just stand there! Grab him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHardcore leaps over the desk, bearing down on you. He must have forgotten about the stiletto heels. As his foot hits the floor his leg collapses out from under him, and you take the moment to turn and run.</span></div></div>",

And it wasn't because your legs were chained to the floor out of fear of the gargantuan mass of muscle hurling towards you, but because you frankly don't even care. You have been imbued with the power to travel through time, twist dimensions, and warp the fabric of reality itself. Why should you even be afraid of some physical muscle?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn back around and peer down on the Eastern European man repeating Turkish curse words over and over again as he tosses his heels across the stained wooden floor. He smirks, noticing that you have yet to move from the spot. Thinking this will be an easy catch, he quickly springs to his feet and lurches forward, spit escaping from his mouth as he lets out a battle cry. His hand is just about to reach your forehand and, you imagine, crush your head like a pomegranate, before you begin to concentrate and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man suddenly begins to shrink. He lets loose a large, angry yelp, noticing that his arms and legs begin to dissolve into a white slime, the pungent smell revealing the fact that it is nothing other than semen. His body begins to turn in a pink, resin-like material as he continues to shrink even further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOOOO...\" is the last thing to echo out of his mouth as it is permanently sealed into an O-shape figure, a pink resin tongue lolling out of it. A pink doll rests among several puddles of semen. The doll was missing its limbs, only its body and torso were present, having been left with an open hole only at the mouth end. His high-bridged nose and face had been stretched ungracefully, his cheeks sucked inward and his tongue and lips protruding. These features made it seem like the doll's only purpose in life was to suck dick. A fellahole - fellatio onahole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa...\" you say as you pick up what seems to be a lifeless doll in your hand and squeeze it, fingers pushing into its soft features. You cannot believe what just happened. You originally intended to stop his movements, to make him inanimate. You certainly did not intend for... this. Perhaps your subconsciousness had affected your reality warping, and the result turned out to be a sex toy to fill your horny teenage needs?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell...\" The Broker mutters, staring in awe as he backs off. \"Is that... transmutation...? No, that has limits... reality warping!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, hey,\" you awkwardly gesture, showing him the doll in your hand, \"Sorry about your... friend here. I didn't really mean for this to happen. I think I can fix this if you want. Probably.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no, no, no,\" he stammers, quickly running up to you and snatching the doll, thrusting it into his pocket. \"Playing around with reality too much will attract them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare dumbly at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know. Them! The Monitors of Reality, Kid, how did you get these powers without being aware of them, and more importantly, not being devoured within the first few hours?\" He trods over to his desk, pulling an enormous bottle of whiskey and two shot glasses out of a small blue ring box. Noticing your stunned look, he smirks and whispers, \"Spatial manipulation, son.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, what's your story? I don't really hold any ill will towards other universal power users. We already have it hard enough as it is. Here.\" He thrusts a glass that is filled to the brim with a noxious smelling brown liquid, alcohol practically evaporating right before your very eyes. \"Don't worry, it's not poisonous. Just a little oversaturated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, uh, it's kind of weird. I don't really know what's going on anyway. I mean, you gave me these like a minute ago,\" you say, tipping over the brown liquid into your mouth. You are pleasantly surprised that not only does it go down well in this dreary atmosphere, but the taste is quite refined as well.

Your performance at work had been in the dirt ever since she'd walked out on you - commissions had dried up and management were already making moves to fire you. Even this shitty flat, with its peeling, mould-encrusted walls, was more than you could afford. What little money Cassandra had left you with had been spent. In a month, you'll be out on your ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a weary yet resolute sigh, you switched off the \"documentary\" and drained your beer. Until the time that you were super successful bikini model Kate Upton, sacrifices would have to be made. Sacrifices such as your son. How biblical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps it would do him some good, kicking him out. Since the divorce he had done nothing but seclude himself in his room, appearing every so often only to eat your food and act like a hormonal, horny teenager. He had no job, no girlfriend, no drive. You loved him dearly, but making him land on his feet and fend for himself was in his best interests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pressed your ear against his bedroom door for signs of life. His music player was blasting out something godawful. You knocked loudly and gave him time to zip up his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing... You hammered harder. \"Chris, open up, it's your father.\" No reply. \"Chris, open the door, I want to have a talk.\" ..... \"Fine. I'm coming in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis room, when you stepped into it, was freezing. The window was wide open, curtains billowing in the cold wind. A stack of comic books had been swept off his desk and strewn about the room, pages flapping. His PC was lit up and playing its noise-music to an empty room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuh. You suppressed a smile at the idea that the little bastard had been sneaking out behind your back. Perhapss he wasn't as antisocial as you thought. \"Just wish you could do it without wasting the heating and electric,\" you muttered, pulling closed the window and powering down the computer. As it shuts down, you catch sight of a text document and the words, 'Power Broker 117 graymalkin road dont forget!!!!'. With a last disapproving glance at his shelves of comics, you stepped outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Graymalkin road?</i> you thought, returning to the living room. <i>That's a rough part of town. What business could he possibly have there? God, please don't let it be drugs.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Kate Upton: A Beautiful Life</i> was no longer running when you flicked the TV back on. Breaking news was plastered across the lower half of the screen and a newswoman stood against the famial backdrop of the city high-street.

A squad of armed police crouched behind several overturned desks, their rifles trained on the massive circular door of the bank vault. The footage played on, though nothing seemed to be happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Notice anything strange?\" the newswoman said, as the footage began to loop. \"Watch again. This time keep your eyes on the bottom left corner.\" Curious you shifted forward but even still you could see nothing. \"Still not seen it? How about now?\" the newswoman said smugly. The footage played a third time except with a red circle over the image which highlighted a black smudge, barely more than a few pixels high, moving across the floor of the bank from the vault, making a beeline for the doorway. It slipped between the feet of one of the cops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat back disappointing. <i>So the bank has a rat problem. Hardly newsworthy.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you had trouble spotting it in that last clip, perhaps this next video will be easier,\" the voiceover said with an air of relish as the view switched. Now they were high above the bank in a helicopter, looking down at the police cars clustered around the steps. You shook your head and cracked open another beer as the video played.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly one of the cops crouched behind the car lurched to his feet, wildly pointing his pistol at the floor and rapidly emptying his clip into the tarmac. The scene became chaos as the police dove for cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was something on the ground, near to where the cop had fired, hard to see at first but becoming clearer. A black dot on the image. It was growing. Now it was the size of an animal, perhaps a dog. Then it was as big as a child. It was a person, arms and legs pumping as it ran, gathering speed. It barreled into the policeman, knocking him off his feet. The others had seen it now and had leveled their guns on it, but didn't seem to be shooting. Perhaps they thought it <i>was</i> a child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept now it was the size of a man. Then two men. A cop car crunched as the expanding figure clambered over it. It was trying to escape. The camera desperately zoomed out to keep the entirety of the figure in shot, which was now rubbing shoulders with the three story buildings that lined the street. The giant was tearing down the street, cars crumpling beneath its feet as it ran, heading straight for the camera, and the footage cut out as the helicopter veered to the side to escape its path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe news reporter was using her quiet voice reserved for serious occasions. \"News Central would like to remind viewers that what they just saw was real, unedited footage from the scene of the bank raid earlier today. Once again, if you know anything that may help the authorities make sense of these shocking images, please call the number on your screen now.\" Attempts by the police to identify the figure - believed to be male and in his early twenties - have been hampered by the mask obscuring both his eyes <i>and</i> part of his nose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA freeze frame of the person came on the screen. The beer slipped from your fingers. It was impossible to tell for sure, what with the mask covering his eyes and part of his nose, but you'd recognise that t-shirt anywhere... It was your son!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least its not drugs...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when you heard the sound of the cat flap. Weird, because you didn't even have a cat.

He had spent three years lusting after the previous Cumshot. In return she had loathed him, rejecting him at every turn. This coming from a woman who would happily have jacked off a cow if she needed the juice, it had seriously wounded his pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It's not the same,</i> he thinks sadly. <i>I wanted her.</i>In his black heart of hearts, he knows the woman sucking him off isn't her, is just a middle-aged man trying to do the best for his son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miserable bitch,\" he mutters angrily, gripping your head and forcing you to take the entirety of him into your mouth.

The Power Broker finally let go of his grip and you took stock of yourself.  You didn't notice anything too different.  You could tell that the minor aches and pains in your joints that came with age seemed to be gone which seemed like a huge plus, after all it would be kind of lame to be a superhero who still had to take Tylenol.  \"So, what did you do for me?  I don't really feel anything.\"  You said with your voice seemingly a little higher. <i> Probably just a product of the adrenaline rush,</i> you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Broker just chuckled, \"It'll take hold any second now, just wait and see.\"  The Broker then snapped his fingers and a lackey ran over with a full length mirror and place it in front of you.  The more drastic changes seemed to now be taking hold, you saw the lines in your face smooth out and tighten up.  It was like you were getting younger, you didn't know what kind of power came with this youth but you weren't going to complain, but the changes weren't just stopping with your wrinkles, you face was really softening up, and your lips seemed to have plumped up just a little.  \"Weird, I didn't look quite like this when I was younger, in fact I'd say I look kind of...<i>girly</i>\"  Your voice went up an octave at that last line and your eyes widened as some more drastic changes took place.  Suddenly two solid and fleshy orbs emerged from your chest.  Even under your jacket it was obvious you had just sprouted a pair of B cup breasts.  And knowing what was coming next you put your hand in your pants and looked down. Sure enough the tool used to help produce your super villain son is no longer there.  You looked back up into the mirror and saw what you figured was about an 19 year old female version of yourself still in your jeans and button up shirt and jacket.  You still had the same short brown haircut, only now it wasn't graying and it looked more like a pixie cut on your new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell did you just do?\"  You shout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did what we agreed on, I gave you the power to stop your son.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?  The power of a teenage girl?  Do you want me to...going shopping to stop him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Power Broker while amused, seemed to have lost a little patience at what he felt was a slight to his work, \"No.  You have powers, your body is now made of a living rubber.  You can stretch your body to extreme lengths, you can temporarily flatten or inflate yourself.  And of course the standard slightly enhanced speed and strength.  You should be able to punch out a man with a single stretch punch.  Go ahead, try it.  I insist.\"  He said motioning towards a lackey who seemed like he'd been through this before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeekishly you looked at the guy who was standing about 20 feet away and said, \"Sorry about this,\" as you pulled back your fist, pictured your target, and swung your fist at him and was surprised when it didn't stop.  Your arm extended 20 feet and hit the goon square in the jaw and knocked him to the ground.  And like a rubber band snapping your arm shot right back into it's normal position no problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, you gave me legit powers, thanks for that.  But I'm still not happy about being a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Power Broker just waved off your complaint, \"Tis only a secret identity.  Surely you boy would recognize you and it would potential cause an even bigger mess that I don't want to deal with.  So what better disguise for a middle aged man than as a teenage girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I can turn back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes you can.\"  The Broker went up to you again and instantly grabbed your new breasts.  Before you could even protest he made a shove and the breasts retracted into your body.  You took a glance in the mirror and saw you were once again you.  And a second later the Broker pulled your pecks and suddenly the breasts were back along with the rest of the superhero package.  \"Simple as that, although I do recommend you use this as well to protect your identity in case you want to walk around town in that form.  Just a precaution.\"  He said as he gave you a black mask that would cover your eyes and nose.  You felt like you had many more questions but before you could ask them an alarm went off.  The Broker groaned, \"Looks like your boy is at it again,  Seems he's hitting the bank just a few blocks from here.  You should leave now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod and sprint out and put the mask on your feminine face.  As you get closer to the bank a sense of fear was building up.  You were about to fight your superpowered son, and you had next to no idea what you were getting into.  You stepped up to the bank and told yourself, \"Last chance to back out.\"</span></div></div>",

Chris travels in his civilian guise but switches into his superheroine form as soon as he steps inside the warehouse. The Broker is waiting for the two of you inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chris!\" he greets her warmly. \"Or should I say Elastygirl? Did you come up with this body all by yourself? I'm impressed; it is looking fabulous. No wonder the newspapers can't get enough of you. Give me a twirl.\" Blushing, Chris spins around for him, showing off the purple leotard that hugs his endowments. The Broker claps his hands in admiration and reaches out as if to touch him, but Chris dodges away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Broker rolls his eyes at you and sighs. \"Figures. They only want me to touch them when they're power-less. After I give them what I want, they don't even let me get close. You must be the proud father,\" he says, shaking your hand. \"Elastygirl hasn't stopped talking about you. I understand you're to be her new sidekick, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye, that's right,\" you reply gruffly, gripping his hand firmly. \"Somebody has to watch her- his back. Who better than his old man?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what a back it is,\" the Broker winks, gesturing with his head at your son's rear, from which he is trying to extract a leotard wedgie. \"Well I think I've got the perfect power that'll complement Chris' perfectly.\" An electric shock surges through your right hand and up the length of your arm. \"There. Done. Elastygirl, I leave the rest up to you. Feel free to stop by anytime. Both of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walks away, you look to Chris. \"That can't be all of it. Am I... done?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose so. He takes longer with some people than others. Do you feel anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As a matter of fact, I do.\" A strange, warm queasy feeling is building in your stomach, spreading out through your body. The stresses of your life, the knotted muscles in your neck and shoulders, all the aches and pains in your joints seem to melt away. And that isn't the only thing melting. The hand that the Broker shook is losing its shape, the fingers merging into one another like flesh-coloured goop. Your hand becomes a formless blob and your arm shrinks away inside the sleeve, flowing into your torso. \"What's happening to me?\" you blurble. Rivulets of flesh are pouring down your face into your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, dad, this is normal! It's hard to control at first, just let it happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour legs buckle beneath you as they too are liquidated. No matter what Chris says, you're beginning to panic. Your whole body is turning into mush. Already you can feel your body soaking into your clothing and spreading out in a growing pool across the cold floor. Your head sinks into your torso, which is now little more than a mound of quivering, pink goo. \"Make it stop!\" you mouth begs up at Chris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't. It just takes practice. Uh... uh oh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh oh? What uh oh?\"  With a great effort of will, you're able to maneuver your semi-liquid body, twisting your face around to see what Chris is staring at. A pink trail of goo that had once been your left foot is meandering across the sloped warehouse floor, trickling unstoppably towards a metal grate set into the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm being drained away! Do something, son!\" Always quick thinking in a crisis, Elastygirl crouches down and presses his mouth into your formless mass. He gives a long gulp and you sense a part of yourself flowing over his tongue and down into his stomach. \"How is this better?\" you cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll be safe inside me until you can learn to control it.\" His lips press against your own and he begins to slurp away. The world goes dark as what was your head is gulped down. You join with the part of yourself already in his stomach. It's warm and cramped, becoming unbearably so as he continues to swallow down the rest of your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris wipes his mouth and pats his bloated stomach. Good job he's Elastygirl or he'd never have managed to swallow the whole lot. He can't help but notice that with the big breasts and bump combined he looks more like a heavily pregnant woman than a superhero. As if to complete the illusion, he feels you move within. \"Settle down in there, dad, you're gonna make me throw up. Just sit tight until we get home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe waddles out of the Broker's base, clutching his baby bump protectively.</span></div></div>",

His body is delightfully pliant, easily stretching like soft rubber under your grip. His eyes widen as you pull his flexible jaw wider and wider, stretching his luscious lips taut over the rim of the toilet. \"Hgghn! Duhrrr drr dish!  Duhd, preesh!\" he yells unintelligibly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mouth now stretched wide across the toilet bowl, you pull down your trousers and lower your hairy old arse onto the kermode. The fleshy toilet seat feels delightfully warm against your skin and you love the way his spongy tits squish like cushions beneath your rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis muffled cries reach a peak just as you let rip. Ah, that feels <i>good</i>. It's like you haven't had a shit in weeks. You grab a magazine from under the sink and spend the next ten minutes reading, until you're sure your bowels have been fully emptied down Chris' throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you're finished. Chris' eyes glare furiously at you as you pull up your trousers. Your arse-print in his breasts slowly dissapears, returning them to their beautiful, bouyant, bustiness. \"Sorry, son, but there's men out there who'll do worse to you than that if you keep going around dressing up like some crime-fighting slut. I hope this taught you a lesson,\" you say as you...</span></div></div>",

From the back of one of the cupboards you retrieve an unopened liter bottle of triple-filtered vodka. You'd been saving it for those times when the memories of your ex-wife became too much, but this will do too. Returning to the bathroom, you find Chris still trapped with his jaw stretched wide around the toilet seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open the bottle and carefully measure out a shotglass of vodka, and pour it into his open mouth. It gurgles away down his throat. You see his eyes smart from the taste. It's strong stuff. Then you upend the bottle and pour the whole thing down the hatch. Judging by the gagging and coughing, part of it seems to find the wrong hole, but enough makes it into his stomach to have the desired effect. His eyes roll back into his head with a low moan. His body goes limp, almost seeming to deflate like an empty balloon. His complaints cease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Great!</i> You release his lips from the toilet seat, and stretchygirl's face snaps back into place. It lolls drunkenly and slumps against the side of the bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That boy sure did pick a fine alter ego,\" you muse, admiring the bleached blonde hair. The make-up was a little excessive though - the excessive eyeliner makes him look like some sort of street walker, and had run badly down his face during his trip through the sewerage system anyway. The breasts were masterpiece however. Hearing no objections from your son, you untie the blue bikini and unveil them in their full glory. You squeeze the smooth orbs, running your fingers over the bullet-like nipples. \"Not bad, son,\" you admire. \"I'd give them a suck but I'd rather clean you up first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeizing his head, you give it a hard wrench. With a gurgling slurp, his entire body comes free from the U-bend, his vastly stretched legs snapping back into place like an elastic band, bursting from the toilet with a spray of water that almost knocks you on your arse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis wet, distended body lies coiled around itself on the bathroom tiles like a snake, gradually shrinking and returning to the shape of a young, attractive woman. He groans softly, out cold from the alcohol.</span></div></div>",

With only a little force, his jaw is soon stretched wide once again. Wide enough for his old man. You insert your foot between his lips, then the other. His gums seal around your ankles. You're not sure how to go about this but it makes sense to treat him as you would a pair of trousers. His neck bulges as you wiggle your toes down the back of his throat and gullet. As you ankles pass through his vocal chords they silence his unconscious moans of pain nicely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time your feet are down inside his chest, you're struggling to pull his mouth up around your hips, fighting against the natural resistance of his flesh. After his lips slide up over your waist, it becomes easier. You maneuver in further by pulling rolls of Chris up over your legs and pushing them further up your body until eventually your feet are somewhere around his knees. His head was stretched just beneath your armpits. You squeeze your arms close to your chest before pushing them down her throat and wiggling them inside his own arms, so that you wore your son's hands like gloves. You pull up the rest of him so that his open jaw is just under your neck, his head hanging behind you like a hood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's very warm inside. The alcohol has worked admirably; there is next to no resistance as you wiggle your arms and legs inside his arms and legs, moving them as though they were your own. The only sign of life from the Chris suit is the slight tickling of the vibration of his vocal chords against your neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckle, admiring yourself in the bathroom mirror. Elastigirl clings tight as a second skin to your middle-aged body. It's not a perfect illusion, but the heavy breasts, the padding around the hips, and the junk in the trunk should be enough to fool most people that she'd simply put on a few pounds around the midriff. The only thing out of place is your male head atop her body. Stretching Elastigirl's mouth one last time, you pull his head over your head, his face over your face. Darkness envelopes you then you're staring out through his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is fantastic!\" you guffaw. You strike a superhero pose.

Seems to care only for making money through buying and selling abilities from super powered individuals. He is almost totally amoral, willing to bestow anybody with any power as long as they have the money.<br>\r\nStores abilities in his body through touch but cannot use them himself. He is only able to grant abilities that he currently has in stock, so to speak - that is, powers that he has drained from other empowered individuals. As such, he usually asks why his client wants an ability and then grants one from what is available according to what will satisfy their needs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor protection he has a team of empowered individuals that are faithful to him. They will track down and kill anybody that crosses him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>The goons</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Hardcore\"</b><br>\r\nPowers - durability/shapeshifting<br>\r\nHardcore is a dour man of late middle-age with a sagging, jowly face; brown skin; and a thick Eastern European accent. On closer inspection, his flesh is revealed to be something resembling soft clay, which can be manipulated into a variety of different forms.<br>\r\nHis inorganic body is resilient to most damage. Bullets will barely make him flinch  Dismemberment will only serve to anger him. The only way to stop him permanently is to expose and destroy the solid stone core hidden within his body.<br>\r\nHis malleable flesh allows him to mimic the appearance of others. He is no great actor however. Whatever his form, his strong accent easily gives him away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Trance\"</b><br>\r\nPowers - hypnosis/telekinesis<br>\r\nTrance is a 30ish Englishman with rather striking eyes that shift through a variety of neon hues. His gaze is hypnotic - anybody that meets it becomes a puppet under his control. He has a manipulative, somewhat sadistic personality to match his abilities, but is notable afraid of his employer.<br>\r\nHas a limited telekinesis capable of flinging away objects in his close vicinity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Folk\"</b><br>\r\nPowers - self-duplication<br>\r\nFolk is a young, athletic woman capable of spawning physical copies of herself. These duplicates possess her memories and skills, and are capable of acting independently. While lacking in powers and individually quite weak they are a handy source of disposable soldiers for the Broker, able to overcome even the strongest empowered individuals through swamping them with sheer numbers.<br>\r\nUpon death, the clones melt away into pink goop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Funk\"</b><br>\r\nPowers - mood and mind-altering pheromones<br>\r\nFunk works for the Broker only on the promise that he will eventually receive a better power. He has the ability to emit (through unsavoury means) an assortment of gases and fumes from his body that effect those that breath them in a variety of ways, ranging from depression to arousal, aggression, forgetfulness, or confusion. He can also expell a cloud of dense black smoke to escape dangerous situations.<br>\r\nHas few friends even among his team.</span></div></div>",

BROTHEL:</i> (or even just Brothel)</b> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrwell Williams was just your regular, everyday familyman that worked tirelessly to provide for the people he loved. But once he found out that his \u2018dedicated\u2019 wife was sleeping out with his younger brother, his walls began to crash down. Following a heated divorce and a biased custody agreement for their children, Orwell tried seeking a way to fill the void that his wife had left in his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned to drugs, sex and crime to satiate his needs but it still wasn\u2019t enough. He was a smart man and began to offer his intelligence to whatever organised crime syndicates could pay enough to support his new lifestyle. This however was still not enough money to keep him afloat and he began racking up huge debts to his former employers. The most notable of these was The Power Broker. The Broker sensed this is an opportunity to help himself out and agreed to annul Orwell\u2019s debts on the condition that he dedicated his life to running The Broker\u2019s prostitution rings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrwell readily agreed and (after transforming into an irresistible succubus) cleaned himself up and transformed The Broker\u2019s Brothels into a booming business. The Broker bestowed upon him (her) the power of reality manipulation, allowing Brothel to alter anyone or anything that enters the brothel to her personal whim. These powers allow her to alter the physical compositions of the mental dispositions of whoever she wants, making her nigh omnipotent in her element. She also possesses shapeshifting and seduction powers, making herself irresistible to whomever she chooses and bending them to her will. Her seduction powers allow her to control the libidos of others, making her a very successful brothel owner indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough her reality manipulation powers put her on par with The Power Broker theoretically, the deal that they agreed restricts Brothel\u2019s powers: although she\u2019s a very powerful person, she is not as strong out of her element and her powers of reality manipulation are severely diminished. That being said, her powers of seduction could mean she could create a loyal army of people to follow and support her in and around communities so she could still retain her metaphorical \u2018power\u2019 even without the wider skill of reality manipulation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"cblue\">(Note: <i>sorry that this is so long. Don\u2019t even know if anyone\u2019s going to use it but I got really into the origin whilst I was writing and didn\u2019t seem to be able to stop \ud83d\ude05. Anyways, hope you enjoyed this little character intro)</i></span></b><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
