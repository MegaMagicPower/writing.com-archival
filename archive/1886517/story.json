You get thirsty, so you go and get a drink. When you get back, the TV screen is shining very brightly. \"What's wrong with my TV?\" You ask yourself as you walk over to inspect it. When you get close to the TV, you try unplugging it, but it doesn't turn off. <i>\"Why didn't it turn off? maybe I should-!\"</i>. Your thoughts were interrupted by the sound of the TV whirring. The harsh light then began to get brighter and brighter until it was so bright that you had to look away. You took one last look at the screen, and everything suddenly went black. The TV stopped shining, but you were gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to regain consciousness. You feel your eyes burning and your body aching. <i>\"What happened?\"</i> you think, '<i>Am I... Blind?'</i>. You attempt to open your eyes, and with difficulty, you do. You get up, and try to figure out where you are. You look around for a bit, and inspect the area to see if you can find out how you got here.

Why are you doing this!?!?? What's going o-GAH!\" Suicune started to lick you all over and move you you around her mouth at painful speeds, as if to get you to shut up.

You can talk!!?!\" You yelled. \"Yes\" she said, \"all legendary Pokemon can talk, we just choose not to unless we need to communicate with humans.\" You take a minute to take this in, then you ask, \"So, why did you bring me here?

While you were trying to get her attention you noticed her ear flick \u201cyes she heard me\u201d you sighed in relief but your relief was short lived when you saw the underside of her sandal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCrap!!\u201d You quickly dived out of the way as the vixens foot came down missing you by inches. \u201cHello who\u2019s there?\u201d You heard Krystal say. Jumping back up to your feet you began shouting again and this time she saw you. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d The vixen said as she squats down to get a better look at the strange creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn\u2019t help but blush a little at the sight of her crotch hanging overhead there was something else you noticed beside the faint outline of a camel toe. You expected Krystal to either be wearing a jump suit or her tribal clothing but she was wearing a tank top some sweatpants and sandals. The vixen noticed your staring and started to growling \u201chey my eyes are up here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes immediately darted back to her face when you heard her talk \u201ccrap I think I made her mad\u201d you thought. \u201cSorry it\u2019s just...well...your so big\u201d you finished awkwardly. Krystal just had an amused look on her face \u201chaha I don\u2019t think I\u2019m big maybe your just tiny\u201d the vixen said playfully. You just shrugged \u201cyeah maybe your right...oh wait a second do you know were we are!\u201d You said frantically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour in my cargo bay which reminds me what are you doing in here and how did you get on board?\u201d Krystal said. \u201cI have no idea...one second I\u2019m at home watching TV and now I\u2019m here\u201d you said gesturing around you. Krystal hummed in thought \u201cwell I can\u2019t think of anyway you could\u2019ve gotten on board\u201d Krystal said giving an hopeless shrug. You started to feel a little dizzy from realising just how screwed you are. Krystal noticed your worried look \u201cHey don\u2019t worry I\u2019ll look after you at least until we can find out how you got here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou perked up a little at hearing Krystal say she\u2019ll take care of you \u201cthank you miss you have you idea how grateful I am\u201d you said giving a little bow. Krystal giggled at how polite you were being \u201cwell I can\u2019t just leave a poor little thing like yourself to wander around and having to dodge my every step now can I\u201d Krystal said jokingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah you got that right big foot\u201d you joked back. \u201cSo um what now then?\u201d You said. \u201cWell first things first let\u2019s get out of here\u201d Krystal said placing her hand beside you to climb on. Hesitantly you climbed onto her palm and sat down while she stood up and left the cargo bay heading to. </span></div></div>",

On the other hand if it seemed like something from Assault then that might not be so bad since there were only three members and were considered anti-heroes which you thought was cool when they helped out the Star Fox Team a few times in that game.

A bright flash of light burst out of nowhere engulfing you and your surroundings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your eyes after experiencing this sudden burst of light to find yourself no longer in your house but next to trees next to a river the grass notably soft but rough at the same time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize that you weren't dreaming when someone yelled.\"Look out!\" As you turned to see who said it something it you knocking you off your feet leaving you with a grase on your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oow!

When you did though you quickly realized taht you weren't in front of your TV anymore. Not only that, but it didn't look like you were in your own world anymore. And upon looking around the area you soon realized that worse yet was that you had somehow shrunk and were now in a museum trapped inside a glass case with a large diamond. Thoughts began to race through you head of how did you get here? And how could you find your way back home to your world? (if there was a way to get back)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet no answer came to you as you let out a heavy sigh and said out loud, \"Well, I guess I have no choice but wait in here until someone shows up. Hopefully I'll be to get their attention and maybe I can ask for their help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight you had uttered those words though your attention was brought towards the ceiling of the building as you a lone figure pull out a something before they put up against the glass and cut a circle through it. Once this happened you saw the glass formed circle was easily lifted upward before it set down next to the opening. After this was done your eyes widen in shock when you saw the figure lower a rope downward before they slid down it revealing that it was the anthro raccoon thief Sly Cooper himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing this though only caused your mouth to go agape as you said to yourself, \"Sly Cooper? I can't believe that I ended up in his game and that his actually right in front of me. This is so weird and yet awesome at the same time since I've always thought he was pretty cool.\" You quickly shook your from side to side before you added, \"No, I can't let myself get distracted. I have to try and get attention when he get over here since I know that he may be a thief. But he is actually a good guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were broken out of your thoughts when you heard the hazel's eyed thief's voice from outside the glass casing as he pressed hius finger towards his right ear and said into the ear piece, \"Okay Bentley, I've made it the diamond without any problems actually. I should be able to meet you and Murray in the back of the building in no time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then saw the well fit raccoon use that same tool from early to cut another circle like hole. And once you saw him make an opening you quickly took your chance and called out, \"Excuse me, Sly. Please look down here. I need your help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the only question was did the gray and black ring tailed thief notice you?</span></div></div>",

I thought I was going to die! how did I come out without injuries?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Chris was questioning how he was alive, Falco had finally come to a conclusion, <i>\"So, his body is able to take extreme pain and pressure but not be damaged?</i>\" Falco thought,<i> \"then I know just where to put him!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Chris, are your eyes still impaired?\" Falco asked. \"Yeah, they are.\" Chris answered, \"Everything is blurry and dark. I can't even tell my right hand from my left hand!\". Falco nodded and pretended to keep thinking for about one more minute until he spoke up, \"Chris, I think I have finally found out a place where you can live!\" Chris perked up at his comment, \"Really! Where!\" he said eagerly. \"here, let me help guide you to it\" said Falco as he closed his fist around Chris and entered his arwing, with an unsuspecting Chris in his hand and an evil grin on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere is Falco going to put Chris?</span></div></div>",

Some of the structures seemed to be surrounded by various weapons, and you could smell several strong scents coming from others. In the west, you could see massive brown pillars towering in the distance, which you presume to be trees making up a forest. The east didn't seem to have anything in particular in it, only more grass, and a path that stretched through it. The south seemed to be a more mountainous area, and you could see what looked to be a waterfall in the distance, which you assumed led to a river.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough the north seemed to be the most logical choice to go for help, you could feel more of those strong rumbles, which you now presumed to be footsteps, coming from the forest as well.
