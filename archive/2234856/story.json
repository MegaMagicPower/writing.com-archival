A bright light shines into your eyes, forcing you to shield them and get up. As you look around, you see that the light is the sun. You\u2019re outside, alone, with no idea where you could be. That\u2019s just marvellous. As you look more carefully, you can see a number of barns and stables. You must be on some kind of farm. Maybe if you can find some people you can get help. Where do you go to first?</span></div></div>",

Despite the small flicker of hope inside you, there is no one here except for a number of plump, well fed cows. Judging by the smell of the stable, there might not even be people here at all. As you go to leave, there\u2019s a sign above the door that says \u201cmilk Jess before leaving\u201d. Normally you\u2019d ignore the sign, but looking at the size of those cows, it might be a good idea to obey it. What do you do?</span></div></div>",

So, you decide to go through the cow shed and find Jess. The cows mooed and looked at you as you passed by them. Soon, you come across large pen with the largest cow you'd ever seen. Sure enough, carved on the wooden fence-gate was the name \"Jess\". Examining the cow, you notice her udders were quite swollen and were in desperate need of milking. Fortunately, beside the gate were two buckets. Taking the two buckets, you entered her pen and sat down on the stool beneath her. You began to slowly squeeze and move the udders as Jess moos in relief. The milking continues as the first bucket is half filled when you feel a sudden shove from her hind legs, kicking you down. As you looked up, you saw...</font></span></div></div>",

As you approach the coop, the sound of clucking gets louder and louder. You see before you the fairly small door to the coop, locked with a latch. With a simple sweep, you unlatch the door and enter the coop. The coop is neatly organized as the hens sit comfortably on their nests. They eyed you curiously as you entered their domain. Examine the room, you see a very particular hen. On a higher perch was a very large hen, beside her was a sign that read \"Big Deborah\". Deborah got down from her perch and appraoched you. Thinking she was being friendly, you got onto one knee for her, but she then lurched at you...</font></span></div></div>",

As you look around, you cold see many large, rotund pigs feeding on their cornmeal. But, there are two that notice you come in. Both pigs were bigger than the rest of them, both in height and width.

The theme is the main character (you) waking up on a strange farm you have never seen before. There are no people, just some overly friendly animals<br>\r\nSome rules:<br>\r\nI will allow any animals that belong on a farm (pigs, cows, horses, donkeys, chickens etc) but no mythical animals like dragons or werewolves, and no making the animals talk. I will have a separate story for that. All themes are allowed, and gross stuff is heavily encouraged. Last thing, I don\u2019t want any weak entries that are only three lines long. I want each one to be as detailed as possible please. Any weak entries will be deleted.<br>\r\nBut enough of my ranting, please enjoy the story ^^</td>",
