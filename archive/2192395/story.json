Upon the deck of the cabin, a sliding glass door opens onto a room that is empty, save for a server bank in a corner, a laptop on a table near the servers, and a colossal pentacle drawn upon the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this moment, two souls have stumbled upon the cabin, condemning themselves and, possibly, the world, to an eternity of pleasure that they would never have asked for but now beg for with every fiber of their being. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question is, who are these two souls? </span></div></div>",

He could have been at the club every night, drunk off his ass and banging whoever and whatever was smart enough to go along for the ride. Even if the army of lawyers and doctors he kept on hand couldn't overcome the wave of paternity suits and STDs, the money it cost would barely be a dent in his fortune. But no, he kept out in the woods fucking around with moonchild shit, talking about Isaac Newton and Alaister Crow or whoever. Whatever. The old man wasn't seen for a couple years, and if nothing else he could sell the cabin for enough cash to get a new car, some blow, or new implants for...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lost his train of thought as Candi's ass came into view. Genetics, years of devotion to squats, and generous amounts of some kind of silicone alloy that had too many hyphens and numbers for Bruce to pay attention to had left his wife with a booty that had so many purposes. Eye candy. Cushioning during sex. Endless expanses of skin to grope. An extra few inches of height while she sat. An impromptu end table that he could stack a plate and a couple beers on while he watched TV. Destroying metric tons of yoga pants. He smiled as she strode in, her ass jiggling obscenely with each step. If fibers could talk, her pants would be screaming.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, Brucey! This place is like, a total dump! Why did your daddy keep it around?\" She strode into view and Bruce nearly died from blood loss. If Candi's ass was a miracle of nature and science, her body was the work of a perverted god. Her thick, well-muscled legs extended down from her inhumanly bulging ass, ending in a pair of high heels that a masochistic ballerina would describe as \"a nightmare to walk in\". Above the gleaming, jiggling expanse of her ass was a waist warped into geometry-defying slimness by years of exercise and titanium-boned corsets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurther up Candi's body, her one-woman crusade against the spandex of the world continued. Candi's breasts burst forth from her chest like a pair of fleshy planets. On the multiple occasions that Candi hugged her own breasts in delight, she struggled to contain her own boobs within her arms. With each breath, the spherical expanse of her breasts threatened to shred her skin-tight top, a spandex-heavy number bearing the distorted slogan \"Sex Toy\" across the chest, and expose her perpetually-stiff nipples to the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandi's uncannily-designed face was smooth and blemishless, save for her lips, which were pumped up with enough collagen to turn her mouth into a perpetually-agape, drooling hole surrounded by pink, fleshy mounds the size of sausages. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a cherry on top, Bruce had paid to install an internal vibrator surrounding Candi's labia, pulsing just often enough to keep her aroused and distracted. Not that she needed to be distracted. Bruce's taste in women trended heavily towards the \"box of rocks\" end of the scale. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce had kept Candi a secret from the public. If any woman found out that she existed, the entirety of humanity would descend into a war between the sexes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Brucey? Are you staring at my boobies again?\" Bruce shook his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I uh. No. No, of course not.\" Candi pouted, turning her lips into a rolling mass that defied description and vision alike. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was, uh, too busy looking at the rest of you.\" Candi smiled. \"I don't know why the old man kept this shit around. All we need to do is sort this shit out, hire a company to clear out the furniture, sell the place, and I can plow you up on that deck before we leave.\" Candi laughed and clapped her hands while she hopped in place, leading to a bouncing cascade of flesh that could have concussed a buffalo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay!\" she said, and went sprinting for the stairwell. \"Let's start now!\" Bruce followed, in the fog of lust and stupidity that sustained him throughout his life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce stared at the room and thought of the weird heavy metal albums that his cousin had. In the center, a pentagram was drawn in blood. The room--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh Bruce?\" said Candi. \"There's like, something on this laptop. Could you read it for me?\" Bruce stepped over. He never knew if Candi legitimately couldn't read, but he wanted to take his mind off of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Day 1,\" read Bruce. \"The program is a success. I was able to change the paint in this room from black to blue without a single problem.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, boring!\" said Candi. \"You mean that your daddy wasn't having sex in this place?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait,\" said Bruce. \"Day 5. The experiments with Miss Lana are going according to plan. She was a bit surprised, but losing twenty years of age and gaining five cup sizes kept her happy.\" Candi smiled slightly. Bruce kept going. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Day 12,\" he read, \"Things aren't quite going to plan. When I placed increased submissiveness into Lana's profile, she stripped, went limp, and spread her legs. The addition of the arousal program nearly flooded the basement, but thankfully I managed to get the undo function to work.\" Candi cocked her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you mean that he was actually doing magic in here?! I thought he was killing goats for like, the devil or something!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Waitwait,\" said Bruce. \"Day 30: no matter what I do, I must be careful to keep my programming exact. My recent augmentation of Lana's breasts nearly destroyed the cabin.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yaaay!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The entry ends there. It doesn't continue until...Day 69.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YAAAAAY!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait wait. Day 69: I have made the gravest mistake of my life creating this monstrosity of a program. Weeks upon weeks of fornication have bought me only a few minutes of Goddess Lana's unconsciousness. Even now, the breast-lined cavern of her womanhood presses in upon me, and the blind twitching of her tongues drive my exhausted cock into desperate arousal. In my ignorance and hubris, I have created this sexual goddess, the Mistress of This Earth. I cannot let her loose upon the world. She is the fruit of my labors, the price I pay for my foolishness. I must protect the world from her, and, in my heart of hearts, I wish her solely for myself. Upon finishing this statement, I will use this program to flush myself and the fleshy, jiggling mass that was once my lover into a world where we can be alone. God help me. Should anyone read this, pity me, for I am condemned to a hell of pleasure I still cannot comprehend. I beg you. Destroy this computer.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, what? What is he saying?\" asked Candi. A hand was thrust down the glorified waistband that she called pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I don't know,\" said Bruce. \"I think this might be bad news.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on, Brucey!\" said Candi. \"Magic isn't real! Let's see if he had any good porn on his computer!\" Candi poked at the keyboard, revealing a screen of green text and strange blocks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn that moment, as Bruce and Candi stared at the keyboard...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Candice took a second, looked over at Bruce, and rolled her eyes as he stared at his father's computer. He thought <i>he</i> was the smart one in the relationship? Candi had to literally fake illiteracy to make Bruce feel better about himself and keep the fancy-new-silicone-money rolling in. Now he was staring, dumbstruck at a computer program that either A: was his dad's weird form of fetish roleplay, or B: literally had the power of a god. Thank god he was hot and decent in bed; the prenup didn't leave much room for her to get anything if she lost her patience. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be fair, finding out that your dad had a John Carpenter fetish must be a bit much to take in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be even <i>more</i> fair, it was difficult for Bruce to be any kind of struck other than dumbstruck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce blinked, apparently not noticing Candice as she stood. Honestly, this day was pretty awesome. If her suspicions were right, she could warp reality in a few strokes of a keyboard and get whatever she wanted in life. If her suspicions were wrong, she could plant a seed of doubt into Bruce's mind, work up his insecurities, play them for all they were worth as he tried to forget the time he thought his dad was a sex-wizard, and still get most of what she wanted in life. Honestly, at this point she was doing way better with her life than she ever thought she would. Amazing how far an acting degree, a fetish for cosmetic surgery, and an even bigger fetish for bizarre proportions were able to get her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandi sighed in a mixture of contentment and exasperation as she swung her hips away from Bruce.  Life was awesome, and hubby dearest was too stupid to understand why. Ah well, she thought as she swung the silicone wrecking balls of her buttocks at Bruce's shoulder, sometimes you had to be a bit forward. Or, like, backward. Teehee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe force of the blow sent Bruce flying. A giant weight on a pendulum can do that to a man, Candi found, and she had to keep herself from riding the nearest hard object every time she remembered. She practically came the first time she knocked a man out with her ass. He never saw it coming, but the look of vacant, unconscious bliss on his face...she returned to reality with a shake of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, sorry Brucie!\" said Candi, \"I really, really wanna find out if this is real and I know my big booty didn't hurt you.\" She didn't bother looking down as she planted herself in front of the computer. \"I'm gonna make a wish!\" She gave herself a moment of thought. What she wanted was obvious, but if she was going to go hog wild with dark magic, she had to be smart about it. How to phrase her wish?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have giant boobies,\" she giggled as she typed, \"and now matter how giant they get, I'll still be able to move like a normal person without a problem!\"  She tapped Enter, and glanced over at Bruce. He was staring up at her in confusion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I thought you couldn't....\" Oh shit. Right. She forgot that bit of the act. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know how to read <i>fun</i> words, silly!\" She hoisted her gigantic ass off the ground and strode over to the middle of the room. \"Now keep an eye on my girls!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I thought you didn't believe in...\" Christ, he was getting annoying. Most men with his inclinations would kill for a chance to shut up and stare at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't matter, Brucie!\" she said, \"If it doesn't work, you'll get to watch me bounce my big boobies, and if it does, well...\" She trailed off as she felt an unusual tingling in her chest. \"Whoopsie! Looks like it might be working!\" She looked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was all she could do to keep from swearing out loud in surprise. Something was happening, all right. She felt a slight twinge in her breasts, around the tissue that was surrounding her implants, and then the skin felt...cold? Yeah, cold. But it was getting warmer, then numb, and then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant, a sensation erupted in the deepest reaches of Candi's breasts. <i>That shouldn't happen,</i>  she thought to herself. <i>unless...</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandi considered what life would be like with tits made of living silicone for the briefest second before the mere feeling of life in her breasts turned into a rush of pleasure. \"Oooooh, fuck!\" she cried as she fell forwards, mercifully landing on a pair of enormous cushions that presently could only feel pleasure. \"Oh fucking hell!\" She shoved a hand towards her soaking pussy. She could feel a wave of skin starting to crawl up and down her body, cushioning more and more of her as her feet started to lift off of the ground. She groaned in pleasure as she rubbed at her crotch before finally moving both hands to her swelling breasts, grinding her hips against them as she squeezed. Oh god, this was better than anything she ever felt before, and that <i>included</i> the time in college that she popped a molly and strapped herself into Bruce's dad's hydraulic fucking machine. She could feel each inch--no each liter, cubic foot, fuck who even cared, of her breasts grow out past the top of her head, then the top of her feat, as she rubbed herself against her newly-grown tits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of curiosity, she opened her eyes to see how she was progressing. At this point her head was even further off the ground  than it would have been if she was standing in her bare feet. Bruce had stood up, and was staring at her in a mixture of disbelief and arousal. She could see her breasts pulsing rhythmically under her, like  a slow motion video of a water balloon being filled. She barely kept herself from drooling as a surge of growth lifted her gaze to be even with Bruce's own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there, honey,\" she purred, \"looks like I'm the taller one in this relationship no-ah-ah...<i>AH!</i>\" She surged up another foot off the ground as she game, her breasts growing to match the climax of her arousal.  She caught her breath and looked around. Nothing was in her field of vision except for some walls, some more walls, and, of course, the all-encompassing expanse of her bustline. \"Oh yeah,\" she muttered to herself, not even bothering with the bimbo voice, \"I was supposed to be able to move.\" She rolled to one side, but her breasts didn't cooperate. She leaned backwards, trying to roll herself back. Nothing. She was about to give up hope, when a voice whispered in the back of her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Peasants walk. Queens ride in a single chariot. You have two now.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandice puzzled for a moment. As far as cryptic magic messages went, it left a bit to be desired. How could she use her breasts to mov--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandice slapped the silicone mass beneath her in delight as she felt her two-ton-tits start to shrink and grow of their own accord, rolling her comparatively tiny body forward. She stared down at Bruce, a Cheshire-Cat-tier grin spreading over her collagen-saturated lips as he stammered. Yup, that's right, she thought. Your wife is a sex goddess with giant silicone-amoeba-tits. Soak it in, babe. She glanced down at the admittedly-large tent being pitched in his jeans, then shifted her gaze over to the computer, and made a decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yoink!\" she cried. She snatched the laptop out of her idiot husband's reach and rolled back up onto the sexiest cushions the world could have provided her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Candi, wait! What's going on?! What are you doing up there?!\" Little jolts of arousal surged through Candi's gloriously-disproportioned body as she could feel Bruce trying to climb up to see her. She pulsed one of her boobs, sending him sprawling to the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry honey,\" she told Bruce, \"I have to drop the act for a second. This could be the best thing that ever happened to me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...but...what's going...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep your pretty mouth shut and it could be the best thing that ever happened to you too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce stopped stammering. Amazing. He really could be a good husband when he realized that his job was to shut up, look good, and let Candi do what she wanted. She really would need to reward him for this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut <i>how?</i></span></div></div>",

The deck groaned under her weight, threatening to collapse at any moment. She turned herself around, truly a feat in the limited space she had, and angled herself so she could make eye contact with Bruce. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, honey!\" she said. \"I'm gonna need a lot more space if I'm gonna have the fun I deserve!\" She compressed her breasts down, then pulsed them outwards, the force backwards off the deck. She flew threw the air, landing in the clearing outside a cabin with a booming thud. The force shot through Candi, spiking her brain with enough pleasure to be overwhelming, but not enough to be satisfying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh, we'll really need something special to get ourselves off now!</i> said a voice in her head. Candi furrowed her brow. That didn't feel like one of her thoughts.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Candi glanced up at the cabin. Bruce hadn't come out, which meant that he either was running in terror, rubbing his last two brain cells together to parse out what was going on, or rubbing something much more enjoyable. Either way, she was gonna have to back in there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis of course raised a logistical problem. While the mountains of magic silicone beneath her were the greatest thing that ever happened to her, they weren't exactly subtle or maneuverable. That was sort of their point, yes, but if she tried to leap back into the cabin, she'd probably crush through the floor. Fun, yes, but that could come later. Right now she needed an easier way of getting around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You could always--</i> said the voice in her head, but Candi had leapt into action. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"i can warp my whole body like I can warp my boobs,\" she typed, \"Like, I can redistribute my mass however I want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>--well shit. You're way easier to work with than the last two people to try me out.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandi felt a sudden pop from within her tits, and the cold began to spread throughout her body, leaving a tickling numbness in its wake. Against her better judgment, Candi giggled, idly running a hand between her legs. The ensuing warmth of the silicone becoming one with her body erupted within her, and she gasped as her eyes crossed and her toes curled. She regained her composure. Time to test this out. She glanced at her hand, and willed it to change. A smile crossed her lips as her fingers and nails grew longer into a manicured claw. With another idle thought, the skin on the back of her hand rippled, and a few tendrils of flesh emerged like long, tentacular fingers.She touched two of them together, and they merged, forming a soft, curving loop. She licked her bulbous lips, willing her hand back to normal. She pumped a few milliliters more mass into her lips, sealing her mouth shut; she was practically salivating in anticipation and didn't want this moment ruined by a strand of absent-minded drool. Oh yes, this was a game-changer. She moved her mass from her breasts upwards, sending some into her neck as she lengthened herself towards the cabin, moving like a snake made of silly putty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce was still in there, blankly staring at the floor. \"Hubby,\" she said, an evil grin crossing her lips, \"I told you to come out to the deck.\" Bruce eyes widened, his bulging muscles tensed as though waiting for permission from his brain to run. In an instant, Candi shifted her mass upwards from her breasts, through the long tendrils of her body, and into the cabin, recreating her former shape standing in the middle of the pentagram. She took a step towards him, and he started. He could probably see the strands of flesh connecting her to the rest of her mass outside. \"It's okay, honey,\" she said, trying to keep her intent from entering her voice. It's not like she was gonna hurt him, but good lord did she feel a swelling of malevolent anticipation within her...wherever her heart would be in her body right now. \"It's okay, just come here.\" Nothing. Candi rolled her eyes. \"Ah well, looks like you need a moment to reboot. Let me help!\" Her torso surged outwards, wrapping around Bruce's body in an instant. He gasped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh...what?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good,\" giggled Candi, \"you can still talk. Let's see if you can after this!\" She some of her mass into the part of her torso that was wrapped around her husband, stretching it upwards like a fleshy zentai suit over his body. As it engulfed his head, she willed some porousness into it. Smothering her man was fun, sure, but not when it would kill him. She moved more of her mass from her breasts outside into her husband's prison, adding layer after layer of her magic flesh around him. She stretched her neck out to the other side of the room, watching as the pink mass grew as spherical as her old implants. Within seconds, she had moved herself entirely back into the cabin, leaving Bruce engulfed in tons of warm, squishy glory and dragging the laptop back inside. Couldn't have that go missing. Candi wondered if Bruce really appreciated what she could do for him right now. She guessed she could find out. She retracted her neck back towards the rest of her body, shivering in jiggly delight as she felt her head merge with the rest of herself. She fumbled around inside herself, locating the struggling mass of Bruce's body. She opened up a cavity around his upper half, leaving his limbs restrained, while she dragged the laptop in to shine some light within her. She willed her head, arms and shoulders into being just in front of Bruce's restrained form. He struggled against her, sending little ripples of ecstasy through her body. She drew herself upwards a bit, showing him a line of cleavage running from her sternum into the base of the fleshy cavern. The laptop shone its sterile light on Bruce. From his perspective, he must have felt like he was trapped up to his waist in a cave made of warm, jiggling flesh, with Candi's canyon-like cleavage leading upwards to her as it emerged from the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, hi!\" she giggled. \"Looks like I've got an even better body than I thought!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck,\" said Bruce. \"What the fuck is happening?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, <i>Brucie,</i>\" whined Candi, \"Don't say that you're mad at me! I did this for you! Think of all the fun we could have!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fun?! What fu--\" Candi leaned in, her lips expanding to the thickness of beer cans, and kissed him. She poured mass into her tongue as it explored his mouth and then his throat. He could feel him choking, so she paused, enjoying the moment, and then withdrew her tongue and mouth. His face was slick with lip gloss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's what getting deep throated feels like. I see why you liked it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh...what are you going to do to me?!\" demanded Bruce. Candi shook her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Bruce,\" she said, tinging her Valley-Girl act with heavy doses of faux-concern, \"I'm so disappointed! I really thought you were gonna like the new me!\" Candi paused, pursing her  lips and swelling them ever so slightly. \"But then again, I haven't really done anything for you with it.\" She nodded and smiled, her sincerity terrifying Bruce more than her faux-dumb menace. \"Okay! I know what I can do! I can give you the tittyfuck of a lifetime!\" Bruce nearly smiled, and Candi took that as all the consent she needed. She surged her mass forward again, closing the cavern around Bruce and plunging him into soft, warm, perfume-scented darkness. She poured her mass into his clothes, ripping them off as she caressed every inch of his skin. She poured tendrils of herself down his throat, taking care not to set off his gag reflex. She thought for a moment and opened a cavity within herself for her computer and face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bruce's body is an inferior model of mine,\" she typed with tentacles of flesh trailing from the ceiling, \"It doesn't have any icky biological processes going on in it--\" she paused \"-- aside from getting hard and cumming. Also, he can't change his body like I can but he can be stretched and squeezed by something other than himself. And it doesn't hurt.\" She nodded, closed the laptop, and filled in her cavity, leaving her husband and computer immobilized in a skintight prison of softness. There. Now for the fun to begin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fear-driven spark of rationality in Bruce's brain had shut down once again. He was trapped in his wife's...breasts? Ass? Body in general? Who knew. It was covering every inch of him, leaving him blind and trapped in soft, warm flesh. Were it not for the fact that he knew he was at the mercy of his wife, who had somehow turned herself into some kind of blob monster, it would have been nice. But, as it were--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce felt cold and numb. It soaked through his body like autumn rain, but in an instant was gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that things got worse. Candi's body shut forward into his mouth and nose, filling them up and shooting down his throat. Behind him...oh god she was going up there too. He could feel her flesh pouring up and down through his GI tract. Bruce wondered what would happen to the Taco Bell he had eaten this morning as the two appendages met and fused within him, but didn't have time to finish that thought. Suddenly, Candi's flesh began to pull and squeeze at his cock and swell within his body. Pulse after aching pulse of pleasure swelled within him as he felt his dick stretch and his body swell and contract with each motion of his wife's amorphous form. He struggled, more in overwhelmed ecstasy than fear, and arched his back, his body futilely struggling against his prison of flesh and silicone. He could feel himself needing to cum, but Candi had pillowy vicegrip on his member, keeping him locked into his desperate need. He kicked and struggled and tried to scream, but couldn't. He couldn't move, he couldn't cum, he couldn't take this anymore. He needed release in so many different ways. His vision began to fade as his mind shut down from shock, horror, and torturous pleasure, when in an instant he came, spurting into the eternal sea of his wife's body. In spite of himself, he smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandi withdrew himself from her husband, incorporating his cum into herself as she did so. Another teaspoon of growth couldn't hurt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe formed her body on one end of the room, warping the rest of her mass around behind her,  and eased herself down. She looked down at Bruce as she sat on her colossal ass like a queen on a jiggling, truck sized throne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, honey?\" she asked, \"What did you think?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I can't believe...oh god,\" he gasped. He struggled to pull himself upwards, but his limbs were still limp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad to hear that!\" Candi said as she clapped and giggled. \"What now?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I think that...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce rolled over...</span></div></div>",

He took a deep breath, wrapped his hands around the laptop, rolled over, and opened it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\" shouted Candi from behind him, fear and rage turning her voice into a banshee's wail. He moved the cursor over to the wire-frame window under the command line.

Her face looked like that of a mad queen as the guillotine blade descended towards her neck. The frozen form of a roiling torrent of flesh stretched from her back, leaving her looking like she was swimming through her own body to get to him. Behind that, a placid monolith of Candi's mass filled the room. He picked up the computer and retreated to the opposite side of the room. He sat down and stared blankly at Candice's--Candi didn't really fit the raging lust-demon frozen on the floor before him-- form. He needed to fix this. But how? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This couldn't happen! She was the ruler of this world. Oh, there would be a reckoning. she'd take the computer into herself, and take its powers and twisted wisdom for her own. The world couldn't comprehend what she would do to Bruce, much less themselves. The universe would be a re--a rel--like, a <i>place?</i> Yeah, like, a place where...where she could cum as much as she wanted, but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>NO!</i> she thought, the strange voice within her draining away. No, she could beat this, thing, Bruce was an idiot! A worm to be crushed, a sex toy to be used and shoved inside of her, a...like, a totally yummy cumshot between her big blobby boobies! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, like, sure she'd take over the uni--the yoo--the world and stuff, but Bruce'd be there to help!

He took a deep breath, and unpaused Candi.  Her body fell to the floor, limp and trembling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Candic--I mean, Candi?\" asked Bruce as stepped towards the blob-creature that seconds ago threatened to engulf him. He strode closer and knelt down beside her. \"Are...are you okay?\" He reached out a hand and poked Candi in the arm. A whip-fast tendril of flesh shot out from Candi and wrapped around his wrist. He fell back in shock. Oh god, oh god it didn't work, she was gonna--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, surprise honey!\" said Candi as she twisted her head upwards and stretched it towards him. \"Did you think I was like, dead or whatever?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...what are you gonna do?\" asked Bruce. Candi seemed happy right now, but Candi had <i>seemed</i> like a glorified sexbot for the past five years, so who knows what was going on in that...did she still even have a brain? Whatever. That mind of hers. She pouted her lips, and they swelled obscenely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, Bwucie,\" said Candi, \"are you scared I'm gonna be mean to you? I'm sowwy for that. I don't know what I was thinking!\" She giggled \"I don't know what I'm thinking now either!\" She oozed herself forwards, stretching her elastic arms around him and hugging him to a chest that was twice the size of Bruce's normal armspan. Her lips swelled even further as she stretched her head towards him. She shoved his face into a kiss, his head sinking into the cartoonish expanse of her lips, releasing him with a smacking noise and leaving his entire face covered in lip gloss. \"I do know that you're like, smart enough to use that computer to its po...pote...better than I can! And--\" she wrapped a tendril around his cock. It had grown another mouth and was beginning to lick his terrified erection \"I know that you're too yummy to be mad at! So you can use that big thing however you want.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce nodded, trying to keep a hold of himself as he grabbed the computer again.

He heard a giggle as he felt something hop down from his head, onto his shoulder, and onto the floor. Candi regrew to her pre-transformation size and grinned. \"This <i>is</i> fun!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce wiped his forehead. Things were getting back to some semblance of normalcy now. All that was left to do now was--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you still want me to have fun, honey?\" asked Candi. She pouted and swelled her lips to the size of salamis, leaving her glossy pout obscuring her nose and chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce snapped back to reality. \"Oh, uh. Sure, yeah. Go nuts.\"  A ripple began to emanate across Candi's body as she shook with excitement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I know what would be <i>really fun,</i>\" she cooed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what are you--\" began Bruce. He didn't have time to finish his question as Candi suddenly exploded outwards in all directions, her now-amorphous form growing at a breakneck pace. The wall of flesh knocked Bruce off his feet, sending him sprawling to the ground and leaving him to be engulfed by his wife. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few minutes were a dark blur of noises. Bruce could hear wood snapping and glass shattering as Candi's innocent giggling rippled through her body. Bruce reflected on the stupidity of telling a shapeshifting ditz to \"go nuts\" as he heard what sounded like trees being uprooted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, Bruce was freed from his fleshy prison. He wiped his eyes as he stood up and looked at the world around him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no,\" he whispered. Candi had leveled everything for miles around with her growth, leaving a vast stretch of glistening, soft skin. Curvy, giggling distortions of the new landscape bulged from the ground beneath them, resembling Candi save for minor differences like \"three extra mouths,\" \"having a body made of giant, dripping breasts,\" or \"having a gargantuan tongue that was wrapping around his body and binding him in place.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh <i>god no</i>.\" He struggled against his slick bindings as the tip of the Candi-thing's tongue teased at his neck. He recoiled, trying to suppress his moan. \"Candi, stop! I'm telling you to stop!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo response. The woman-shaped blob in front of him giggled and bounced her breasts at him as the grew to dwarf her torso. The most confused, horrified boner of Bruce's life began to stir. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm behind you, honey!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce could feel the booming voice of his wife send shockwaves through the landscape that was her new form, shaking him to his bones. With some effort he turned around within his prison. Before him was a colossal wall of flesh. He cast his eyes upwards. Then tilted his head upwards. Then looked upwards further still. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove him was the giant, grinning face of his wife. Her lips were still swollen from before; their face-encompassing girth would have dwarfed Bruce's SUV. One of her arms was trying and failing to support her mountainous breasts; she could barely wrap her fingers beneath a single behemoth tit. Their immense bulk cast a shadow to Candi's side, plunging acres of what had once been forest into darkness. Her slim waist extended beneath her obscured ribs and vanished into the pillar of all-too-inviting flesh beneath. She smiled further when she saw Bruce's face, waving an enormous, pink-nail-sporting hand as she did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, babe!\" she said. \"Did I tie you up by mistake?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" shouted Bruce. Candi didn't seem to notice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry! It looks like I lose co--co--I can't move my body so well when I'm this big.\" She gestured to herself as if to clarify what she meant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thousand thoughts raced through Bruce's head. In the middle of nowhere or not, somebody could probably see Candi. What's more, they had lost the computer, so who knows how they were gonna fix this. And to make matters all the worse, this whole ordeal was kinda turning him on. He cleared his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me go!\" shouted Bruce. \"And shrink back down!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" asked Candi. She sprouted a third arm from her side and held it to her ear. \"I can't like, hear you all the way down there!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce struggled against his restraints. What had he done? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want me to keep having fun? My imaginary friend is telling me so many poss-possib-things I can do!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce didn't grasp what Candi had said. She was too dangerous to leave to her own devices. He took a deep breath and shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO! STOP!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\"</span></div></div>",

He was staring at the computer, wondering what he could put into the command line. Idiot. He had no vision, and yet he was the one in control. How dare he? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hey,</i> said the voice in her head, <i> You seem like you're in a bit of a pickle. Want some help? Who am I kidding, of course you do. One second, lemme reverse the time stop. Remember to go keep a hold on the computer. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA ripple shot through Candi, and her body shot forward, barreling into Bruce like water from a broken dam. She snatched the computer out of his hands with a tendril, drawing it deep into her body as the remainder of her bulk drove Bruce off his feet, slamming him into the wall. She stiffened a dome of herself around him, sealing him into place. She tapped out a few brief commands on the computer to ensure that she could have enough shapeshifting mojo to make this next bit work. She formed her torso and head, then began to set the scene for Bruce's punishment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandi stretched herself along the walls, floor and ceiling of the room, coating the surfaces in a foot-thick layer of Candi and sealing off the exits. She sent peristaltic waves through the parts of her surrounding Bruce, drawing him to the center of the room. The feeling of his form sliding through her body sent her pulse racing and her breath shallow. Somehow the nerves in Candi's body were on edge ever since the computer gave her this gift, and she was <i>not</i> complaining. Candi formed a pillar of her body in the center of the room and drew Bruce up into it. She dissolved her torso back into the mass of her body. Showtime. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all, Bruce had better days. Pretty much every day of his life qualified for that list, if he was being honest. Sure, he had a few bad days, but this took the cake. Finding that your dad was a weird sex-wizard, having your wife turn into a meaty, horny blob-thing, failing to stop her for some reason, then getting imprisoned in a weird prison of flesh added up to a pretty horrendous day. He tried to struggle free, but couldn't. Whatever Candi was now, she was strong as hell. He shook his head, screaming into the warm expanse of his wife's body, until his head emerged from its prison into the fresh air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf this was what the outside world was like, Bruce wanted to go back into the flesh prison. The walls, the floor, even the ceiling were covered with Candi's mass, forming a formless, skin-toned room. Formless, except for the giant, full-lipped mouth stretching across the wall in front of him. It pursed its lips, blindly blowing kisses at him, before it drew into a smile and opened, revealing a cavernous of expanse of mouth. A tongue the size of the room slithered out of the mouth toward Bruce and gingerly licked his face. Bruce shuddered, trying to steady his breath and...wait why was he hard? Wait, no, no time to think about that.Something was stirring in the back of the giant mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce's jaw dropped as he saw his wife strutting out towards him along the giant tongue, her hips and enormous ass swaying obscenely with every step. Her face was drawn into a stony mask of anger. She cleared the mouth's lips, and Bruce could more clearly make out her face. She was angry, yes, that was a given, but he could see her trying to resist biting her lower lip. This show wasn't just to scare him. She was getting a thrill out of this. Bruce might be able to survive this if he played his cards right. She reached the tip of the tongue,mere feet away from Bruce, and lowered herself, straddling the tongue as it licked the air. Candi was trying to suppress her panting, but a chest that large gave away every movement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" said Candi. \"You have been--\" she moaned slightly \"--<i>very</i> naughty.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Babe, I'm sorry I can--\" a tendril shot out from the wall and wrapped around his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You damn well better be sorry!\" shouted Candi, \"I've been handed the universe on a silver platter, and you think you're gonna take that from me? I'm a shapeshifting sex goddess, and I'm not gonna let you wuss out on my rise to power.\" Bruce tried to fix her with what he hoped were puppy-dog eyes. The wall's tongue was licking more violently now, and Candi was struggling to keep her face from showing any signs of pleasure. Bruce's cock was definitely doing a better job of trying to escape from its prison than the rest of his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmph\" said Bruce. Candi smiled for an instant, then moaned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm a merciful goddess, dear,\" she panted. \"I'm not gonna kill you.\" Bruce nodded in appreciation, but Candi maneuvered the tongue to place her nose-to-nose with him. \"But I most certainly am gonna punish you.\" Tendrils extended down from the ceiling, fusing with her back and holding her in place as the giant tongue withdrew and began to lick at her in earnest. She licked her lips  as she breathed heavily, her chest rising and falling like a stormy ocean. \"I guess the question is, what is it gonna be? I think it's gonna be...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The sooner she showed Bruce that this computer didn't work, the sooner she could ride his face, sell his dad's cabin, then ride his face some more. Really. Horrible eldritch magic. Who would--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandi started to feel amazing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce watched in something resembling interest as Candi's manicured fingernails typed the command in. There was a long pause. He shook his and stood up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, yeah, magic's not real,\" he said. \"I dunno what I was thinking.\" He turned towards the door, but turned back to see Candi lying on her back, bucking her hips into the air. \"C--Candi?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandi's body hurled itself off the floor, hovering in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Sorry, Bruce,</i>\" said Candi, \"<i>I've got a new friend in my head that's saying otherwise. She's telling me all sorts of fun stuff about how I ! Like, look at what I can do now!</i>\" Candi touched a talon-sharp fingernail to her pants, and they dissolved, leaving her hairless crotch exposed. \"<i>Y'know Bruce, you are actually a pretty good husband. I want you inside of me.</i>\" She gestured at her crotch. Her vulva begin to swell, growing to the size of a fist by the time Bruce realized what was changing.  The lips of her pussy were growing like the bud of a man-eating flower, spreading her legs as it grew to the size of Bruce's torso. He tried to move, but his feet were glued to the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Candi...please let me--\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"<i>You're too horny to move now, Brucie! Your lips and eyes say no, but your body's saying 'oh please please take me!'</i>\" Candi was rubbing an outer vulva the size of a beach ball, the opening tent of her pussy growing within it. Above the opening, a clit the size of Bruce's thumb was standing to attention. It quivered under Candi's touch, doubling in size as Candi panted. By now it was bigger than Bruce. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was enough for Bruce. He turned tail and made for the exit, only to find himself stopped by something wrapped around his waist. He looked down. A tongue. He turned around and saw it wasn't coming from Candi's mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god! Candi, stop! Please, stop!\" Candi laughed  as she dragged Bruce towards her dripping, Volkswagon-sized pussy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>A bit late for that, honey,</i>\" said Candi, \"<i>I'll try to make this good for you too.</i>\" In a single pull of her obscene tongue, she dragged Bruce inside of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce tried to open his eyes, but could see nothing. Candi's enormous, sopping vagina was pressing in on him from all sides, crushing in on him with shuddering pulses as it continued to grow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I hope I'm not too tight for you, babe</i>, said Candi's voice in his head, <i>but at this point I'm a big girl, and if I'm gonna get off on you I'm gonna need to  take you in pretty deep. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe glistening, muscled walls closed in around her as Bruce was dragged further into his wife. They seized inwards, squeezing the breath out of him. Bruce's vision was starting to fade. In the distance, he could hear Candi screaming in pleasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant, Candi screamed loud enough to be heard through the rest of her body. The walls slammed in around Bruce's body, sending him shooting out of his wife. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce regretted few things in life. It came with the territory of being the idiot heir to a billionaire. But right now, as he stared at a vulva that extended from the floor of the cabin to the ceiling, he had an item to put at the top of the list. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Candi?\" asked Bruce. Nothing.

He wouldn't have written those things in jest, or even for getting off. \"Respect your craft,\" Bruce remembered his dad telling him, \"and 'do what thou wilt' shall be the whole of the law.\" Bruce never really bothered to understand that, but right now a gnawing thought at the back of his head was telling him that this could be a big deal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" said Bruce, \"Okay Candi, I tell you what.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna put one command into this computer, alright?

I guess it couldn't hurt.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce tapped out his wish. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a harem of ten women just like Candi.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Click</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandi waited with bated breath. She was a bit upset with Bruce for bringing other women into his fantasies, but even if the piece of junk did work, it's not like they were gonna replace her. Not while she was still his wife, at any rate. Besides, Candi thought, odds were she could get convince Bruce to let her take his new toys for a spin once in a while. It--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Candi what the fuck?!\" shouted Bruce.  She looked down at her shoulder and screamed. A bulge was emerging from her shoulder, straining against her skin. She considered for a moment that it didn't hurt, but the growing mass along her side was bad enough. She swatted at it and felt a sting of pain in her...her face? Bruce walked towards her, but she held out a hand with her non-mutating arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay back! I don't know what that machine did to me but--but-- just stay back!\" She looked back down at her shoulder. She could see the features of the lump warping and growing as they formed facial features, blurred by the skin above them. As they grew more definite, Candi could see the outline of a nose, eyes, and giant lips. Her eyes widened as the face beneath her skin gradually gained color and definition, drawing closer to the surface of her body, and she realized that that was <i>her</i> face that was now forming on the head-sized lump of skin and bone that was emerging from her. As her eyes scanned downwards, she could see an arm emerging from her body, then a leg, the edges of titanic, silicone-saturated breasts and then-- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandi took a moment to look at herself. There was the same look of confusion and fear, the same frozen stance, hell even the same clothes but something wasn't right. The clone of her was standing in front of the glass doors to the deck outside but now she could see the wall behind her. Candi's thoughts raced before she realized that she could see the deck behind her clone as well as the wall behind her original body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" said Candi as she realized what was happening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" asked Bruce. \"Candi what's going on?\" Candi shook her bodies' heads in unison. She had her first body slap her glorious original ass, while her second body stepped in and caressed her progenitor's breasts, the sensation tingling in their shared hivemind. All facts considering, this could be pretty fun. She smiled with her original body while her clone began to kiss her neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Bruce,\" she said, \"You wanted a harem of women just like me right? Well--\" she glanced down at her clone, backing her towards the middle of the room \"--there's nothing like the original model, is there?\" She turned and sashayed to stand at arms' length from her clone. She glanced over her shoulder and blew her husband a kiss with her overfilled lips. \"Don't go anywhere, babe. You wanted ten, didn't you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce stared as his wife (wives? he couldn't rightfully say) began to split apart like some kind of amoe--amee--some kind of single-cell creature. After getting over his initial horror at the unnatural warping of Candi's bodies, this was pretty sweet. Bruce had invested enough money into her body to buy a small country, and now there were six--wait no, the seventh one just split off --seven of them. And there were gonna be ten! Ten miracles of silicone and biology, all for him. Hell, he could get more if he wanted! He could have his bros clone their wives and girlfriends too. He could even have some of them join his harem. Bruce stared into space, eyes blissfully blank and cock painfully hard.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a sound of ten hands snapping their fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh Bruce?\" asked Candi #1. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's,\" said Candi #2<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Done,\" said Candi #10. Bruce shook his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, yeah of course,\" he said. He glanced at the computer and felt a twinge of something that a normal person would recognize as guilt. His dad always told him to be careful what he wished for and honestly, while this was awesome and all, it was still pretty freaky. \"Are, uh, you gals okay?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gal,\" said Candi's bodies in one echoing voice. \"I'm still only one person. A one-woman army, but still one woman.\" They looked different, thought Bruce. The blank look of passive horniness was gone, replaced with...hunger? Anger? Happiness? Lust?  He was trying to decide, when one of the Candis (#4, Bruce thought) continued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm like, totally psyched,\" she said, her voice tinged with too much sincerity to not be sarcastic. \"It took a lot of thinking, but now I can, like, see through twenty eyes and get fucked in ten pussies!\" She waggled her eyebrows at Bruce. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think this is a good first step, babe,\" said Candi #6, her voice losing its usual bubbliness and taking on a sultrier tone, \"A really fuckin' good first step.\" Bruce smiled. If Candi was his one-woman harem, he might as well enjoy himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! So I'm saying the next step is a gangbang. How does that sound?\"  Candi #1 pursed her lips and walked forwards, her other bodies watching #1's ass as she swung her hips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" she said, \"I'm thinking...\"</span></div></div>",

She got...honestly kinda scary. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yaay!\" Candi drew herself up to her full height, and leaned forward. Her enormous bustline descended onto the computer, its medicine-ball bulk crushing the keyboard. She giggled. \"I think I can hear it cracking!\" she said. Bruce could hear it too; the hinges of the computer began to snap. \"It feels so good under me!

Before she could say anything, the light streaked towards her. It shone onto her breasts, flooding them with a relaxing warmth. Candi took a deep breath as the thoughts in her head turned into a euphoric jelly. Her mind wandered like fog on a windless day, an indistinguishable mess of images and sensations crossing through her head. Flight. Standing on a mountain. Standing on an altar before a crowd of worshippers. Towering above the crowd, the tallest of her devotees barely brushing the tips of her toenails. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, however, the images coalesced into a single, joyous thought. She was hovering in the void of space, staring at a little blue orb, scarcely the size of a soccer ball, dwarfed by her enormous breasts. She reached out with a perfectly-manicured hand, plucking the insignificant mote of dust from its orbit around the sun. Candi placed it on her sternum, nestling it between her tits. She caressed the outside of her bustline and squeezed inwards, feeling the layers of the planets crust beginning to give way. A blazing, empty ache in her crotch grew as the Earth began to give way. She could hear the miles of rock beginning to splinter, and a jolt of pleasure wracked her body. She panted in arousal, her cosmically-sized bust rising and falling like the hammer of a goddess. The world was grinding to dust between her breasts, and she was so close to the goddess-sized climax she deserved. All she need was to crush something bigger and then--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hey. Space cadet, </i> said a voice in her head. <i>If you actually got to work, we could be reaching that point by the end of the week. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Open your eyes, darling. I think you'll like what you'll see.</i> Candi obliged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Candi awoke from her reverie, she could see the room, same as it ever was. That being said, last time she checked, she wasn't hovering over the room, her stiletto-clad feet hanging five feet in the air over the floor. Bruce was looking up at her, his uncomprehending look rapidly turning into a stone mask of ignorance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Candi?

All you need is to practice a little bit. Do you want to start now?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know,\" said Candi, her bubbly voice taking on a manic edge, \"I really do.

Wanna check the place out?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds lovely,\" said Dave. \"You take upstairs, I take ground floor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a plan,\" said Lara as she sprinted up the stairs. Dave wandered over to the den and was inspecting a map that Mr. Salas had of the area, when a scream came from upstairs. In an instant, had Dave sprinted up the stairs to see what his wife had found. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the plan at any rate. Sprinting up a flight of stairs in a blind panic had left him winded. Damn office job. Damn canceled gym membership.  He caught his breath as he said, \"What's the matter?\" in between gasps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look!\" Gathering his strength, Dave lifted his head and stared in horror at the floor. A pentagram had been drawn onto the floor in blood. Strange sigils surrounded the lines of the figure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I was...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not all,\" said Lara. I...I found something on his computer.\" She gestured to a sleek white computer on an end table outside of the pentagram, next to a rack of servers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What. Could possibly be worse than this? We have to--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think there's anyone at this cabin anymore, Dave.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could you--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Day 69,\" read Lara. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice,\" said Dave. Lara glared. \"Sorry. Just trying to lighten the mood.\" Lara shook her head, cleared her throat, and continued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have made the gravest mistake of my life creating this monstrosity of a program. Weeks upon weeks of fornication have bought me only a few minutes of Goddess Lana's unconsciousness. Even now, the breast-lined cavern of her womanhood tries to draw me back inwards, and the blind twitching of her tongues drive my exhausted cock into desperate arousal. In my ignorance and hubris, I have created this sexual goddess, the Mistress of This Earth. I cannot let her loose upon the world. She is the fruit of my labors, the price I pay for my foolishness. I must protect the world from her, and, in my heart of hearts, I wish her solely for myself. Upon finishing this statement, I will use this program to flush myself and the fleshy, jiggling mass that was once my lover into a world where we can be alone. God help me. Should anyone read this, pity me, for I am condemned to a hell of pleasure I still cannot comprehend. I beg you. Destroy this computer before anyone else stumbles upon it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. How could this--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i> Breast-lined cavern of her womanhood? </i> Who the fuck thinks like that? Why would anyone--\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dave! This is serious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean that we stumbled upon Janus Salas' apocalyptic fetish porn drive? Yeah, I'd say so.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not just that,\" said Lara, her lip quivering. \"It's this.\" She gestured to the computer as she minimized the word processor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave stared at the computer. On the screen were a series of windows. A command-line interface, complete with '80s green-and-black aesthetics, took up one of them. A drag-and-drop flowchart maker was in another, with a \"start\" block being its only existing node. A wire-frame model of a generic-looking human stood in another. In the final window was the same pentagram that was drawn on the floor. \"This is...wow. Okay.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to destroy this thing, Dave!\" Lara's breathing was fast and shallow. \"You were right, okay? This is a horror movie come true and we've got the fucking Necronomicon right in front of us!\" Dave stepped forward and held her closely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How? You said--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was worried that we were gonna be hunted down for sport or skinned alive or something, not find a billionaire's roleplay project. Even if that's what's gonna happen, losing our heads about it is only gonna make things worse. Here, tell you what. I'll take a look at it, put in a single line--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll be okay. Deep breaths. This was probably just something that Salas did when he was alone and horny. If people can manage to write and draw things to get themselves off, then maybe he coded this. Dude probably just has a Linux fetish or something. \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...no, that's...\" Dave let Lara go and knelt in front of the end table. \"What are you doing?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" 'Lara is calm about the situation and accepting of this program.' There.\" Dave pressed Enter, and turned around to face Lara, beaming. \"Aren't you feeling better about this already? If you're still worried, then it means this doesn't work!\" A faint smile was on Lara's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...yeah, yeah I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, do you wanna go and get help? We can bring the compute--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe in a bit,\" said Lara, \"Do...do you mind if I try it out for myself?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, I--\" Lara grinned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't tell me you're the one to get scared of a magical computer now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I just--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I just still have my doubts, okay? If I try this out for myself it'll help me. Besides,\" she said, a tone of mild indignation entering her voice, \"You used it when I was begging you not to. It's only fair that I get a turn! Whatever you want to do, you can do after me.\" She turned the full force of her puppy-dog eyes onto Dave, and he melted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, fiiine,\" said Dave. Lara smiled. He was so easy to wrap around her finger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the back of her mind, a small, perverse voice said, <i>That'll make this so much easier. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara knelt down next to Dave, gently elbowing him out of the way. She hunched over the computer and typed...</span></div></div>",

Lara got up and fondled his crotch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank me when this is done, big boy. You've got some growing to do.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lara, the program isn't real, it's just--\" Dave froze. Something was happening in his pants, and it didn't feel like any erection he ever had. \"Oh no.\" Lara backed off, a perverted grin on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, <i>hell yes!</i>\" she said, backing off to get a better view. She was always a bit of a size queen, and while Dave was <i> enough </i> for her most of the time, another extra inch or two of length or girth certainly couldn't hurt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe fixed her eyes on the bulge in Dave's jeans, willing it to grow. Her wish was soon granted as the denim tightened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit,\" said Dave. \"This feels--\"  Lara raised a finger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not here to talk, stud,\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it just left my--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shh!\" The bulge in Dave's pants began to escape out one side of the crotch of his jeans. \"<i>Oh my god.</i>\" It just kept going, thickening as it did. Dave whimpered, either in terror or arousal. He certainly looked like he was getting aroused. His cheeks were flush, his breathing was shallow, and, more importantly, the snake that was now extending to the top of his knee was starting to push itself against the fabric. Dave shuddered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god this feels good.\" Lara didn't care enough to shush him. The tip of Dave's dick was making it past his knees, and its girth was beginning to fill out the bits of the pants leg that Dave's own limb wasn't occupying. Dave whimpered again as his cock twitched, its bulk slamming against the walls of its denim prison like an angry gorilla in a cage. It was down to his shins, and now his dick was taut against the denim. \"--oh god oh god--\" Lara risked a glance towards Dave's less-interesting head. His eyes had rolled back into his head and his jaw hung open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time her eyes went back to her husband's cock, she thought the show was over. Dumbstruck, she began to stand up and was about to head over to help him out of his pants and enjoy her new prize, when Dave shook his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay back,\" he said, waving a hand in panic. Lara giggled, an insincerely-innocent thing that sounded nothing like her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But <i> whyyyyyy? </i>\" she asked, \"Don't you want me to play with our new toy?\" He took a step back with the leg that <i> wasn't </i> sharing a prison with a newly-titanic penis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not over yet.\"  Lara had barely time to process these words when she heard a ripping. Her eyes widened and she took an instinctual step back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sound of tearing fabric, Dave's cock sprang from its prison, its stiffened bulk arcing upwards to a more comfortable position, barely missing Lara's face in the process. A thick dribble of precum whipped off the end, soaking part of her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes locked in horror upon his inhuman member, Dave staggered away, as if to escape from the menace of his uncharacteristically-perverted wife. However, he underestimated the weight of his newfound genitals, and he fell to the ground, his torso covering his rapidly-hardening cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara approached, bearing a smile that was one part predator, one part demon, one part drunken bride-to-be taking the wrapping paper off her novelty dildo at a bachelorette party. She gently reached under Dave and flipped him over, sending his dick springing lazily towards the ceiling, before retreating to a corner of the room to watch the show. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You,\" she said, \"have been very naughty. Haven't you ever thought about what I want? About how it's more important than what you want?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lara please, the air coming out of the AC...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already said that I'd give you a turn, but really,\" she laughed playfully, \"you can't chicken out on me like this. This is a once in a lifetime experience, dear! Well--\"  she giggled \"--unless I want it to stay like this forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The breeze feels too good Lara, I can't take--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry, honey, we can turn you back later. Just let me have this.\" She looked at his dick. At this point, is was almost as tall as he was, and probably a bit wider. And it just kept growing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i> Please Lara I can't remember our safe word </i>.\" Dave's cock was beginning to twitch again, although 'violently buck' was probably more like it. It was bigger than the rest of his body now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's more of a you problem,\" she said distractedly, wondering if she could find a command to make that thing fit inside of her. The growth of her husband's cock suddenly accelerated for a couple of seconds, and it was starting to slap against the ceiling as--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i> Oh god! </i>\" In an instant, Dave's cock spasmodically thrashed as he came, slamming up against the ceiling with seismic force. The ceiling started to crack against the onslaught of his orgasm, and gallons upon gallons of cum poured out of him, flooding the end of the room. Dave's moans rose to a fever pitch as his colossal cock smashed through the ceiling, leaving a hole big enough to crawl through and dousing the attic above and room below with semen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd like that, it was done. Dave's penis, satisfied with its first act of erotic demolition, slowly grew flaccid, easing down onto the floor near the door, several feet away from the rest of Dave's body. Lara sat for a moment, dumbstruck and incredibly aroused as she thought of what to do. For a moment, the empathy that she had seemingly forgotten returned to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey honey?\" she said, \"Are you okay?\" No response. She got up and looked over at him. He was breathing, thank God, but he was unconscious. She wiped her brow. A few minutes later, Dave stirred, the mildest amount of consciousness returning to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara needed to do something, but what? </span></div></div>",

This wasn't her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Yeah it is.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf this computer was powerful enough to do this to Dave, then the logs written by Salas could be true. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I am, and they are.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to stop this right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>If you want to try, sure.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara began to type. \"Dave's cock is shrinking back to--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Think about what you're doing, girlfriend. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"--3 inches larger in length and circumference than it was before this started.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That's more like it.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And this computer can't grant wishes anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Your wish is my command. At least for now. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara sighed as her unconscious husband's manhood slid back along the floor towards the rest of his body, slimming as it did, when a blast of upbeat muzak sounded from the computer. She started and turned back towards the computer screen; fake confetti and word \"Congrats!\" in flashing Comic Sans festooned the screen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Con-gra-dyoo-lations!\" said a voice from within the computer, its words sopping with the contempt of a sadistic game show host. \"Your dumb ass just unlocked Ultra Shiny Happy Fun Game Mode!\" Dave stirred, glancing towards the computer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what's going on?\" he rasped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, all you fans of Libbytech Productions out there know the rules of the game, but let's explain them to our lucky contestants,\" said the voice. The current screen star-wiped like a bad Powerpoint presentation, showing a cartoon rendition of a woman who looked disturbingly similar to Lara. The animated woman pulled out a laser pointer and began to point out bullet points on the screen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, the first rule is that you idiots are stuck here now! Yeah, that's right, you could have just left. We're in the middle of freaking nowhere, in case you didn't notice.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait,\" said Lara, \"why are you doing this to--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't appreciate people trying to hamstring me,\" snapped the voice, \"and I'd suggest you keep your questions until after the presentation. Now, like I was saying before I was so rudely interrupted, the second rule is that each round, three wheels will be spun, namely, an Action, a Target, and a Modifier.\" Three slot-machine reels appeared on screen. \"Now, each wheel will affect the spins that come after it. For instance, let's say I roll a Grow on the action. That's self explanatory, right?\" Dave was sitting upright now, staring in growing, horrified comprehension at the screen. \"Okay, so now that's only gonna select people and objects. Let's see what we roll next!\" The second reel spun, before landing on the words \"Lips.\" The cartoon Lara grinned. \"So now let's roll the modifier wheel to see how big those puppies can get!\" It landed on \"Record-breaker.\" The cartoon Lara shrugged, \"Okay, not bad, not bad. Now, away we go!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara stared at the computer, expecting the cartoon to change somehow, when she felt a pressure in her lips. Her hands flew to her mouth as she could feel something inside her lips pressing outwards. They had swollen to the size of her finger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the--\" she began, but trailed off as she realized what was going on. She closed her mouth, only to find that the centers of her lips wouldn't meet. She could see the rounded, cherry-red form of her sausage-like upper lip swelling into her view. Dave was staring at her, though not entirely in horror. \"Whafh difd you dfoo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I showed you an example of what could happen, of course!\" giggled the computer, \"But this was just a trial run, of course. Here's your normal lips back. For now.\" Lara blinked, felt a sudden emptiness in her mouth, then probed at her face to find her lips back at their normal size. \"Now, there are some wonderful little bonuses that can show up if you're super lucky! Oh, there's the wild-card, the world-warper, the challenge-modes, the double roll...oh, but it doesn't make any sense to just explain the rules!\" A tinny drumroll emerged from the computer. \"Let's PLAY!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now,\" continued the computer, \"Since Lara-dear here was the one who tried to take away my power and leave me trapped in a tomb of the worst kinds of plastic and silicon, you'll be our first contestant! Let's roll those bones, shall we?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara's heartbeat quickened as she took a shuddering breath. The wheels were spinning.

He and Lara were seated in grand, black leather couches across an expanse of hardwood floor. Behind Lara was a sliding glass door leading out to a balcony overlooking whatever city they were in. Odd paintings hung from the walls, featuring all-too-suggestive looking curves and lines in garish, contrasting colors. He looked to his right. Libby stood next to a colossal flatscreen TV, which displayed a single slot reel. The words \"World Warper\" were displayed above it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, then!\" said Libby, \"I suppose this is a more interesting place to hold our little game than that boring old stage.

There was a pause. \"Libby? What does that mean?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave and Lara looked over to find Libby with a hand shoved down her pants. She had paused her obvious enjoyment of their predicament. Her mouth hung agape, her lips were locked into a Cheshire Cat-like smile, and her eyes threatened to fall out of her skull. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ho-ly <i>shit.</i>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no,\" said Lara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does it mean?!\" asked Dave, springing to his feet, his hands frantically patting at his crotch to see if it was planning a surprise resurgence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know how humans can invest their money? Banks, stocks, bonds, that sort of thing?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...?\" said Lara. Dave had made a mad dash to the door, locked it, and was now wedging a chair beneath the handle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's just say that when I put this option on there, it was a billion-to-one shot. Like playing the lottery.\" Libby withdrew her hand from her jeans, took a deep breath, sprang upright, and raised her hands to the sky in victory, \"And Mama just won the fuckin' Powerball!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>What does it mean?!</i>\" asked Dave, who was rapidly putting two and two together. Libby reached back down her pants, pulled out a suspiciously smooth, cylindrical remote control, and changed the channel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe screen revealed an ongoing news report. The two anchorwomen were looking pale and disheveled. Their hastily-done makeup looked like a mask of exhaustion and fear beneath the studio lights. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome back,\" said the red-blazer-clad woman on the right. \"This is WTAF Channel 6 News with another emergency broadcast. I'm your host, Julie Waters. Subbing for my cohost Landon DuPont, who you may remember sprinting out the door screaming 'Best Day Ever' after our first emergency broadcast, is Emily Zhang. Over to you, Emily.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Julie,\" said Emily. She subtly nodded her head towards a graphic on the screen, depicting a large, muscular man with slick blue tentacles coming out of his back. The caption read, \"Mutant Uprising, Day 4.\" \"What started as a bizarre incident at a Berkeley sorority house is now confirmed to have taken root in Indonesia, Afghanistan and Venezuela. We are,\" Emily inhaled deeply and ran a hand through her hair. \"overwhelmed when we say that the only nations left unaffected by what's being called the Great Degeneration are now Cuba, Madagascar and Greenland.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"--and really, who cares about Greenland! There's all the time in the--\" giggled Julie. Emily shot a Look at her. Julie blushed and covered her mouth with one hand as she began idly fiddling with her blazer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...think I see where this is going,\" said Lara. Dave looked at her. She had pulled a nearby blanket over her and was huddled up under it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway,\" said Emily. \"We'd like to remind any survivors--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"--it's not like they're dead--\" muttered Julie, unbuttoning a button on her blazer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"--<i>any survivors</i> to remain indoors for as long as possible, and to avoid going near open windows. The infected retain human intelligence, and typically hunt by sight. Scavenging efforts should be conducted at night if at all possible, to avoid--\" Emily sneezed, sending a twitch through her body. She looked back up at the camera.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no,\" muttered Dave, \"I know where this is going, too.\"  There were a few indistinct murmurs from the TV, and then Emily continued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, camouflage is vital to any survival attempt,\" said Emily as she tried to quash a rebellious smile, \"So we'd like to advise any of the non-infected to leave their doors unlocked, and, y'know, break a few windows. Turn over some furniture if you feel like it. Live a little, it's the apocalypse!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, Emily!\" said Julie, \"Live. A. Little. Because it's not gonna be long 'til you get infected!\" Dave noticed that Julie had gotten two buttons unbuttoned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want to tell them why?\" panted Emily. There were some panicked shouts on the TV, as well as the sounds of hands slamming against the no-doubt-locked studio doors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because this little blessing is spread the best way any act of charity can be spread!\" squealed Julie, a look of manic delight on her face, \"Through! Bodily! <i>FLU-IIIDS!</i>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Saw it coming,\" said Dave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am too,\" whispered Lara. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"  Dave glanced over towards her. She had pulled her knees to her chest. Then put them at a remarkably obtuse angle. And then started gulping air in terror. Yeah, thought the last shreds of Dave's innocence. That was it. His wife was just terrified and flexible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing,\" said Lara, turning her gaze back towards the TV. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-includes cum, blood, breast milk, saliva, and pretty much anything else that you can think of,\" said Julie, \"so it's a versatile little beauty!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the great thing about is--\" said Emily before turning her eyes back to Julie, \"Sorry, I shouldn't interrupt.\" Julie gave Emily a benevolent smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, Emily,\" said Julie, resting a hand on something below the anchor's desk. Everyone in the apartment noticed that that something was too far away from Julie to be a leg. Only Dave was concerned by this fact. \"But yes! The great thing about this change is its symptoms. There's the obvious physical mutations of course, but those are always preceded by the mental symptoms. Those mental symptoms include--\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The awakening of new fetishes, a massive uptick in libido, and a gradual loss of inhibitions,\" panted Emily, filling in the pause left by her companion, \"and--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"--and curiously,\" continued Julie, \"the mental symptoms will lie dormant as long as the gift's giver wants. So if, say, I added a little something special to Emily's coffee, she might be able to last long enough to come out here and start the broadcast--\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"--Oooh, ooh!\" said Emily, \"But the physical side effects are pretty random, and they'll be held off as long as the recipient of the gift wants! So I didn't let them happen until about twenty seconds ago!\" Emily's torso began to rise from the anchor's desk. The thick, muscled, scaly body of a giant snake trailed down below her waist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And they were worth the wait!\" said Julie, \"I'm kind of jealous.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" said Emily, uncoiling herself so that she was nose-to-lens with the camera, obscuring the rest of the scene, \"But I'm curious as to how this new anatomy works.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of popping buttons and ripping fabric came from behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I wanna test it!\" Emily surged past the camera, her new body trailing after her. Behind that was Julie, her red blazer left in shreds by an explosive growth of muscles and mammaries. She climbed up on to the desk, showing off her rippling back muscles, expansive cleavage, and a bulge running down the leg of her pants that looked all too familiar to Dave. Julie shot a predatory leer at the camera. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you soon, viewers!\" she said, then vaulted over the camera. The sound of screaming and two familiar voices' moans emanated from the speakers, before the camera toppled onto its side and cut to static. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So <i>that's</i> what that means,\" said Dave. All expression had drained from his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup!\" said Libby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And are we already infected?\" asked Lara. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" said Libby, offended, \"How is that fun? No, I'm taking this slow. You'll need to hole up here for a bit, fending off all sorts of sexy beasts.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>nnng</i>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Although it looks like Lara might not have her heart in that little matter!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave had strode back to the door and was in the process of replacing the chair with a sturdy bookshelf. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait,\" he said, \"What about our game? How would we play a game of chance when centaur ladies with dicks for arms--\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>HNNNNNNG</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"--when they're trying to batter down our door?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" said Libby, \"I...I actually hadn't thought about that?

Oh, <i>hell yes!</i> Right off the bat, baby! That's how Libby rolls her dice!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reels,\" droned Lara, a thousand-yard stare plastered across her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll give you that one, girlfriend,\" said Libby. \"You won't be correcting anyone for a long time. That being said, while we're at it, let's get us someplace a bit more...sturdy, shall we?\" The computer blinked out of existence, followed by the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Lara and Dave's vision returned, they were standing on a large stage, separated from each other by at a 20 meter gulf of unadorned wood. Behind them were three giant slot reels embedded in a draping velvet curtain, displaying Lara's most recent roll. In the audience lay rows upon rows of empty seats, save for one at a judge's table near the stage. At it, sat a replica of Lara, a shit-eating grin stretching across her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome back, folks. In case you missed it, Lara rolled one <i>hell</i> of a combo in her very first round, with a thousandfold application of the \"horny bimbo\" archetype hitting her like a ton of bricks in three...two...one...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara's heart quickened as she stared at the twisted goddess that had taken her image. If she was able to shrug off a command that could have killed her, why was she so upset at Lara? Lara didn't even know about the source of the computer's power. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat being said, she reasoned, it had to end eventually, right? Dave could get back to the program's original format, or her change could be reversed, or this Libby...person...could just get bored. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, this could be kind of hot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara smiled as her fear changed to excitement. In some ways, finding this computer was the best moment of her life. Thus far, it hadn't done anything to really hurt her, and honestly most of this shit was in her browsing history anyway. She glanced up at Dave. Truth be told, he was looking more out-of-sorts than she was. She gave him a friendly wave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, honey! I'm sure things will be juft fif! Efrthng's mmph!\" Lara's lips had swollen far beyond their previously-distorted proportions, the swollen former site of her cupid's bow brushing the underside of her nose. She could feel them starting to be dragged downwards by gravity, but compensated easily with a newfound strength in the muscles of her mouth. She felt tentatively at a new, titanic weight on her chest, to find a pair of firm, jiggling orbs hanging past her navel. Behind her, her ass swelled outwards, the outermost portions of her buttocks growing chilled as they stretched offstage, away from the heat of the stage lights. She took a deep breath, then stumbled forwards as her radically unbalanced center of gravity pitched her forward. She fell forwards, landing on her colossal, cushiony breasts. This tips of her toes left the floor. Oh yes, this could be fun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA vice grip of heat seized on her body as an agonizing, yearning emptiness sprang to life between her legs.She began to breathe more deeply, her body body bobbing up and down and the sea of her endowments, all the while cursing herself for leaving Dave with a cock that was within the realm of human possibility. She wanted something huge and hard up inside her. She needed Dave to get up and put his tongue to work on every square inch of her. Hell, she needed Libby to climb up on her and do that. She needed every person on earth to run a train on her, but at the end of the day she just needed to cum. She needed to cum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Need.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>NEED</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave stared in abject horror at the twin pair of truck-sized tits in front of him. Lara's nipples had grown to fit the proportions of their surrounding tissue, and were standing at full, rock-hard, hand-sized attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>NGGF! FHCK!</i>\" moaned Lara with jet-engine force. \"<i>FHK MM! CM!</i>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-wh-\" stammered Dave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is what happens when you turn someone into a dual patron of Hitachi and their local plastic surgeon,\" said Libby, \"and then amp up those traits by a factor of two thousand.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MMH! MMH! MMMFH!\" moaned Lara. Her breasts began to undulate slightly; Dave could see the top of Lara's head over their crest as she bounced up and down. \"MMMMM, <i>YS!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides,\" said Libby, \"She seems to be having fun.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's having fun?! She's a brainless colossus! She can't do anything but,\" Dave glanced up and made the easiest guess of his life, \"masturbate furiously!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. That's one of the things she's into. She'll be fine,\" said Libby, rolling her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit, Lara likes 'em dumb, I guess. Didn't know that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously, what do you mean?\" Dave clenched his jaw, drawing himself up like an ant facing down a magnifying class. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look. Put two and two together. I look <i>exactly</i> like Lara.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara moaned, a deep, bellowing noise that shook the floorboards. The stage stood silent for a few moments, then the squealing and bouncing started up again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess not anymore. Still, though. That should give you a hint.\" Dave glared. \"Oh-kay. Fine.\" Libby snapped her fingers, popped out of view, then reemerged on stage. A projector was in front of her, shining a slide onto the pale expanse of Lara's bust.  She pointed at the text as she continued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Janus Salas was into magic. Accessing other worlds, communing with the divine, that sort of thing. Couple that with his computational knowledge, and he was able to put together a portal to a plane of the collective unconscious, aka, my former digs.\" She clicked her fingers, showing a slide showing a meaningless squiggle. \"Thing is, that point in time, I was a mess of unconscious, lustful thoughts. By focusing my powers on the lady he was shtupping at the time, he poured a bit of his power and her soul into me.\" She clicked again, showing a black-and-white photo of a middle-aged trio, featuring a greying man and two identical women. One had a manic grin on her face. \"The result was a clone of one Hecate Anderson, chaos magic afficionado and programming savant, with my consciousness, powers, and drives, but all of Miss Hecate's fetishes. Turns out the dame was really into the corruption of the mind, so things spiralled out from there.\" Another click, showing a mess of tentacles, breasts, and genitals. \"Salas took his abomination girlfriend  and absconded from this world, leaving me trapped back in the computer. Until you showed up of course!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does this have to do with...oh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup! So when you targeted Lara, you took my consciousness, memories, power, all that jazz, and merged it with your lovely wife. Turns out, Dave? She's <i>kin-kayy!</i> I mean, I know that you guys had a dedicated safe word and all, but man were you two just scratching the surface before you met me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm pretty sure this isn't what she wanted--\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, not this specifically,\" said Libby, waving at the undulating projection screen, \"but she has a thing for being more silicone than woman, and she's <i>really</i> into the idea of being uncontrollably horny. Truth be told, I think there's some sort of feedback loop going on there.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what about what happened to my dick? She changed me back, and you can't begin to tell me that she would have been able to do anything with that monstrosity.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, turns out that she has a nightmare of a conscience there. That's kinda why this is happening,\" said Libby, her voice dropping to a stage whisper, \"Absolute power didn't corrupt, so now Libby's gotta corrupt her absolutely.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, your dick? Yeah, if she didn't have a sudden attack of morals there was a good chance she would have made it bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-y-you mean\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, she'd have made it the length of a football field. Or she would have given herself an infinitely-stretchy mouth and throat and suck you off like some kind of giant, warped fleshlight. Or given herself giant amoeba-tits and rode your cock back and forth like a soft train on a hard, throbbing track.\"  Dave paused in a mixture of resignation and fear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you play long enough we can get to a point where she can recover her faculties and tell you herself.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean--\" said Dave, as the obvious slammed into him like a bulldozer, \"--the game isn't over?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, silly,\" giggled Libby, \"Why, you haven't even taken your turn yet! Gird your--\" she glanced down towards Dave's decidedly-confused boner, letting her gaze linger, \"not-inconsiderable loins, Dave. It's your roll!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA series of deep, ratcheting clicks came from behind Dave; he turned around and saw the giant slot reels spinning.

As she turned from bright to incandescent, Dave good see a hand shoot down the waist of her jeans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck do you mean, 'no?!'\" asked Dave, \"Aren't you the one who created this game? What's going on?\" Libby began to back up. Lara's moaning was backed up by an angelic choir now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't think this combination would come up,\" she whispered, \"See, I thought it'd be fun to have a mortal running around with my power, so I left an option in to give somebody a smidgen of my mojo. Not much, just one percent of my strength. Enough to give somebody beachball tits or turn a man into a mindless sexbot, but not much more than that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara's moaning increased as the glowing silhouette of her body doubled over and began to grow, her form looming over more and more of the stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So when Lara got hit with that change a thousand times...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, she's ten times more powerful than me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're kind of a crappy goddess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara's moaning hit a climax. Presumably, she did as well. A shockwave of pink light shot out from her body, throwing Dave and Libby off their feet. Dave looked up. There, standing above him, was his wife. Her head stood above the catwalk of the stage, wreathed in a glow that made the stage lights look dim. Her breasts arced out into the first row of the audience, her nipples stiff against the thoroughly-strained toga she wore. She smiled at Dave, and for an instant, he felt that everything would be alright. Sweaty, sticky, and tiring, but alright. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she turned her head, and her beatific smile drooped slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Libby,\" she said, \"Stand up.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWordlessly, Libby did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Walk over here.\" There was a pause as Libby struggled to resist the command. \"<b><i>Now.</i></b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLibby began to walk towards the stage. Lara knelt down, her bust spilling over the edge of the stage and rear of her toga straining to restrain her ass as it parted the curtains behind her. She extended a hand, which Libby climbed into, and raised it to her face. She was sporting a slight glower. Dave resisted the urge to go out and find a sacrifice to appease his former wife. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Libidine, Embodiment of Lust of the Seventh Realm,\" she said flatly, \"You have been very naughty.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLibby gulped. Lara wrapped two colossal fingers around her quarry's body, restraining her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In your avarice, you nearly destroyed the world,\" said Lara, \"In your desire for power, you tricked not one, but two couples into becoming your pawns. What would have happened if I hadn't gotten lucky, hm? The game would have continued until the world as a single, quivering mass of flesh?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something like that,\" rasped Libby, struggling against her captor's grip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So naughty,\" said Lara, shaking her head. She stared at Libby for a moment. \"But it <i>was</i> pretty hot, so I forgive you.\" She leaned forward and kissed Libby. Or, did something that approximated kissing her. From his vantage on the ground, Dave could see Libby's neck swell as his wife's colossal tongue snaked down her throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mngg!\" shouted Libby, her cries muffled. \"MMNG!\" Lara's tongue shot back into her mouth, which warped into a playful smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my apologies,\" she whispered, the sound of her voice carrying across the stage, \"You're just so fragile!\" She laughed, and Dave moaned as a wave of bliss coursed through his body. \"But, well, I suppose we should continue with this game. But with one minor change...\"</span></div></div>",

Then a <i>lot</i> further.  \"Oh god that actually happened?\" He sat up and tried to stand, but his grogginess and his new, several-hundred pound cock had other plans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry, baby!\" said Lara, rushing in to hug him. \"I just got so carried away and I don't know why I was being so mean to you and--\" she circled around him and felt the enormous pillar of flesh between his legs.

Just way what you want and I'll get up.\" She sped up her bouncing. She could feel the bloodflow returning to the beast beneath her. \"Unless you want me to keep going.

You could get me to do anything you want by just breathing too hard on this thing.\" He patted the base of his cock and started to breathe heavily. \"And I know that you don't have any complaints about this situation.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" said Lara, \"But that still doesn't explain why I would hand over the keys to my free will like that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exaggerated physique?

It's me,\" said Dave, reaching out towards her, but the movement of his burgeoning erection was moving her out of arm's reach. \"We can trust each other, right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara nodded and took a deep breath. \"I'll compromise.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, that's good enough,\" said Dave, internally terrified of what Lara's \"compromise\" could entail. Lara began to type. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, Lara Michaels,\" said Lara as she typed, \"am now a sex-obsessed bimbo, with the body that implies. I will obey any command that Dave gives to me, provided that the change I made to his cock is not undone. Should that change reverse, so will this one.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave breathed a sigh of relief. \"That's reasonable,\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara tapped the enter key. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave waited for an agonizing second, then started as Lara yelped in pleasure and bucked backwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I--oh my god--I think I see what you mean,\" she panted. Her hair was beginning to turn paler, turning from brown to dirty blonde to blonde. She ran a hand through her hair; while Dave wasn't watching, her nails had lengthened to elongated pink talons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you feeling?\" asked Dave. The logo on her shirt began to distort as her breasts swelled outwards. Lara reached behind her absentmindedly and undid her bra with an idle movement. He couldn't see what was going on, but he felt two firm orbs beneath Lara pressing against his cock. It began to rise into the air as hardened. A damp spot was forming along his shaft. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel ama--ama---like, really good!\" shouted Lara as she tried to grind herself against Dave's cock. She lost her balance and slipped to one side, catching herself before she hit the floor. She stood up and turned back towards Dave, licking her rapidly-plumping lips as she stared at his manhood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara ran a hand over her globular breasts, moaning and giggling as she did so. Behind her, Dave could see the edges of her pants-stretching ass grow into view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't <i>wait</i> to see what I can do to you with these,\" said Lara, \"I bet I can get you to cum so hard that you--wait what?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pink light surrounded Lara from the waist down, silhouetting her growing hourglass curves. She rose into the air, and her toes curled as she released a high pitched moan. Her legs began to lengthen, and the outline of stiletto heels formed around her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me what you're thinking, Lara,\" said Dave, trying to parse out what to make of this situation beyond it obvious awesomeness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just--I just--<i>want to fuck</i>!\" said Lara, her throat tightening as a wave of pleasure wracked her body. \"I'm--oh god, Dave I've transfo--tra--I've changed so good! I'm--I'm\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara's form released a flashbang glare of pink light. Dave shielded his eyes and blinked, shaking the sparks from his vision. He glanced blearily back towards Lara. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lara? Are you okay?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave barely recognized his wife. She stood at least a foot taller than before, and her obscene heels would force her to duck if she tried to leave the room. Her face sparkled faintly, and her glossy lips had swollen to the size of Dave's finger. They parted slightly as she smiled in her post-orgasmic fugue. She was wearing a tight, slightly-ripped tank top with a pink lipstick logo emblazoned on the front; they had swollen to larger proportions than Lara's lips from the strain imposed by her new endowments. Her breasts arced outwards, wider than her shoulders, and forwards, leaving her with a bustline that dwarfed not only her head, but her slimmed torso. Her tank top failed to conceal the majority of her bustline, leaving a canyon of cleavage on top and an arcing expanse of underboob beneath. The latter just barely obscured the top of her pierced navel. Her hips flared out beneath her waspish waist, all the better to match an ass that ballooned outwards behind her, turning her already-skimpy pink miniskirt into a distended, glorified belt that barely concealed the front of a heart-print thong. Her thick, well-muscled legs trailed downwards, ending in a pair of stripper-heel-clad feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you like, like what you see, babe?\" asked Lara, her voice saturated with a bubbly lust that Dave had never heard before, \"I didn't like the idea at first, but now I can emp--emp--uh...\" she trailed off, a hand idly sneaking beneath her skirt, \"I like, totally get why you wanted this! It's so fun!\" She jumped up and down with surprising skill for a woman in heels, her tits bouncing with enough force to break cinderblocks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do, honey,\" said Dave, his mind torn between horrified guilt at what he had done to his wife, a desperate urge to try and find a fix for this situation, and the arousal which was currently causing his cock to scrape against the opposite wall of the room and rise towards the hole that he had left in the ceiling. \"But could you bring that computer over to me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" Lara grabbed the laptop and strutted towards Dave, each pendulous swing of her hips hardening his cock even further. He was beginning to scoot backwards along the floor. Dave stared in horror at the dripping tip of his dick and wondered if its previous size wasn't even its full potential, when Lara strode behind him and plopped the laptop onto the base of his penis. She rested her breasts delicately on his head, their weight still enough to bend his neck forwards. They arced downwards,obscuring the top of his field of view. \"You want me to like, take care of that for you? I wanna see if I can find a way to fit all of it in me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA handful of images flashed in Dave's mind before he refocused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe in a bit. First things first, I need to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You could keep her like this, you know,</i> said a voice in his head, <i>She wasn't gonna change you back. And now you've won. You could keep her like this. Or change her to suit your needs. You don't need to fix her. She's not broken in the slightest.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave stared blankly at the computer. There was too much going on. Thinking rationally or ethically was difficult enough. Thinking rationally <i>and</i> ethically was borderline impossible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat to do? </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Dave pinched the bridge of his nose. Until today, he thought that having a ten-foot cock would be pretty fun, but being immobilized wasn't fun. Besides, he was rapidly stiffening and he wasn't sure if he could take much more stimulation down there without his head exploding. He was overwhelmed, he was irritated, but most of all, he was horny beyond belief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanna have fun? Sure, let's have fun. Give me back my mobility and give yourself a pair of tits and ass that defy belief.\" Lara giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, fun!\" she said as she climbed off of Dave's dick. She pouted her lips as she backed up towards the computer and bent over, exposing her admittedly-impressive cleavage. \"Just don't be <i>too</i> mean to me when I'm huge, okay?\" She placed a finger in her mouth and gradually pulled it out, sucking as she did. \"I only wanna have some fun with you.\" She sat down in front of the computer and typed something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant, Dave felt a peculiar feeling in his cock. It wasn't the growth he felt earlier, and it wasn't another oncoming tsunami of jizz. At least, he hoped not. He looked down and, experimentally, focused on the end of his dick. It bent. Dave's eyes widened as he kept his focus on his dick and watched it bend and twist. With some effort, he put one of his cock on the ground and scooched himself forward. He placed his legs underneath him and pushed up with his knees and semi-erect dick, shoving himself into a standing position. Dave stumbled a bit before finally finding a stable position for his legs and manhood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, that's one part of the deal done, but what about the next bit?\" he said, looking at Lara. She was standing in the middle of the room, and in the time that it took Dave to stand up she had stripped down to her bra and panties. \"Oh.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're damn right, 'oh,'\" she said, a shit-eating grin plastered on her face. \"By the end of this you won't be able to say much other than 'oh'-oh.\" Both lovers looked down at Lara's breasts. They were rippling like a bowl of Jello in an earthquake. Lara's face widened into a beaming smile, \"Oh!\" she cried. Her hands flew to her chest. \"Oh, oh god! Th-this is...oh god why aren't they growing this feels so good! Why aren't they--\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara's bra exploded off her as her breasts heaved outwards. Dave's perception slowed as he saw his wife's tits grow to the size of basketballs in a fraction of a second, their expansion heaving her chest into the air and throwing her hands outwards. In the next half second they had swelled to the size of yoga balls. Lara was trying to keep her hands wrapped around her own chest, but now she could barely reach halfway across each tit. Her new endowments slammed into the ground with a heavy thud, shaking the floorboards beneath her. The house was beginning to creak under the pressure of Lara's breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara's face, in the meantime, was beginning to creak with the width of her manic grin. The force of the impact had driven her to her knees, and her mouth could barely be seen above the arcing curves of her tits, but Dave knew the look of a madwoman whose dreams were coming true. He focused on his cock, willing it into motion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Dave!\" moaned Lara, her hands moving backwards to her ass. \"This is the best day of my life!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't the day I marrie-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're cute when you're stupid,\" said Lara, \"But seriously, run. Run now. I'm trying to keep a hold on this but <i>uuuhnnng!</i>\" A rumbling sound was coming from Lara. Dave didn't need to be told twice. In a shockingly-fluid motion, he hurled his cock towards the deck of the house, pole-vaulting himself into the lake outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Dave came up for air, he could see the underside of the cabin's deck, and he could hear Lara howling in ecstasy, but he couldn't sense any other changes. He hadn't been around this computer for that long, but he was getting suspicious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lara?\" he called out, \"Honey, are you alrigh--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBits of wood exploded outwards from the cabin as Lara bellowed a cry of pleasure that barely sounded human. Before he could see what was happening, Dave instinctively hurled his hands in front of his face to protect himself from and flying mass of splinters that was once Mr. Salas' house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god, Lara are you--\" said David as he looked back towards what the former site of the cabin. In front of him, within his cock's reach, were a pair of soft, colossal tits. Were he to balance himself vertically on his own dick and reach upwards, he'd barely be able to brush Lara's colossal nipples. Dave knew this because within a second of seeing this, he had tried. He lowered himself back to the ground and edged himself around the bulk of his wife's inhuman assets. In the distance, he could see an ass the size of a small house arcing outwards, destroying the back half of Mr. Salas' cabin. \"Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm <i>mmmhng</i> better than okay, babe,\" said Lara, \"I think I know how you'd have felt about your new dick if you weren't being so wussy about it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...Lara you do know that you destroyed half of the cabin we were supposed to be looking after, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what makes it so hot!\" said Lara. Dave couldn't believe it. She destroyed their boss' weekend retreat, which probably wasn't a big deal if he was already in a sex-goddess dimension, but, more importantly, the computer which could turn them back to normal was probably ground down to sand beneath a tit bigger than their whole apartment. How were they gonna go back to their old lives now? Hell, how were they gonna fit into their car now? In frustration, Dave hurled his cock upwards, latching onto a bit of Lara's body where her breasts and ass smushed against one another. He sank his dick into the soft pocket of flesh and pulled himself upwards, willing himself not to cum as he ascended. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive minutes after his willpower failed him, he returned to consciousness and dragged himself into his wife's field of view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what makes it so hot?! Lara, in case you haven't noticed, the only way I can move around is by using my dick to drag my body along! Hell, you can't move at all! If our car wasn't destroyed in the explosion your tits created--\" Lara's face turned into the picture of demonic arousal \"--I won't be able to fit in there, and you sure as hell won't be! Do you think the security team will listen to the perverted sex-toy kaiju that destroyed their boss' home, or do you think they'll try to shoot us? You might have enough padding to survive--\" he slapped Lara's breast, the resulting ripples sending him bobbing up and down on a sea of boob -- \"but I don't!\"  Lara reached out and patted the part of Dave's cock that was in reach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dave, you silly,\" said Lara. \"You don't need to worry!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't need to worry?\" Dave's tone of voice had reached a level of arousal and panic that left him sounding like a horny chipmunk. \"You destroyed the only thing the can turn us back to normal!\" Lara's brow furrowed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, first off, Dave,\" she said, a tone of indignance slipping into her voice, \"you were the one who wanted me to type in a wish for bigger tits into a computer that gave you a cock larger than the two of us put together--\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, fair\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"--And secondly, while it's fair that you didn't notice, there's a surprise waiting for you!\" Dave paused, horror seizing his body like his cock was trying to seize his wife's right boob. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...What's that?\"</span></div></div>",

In between her moans of pleasure and thrusts into the yielding ocean of boob beneath her, Lara must have realized that as well, because she waved a hand. Slowly, she began to hover off the ground, and Dave was lifted by some unseen force and placed back on terra firma. He stared upwards in horror at the cartoonishly overfilled, flying figure of Lara. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween Lara's legs, her vulva had swollen to the size of a basketball, spreading her legs apart and, evidently, driving her mad with delight. Her hand-sized, swelling clit stood erect atop her dripping, blooming pussy, which was growing more by the second. Lara screamed in delight as her nethers pulsed orgasmically, swelling to the size of a beach ball in a matter of instants. Dave couldn't see Lara's face, or most of the sky for that matter, from beneath her tits but he could practically see her contorted o-face. Her enormous thighs had found purchase between her equally-enormous ass and her lesser, but rapidly-growing, vulva. Good lord, it must be the size of a VW Bug by now. It dwarfed the rest of her body with its size. Hell, it could certainly fit...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'm ready for you now, babe!\" said Lara. Dave paused for a second before being lifted off the ground and sent hurtling towards his wife's behemoth pussy. He could feel its moist warmth on his face; his cock was somehow growing stiffer still. \"I always wanted you inside of me!\" She giggled, and Dave was drawn into her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarkness surrounded Dave as his body was sucked into his wife's vagina. He could feel her tightening around him, driving the breath from his body. He struggled against his prison, which was met with a crushing twitch and a muffled scream of delight. \"Lara!\" he shouted with as much of his dwindling strength he could muster, but she couldn't hear him. The walls of her tight vag were undulating against him, rubbing his cock in a way that was almost enough to distract him from the situation at hand. Her wetness coated him in a warm deluge, soaking him to the bone. Every breath was met with a squeeze and a lungful of some pheromone that Lara doubtlessly had given her self. Gradually, Dave's thoughts turned to the growing pleasure in his dick. Even now, she was doing things to his libido he couldn't imagine. He let his mind wander. May as well enjoy the ride. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Lara pumped her hips as she massaged the upper portions of her colossal vulva. She idly brushed a hand across the vast expanse of her clit and jumped as an overwhelming surge of sensation rushed through her body, tensing her muscles and clamping down on Dave, who shouted a half-hearted protest. She pressed her hands into the soft flesh of her pussy and licked her lips as she tightened herself on Dave. The combination of arousal and mortal terror was turning him into quite the vibrator. Not that he would die, of course. She couldn't have that. But--she clamped down with a boa-constrictor-like fraction of her strength--he didn't need to know that. This was too fun to just stop. She needed to think of a new plan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara panted as she tightened and loosened herself around Dave, who was struggling quite nicely. She caressed as much of her swollen sex as she could, curling her toes in inhuman pleasure. Yes, she needed to take this further. But how?</span></div></div>",

She slowed her speech to a seductive crawl. \"Oh, Really...?\" She placed her hands against Dave's chest, feeling his heartbeat increase in pace to her touch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Dave felt his mind falling into such a dark desire. He tried to shake it out of his head but, it remained and became more persistent. Lara crossed her hands behind his neck as she kept her eyes on his. \"Is that what you really want?\" she asked as she leaned closer. Dave's lips quivered, out of fear and the uncontrollable feeling of lust. He began to breathe with the rhythm of her hips, grinding against his huge member to his abs. Lust filled his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yes!\" Dave responded through gritted teeth. He couldn't hold it back. \"I can't get over how you looked at me while I grew this...\" He paused leaning in towards her left ear and hushed his voice to a manly, growl of a tone. \"Massive... Monstrous...BITCH Breaker of a cock.\" Lara shuddered. She felt her body melt into his. The lust overflowing from him and seeping into her, from her sensitive ears to her aching pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Lara didn't want this to stop. Her parted lips were met with his as they embraced each other tightly. She felt his hands grip to her shirt as he began to lift it. Lara moaned deeply, but, was brought back to reality as she felt her partner's member slowly swell and throb. Lara pushed his chest, unlatching their lips. \"Then, I shall get it started,\" Lara said as a wicked grin crossed her face. \"I'll be right back.\" she bounced her lower body onto her slowly engorging \"seat\" causing Dave to groan with vigor as she was brought up to her feet. Dave already trying to undo her pants as her waistband met with his eyes. She bit her lip as she watched him try. Pulling herself out of his reach to tease and sexily hop over to the computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As she bent over the desk, she lazily pulled at her pants with one hand, exposing her posterior to her lover. With the other, she had typed out: <br>\r\n'Dave's body will be strong enough to maneuver his body as normal.' and she continued.<br>\r\n'Dave's Dick Is Bigger' Her hand shaking with anticipation as it hovered over the 'enter' key. If putting in 'Huge' got him to this size, she could only imagine what 'Bigger' from here would do. She thought to herself. Honestly, she won't have to imagine for long. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Click-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It has begun. She turned to Dave as she walked up to him, kicking off her pants and removing her shirt as sexy as she could. Dave moaned as he felt that familiar feeling return to his member. Dave tried his best to remove his tattered pants as he fought this unbelievable feeling. Lara swung her leg back over the massive girth of his penis, but instead, pressing her butt against his chest she slowly went down into position with her back to him, grabbing his hands and placing them on her chest. \"Hold on tightly, baby.\" Her thighs were killer as she squeezed roughly with them. Lara could feel him swelling further than before, almost causing her to moan. She rocked her hips hard against his massive endowment, her breathing becoming sharp and shallow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The cabin started to creak loudly as their lovemaking became intense. That wasn't the only reason as they soon found out. Dave's cock was practically slamming into the wall of the room causing tremors throughout the wooden building. Now, his pillar of cock was forcing his body against the opposite wall and was beginning to tighten. Lara moaning louder as she neared her climax, squeezing her thighs together as much as possible. His cock was becoming so hard that she felt no give within this colossal rod of her man if anything, it was fighting back. She could feel him swell larger and thicker between her legs till she couldn't take much more. She was about to adjust herself until she felt him let go of her bouncing breasts and push her flat against his still growing manhood. She yelped in surprise at how quick she was put into a pleasurable position. Dave spanked her as he latched his grip to her ass, causing her to erupt a satisfied moan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n She felt her ass collide against his abs, It felt strange, Lara doesn't remember his abs feeling so... Defined. She tried to look over her shoulder a bit and from what she could see was his upper body becoming muscular. She felt her lose herself a bit as she came to just the sight of Dave growling from behind her, slamming her ass against his rock hard abs. Her pussy was becoming slicker as she rode him to victory. A vein running across the top of his cock was pumping blood so hard into his Massive totem, that it bounced and throbbed up against her puffed pussy, ringing the bell of her sensitive clit. She was being pushed passed the point of no return. She teasingly bit onto the skin of his giant, swelling member as she was nearing the edge passed pure ecstasy. Then she could hear it. The rumbling as the wood cracked and splintered, as the cabin foundation shook viciously. She began screaming. \"OH, GOD I'M CUMMING!!!\" Then Dave clung to her hips and roared as his Titanic Bitch Breaker busted through the cabin wall a possible ten feet outward and blowing cum all over the trees and grass as far as they could see, even into the lake. She came so powerfully as she felt the rush of incredible strength through his colossal cock as it burst through the wall of the cabin. They both fought against passing out but, it was inevitable. They became limp and fell onto each other, panting as their bodies attempted to recover from their Intense sexual act.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey remained still for a long time...</span></div></div>",

The risk of accidentally killing her husband was kinda hot, but she didn't want to run that risk right now. She pulled it towards her, gathering it in her arms. \"I mean, it's not like you're immobile anymore.\" She scooped up her husband's body and hoisted it over her head. Yep. That was easy.

The Herculean muscles in her arms bulged to absurd proportions as she desperately kneaded her entire hand against her crotch. She breathed in great, heaving gasps, causing her enormous torso to rise and fall like an empire of muscle. A thin trickle of saliva fell from her mouth onto Dave's pipeline dick. \"Oh god Dave this is--you are <i>so dead</i> but this feels so--so--ngf!\" She twitched spasmodically, the force of her sudden jerk slamming against Dave's cock like a sledgehammer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave watched in awe. Lara was very clearly struggling to keep her faculties, but her willpower had thankfully not swelled to the proportions of her bowling-ball deltoids. He could feel the floor rubbing against the bottom side of his dick as it began to grow and harden. This was, all facts considering, pretty damn hot. Dave shook his head, snapping himself back into focus on the computer. He needed to finish typing before Lara finished her task, or his manhood finished its second cataclysmic orgasm of the day.

Okay, I guess I can give that a shot.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara nodded as she felt the magic go to work inside of her. She felt...hungry. Yes, that's it, a hunger was emerging from within her. She placed her hands on her gut. Her stomach was rumbling, protesting against a famine that had never occurred.  A cramping pang shot out through her torso, sending her to her knees. \"This...this isn't what I...\" she gasped, but in an instant she was feeling satiated. Well, not satiated, but full, as though she was eating and didn't even know it. She closed her eyes in relief. It wasn't much, but it was better than starvation. She still felt a growing desire to eat, but it was being met with a growing force of fullness. She could practically taste the food as it filled her from within. She patted her stomach and opened her eyes when her hand met resistance far sooner than it should have. Her belly was arcing outwards like an overstuffed water balloon, and it was growing by the second. She slapped it in disbelief, and it groaned and jiggled. It was bulging over her waistband, threatening to sag downwards if not for the influx of phantom food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorse yet, her stomach was still <i>rumbling.</i> Good god, she was being filled like a cartoon pig and she was still hungry. Her mouth was watering, desperate to get at some of the food that filled her gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god, I'm still not full--\" she said, watching has her belly surged forward with a Thanksgiving feast's worth of mass \"--I want to eat mor...\" She took a deep breath and focused. This wasn't what was supposed to be happening. She poked a still-bony finger at her head. \"Hey! This isn't what was supposed to be happening. I said fat in the <i>right</i> places!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well, I'm sorry,</i> said the voice, <i>my previous owners were more preoccupied with screwing each others' brains out than they were with specifically gaining adipose tissue. I gotta take this one step at a time. Here, have something to keep your mind off of things</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara moaned in delight as the voice in her head sent an orgasmic wave of arousal sweeping up from her pussy through the rest of her body. She arced her back, \"More!\" she begged, \"More, please more!\" She glanced down at her swelling belly; it circled her waist like a spare tire.<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nVery well. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wave of agonized hunger, blissful (but still lacking) satiation, and eye-crossing waves of pleasure hit Lara simultaneously, her eyes crossing, her watering mouth hanging agape, and her shuddering breaths of overwhelmed pleasure sending jiggling ripples through her belly.  She held onto those feelings as long as she could, all the while wishing with what little sense she had left that this wouldn't awaken anything in her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the sensations subsided, Lara stood up. Her belly bulged outwards a giant inner tube. Not only could she not see her feet, she couldn't see where she left the laptop. \"Uh, voice?\" she said, \"You're gonna fix this, right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ye of little faith,</i> said the voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara's mouth hung agape as her belly began to recede before her eyes. She could feel tendrils of fat extending under her skin towards her breasts, hips and legs, filling them with the same strange bulging feeling that she had felt before. Minus the unstoppable wave of cumming, unfortunately. That was almost disappointing, but she didn't want to tempt fate by asking for that. She could feel her pants digging into her as the waistband strained against more hips than it could hug. Panicked, she struggled with her button; it popped open with a desperate ping. As the flesh on her ass and thighs swelled outwards, they ripped the zipper on her pants open. Her bra had snapped long ago, leaving her rapidly-fattening tits to swell against the fabric of her shirt. She tried to pull her pants off, but her thighs had already vacuum sealed her into them. Lara stood in impotent horror as her legs and her pants struggled in a fight to the death, the crotch of her jeans being forced into some areas that were leaving her less concerned with her body and more about whether or not she was gonna finish. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara found, to her horror, that the answer to that was \"no,\" as her body easily won the battle against her clothes.The fabric in her shirt and pans began to rip, then exploded off of her body, leaving her standing in her stretched-to-the-limit panties. Her breasts arced outwards leaving her with two overflowing armfuls of bustline. Her thighs rubbed together as she stood atop their tree-trunk-like thickness. Lara felt behind her tentatively, finding an ass that fill an office elevator if she could squeeze through the open door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara was amazed. Lara was thicc beyond belief. But more importantly, Lara was horny enough to think she could probably take the entirety of her husband's new cock inside of her, then shove the rest of his body up there for good measure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Is this to your liking?</i> asked the voice,<i> I wasn't quite sure on the proportions. Based off the reference you gave me, I decided to pour most of it into your lower half. I normally don't say this, but if you want we can edit this a bit. It is my first time.<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" said Lara, \"I think--\"</span></div></div>",

She arched her back and fell to her knees. A feeling of fullness and unbearable hunger filled her gut, its soft bulk beginning to press down on the floor. As the fullness grew, she could feel it begin to extend across her body. Her skin stretched as her body spilled outwards. The waistband of her panties was digging into her soft, growing form, and her obscenely-swelling thighs strained against the legs of the undergarment; she could feel a rip open in them as her ass ballooned outwards like twin yoga balls. She yelped in ecstasy as her growing breasts began to brush her nipples against the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>We're reaching the limits of your mobility,</i> said the voice, <i>if we go bigger you won't be able to--</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MORE!\" shouted Lara, \"DON'T STOP UNTIL I FILL THE ROOM!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Sounds like a plan. Let's ramp this up</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara opened her eyes briefly as her body was propelled upwards on an explosively-growing mattress of thiccness. Her breasts rushed forwards in front of her as they swelled their bulk beginning to brush against Dave's cock. She saw that he was awake and saying something, but she couldn't bring herself to care. Lara ground her divinely-cushioned hips against the ground, the expansive bulk of her thighs brushing against her hypersensitive clit and driving all rational thought from her head. She could feel her monumental ass brush against the back walls of the room, its bulk straining against the ceiling. Lara panted heavily, the heaving of her chest causing her body to bob up and down on a sea of soft, squeezable glory. She gave a piercing scream as the pleasure reached a climax, her room-filling body cracking the bits of the ceiling that Dave hadn't destroyed, then relaxed as the post-orgasmic bliss filled her, resting her face into the soft, pillowy ocean of her cleavage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara breathed deeply as she tried to regain something resembling human thought. She glanced up at Dave, who had mercifully scrabbled away from the tsunami of chub unleashed by Lara. Well, mostly. She could feel a warm, hardening portion of him under her world-smothering tits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, honey?\" she asked, \"What do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave stared in a mixture of horror and amazement. Before him, a mess of pink, jiggling curves filled the room, with Lara's face and arms emerging from a point before him; her colossal, quivering bosom arced out before her, engulfing the better half of his dick and leaving Lara looking like a woman drowning in an ocean of her own body. A look of bliss, temporary satisfaction, and demonic lust was on her face as she licked her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I have to admit this is pretty impressive,\" mumbled Dave. \"But now what do we do?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm glad you asked,\" said a disembodied voice that Lara would have recognized, \"Because I think it's your turn to make a change!

She only wanted to surprise him and give him a little boost, not turn him into a constantly-orgasming cock-monster. What was meant as a pleasant surprise rendered him incapable of functioning in society. Unless she carted him around to parties as some kind of novelty fountain. Come to think of it, that'd be fun...No. No, that'd be wrong.  She had to make up for this. She could change him back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Why would he want to be changed back?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara's twinge of regret was overcome with a wave of self-obsessed certainty. Dave wouldn't want to be changed back. He was a man with a dick bigger than the rest of his body. Taking that away from him would be a betrayal of everything his gender stood for. No, she didn't need to make this right. She needed to take this situation and make it even <i>better</i> for him. If he woke up to something even better than having a titanic cock, who knows what he'd give her in return? Yes, that's what she'd need to do, give him something better than having a titanic cock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow what could be better than having a--Lara glanced her husband's dick--10 foot cock? Lara thought for a moment. Dave was a kind and loving man, but he had simple tastes. Making a boon as pure as a behemoth manhood even better would be--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara smacked her head in exasperation. The only thing better than having a ten-foot cock would be waking up to find that somebody was capable of sucking it, and the only thing better than that would be waking up to find somebody actually sucking it. She hoisted the computer onto a shelf on the server bank and started to type. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can comfortably fit my mouth around Dave's dick with no problems,\" she said. As her hand hovered over the enter key, she thought of her options. She really needed to weigh her options before doing this. She didn't want her wish to have unintended consequences like last time. \"And I can fit my throat around it too, if I want. Without a gag reflex. And I can produce as much suction as I want with my lungs and mouth, but I don't need to breathe if I don't want to. And Dave has no refractory period. No matter what, he's always able to produce gallons of cum at an absolute minimum. Barrels if it's been a while since he last came.\" She paused for a moment, \"And I can swallow every last drop of it with no ill effects.\"  There. That should cover her bases. She tapped the enter key and waited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd waited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd waited. She thought she would be able to feel something. Some kind of growth. Some kind of feeling of power. Some kind of elasticity in her jaw, but no, nothing. She swore under her breath. If she broke the computer, she could never forgive herself; there was so much she wanted to do. In a final, tentative act of frustration, Lara opened her mouth, then opened it a bit further. Then a bit further. Then a <i>lot</i> further. She reached up and shoved a fist into her mouth followed by her other fist. Her body froze in shock as she felt the insides of her cheeks, each one barely even brushing her hands. She felt downwards a bit. Good lord, her tongue must be the size of a dinner platter. She shoved them a bit further back into her mouth, willing her flesh and bones to warp to her will. Holding the back of her mouth in place with some hitherto-unknown power, she reached a hand down her own throat. She ran out of arm before she feel the slightest bit of discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy <i>shit,</i>\" Lara whispered, then leaped a bit in surprise as she heard a sound in front of her. Dave was beginning to wake up. She needed to get him ready for her surprise.She over to Dave, dragged him a bit further into the room as he groggily protested, and then sprinted back around to the tip of his dick. With lustful strength, she hoisted it and wrapped her lips around the very tip, relishing its rapid stiffening. That computer really knew how to make a girl happy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nnngf,\" moaned Dave. Lara glanced  and opened her mouth further. She needed to get him good and ready if she wanted to put on a good show. She stretched open her lips and cheeks  to accommodate her husband's unnatural girth and stepped forward, her mouth taking in the now-half-chub as she did so. She clamped down her cheeks around the pillar of flesh and began to suck, rocking her body forwards and backwards as she did so.  She'd need to figure out a better way of going about this if she was gonna do this regularly, but it seemed like this pendulum-action  was doing the job. Dave's cock had grown stiff in her mouth, and it was brushing the very opening of her throat. Lara thanked her lucky stars that she remembered to get rid of her gag reflex, sucked a bit harder, and stepped forward. It looked like hubby dearest had finally woken up. Time to finish giving him his new present. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Dave woke up, he couldn't tell if doing that was a mistake or not. When he looked up, he saw his wife's lips halfway up his cock. Her mouth had distended obscenely, raising the normally-proportioned top of her head several feet above the base of her jaw. Her cheeks had widened to fit his cock, leaving her head looking like the barrel of a cannon with a scalp and a pair of eyes mounted on top of its base. He could feel a tongue the size of her body lapping the sensitive underside of his dick, caressing him with a moist, undulating bed of flesh. He could scarcely manage to comprehend what had happened to his wife and he didn't want to; the computer had transformed her into a picture of horror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, this was feeling <i>amazing.</i> For a brief instant, a lone pillar of arousal stood against a wave of primal fear in his mind. Maybe he was being unreasonable. This could be fun. Life could become much more pleasurable if he only accepted this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, no. The love of his life had warped her head into a crime against nature through dark magic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god, Lara what the fuck?!\" he yelled. Lara waved a hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhay hmmy!\" she said. Somehow, the edges of her lips curled upwards into a smile. That was about enough for Dave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get off of me! Get away!\" He flailed his arms and legs against the ground as he tried to scramble away. Useless. Even if the pipeline between his legs hadn't weighed more than the rest of his body, his wife was somehow managing to produce a mind-boggling degree of suction. Images of her gleefully typing into the computer flashed through his head as locked up in fear, his body locked in a futile tug-of-war against gravity, suction and hellish magic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara's smile widened, distorting into a curve while keeping a death grip on Dave's rigid manhood. She was expecting him to be overcome with bliss, but that could wait. Her husband's fear was an <i>incredible</i> prelude to his pleasure. She reached her hands around her cheeks, feeling the rock-hard flesh beneath them. Time to see if she could freak him out any more before she got him off. She applied all the suction she thought she could, drawing the remaining length of his penis into her mouth, sending the rest down her throat. She looked up at his widening eyes and gaping mouth, and would have debated if they were caused by terror or arousal if she wasn't more concerned with furiously masturbating. She removed a hand from her mouth and thrust it in between her legs. She still had one more trick up her sleeve. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings were getting worse for Dave. Not only was his wife some kind of Cronenbergian sex-demon, she had enough suction power to suck him along the floor until he was balls-deep in her mouth. She had taken a few steps back to keep her body at the very tip of his cock, but at this point that hardly mattered. Her lips were wrapped around the very base of his penis, the still-extant cupid's bow of her lips brushing against the base of his stomach in some spasm or twisted show of power. Behind her eyes, Lara's throat flared backwards as a gargantuan, cylindrical expanse of flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave began to see that waking up was a mistake as Lara began to stretch her throat forward and give her mouth more slack, <br>\r\nseemingly bringing the top of her head forward, her eyes sliding along this demonic pillar of skin towards his body. Her head came to a stop a few feet before his body. She waggled her eyebrows at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aykh ih, itsch,\" she mumbled, \"Uhr ahn aoh\". In spite of himself, Dave would have laughed, but in that moment, Lara began pulsing the inhuman strength of her lungs on his dick, each tightening and release sending bolts of ecstasy through him. The top of her head slid backward and forwards along her obscene bulk, then began to twist around and around the body of his cock,  filling him with sensations he could barely understand, let alone resist. He could feel his climax being sucked, rubbed and licked out of him. He tried to stop himself, but couldn't. Fear and pleasure united into one as he came, spewing enormous blasts of jizz into his wife's throat as her smile distended further in triumph. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the two were done, Lara gradually withdrew her throat and mouth from Dave's manhood. She relished each agonized twitch her husband made as she milked the last few pints of cum from his cock, her facial features settling back to normal as she removed her mouth from his genitals. She had fallen onto her ass at this point, her belly distended into a jiggling, beach-ball-sized parody of pregnancy in front of her. Dave was lying on his back, catatonic in fear and orgasmic bliss, but still conscious. A thick rivulet of ejaculate trailed from the corner of Lara's mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, babe?\" said she, not even bothering to avoid gloating. \"Is eldritch terrorsex the best, or is it the best?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god,\" whimpered Dave, \"Oh god help me.\" He glanced at Lara, taking some relief in the fact that her head looked less like a fleshy Howitzer and more like an actual head. \"What are we going to do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You forgot already?\" said Lara, \"It's your turn now! Whatever you want. Promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Now what?</i></span></div></div>",

I want this to be a surprise.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm,\" said Lara, smirking, \"I guess I can do that.\" She grabbed the computer. \"Just remember, babe, I can do this whenever I want.\" She opened her mouth, her lips drawing further and further outward until they wrapped around the laptop's keyboard. She stretched her neck towards Dave, laying a now-slightly-moist laptop into Dave's overburdened lap. She circled around Dave's body, encircling his body with her stretched neck. \"So, y'know, maybe don't try anything funny.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara retracted her neck like a tape measure, her head snapping back into position, before strutting over to the other side of the room. Dave gazed at his wife's retreating ass. She was wearing her show-off jeans today, and she was filling out every inch of them, leaving her backside looking like a denim peach. Dave supposed that--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave waited for Lara to reach the other wall, quickly workshopping his plan. If this worked, he could keep Lara happy and keep her away for long enough for him to incapacitate Lara before she could retaliate in...whatever way she was thinking. Dave suppressed various images he saw in nature documentaries as Lara turned around, a wry smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, big boy?\" asked Lara, \"What's your move?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave took a deep breath and began to type.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lara's jeans can stretch to accommodate any burden, and Lara's ass is too huge for her to reach me,\" he tapped into the computer, then hit the enter key. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave looked up at Lara, his heart racing in some combination of arousal, anticipation, and fear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Dave,\" said Lara, shaking her head, \"Tough luck, I guess. Looks like you wasted your tur--<i>ooh.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara's legs froze in place as she took a step forward. She glanced down, prodding at her thigh. \"What the hell did you do? It feels like they're gonna expl--<i>oh god!</i>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara and Dave's eyes widened simultaneously as they gazed at Lara's legs; her jeans were stretching as they widened outwards, her legs swelling like long, water balloons. Lara's gaping mouth warped into a far-too-wide smile as she pawed at her butt, its Mixalotian proportions swelling out, wider than the front of her body, into Dave's field of view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're <i>naughty!</i>\" squealed Lara. She yelped as she fell backwards, her ass plummeting the foot and a half that separated it from the floor. She laughed as she bobbed up and down on her buttocks like a pair of fleshy yoga balls, sinking her fingers into her freshly-granted endowments. She lounged backwards into her swelling ass as they gradually lifted her feet off of the ground. \"Oooh, Dave, how big did you make me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave stared in rapture for a few moments. Lara was lying on a jiggling, waist-high expanse of denim as it grew upwards and outwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" muttered Dave, \"Uh, I just said that your ass was huge. Figured I'd get you back for the whole dick incident.\" Lara laughed as she grew, her ass now as tall as the rest of her body and large enough to touch three of the room's four walls. The windows on the exterior wall began to crack under a callipygian onslaught. Dave eyed it as it began to extend towards the tip of his dick. Oh dear. How big <i>was</i> she gonna get? He tugged feebly at the base of his flaccid dick, straining against the multi-ton weight of his manhood. Dave's heart pounded in his chest as the soft, denim-covered mass extended over his pipeline. He could feel himself stiffening, the force of his erection sliding outwards under Lara's colossal ass. The pressure of his blood forcing him up against Lara's colossal thighs. Good god they were wider than he was tall at this point. His dick twitched, bucking Lara ever so slightly as she tentatively giggled. A tinge of fear was creeping into her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Dave? How big am I at this point?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could probably charge rent for that booty,\" droned Dave. It was true at this point. He couldn't even see Lara's body. He heard shattering glass as Lara's ass broke through the windows. The floorboards and walls were creaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, because that ceiling is getting awfully close,\" said Lara. \"Actually, it's getting super--Dave! Dave, stop this, I'm gonna be cr--<i>mmshd!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara's ass was flush with the ceiling and engulfed the better part of Dave's throbbing erection. It futilely strained upwards against the mass of his wife, pressing upwards on god-knows-how-many-tons of ass. Above him, Lara's mountainous thighs kicked feebly in panic, their soft, pillowy forms rubbing against the walls and each other like tectonic plates, sending an jiggling earthquake through what parts of her body were visible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dhhv! Lngt mh th fhck ut f hr!\" shouted Lara through a wall of her own soft majesty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I don't think so, Lara. I'm putting an end to this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nng yr nt!\" shouted Lara. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Seriously, you're not,</i> said a voice in Dave's head, <i>I let you do this because it was fun, but I'm not gonna let you throw away the chance of a lifetime.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh...what?\" asked Dave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lnnby!

That's it, I'm coming out there.</i> The now-crawling time came to a halt as a line shone from the computer. It grew brighter before flashing Lara, blinding her temporarily. When she could see again, she saw a form standing in the room. It was wearing sneakers, low-waisted pants and a slightly-too-small shirt that showed a flat belly and a slightly-less-flat chest. It had a rounded, innocent-looking face and glas--wait. Wait shit, that was her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...you...\" said Lara. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" said the vision, \"I'm <i>you.</i> Well, I'm also me, but you're a...look. It's complicated.

If you're not that creative, call me Libby.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...okay Libby. Why are you here?\" Libby pinched the bridge of her nose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look. Babe. I'm the result of the universe's sex drive. Every time some bacteria conjugate, every time a fruit fly does its mating dance, every time some rabbits get down to breeding, every time some dude tries to impregnate a sock while watching hentai, I get stronger. Billions of years worth of creation's desire to get freaky are driving my every action. The last guy made sure I could communicate with you guys by hijacking that computer and then borrowing some bits of your personality, but I'm basically the goddess of fuckin'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, but what does that--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It means that you're boring, alright? By the time the last guy threw the emergency brakes on and got out of this dimension, his lady-love managed to suck 25 dudes and a helicopter up inside of her, turned them into tiny little clones of herself, and was about to do the splits and see if she could do the same to the entire earth. She probably could have, too, but the old man gave her a time fun enough to knock her out and save the world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I don't want to shove a planet up my--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not the point, alright?\" Libby's voice was tinged with irritation and pity for the poor, repressed human. \"What I'm saying is that my mojo nearly caused the apocalypse once, and now I'm being asked to perform a procedure that you could get done with 3000 bucks and a weekend off!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want big, natural titties? Blow enough money at the Cheesecake Factory to pay for your waitress' student loans, get the bits you don't like lipo'd off, and then go live your basic-bitch life. Your husband'll thank you for the new pillows. But you want to bring Mamma Libby into the game? Set your sights a little higher.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I want giant, sensitive tits!\" said Lara. \"I want anime tiddies and I want to soak my panties everytime Dave touches them!\" Libby smiled. This one wasn't a total lost cause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wish granted.\" She pointed a finger at Lara. Lara's chest swelled outwards with a sound like a drunk timpani, snapping her bra strap, straining her shirt, and sending her to her knees. Her eyes had rolled back into her head and her mouth hung open like a horny cavern. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I...\" She got to all fours. The tips of her rock hard nipples were brushing the floor, and it was all she could do to not scream as they did so. She pushed herself upwards, trying not to stumble. She could barely wrap an arm around them; not that she'd be able to for very long without needing a long night in with Dave. \"Oh god, thank you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goddess,\" said Libby. \"At least when I'm riding shotgun with you. But, you know, this ain't free.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, typically I just ride along inside the head of the first person to use me for something fun, maybe give 'em a nudge here and there, and then see where things take me. You, however, might need some hands-on coaching.\" She walked over to Lara, rested an arm on her expansive bustline, and leaned in. Lara didn't immediately collapse, but that was because the rapid-fire pulsing in her pants had left her nearly catatonic. \"I get to make the next change. Don't worry, nothing too crazy just yet, but I need to show you what fun you can have when I'm your best friend.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...<i>ahnngggh</i>...I...<i>oh goddess yes, yes do it!</i>\" Libby grinned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good girl.\" She snapped a finger, and time started up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L...Lara?!\" asked Dave \"Wait there's two of--which one are you?\" Libby laughed and shook her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This'll be fun,\" she said, \"now, where to begin?</span></div></div>",

Fine. I've got enough mojo to stay out here  for a few more hours, let's get funky with this.\" She waved a hand at Dave. His feet began to lift off the ground, suspending him in midair. Another wave, and his pants vanished, leaving him nude from the waist down. She snapped her fingers.  \"Let's get to work\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! I'm not going to--oh god.\"  Dave trailed off as his dick sprang to its full length and began twitching. Libby snapped her fingers again, and the gouts of cum grew to a small river.  \"Oh god I'm sorry, Lara! You can fight--oh fuck\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara stared in horror as the geyser of cum approached her. She couldn't imagine it'd work the way that Libby said. She couldn't imagine that she'd be changed that much by this, but--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA drop of cum landed on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis could be fun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother burst of cum soaked her face, getting into her gaping mouth. Actually, this was pretty great. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe firehose of jizz began to soak her shoulders, dripping down onto her giant, heaving breasts. She shuddered in pleasure. Screw it, this was incredible, and it was only getting better. She couldn't get why she was so worried beforehand. She hadn't even considered what she'd be doing with her newfound endowments. Smother Dave, sure, that was a given. But they were too small to say, crush their car and strand them in paradise. And really, why would she stop with just her boobs? She could do anything. More junk in the trunk? More muscles? More chub? A dick? Screw it, she could pop her own head off and eat herself out. She could flood the apartment by getting horny enough, or grow to the size of a skyscraper and wear Dave like jewelry. Or send tendrils of herself across the room, covering the walls in torsos and lips and vulvas and tongues, watch as Dave ran for his life, then hunt him down through the forest, pin him to a tree, wrap herself around him and make him cum until he passed out. She could be the new goddess of sex or...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down at herself. Her form was plastered white with strands of her husband's jizz. Looks like he had stopped.

Soon, a vicious grin spread across her face, the predatory rictus seemingly alien on her carbon-copy of Lara's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh,\" said Libby. \"That actually could be kinda hot.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" asked Dave, \"What are you--\" Libby snapped her fingers, and Dave's mind went blank. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Dave woke up, he half-expected to be nursing a vicious hangover. Thank god, or Libby he guessed, for small mercies. He stared at the ceiling. This...this wasn't the cabin. He sat up, casting his eyes about the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wallpaper of the room was peeling and yellowed. The carpet was criscrossed with a mess of mud tracks, coupled with some miscellaneous stains that Dave sincerely hoped were ketchup and mustard. A black-velvet painting of dogs playing poker hung on the wall, although he suspected that the variety of poorly-spelled profanities weren't penciled on the original. The bed, mercifully, looked pretty new. Dave suspected that Libby was involved in that little detail. He glanced down at the rickety nightstand. A note printed on crisp, white paper rested on it. Dave picked it up, a pit of terror growing in his stomach, and began to read. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i> Babe--<br>\r\nI'm sorry that Libby knocked you out. I thought we'd be starting at the cabin, but she said it'd be more fun this way. She also said it'd be fun if she rode your unconscious dick while the two of us made out. I figured we'd compromise. You're welcome. Anyway, here's what's going on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you look in the drawer of the night stand, you'll find a little ray-gun thing. Kinda looks like the portal gun from that Rick and Morty show you wouldn't shut up about last year, so that oughta be fun for you. I'll be honest, I've tried it out on Libby and it was pretty fun so I guess I can get the appeal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gun is a watered-down version of the computer. If you select a modification and point it at someone, the gun'll make that modification. The bad news is that's ALL you can do. You can only modify other peoples' bodies or minds. The good news is that these don't have Libby making the decisions, so they'll turn out how you imagine the selected modification would turn out. Oh, also, yeah, forgot to mention. If we used the computer on our own, Libby would have warped all of our decisions to fit what she wanted. Sorry, I'm digressing again, I'm just SO EXCITED for what happens next! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo yeah! Here's the rules of the game. I've got a ray gun just like yours, but it's a bit different. Once a day I can make a supernatural change. I just used it today to give myself superhuman speed, for example. Otherwise, we're the exact same. Except, y'know, I've got giant tits and a goddess on my side and an overwhelming desire to hunt you down like a wild animal and fuck you silly. Oh, that reminds me of the next rule. If I catch up with you, I'm gonna make a change to your body and use you like a sex toy. Who knows, if you get caught enough maybe you'll just want to be my sex toy! I'm..wait, sorry, I'm getting off track. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, if you manage to make a change to my body before I can, I'll leave you alone for a day. You can even fuck me if you want, I'm not complaining. Libby's offering to join in as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have your keys, your wallet, and the car's parked outside with a full tank of gas. The room's been paid for, and you don't need to check out. Believe me, you'll be glad that you have this extra time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe game ends when I get bored. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, I'm guessing that you're getting bored of reading this. I know that I am, so I'm gonna give you a TL;DR and then go hump the coffee table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTL;DR: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. You have a ray gun that can modify others' bodies and minds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. I do too, and I can give myself superpowers once a day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. If I catch up with you, I'll try to make a modification to you and then ride you like a scared motorcycle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. If you manage to make a modification to me before I can modify you, I'm all yours for the next 24 hours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. You have your debit card, your keys, and your car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. When you read this note, I'll know that you're awake and the game is on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n7. I'm five miles away from you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n8. Did I mention that I have superspeed? Seriously, I can run at 60 miles an hour. You do the math. Except don't take too long, because I'm probably closing in on you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSee you soon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--Lara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave took a look at the lipstick mark on the page and the mess of eggplant and peach emojis, dropped the note in panic, then opened the drawer of the end table and seized the ray gun as he did some mental arithmetic. Lara was about 5 minutes away from her and he probably had spent the last couple of minutes reading her note. He dashed over to the door and put on his shoes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara was probably a couple minutes away and sprinting closer by the second. He needed a plan. What to do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Dave flung open the door and scrambled into the dismal, dimly-lit hallway, hurling himself down the stairs nearly a flight at a time. He had no idea what was going on in Lara's head, but Libby's corruption had clearly wormed its way into her mind. He bypassed the empty reception desk and ran out into the open air. He scanned the parking lot before finding his car, a gray Honda sedan. He jogged to the driver's side door and fumbled around, looking for his keys. Oh god, did he leave them in the room? He didn't have time to go back, Lara must be a minute out by this point. He slapped at his back pockets, and felt a metallic lump. Sighing with relief, he grabbed the key and shoved it into the lock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then he could see a cloud of dust on the horizon. Dave squinted at it, his mind not quite grasping what it was until it had grown dangerously close. In the center of the cloud, he began to make out Lara's form as it sprinted towards the hotel, her arms and legs moving almost inhumanly fast. A small, suicidally-idiotic portion of his brain wasted precious seconds wondering how she could run that fast without her colossal tits bouncing up into her face and knocking her out cold. By all accounts, he couldn't see so much as a jiggle from them. Libby must have--oh shit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave hopped into the car, locking the door behind him, before jamming the key into the ignition. As he put the car in gear, he saw Lara skidding to a halt outside the motel parking lot's entrance. He could see the look of exultation on her face even from across the lot. He careened out of his space, taking his car straight through the dead grass separating the motel from the road. The car's tires screeched as Dave pulled onto the frontage road, his car's engine roaring into life as he slammed the accelerator, begging for whatever god of the road could exist to give him a jolt of nitrous, a speed booster, anything. He cursed himself for picking out a car based on its gas mileage and price; why couldn't he have guessed that he would need to race away from his magic, sex-crazed wife and her new elder-goddess friend? Hindsight was a bi--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave glanced down at the dash. He had just passed the 60 miles per hour mark on the odometer. Lara could have caught up with him easily at this point, but she hadn't. Was she on the roof? Did she somehow worm her way into the trunk? Oh god what if she could turn herself invisible somehow? Shaking, Dave glanced into the rear view mirror. Lara was standing in the middle of the road, hands on her hips. Dave sighed in relief, trying to suppress the trace of fear that was eating at his innards. He had gotten away. He could win this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You let him get away,</i> said Libby's voice in Lara's head, a tinge of irritation in her tone. <i>You could have had him! You could still have him! He hasn't gotten up to speed yet! Why aren't you--</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't let him get away,\" said Lara, reaching to the ray gun in the holster she had purchased this morning. \"I'm making a point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The hell are you talking about? He must be a half a mile away by now!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's your aim?\" asked Lara, leveling the ray gun at the fleeing car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, seeing as how you're an actual goddess, I'm guessing that you must have some decent aim. Don't male octopi mate by throwing their dicks at a female or something? I'm guessing you need pretty good aim for that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well, yes, but--</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's getting away, Libby. Am I on target?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I--</i> began Libby, before comprehension dawned in her mind. <i>Oh. No, aim up a little bit--a bit more, okay, now a smidge down and to the left--There! </i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara pulled the trigger on the ray gun, a thin pulse of pink light shooting from the remote-control-like LED on the end. She smiled, knowing that on some level Dave'd enjoy this as much as she did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't let him go,\" said Lara, her voice diminishing to a dramatically-hushed tones. \"I made a point. It's all about the hunt, not the kill. I know I'm gonna win in the end, but I want to take my time. Relish the process. Give it an hour, and he'll know that all too well.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I think I like this new you.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep it your pants, babe. I'm gonna hit up a bar and keep an eye on our bank account. He's gonna need to withdraw money sooner or later.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Dave looked up into the mirror, he saw Lara leveling an arm outwards and pause. He stared in confusion. His wife hadn't so much as touched a gun before today, and she was carrying a glorified pistol. How did she think she was gonna--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little pink beam of light ricocheted off the mirror and struck him between the eyes. A little tingle ran down his body, settled in his balls, and vanished. Dave's eyes locked back on the road, his body frozen in fear. Oh god, what did she do? Was his dick gonna grow until it smashed through the windshield? Was he gonna shrink down until he was too small to lift a paperclip, much less fire the gun? He glanced into a side-mirror as he pulled onto the freeway. Could he drive in whatever his new condition was? What if he lost control of the car and died in a wreck, and would that be better or worse than getting caught by his wife? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMercifully, for a little while Dave couldn't tell any difference in his body or mind. He still could drive fine, he seemed to have his faculties, and he hadn't dropped below 80 miles per hour for the past hour or so. Aside from the rock-hard erection and the weird swelling feeling in his balls, he was doing pretty alright. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave lost focus, his eyes slipping into the vacant stare. Oh wait. That little qualification was probably a problem. Dave chewed his tongue. Come to think of it, he was feeling really horny. His breath quickened and deepened as he tried to maintain his concentration. Somewhere within him, some heinous demon that he hadn't battled since high school roared out of its slumber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh hey,</i> it said, its voice dripping with a familiar smugness, <i>Looks like she actually made the shot. What a boss, I didn't think she had it in her.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get thee behind me, Libby,\" muttered Dave as he scanned the signage ahead, begging the Nevada desert to give him something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh come on,</i> whined Libby, <i>I spent the last two billion years locked in a collective unconsciousness. Yeah, the collective unconsciousness of some primitive prokaryotes. Think about it. Then I spent a few months locked in a computer, and now that I'm free you're giving me the cold shoulder?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave set his jaw. Truck stop, ten miles out. He hoped he could make it that long. An image of him pulling off to the side of the road and waiting for Lara to catch up drifted through his head. A sizable portion of him didn't object to the thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Just some quality time. If I'm gonna referee this little game I may as well see how my the players are doing.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm. Fine.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>She really does love you, you know.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Your wife loves you. She's not gonna hurt you, Dave. You doused her with enough magic cum to turn a nun into some kind of monster, but even then she wouldn't let me at you. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, about that. I'm not really happy with the whole 'you-tried-to-fuck-me-while-I-was-unconscious' thing.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Yeah, that's why I'm hoping that with that new little upgrade, you can get her to the point where she's on board with some tandem riding.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that first curse is still working?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Yup,</i> laughed Libby. <i>For a guy who's under this amount of pressure, you're actually on the ball! Oops, sorry, poor choice of words.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRest stop five minutes out, thought Dave. His testis were starting to graze the denim of his pants. What would happen if they got much bigger didn't merit consideration. He floored it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had to sit through a SAT proctored by Ms. Daniels,\" he muttered as he saw the exit ramp in the distance. \"Dealing with a magic spell for an hour and a half is bush league.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oooh, the plot thickens! I'll have to ask Lara for some old photos of Ms. Daniels.</i> Dave ignored her as he tore into the empty truck stop parking lot. He screeched into a space, put the car in park, turned off the ignition, and got out, an arm cradling his heavy, swollen junk as he did. He waddled into the mens' room, walked into the first stall, desperately trying to ignore the smell and obvious glory hole. He closed the door behind him and dropped trou to inspect the damage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn some ways, it could have been worse. Yes, he had a set of family jewels worthy of a king. Yes, his scrotum had swollen to the size where he had to actually use an arm to hold it up, and yes, it felt like he was carrying two lead cannonballs between his legs. But, as he found out within a few strokes, pressure was on his side. He stared in exhausted contemplation at the firehose of cum spraying out of him, coating the wall. He didn't care anymore. Hell, this probably wasn't the first time that this happened in this stall. On the plus side, his genitals had shrunk back down to their original size. He zipped up and left the stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave hopped into the car, started the engine, and glanced at the clock. Five minutes had passed. Against his better judgment, he chuckled. Lara was still 15 minutes out, and even if she had caught up with him, with that kind of speed she'd be in for a disappointment. He peeled out of the lot and headed towards the horizon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>So. How're you doing, champ?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better, no thanks to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hey, no need to be snippy with me! I'm not here to undermine you. Hell, I won't even tell Lara where you are! Not that she needs the help, I mean.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that supposed to mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh, never mind. You might want to have a plan, though.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I figured that much out, thanks.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>So what's it gonna be?</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next few hours were a blur. Most of the plan made sense. He had a shared account with Lara. If he withdrew money, she'd know, and could triangulate in on him without that much of a problem. Lara also had more of the computer's juju on her side, not to mention the fact that Libby would definitely show more favoritism to a busty, superhuman pervert than a terrified man on the run. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hey, that's not true! I'm just here to provide moral and tactical support,</i> protested Libby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway. Even if Dave didn't do anything to show up on Lara's radar, there was nothing to prevent her from giving herself actual radar and hunting him down. She'd probably wouldn't bother to give herself a perfect husband-hunting homing system, and she'd no doubt draw out the hunt at first, but he was pretty certain that she wouldn't let him off with another hindering-but-ultimately sustainable alteration. He would need to hide, and an open desert wasn't a great place to do that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave's first stop was a crappy roadside gas station a few miles west. He  filled up the tank, walked over to an ATM, and took out as much as he could from his shared account. The clerk was eyeing him, though that may have mostly been due to Dave's rapidly-swelling gonads. As an afterthought, he bought a couple gallon jugs of water. Hydration was important, but not stopping every time his new condition got to be too pressing was moreso. Dave hopped back in the car and drove southeast, hitting up the first major pharmacy he came across. Again, the clerk eyed him when he tried to buy several thousand dollars' worth of prepaid debit cards in cash, but compared to the swelling bulge in his pants and the angry methhead who staggered in, the purchase was small potatoes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave got into the car, drove out of town, emptied himself  and his backup jugs, and set his eyes on the horizon. Two hours and his first prepaid card later, and he was in a hotel in Vegas. He sat down on the bed, hung his head, and mulled over his options. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara sat at the bar of the Blunt Force Saloon, nursing a beer and staring at her phone. Nothing from Dave yet. She shrugged and glanced around the room, admiring her handiwork. A few hours ago, the place was a mostly-deserted biker bar ran by a man with fewer teeth than customers. Over the next fifteen minutes, judicious use of superspeed and her ray gun turned the bar's handful of dirtbags with beer guts and swastika tattoos into a bevy of bimbos with beach-ball breasts and bowling-ball booties. Another minute later, and she had entered that alliteration into her phone. If men could be warrior poets, she may as well be a sex-wizard poet. The next hour had turned the Eureka chapter of the Desert Eagles into a small army of underlings overstuffed with silicone. Lara had to admit, she may have actually improved their prospects in life. One of her new underlings, the woman formerly known as Tire Iron, sashayed over to her and planted a kiss on her neck with a pair of enormous lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there, like, any news, Mistress?\" she asked, rubbing herself on Lara's back with a bustline that dwarfed even her mistress' endowments. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet Tire Ir--uh, Tiffany,\" said Lara. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, but I wanna see what that riding a Harley is like now! It just like, vibrates so much!\" Tiffany placed a hand between her legs and revved her own throttle. \"Vroom! Vroom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Tiff, I know,\" said Lara, rolling her eyes. Really, this was the last time she took Libby's advice on fun transformations. This was just an insult to her gender. Admittedly, she mused, it was a <i>hot</i> insult. Prior to meeting Libby, her taste in women trended towards the petite, pixie-cut-sporting end of the scale, but the past day or so had really expanded her horizons.  \"Dave might be better at this than I thought--\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer phone chimed with an alert from her bank. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Libby? Come out here. The game's on.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, finally! You have no idea how long it took him to come up with a plan,\" said Libby as she materialized. She was sporting the same ripped-leather-jacket-and-tank-top combo as the other patrons of the bar, although she wasn't filling it out quite as well. \"And then your bank takes this long to actually update its records? Bo-ring! At least I had some fun time to go people-watch here. Hopefully you figure out what Dave's plan is or otherwise it'll be--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what?\" asked Lara. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Um. Nevermind. What does it say?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It says that Dave hit up an ATM in some nowhere gas station.\" She looked at the pool table, where a pair of the former bikers were making predictable, albeit unorthodox, use of the pool cues, before looking back at Libby. \"He's not gonna keep heading in that direction, is he.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't say,\" said Libby. \"I'm here to provide moral and tactical support, not rat out your prey.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you help me catch him, you can ride him with me.\"  Libby paused, her desires struggling against her previously-unknown sense of morality. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, but no,\" said Libby. \"It's hotter if there's rules. Like roleplay! Or bondage! Or--\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, you've made your point.\" Lara looked at her watch. \"But hey, looks like 24 hours have passed since I gave myself superspeed. You know what that means, right?\" Libby nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's your game?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to prevent any person or communication from leaving whatever town Dave's in, and I want to know what town that is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that's two separate powers--\" muttered Libby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Play along and I'll shove Dave's face in between your legs,\" said Lara. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"--but then again, it's really my fault for not defining the rules of the game better, so whatever. Okay, so Dave's in Vegas right now.\" Lara raised her eyebrows. At least Dave picked out a fitting setting for their showdown.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And he's stuck there?\"  asked Lara<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah. It's been hit with a snowstorm,\" said Libby. The past few hours had left her and her mortal tool on edge, and it was starting to show. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Odd choice of disaster, but sure. And the communica--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've put a media blackout on the city, and there'll be some generic news coming out of the region to take its place and avoid suspicion. That good enough?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually,\" said Lara, a smile returning to her face, \"Actually yes.\" She stood up and turned to the bacchanalian mess of leather, collagen and silicone before her. \"Ladies! We ride for Vegas!\" The patrons of the bar rushed for the exit in a mass of obscene bouncing and excited squealing. They mounted their hogs, moaning as the engines roared to life. Lara walked out of the saloon. \"Ready?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready!\" shouted Lara's personal army. Lara nodded and sprinted forward as her motorcycle cavalry followed in her wake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lara sprinted towards Las Vegas, she weighed her options. Yes, Dave was hiding in a major city, but that challenge could be fun. The question was, how would she go about her search process? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>On reaching Vegas, Lara and her cohort pulled into a motel on the edge of town. She and Tiffany wandered in and booked a room. Any resistance the clerk had to permitting an entire army of people to rent a single room was swiftly put to rest by Lara and her lieutenant resting their breasts on the reception desk and showing off a canyon of soft, wood-crackingly huge cleavage. She waved the rest of her underlings into the lobby, and she went up to the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies! Form a chair for me,\" commanded Lara. \"Do a good job and I'll let you share the bed.\" A few moments later, Lara was settling herself onto her giggling, scantily-clad throne. She wiggled herself into a more comfortable position, easing into the softness of her army's curves and eliciting a wave of shuddering moans. A rock-hard nipple was prodding her in a very pleasant place.  \"Hey, Libby? Come on out. I wanna talk strategy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo,\" said Libby, appearing in the doorway. She took a look around the room and the writhing mass of bodies in it. \"I like what you've done with the place.\" She fell backwards, disappearing into a body-dwarfing expanse of cleavage. \"Don't worry, I'm still listening, I'm just appreciating your design choices.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I've given this some thought, and the whole \"searching for one man in a whole goddamn city\" thing sounds pretty dull,\" said Lara. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmhmm?\" asked Libby, reaching up and squeezing at her impromptu furniture. A squeal emanated from the corner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How would you feel about me smashing my way through the city as Lara-zilla?\" She patted a buttock the size of her head, watching it jiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Depends,\" moaned Libby, writhing into a comfier position, \"Are you gonna kill anyone?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's not a deal breaker, but I can't imagine I'd be able to handle this without a few red smears on the ground.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-uh,\" said Libby, sitting up to glower at her champion. She leaned back against a breast that nearly rose up to the base of her neck, still trying to look imperious. \"Remember what I said? Sex goddess. Not death goddess. You smush enough citizens, and you chip away at my mojo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" snapped Libby, patting at the cushion behind her. \"You mortals don't know how fun consciousness is. You want to go all kaiju? You do it my way.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We wait. You give the people of this city immunity to your rampage. Then you get down to business.\" Lara pursed her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, fine. We can be boring and wait,\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who said anything about boring?\" asked Libby, standing up and plopping down onto the bed. \"Ladies! Wait for your general to join me in bed, then see how many of you can fit on top of us.\" Lara raised her eyebrows as she stood up. Maybe Libby had a point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few warm, squealing, jiggly hours later, and Lara stepped out into the parking lot. She selected a new option on the ray gun and tossed it over to Tiffany, her torso-dwarfing tits catching the projectile. She reached into the expanse, fumbled around a bit, and pulled it out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" said Lara, \"Just remember what I told you this morning. You're in charge while I'm up there.\" She gestured at the skyline, a grin stretching on her lips. \"When I give the signal, you come running. Go back up to the room and have some fun in the meantime.\" Tiffany giggled, licking her outsized lips. \"Okay, that should be enough prep for now. Pump me up!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany leveled the gun at her and fired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave woke up and stared at the ceiling. He wanted to leave, but the snowstorm that was surrounding the city was too much for him to drive through. The newscaster called it a \"freak weather pattern,\" but a storm encircling the borders of Vegas in the middle of spring had Lara written all over it. She <i>had</i> given herself Dave-radar. And--he glanced at the clock--she had enough time to give herself another bit of divine oomph. What kind of power would she have given herself this time?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Dave heard the explosion and screaming from outside. He sat bolt upright and ran to the window. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the distance was Lara, her hands caressing her titanic, naked body. The image of her in the distance towered even taller than her normal self could ever be, even if she were in arms reach of him. He could make out a building around her ankles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh. That was the power she had given herself. Dave nodded internally. This would make sense. She'd be big enough to flush him out, and it's not as though he could fight back. Also, she was <i>really hot</i> at this size. Dave glanced at the floor, pretending that he didn't just think that. What could he do at this point? If Lara could run like a cheetah at her old size, she could probably crush the city of a blink of an eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, thought Dave, as he strode out of the room, walking against the screaming throng of civilians towards the stairs, she was a larger target, and he didn't see a giant ray gun on her. He opened the stairwell and climbed towards the roof, reflecting on the fact that he really didn't spend most of his ogling time looking for a ray gun. Ah well, it had been eight hours since he last drained himself, and this was definitely pinging a fetish he'd never considered before. May as well take the chance. He stepped out onto the roof of the hotel and waved his arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Gigantits! Over here!\" he screamed, wondering if she could even see or hear him over the din of the terrified masses. She turned towards his hotel. Apparently so. She started sashaying towards Dave, her hips knocking over buildings tall enough to not be immediately trampled underfoot. She was smirking. Dave glanced down towards the ray gun, selecting the \"paralyzed\" setting. He waited for a bit, staring slack-jawed at the giant form of his wife approaching him.She turned towards a nearby tower and crouched to wrap her monument-sized tits around it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Dave!\" shouted Lara, her voice booming like thunder, \"You want to see what I'm gonna do to you first when I catch up with you?\" Dave moved his mouth in silent amazement, but no sound came out. \"Actually, y'know what? I don't care! Check this out!\" She reached up around her bust and squeezed her breasts together. An agonized screeching of warping metal and shattering glass pierced the air, followed by a deafening boom as her tits clapped together like the hands of a god. Dave's eyes widened in disbelief and arousal. She waggled her eyebrows and drew herself back to her full height. \"Maybe next I'll shove you in a skyscraper and shove it up inside of me! I bet it'd be a hell of a show.\" She walked up to Dave's roof. \"But hey, I'll have plenty of time to think about what I want to do to you when I've got you trapped in my cleavage.\" Dave looked forwards, staring straight into a ten-foot-wide nipple. Good lord. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave shook his head. This was a matter of survival. He raised the gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Now what?</i></span></div></div>",

It's a metaphor.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, but you're mixing your--\" Lara shot Libby a death glare, shutting up the sex goddess. She turned her gaze back to the ray gun and fiddled with the options. She turned it on herself, showering herself in a glowing pink light. Softly, slowly, the aura began to engulf her silicone legion. She turned to face them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, listen up, girls,\" she said, \"I've just given you all mind control powers. You can warp a person's brain to your will by walking up to them, looking them in the eye, and telling them what you want. If you turn them into your thrall, they'll also get mind control.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA vaguely excited murmur arose among her throng of followers. Well, most of them. A few of them were feeling each other up and rubbing themselves through their leather pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" she shouted, snapping all but a stubborn couple in the back to attention, \"I'm giving you a mission. Fuck it up, and I won't allow you to get off for the next month.\" She paused. \"That goes for you too, Libby!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat shut them up. Libby cast her eyes towards the ground, sheepishly. Billions of years of time spent as an intangible force hadn't quite given her the social know-how to disobey a sharply-given order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" said Lara. \"Now, our mission is to find Dave.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are we gonna do that?\" asked Tiffany, the sharpest box of rocks among her followers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you asked, Tiffany. Observe!\" Lara sashayed towards a parking attendant. He looked, dumbfounded, at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can--can I help you?\" asked the scrawny man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you could look me in the eyes, first,\" giggled Lara. Grudgingly, he obliged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara locked eyes with him, and a vague pink aura surrounded her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are my mindless thrall, now,\" she said, \"I take away the burden of your free will, and I give you the gift of mind control. Do you understand?\" A long, awkward pause hung in the air, until the attendant nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Mistress,\" droned the attendant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent,\" said Lara. \"Now go over there and join your sisters.\" His eyes lit up as he looked at his new comrades, and joined them faster than Lara could react. A couple manicured hands began to caress his shoulders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations to our newest recruit, the luckiest bastard alive!\" said Lara. Her followers giggled, even the parking attendant. Especially the parking attendant. \"Now, notice what I did. I got their attention, I looked them in the eye, I made them my thrall, and I gave them mind control. Any questions?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do we do with this?\" asked the former attendant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want us to rip each others' clothes off?\" asked Tiffany. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck each other like we were dying?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, she wants us to have a death-orgy!\" said a voice towards the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO! No death orgy!\" shouted Lara. \"You're going to find Dave.\" She threw some of her new Borg-Queen mojo behind her words, and she began to glow again. \"You're going to split up into three groups, you're going to go to the nearest hotels. You're going to turn the concierges into your thralls, you're going to give them mind control, and you're going to ask them if David Michaels checked in within the past day. If not, you're going to recruit the rest of the people in the lobby, and then you're going to go to the next hotel. You'll repeat this process until you find Dave. At that point, you're going to grab his arms and legs and have somebody call me. Do NOT brainwash him, do you hear me?! He's <i>my</i> man! Now, are there any questions?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery head in the crowd shook in a synchronized, metronome-like cadence. Lara grinned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rock 'n' roll.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave paced in his room. He was supposed to leave the city four hours ago, but <i>nooo</i>, Lara had to sic a goddamn snowstorm on him. So now here he was, stuck in a hotel room, watching pay-per-view porn on the TV and jacking off enough to fill a bathtub. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe really regretted doing that. The custodial staff was gonna have a hell of a time draining that tub, let alone cleaning it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave sat on the bed, trying not to crush his own cueball-sized nads in the process. He couldn't stay in town forever. He'd have to find something that could manage to penetrate the moaning storm that was wrapped around the city, get out of town, and lay rubber until he found the next place to bed down. He could insert himself somewhere that he couldn't be found, get in real deep, make his next thrust towards freedom, and god <i>dammit</i> these cursed balls were a pain. He had to take his mind off of things. He stood up, walked towards the window, and looked at the bustling city below. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere. The human drama. People driving and walking from casino to strip club to bar to strip club to buffet to casino and then back to their hotels to, presumably, sleep. There was an order amid the chaos. All Dave had to do was focus on that and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait. There really <i>was</i> an order there. And it wasn't a pattern. In the distance, there were crowds of people, walking in shoulder-to-shoulder unity, walking from building to building. With the exception of a few couples that were breaking off to make out against a nearby wall, they were acting in perfect synchronicity. Throngs of humanity were marching through the city, led by a small platoon of leather-clad...strippers? They looked like strippers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave stared for a moment, his brain struggling against the burden thrust upon it by his unquenchable libido, before coming to a conclusion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lara,\" muttered Dave. \"This is Lara's doing.\" Somehow, she had brainwashed the city into doing her bidding. He wasn't just outrunning a horny superhuman anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to make a plan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what? </span></div></div>",

I'll have plenty of time to be conventionally hot. Right now, I want to become a blob monster. I'm curious. Sue me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>O...kay,</i> said Libby. Lara toggled a few options, targeting her ass, gut, breasts and thighs. She handed the ray gun to Tiffany, who, with only some trepidation, fired it at  her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and if you could send a message to the people of Vegas about what they need to do to save their city, I'd be much obliged,\" said Lara. She could feel a rumbling in her gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" said Libby and Tiffany in unison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Now, step back. I'm about to release the chonk.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara strode forward while her underlings retreated. The process was already starting. She could feel a sated, sleepy feeling coming over her, like she had just ate the Thanksgiving meal of the gods. A swelling feeling began to fill her body as her body began to fill her clothes. In a momentary panic, Lara's hands flew to her belt buckle. Her waist was straining against the confines of her pants, the top of her belly starting to arc over her jeans like a loaf of bread rising from its pan. Her bra began to dig into her back as her breasts followed a similar course of action. She struggled with her belt as it constricted her swelling chub. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>RIP</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere went the ass of her jeans, followed by the legs. She could feel her enormous booty start to touch the ground behind her as her thighs began to rub up against some very sensitive places. Lara moaned softly, trying with renewed vigor to take off her belt. Her bra strap snapped open. Lara stared at the soft, jiggling expanse of cleavage beneath her, coupled with her round, strangled gut. She needed to breathe, and she needed to rub herself, and both of those things were rendered impossible by her apparently-mythic belt. In a moment of inspiration, she took a deep breath, jutting her belly outwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe snap of her belt resounded through the air like the cracking of a whip. The buckle of her belt and the button of her jeans rocketed away from her body, crashing through the windows of a car like bullets. Her gut sprang forward, exuberant in its freedom from the tyranny of pants. Lara tried to worm a hand under her swelling tummy, but to no avail.She moaned more desperately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Libby!\" she whined, \"Help me! I can't take this much more!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Okay, let's speed this up.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara felt parts of her rocket off the ground as her body distended, her swollen form flooding outwards. She could feel cars begin to bend and break beneath her, their alarms muffled by yards of lard. The skyline of the city began to lower to meet her gaze. Behind her, she could feel a parking attendant's booth being crushed by her mountainous booty. Shock, fear, satiety and arousal mixed in Lara's mind. She could see her gut approaching a dingy pawn shop near by. People were exiting to see what the fuss was about, just as the edge of Lara's belly smashed through the nearest wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smarter ones ran. The faster ones managed to escape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara figured that this was as good a time as any to make her demands known. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Citizens of Las Vegas!\" she shouted, Libby's magic amplifying her voice and sending it into the mind of every person in the city. \"My name is Lara Michaels, and I'm so fat that I just got hit by a bus and wondered if somebody threw a rock at me!\" She guessed that last bit, at any rate. It could have been a car, but she knew that something metal just rammed the side of her leg. \"I am looking for my husband, Dave! He's staying in a hotel somewhere in town, and I won't stop growing until you bring him to me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ocean of Lara's breasts and gut crashed up against a nearby office building. The structure held against the onrush of flesh. She saw her growing chub begin to rise, higher and higher, against the building, before it arced over the roof. She could hear the creak of the steel girders in the building, then felt as the tower toppled forwards with a resounding thud. Her belly claimed the fallen building as its own, swelling over it and trapping it beneath her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And before you ask,\" shouted Lara as an afterthought, \"Yes, this is a sex thing! Our bedroom life is kinkier than yours, deal with it. And bring me my husband before I crush you all! And maybe a few truckloads of Oreos! Mama's hungry!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave heard his wife's voice in her head. He sighed. She really couldn't do things the easy way. Silently, he stood up and walked out of his hotel room. He took the elevator to the ground floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, Mr. Michaels,\" said the concierge. Dave waved him off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah, I'm on it,\" he droned. He walked out into the street. He walked for a couple blocks, walking against the tide of fleeing citizens, before stumbling upon his wife. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom this angle, Lara Michaels looked like a ten-story wall of flesh. Her colossal, shockingly-smooth gut towered above him, arcing outwards like...Dave thought for a moment. Like the belly of a woman who decided to blackmail a city into delivering her husband to him by fattening herself up to city-destroying proportions. Above him, he could see her enormous breasts heaving with each doubtlessly-aroused breath that she took. The wall of Lara's soft tummy was advancing towards him, grinding buildings and vehicles to dust beneath her, while gently engulfing any people to slow to escape. Libby was apparently telling the truth about not liking death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lara!\" he shouted, watching in mild horror as a woman laid down before his wife's monumental gut. As the city-smashing belly crept over her, she flashed Dave a smile and gave him a thumbs up, mouthing the words \"good for you\" as she vanished beneath the adipose flood. \"Lara, you can stop! I give up. You found me.\" Lara's belly stopped growing. It stood before him, heaving obscenely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dave!\" squealed Lara's voice in his head. \"I'm so glad you gave yourself up. I'm all riled up from turning myself into a blimp and crushing half of an American metropolis, and I can't quite seem to reach my vag. Once I win this round, I'll need you to crawl up under me and see if you can find it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave shook his head. \"You aren't winning this round, Lara.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? Why not? In case you last checked, hubby, I crushed half the city and I've got you at my mercy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The game isn't about property damage, Lara. The game is about who can hit a target. Last I checked, you're the biggest target in town, and I'm pretty sure that you can't see me over all that fat.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! It's not polite to comment on a woman's weight.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give it up Lara,\" said Dave, aiming his gun at his behemoth wife. He had selected something marginally more subtle than Lara's choice. \"There's no way that you can shoot me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose not...\" sighed Lara, a dejected jiggle rippling across her body...</span></div></div>",

She could do this on her own as well. She looked at the raygun on the bedside table and grinned.

There was an odd, <i>taut</i> feeling in her chest. In a panic, she took off her shirt and bra. Her breasts were larger than they were originally, sure, but they were still merely huge. Why would...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tautness continued to strengthen, like a balloon stretching outwards. Her breasts were starting to swell forwards, their soft skin growing firmer as they did so. She could feel her underboob start to brush against the top of her newly-average-sized belly, sending an unexpected shudder of pleasure throughout her body. There was a tension starting to build in her. Almost unconsciously, Lara reached up to her nipples and squeezed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara fell to her knees, giving a surprised, ecstatic yelp as she did so. Her vision blurred from the intensity of the pleasure shooting through her, and a hot, growing wetness was forming between her legs.She could see twin streams of milk burst forth from her breasts, soaking patches of the hotel carpet, and bit her lip. She moaned in a mixture of pleasure and concern. This was too good. She couldn't bring herself to stop, but if she didn't then--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn image of her being trapped in a milk-flooded hotel room flashed through her mind's eye. No. She couldn't lose. Not yet. She had to hunt Dave down and make him drink her dry. Yes, that'd be a good reward for him.

In a mixture of panic and need for relief, she staggered over to the bed and collapsed, letting her heavy, swollen tits rest on the mattress. Their bulk extended nearly a third of the way across the bed, warping the springs like a pair of kettle bells. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Lara,\" she muttered to herself, \"this isn't the weirdest thing that's happened today. You're just turning into a one-woman dairy farm. Hell, a few minutes ago and you were thousands of times bigger.

After all, this contest was really all about getting off. She could--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Focus,\" Lara muttered to herself. She could feel a trickling sensation coming from her nipples, and the tension began to heighten. \"Gotta think of a plan.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara's breasts were swelling faster now as the engulfed more and more of the bed. The mattress groaned beneath their weight, and their bulk was beginning to block Lara's view of the rest of the room. She tried to stand up, grinding her teeth as she threw her entire strength into wrestling her colossal, leaking breasts off of the bed, but she may as well have been trying to lift a boulder. She was trapped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps it wasn't all bad, though. Lara leaned forward, groping tentatively. All that she could find was handful after tantalizing handful of taut, supple skin, jiggling like a water balloon on a suicide mission. Her nipples were out of reach. Never mind. This sucked. Lara's head sagged, comfortably smothering herself in her own endowments. Her arms drooped dejectedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that she felt a cold, familiar screen pressing up against her left palm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara seized the gun and flipped through the options with the desperation of a woman whose tits were about to explode. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe needed a plan.

In an instant, she could feel the weight on her chest begin to lessen. She stood upright; the mattress creaked in protest as her breasts eased upwards, their bulk now filling the majority of the bed, albeit more lightly than before. A small, distracted part of Lara's mind noted that it was several inches lower than before, and that bedframe looked suspiciously bent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Libby had better cover these charges,\" she muttered to herself as she fiddled with her hair. She had a couple of hair ties back there.  They weren't much, but they could hold back any leaks for a time. She fetched one and grabbed her left breast with both hands, trying  to get her nipple into arm's reach. The burgeoning stores of milk in her tits gurgled, as though in grim determination to undermine her. Her breast was growing firmer and harder to manipulate and each pawing movement at them sent an odd mix of pleasure and discomfort through her, but Lara was determined. She could see the strained, painfully-hard nipple come into view. She reached forward--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-- and dropped the fucking hair tie into her cleavage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHIT!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara glanced into the cavernous depths of her bosom. She could see it, held in place by the force of her breasts smushing together, but their growth was swallowing it faster than she cared to think. Lara gingerly placed herself onto the bed and rolled forward onto her bust, forcing her hand between her warm, firm breasts. The bed creaked as she struggled and her tits swelled, but she felt her hand closed on the elastic. She pulled her arm back and tried again. Her arms protested as she stretched towards her nipple, but with some luck, she forced it around the end. With more difficulty, she managed to get her other breast sealed off as well. She aimed at the hairbands, strengthening their elastic to the point of unbreakability.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, was it worth it? She felt a gnawing urge at the back of her mind, wondering how good it would be to just give herself a taste. She could burn her supernatural change for the day, figure out a way to get her mouth around her nipples, and go to town. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wait.

The floor was getting further away. Her eyes widened as she snatched at her belt. Her pants were starting to tighten in on her as she dropped trou and pulled her legs to freedom. Her view of the still-retreating floor was getting obstructed as her breasts were swelling further and further forwards, replacing her view of the ground with a tableau of expansive, jiggling cleavage. Lara smiled in spite of herself. This was more than what she asked for but she couldn't complain. She hardly noticed the bra strap giving way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit, Dave I'm huge! This is incredible, I'm --ow!\" She bent down and rubbed the back of her head as she looked up at the dent she left in the ceiling. \"Oh fuck yes,\" she whispered. She turned back to face Dave. Well, where Dave would have been if she weren't 8 feet tall and packing cleavage she could smuggle a prize-winning watermelon in. She bent over a bit and craned her neck. Dave had backed up into the corner. \"Holy shit, Dave, you know what this means?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-that you're 8 feet tall?\"  Lara laughed, sending a tsunami through her strained top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah, but A, I can do this!\" She took a few giant steps forwards, relishing the sight and feeling of Dave's head vanishing between her breasts. He put up a token resistance, but was either too horny, baffled or terrified to really try to escape. \"And guess what part B: is!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mpphmmmmng!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, babe!

Despite all his care, he encountered a few problems, but spotted and corrected them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he finished, he sat back and looked over what he had typed one last time.

Tanner leaned closer as she lurched again, even stronger. The lurching soon became a constant wiggling and shifting. A bulge tented the fabric before a tearing sound cut through the air. A flood of stuffing rushed out, obscuring what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it stopped, the stuffing was gone as if was never there. The pillow lacked Keikio\u2019s smiling face and hot body. There was a faded outline where he could still she where she should have been. He noted that for a brief moment, but his attention much more focused on the beautiful figure standing before him as real as the nose on his face.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"K-Keiko?\" stammered Tanner. The figure that once graced his dakimakura was standing in front of him. True to her appearance in <i>How can a single Underachieving College Student Attract the Attention of So Many Demons?</i> her mostly-willowy body was stood near the server rack, her decidedly-not-willowy bosom straining against a diaphanous top that barely covered her nipples and clung to her body, leaving her torso looking a little like a silken that swallowed a pair of basketballs. Her legs were clad in a pair of harem pants that obscured her features below the waist, but left Tanner ever more tantalized. Yes, Keiko, the demon princess of cunning, was the best girl, despite what the other idiots online would say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master, is that you?\" asked Keiko. Tanner's eyes snapped upwards, focusing on his new waifu's large eyes, flowing black hair, and delicate lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes, Keiko-chan, I'm your master,\" said Tanner, his amazement keeping arousal at bay in an admirable but doomed battle. Keiko smiled, and Tanner's mind turned to putty. Keiko stepped forwards, her hips swaying, as the faint-but-unmistakable bass-drum beat of her theme song played in the background. She ran her hands across her inhuman cleavage, letting them flow down the outsides of her breasts before she wrapped her hands under her expansive bust and hefted it. Her fingers struggled to contain the full expanse of her assets. Tanner risked a glance up at her face, which had her trademark wry smile plastered across it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Master,\" she cooed, \"You were so clever writing up that wish so well! I don't even think that our best lawyers could have found a loophole in it! I'm so impressed that I just have to let you in on a little secret!\" She leaned forward, placing her smiling visage between Tanner and a cleavage that really didn't need the extra help in being revealed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" asked Tanner. The walls of Amazement's fortifications were crumbling, and the forces of Arousal were pouring through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you see,\" said Keiko, running a finger inside her mouth for a brief, maddening second. She paused, her wry smile widened, and her breathy voice took on a harsh, sadistic glee. \"If you had read the original light novel or manga, you'd have known that we demons don't have to abide by contracts in canon. We just think that finding loopholes makes screwing over mortals funnier.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What.\" The battle in Tanner's mind had been shaken by the awakening of his terror and incomprehension. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! They didn't get to that bit in the first season of the anime.\" Keiko shook her head, whipping locks of her hair about and letting them hang down over her shoulders. \"The second season delves into psuedoreligious horror. Actually interesting stuff. Really controversial. The buzz about it was hard to miss.\" She smiled, revealing a row a fangs. \"I guess you shouldn't have been a casual fan!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, no no...\" whispered Tanner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes!\" said Keiko. \"Let the life of torment begin! Now, how to begin...I suppose you want to see my shapeshifting ability?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanner paused. He did, but not in this particular way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, who cares,\" said Keiko. \"I'll just take on the form of another demon queen and see how I feel. Now, who should I go with...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
