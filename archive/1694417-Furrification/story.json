She stumbles in with tattered leggings dangling on her rear legs. You don't see her come in right away, but the clopping hooves are a giveaway something's amiss. You turn the corner and almost jump out of your shoes; your girlfriend is a horse from the wais... no, wait, that's a horn jutting out her forehead, with a small trail of dried blood running from the base from when it seemed to have... grown out. Her ears were now long, thin, covered in white fuzz, looked like horse ears, and sitting higher on her head, poking out her long hair. You see that other than the tattered leggings on her rear legs, the rest of her clothes are intact. Oddly, her choice to wear a pleated skirt paid off for her in a twisted way, as it was still intact on her human hips, as was the rest of her clothes, although it looked like her bra was clumsily stuffed in her pocket boo... Oh look, her breasts were as big as her head now, which explains why the shirt that fully covered her this morning was now leaving her midriff fully exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can stop staring... I know I'm half horse, Jeremy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How? When? Why?\" you stutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. People just started transforming all of a sudden. Some did, some didn't. I was one of them that did. It happened when I coming home on the subway. I decided because so many people wee affected, it'd be asinine to try to go to a hospital, because that'd be what everyone would be doing, and what what I tell the doctor? 'Hey, doc. Can you help me? I suddenly became a unicorn centaur, and I'm worried my health insurance won't cover this.' So as I came home, I saw some of the other people changed. Overall, it was like some sort of virus that was making people more... animal-like. It seemed more women than men were changed, but the women that were changed were more often centaurs of some kind like me, or had minimal animal features like just ears and tails, though some women had full-on fur, fangs, claws, and muzzles. The men seemed more bestial and feral, as though whatever did this could infect women easier, but worked more effectively on men.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting...\" your attention begins to be diverted to her rear...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha... What are you staring at? People kept staring at me... well me more often than others, and it was weirding me out,,, What <b>ARE</b> you looking at?!\"</span></div></div>",

It won't be... all bad. I'm going to stay by your side through all of this, and as you said, this seems to be happening all over the city... maybe the whole country, the world even.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha clops on over to the sofa, fidgeting around a bit trying to figure out how to sit with her new centaur body, before finding a halfway tolerable position across the sofa, and turns on the TV, seeing a young cat-eared journalist doing a special report, the catgirl reporter seemingly the only one on the studio other than the person working the camera. They watch her trying to get information for hours, before, right around 2 AM, tired and frazzled, she seems to finally have some credible info.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...It seems we're finally getting reports in from the CDC from sites across the country, as well as information from several European and Asian agencies. At this point, it seems the mystery mutagen, which social media has dubbed 'The Furry Flu' seems to have infected roughly 70% of the world's population. The virus, as people have stated in tweets, seems more communicable in women than men, but more potent in men than women, and the changes usually all happen in a matter minutes, then it's over. The CDC has worked overtime, and already have identified four strains, which they've labeled strains F, B, W, and T. As of right now though, exact details on what each strain does has not come to light.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn the TV off, saying to Samantha, \"I know you're worried about all of this, but don't drive yourself crazy. It's going to take awhile for the CDC and WHO to figure out what is going on here. All we can do now is go to sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha yawns, then stumbles off the sofa, trying to get back on her four hooves. \"Ugh... I guess you're right.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>One week later, Samantha has <b>MOSTLY</b> mastered the art of walking on four hoofed legs. Stairs are... still a time-consuming challenge. It was a good thing her boss gave her the week off to adapt to her new 'horseyness,' because re-learning to sit down properly took a day alone. She also found that her shower wasn't large enough to accommodate her horse plot; the only shower in entire apartment complex that she use was a special large walk-in tub the elderly couple living next door in 4A, the Reitmanns, whom luckily seemed to managed to avoid infection themselves, had installed a few years back, and were willing to let Samantha use until you could get a contractor in to install a new shower for her. However, you have to admit, she has gotten pretty pro with that horn of hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you and Samantha noticed that the Reitmanns seemed to be the exception to the rule. On your floor, you saw most of your neighbors changed in some fashion. Rick Bannister in 4C had gone full-on wolfman, covered in fur, giant snout, fangs, the works, and has been parading around shirtless since he changed, while his two little girls seems to have become taurs, though unlike Samantha, his six year old girl Lizzie was a goat centaur, and and his ten year old daughter Rebecca was a lamia, which, based on overhearing her shouting at her dad, was not something she was pleased with, because she was upset about not having any feet to play soccer with anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver in 4D were the Ramalas, Raj and Asura. Asura had become a powerful six-breasted anthro leopard woman; she used to be just under 5', and now she hits her head sometimes in the top of the door with her 8' 2\" amazonian stature. Raj, on the other hand, somehow the virus had turned him into a woman, then into a catgirl with calico ears and tail. Strangely, both of them looked... younger, like the virus had knocked 10 or so years off the 30-something couple. Both have seemingly adjusted quite quickly to their new lives so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn 4E there is the Matsumotos. The father Hiroshi seems to have come out of this uninfected like me, as has his wife Makoto. However, their children seemed to have been infected, with their young son Akira now an anthro bat, while their 17 year old daughter Akiko now sporting fox ears and a tail, as well as a second pair of breasts and black furred paws for feet. Most surprising though is Akiko's twin sister Haruka, whom looks normal, but every night you heard Haruka scream out, her screams slowly shift into loud brays like that of a donkey, and then one night you it happen - she was trying to hurry into her apartment, her body sporting donkey ears poking of her hair, tail swishing out beneath her skirt, and growing grey fur all over, but then she dropped her keys, and that's when you saw her hands become hooves as her body swelled and exploded out of her uniform, and then to add to your surprise, you saw her now sporting a massive donkey dick and pendulous balls, her feminine opening sealed shut. She finally let out a long bray as her muzzle formed, the final part of the change turning her into a full-fledged male donkey, when suddenly she jizzed all over her apartment door. Just moments later, Makoto ran past you and began to apologize for not being home to let her in. She then explained what I had seen, that by day, Haruka was normal, but every night since this all started, she turns into a jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, in the last apartment on the floor, 4F, was the most shocking transformations. They were the Pratts. Beverly Pratt used to be a woman in he late 40's that was well over 300 lbs. Now she was a size 2 cowgirl with mottled skin, 4 K-cup breasts, a massive udder between her legs just above her crotch, two petite horns, floppy white fuzzed ears, and a cow's tail tipped in a tuft of hair matching the hair on her head. Even more shocking was that she now looked like she was 20 again, much like Raj and Asua did. This though, didn't hold a candle to her daughter, Kimberly, or as she goes by now, Kiki. The once twig-like 17 year old short-haired brunette bookworm that was the valedictorian of her senior class was now a full-on slutty anthro dog with long wavy platinum blonde locks, golden retriever features, eight I-cup breasts, a waistline even narrower than her mother's, flared hips, and just above a drooling vagina sat a 13\" doggy dick she was more than happy to show everyone and offer to anyone, using her tiny miniskirts to accentuate its erections. Beverly explained many times that this was the virus' fault, and now any time she had to go anywhere with her daughter, she had to put her on a leash and placate her promiscuity by letting her suckle on her udder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, a special report came on, with the same catgirl that had been covering the virus from before giving an announcement alongside a doctor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeremy, come here this!!\" Samantha calls to you. \"I think they're saying something about what the virus did!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk on over and sit beside her, hearing an audible creak in the wooden furniture. You worry if it is strong enough to continue holding her extra equine mass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the TV, the doctor, a husky badger man, takes a deep breath, and begins to explain to the catgirl journalist, \"As it is known, there are four strains of 'Bestial Metamorphic Mutagen,' or as it's come to be known, the 'Furry Flu.' The World Health Organization has broken it down into four sub-types; F, T, B, and W. We know now that anyone that contract the F version of the virus cannot get the T type, and vice versa. However, you must <b>ALSO</b> have one of the other strains to contract the W strain. The W strain seems to only be able to piggyback on the other three types. The B type can infect a person on it's own or combine with the F or T strain as well, resulting in the most advanced mutations. Now, here are some details on the nature of the strains:<br>\r\nF is the most common, and seems to impart animal-like traits to its host. As you see, this is the strain I have contracted, giving me my cat ears and tail. However, further changes can occur, such as gaining extra breasts, growing fur, genitalia changing to match the animal you are becoming, eyes and teeth changing, growing a muzzle, and even gaining an animalistic estrus cycle and ability to be impregnated by, and sexual attraction to, the animal you resemble, and possibly more. While most infected with this strain never change past the 'furry,' or an anthropomorphic animal stage, in 0.4% of cases some victims have fully transformed into animals. A rare and peculiar effect of the F strain is that roughly 5% of all infected have a chance of having their gender changed, with 90% of these gender changes being male to female, and 10% female to male, every time the changes imparting fully-functioning reproductive equipment.<br>\r\nT is the second most common, causing individuals to remain mostly human from the hips up, but becoming centaur-like from the waist down. This version seems to be responsible for any transformation where the victim is all animal from the waist down. This seems to include centaurs, satyrs, mermaids, driders, lamias, and others. Other possible effects of this strain currently found seem to be enlargement of the breast tissue, estrus, and again, the possibility &amp; desire to copulate with animals.<br>\r\nThe B strain causes hermaphrodism; those infected, both women and men, all seem to become almost entirely female in their physical form except they also have male genitalia directly above their vagina, their testicles now fused internally to their ovaries. B strain patients also always experience abnormal breast tissue growth, regularly placing them in the H-cup range or higher, as well as having disproportionately enlarged male genitalia. B-types also seem resistant to aging effects, as we saw by chance in one exam. Those infected with the B stain also suffer from a marked decrease in intellect with a proportionate increase in libido and stamina, inverse to their that of their original intellect, which the CDC explains that the smarter a B strain patient was pre-infection, the dumber and more sex-addicted they will be be post-infection. All B strain patients become omni-sexual - they can and will engage anything in intercourse short of children, and can be impregnated by anything on the planet. This strain, if it synergizes with the F-type, will <b>ALWAYS</b> cause multiple breasts in it's victims, no matter much or how little the F-strain factors in otherwise. It also causes the mind to exhibit more submissive feral traits. As a result, many governments are requiring B-types to have guardians, as they have deemed them incompetent, for all they seem focused on is sex and shopping.<br>\r\nThe W strain is a recessive type that has no effects on it's own, and cannot infect one without the aid of another pre-existing strain in your system. Thus, if you don't also have the F, T, B, FB, or TB versions of the Mutagen already in your system, the W strain is utterly harmless and benign. However, when it does work, the effect of the strain is effectively the same as some describe as 'lycanthropy;' a certain trigger will cause you to transform, usually the time of day, and when the trigger goes away, you change back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many people have been changed?\" the catgirl journalist asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We now estimate, factoring in those with lycanthropic symptoms, that roughly 84.2% of the Earth's populace has some form of the Mutagen. We also know that, unless the Mutagen somehow mutates again or it has a secret second stage we can't detect yet because it's too soon, I think the Mutagen is done doing what it going to do, so if you haven't transformed yet, don't plan to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha sighed and said, \"So... I'm a T-type.\"</span></div></div>",

She pulled out a jacket, shirt, and then pants, like usual, but then realized her big ol' horse flank can't wear regular human pants ever again. \"Well, can't wear <b>THESE</b>... but I still feel naked without something down there...\" She throws on a miniskirt that she could fasten from the side. While it complimented the outfit and satisfied that odd feeling she was going out half-dressed, she then flicked her tail past her bum, only to realize the futility of the skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to figure something out for that soon. Luckily my tail is so large and curly it works as a decent censor, not to mention... how does a horse have a ghetto booty?\" Samantha ponders looking at her plump plot in the mirror, and then catching sight again of the three diamonds on her flank. \"And of course, there's <b>THAT</b>. Almost certain that's gonna get me in trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's cute.\" you tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You would, ya pony lover.\" Samantha snorts. She grabs her pocket book and laptop. \"Anyhow, I'm out. See you tonight!!\" She heads for the door and heads out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou resume your ritual for preparing to go to work, at the deli two blocks down that you own, which has gotten a serious boost in business since the Furry Flu happened thanks to the influx of anthro people and kemonomimi girls that have increased meat and fish in their diets. Just as you were heading out the door of the apartment complex, Samantha comes racing back in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing bac...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god, some rhino guy snapped a picture of me, and next thing I know I'm getting tweets left and right from people around the world calling me 'Rarity,' and then a couple of other guys began to fanboy on me hard, and I got weirded out. Finally, I saw one of the tweets link to some article mentioning I'm like a girl in Japan that hair turned pink, grew yellow wings and a pink horse tail, has yellow horse ears like mine, and three butterflies on each thigh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's Fluttershy...\" you tell her. She doesn't seem pleased you know this, or that you corrected her, but she goes on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and one guy in Florida that became a wholly non-morphic feral horse...\" she looks at the screen. \"...Big Mac? Wait, he's a hamburger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's short for Big Macintosh. It's a type of apple... Nevermind.\" you tell her. \"So there's only the three, including you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it seems so.\" Samantha tells you. She looks at the Twitter feed again and gasps. \"Dammit...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rick in 4A is boasting here about what good friends he is with us just to up his popularity. At this rate they're gonna figure out where we live!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Samantha's boss calls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Newman, you're late. I gave you a week off because of the Flu, but you need to get back in right away. Accounts are backing up. The Flu has been bad for business around the world and we have to catch up pronto!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Samantha can say anything, he had hung up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this sucks... but we got to eat. Maybe they'll leave me alone once I actually get to work.

It still seems the public transportation commission hasn't modified the turnstiles for taurs, or at least taurs like her, as they're now too narrow for her horse body, but she saw a couple of lamias had no problems with the turnstiles, a cecaelia <i>(octopus-taur)</i> was just walking through like a regular person, and a mermaid was using a wheelchair, but because she couldn't get by the security guards waive her on through a different gate. She felt... singled out. Samantha also seemed to notice the trains have not been renovated yet for taurs' comfort, so Samantha finds herself having to sit in the aisle next to the door, occasionally sliding around, her hooves having reduced traction on the metal grating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile on the subway, she heard a camera flash, and she saw who had just took a photo of her, a couple, a man and a woman, both almost entirely transformed into non-morphic caracals, save for their hand-like paws, human eyes, and as noticed, still able to speak normally, the guy wearing a Yankees cap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'd be ironic if she was a fashion designer.\" the male caracal said to the female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha thought to say something to them, but decided against causing a scene and hid into her jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she made it to her stop, glad to be off the wild ride. However, her rear and tail both feel dirty from sitting on the floor of the subway car. No time to clean them though. If she wanted to keep her job, she had to hurry!! She galloped up to the... Samantha puts one hoof on a step before slapping her forehead<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I doing?! Just use the handicapped ramp!!\" she blurts out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, trotting up the ramp was much faster than trying to navigate her four hooves up the several steps to the street surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw man, if I don't get there soon, I'm losing my job for sure!!\" Samantha considers hailing a taxi, but then she has a vision of what that'd look like, trying to smush herself into the back of a cab, so she steps back from the curb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell, I'm half a horse, might as well put this body to good use.\" Samantha begins galloping through the sidewalks and streets, meandering through the crowds, making to the intersection before her work before nearly bowling into a mounted officer, skidding to a stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful there, lady. You in a rush? You almost hit me and my partner.\" The lion anthro cop said atop his horse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, officer. I was just running late for work. In fact, there's my office over there across the street.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cop didn't seem overly upset over the incident. \"Well, you just be more careful from now on.\" His horse is sniffing up Samantha something fierce. \"My partner seems to like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, isn't that nice.\" she says. \"Well, am I free to go, officer?\" He moves out of the way, allowing her to head on in. \"That horse was... weird.\" Samantha though, going in the elevator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha went to her boss' office to explain her tardiness...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir, sorry I was...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An employee sent me an interesting link a bit ago. I gleaned over it. Seems you became a little bit of a minor internet event this morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can... explain that?\" Samantha's voice twisting up in shrill tension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, no need.\" her boss says. \"I think I got an idea why you were held up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it was weird, the first time I got out of my apartment building all week and people on the street start comparing me to some cartoon horse. I got a little freaked out, and then that photo popped up on Twitter...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm guessing that's about when I called.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'd try to relax. You're not alone in all of this. After I got that link, I decided to do a little research to see how many other people are like you, and discovered The Flu somehow transformed roughly 1.3 million of the nearly 6 billion people that got infected into forms that somehow resemble fictional beings. Scientists appear to be baffled as to how or why this phenomenon occurred. They're still trying to piece together The Furry Flu itself, let alone how it could make some people resemble characters from our cultural zeitgeist. Luckily, it seems for now you're 'popularity' is staying put to the supposed 'fan base,' so I don't think this'll impact your life too much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" Samantha begins to utter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to hear of you being late because of 'this' again. Now get to work.\" As Samantha heads out, he adds, \"It is nice though to say we have The Element of Generosity on our staff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha closes the door. \"'Element of Generosity?' What the hell was that about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her cubicle, Samantha soon found her first problem of the day - her office chair had to go. There just wasn't any space for it and her in the cramped cubicle, and it wasn't like her centaur body could sit in it anyhow. This now meant she stand or scoot her butt every time she needed to access her file cabinet, which was a lot. Then she discovered her workload was backed up to the hilt. The firm had stayed open during her week off during the initial chaos of The Flu, but only with a skeleton crew of those uninfected, leaving those coming back today with a buttload of work to come back to. Working in the accounting division of an advertising corporation was tedious enough, but when you're behind in your work...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, lunch came, and all Samantha could afford to do was get a salad and a coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How am I going get through all of this before I become an old bitty...?\" Samantha sighed sighed, sipping the coffee she held in both hands, staring at her computer screen. Suddenly, she noticed the information on the screen adjusting itself as though she had she had been typi... It was her horn!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thank you, you freaky little forehead erection!! I forgot I could do that!!\" Samantha soon puts her telekinesis to good use, pulling files from a filing cabinet she had practically memorized, feeding herself as she typed, and even using the copier without ever getting up.\"My horn gives me super powers!!\" Samantha blurts out, jumping to her hooves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's nice, dear.\" A female narwhal-morph in the neighboring cubicle responds to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs 5:00 neared, Sam actually caught up on her work, and had nothing left to do, when she heard some arguing from the boss' office. Suddenly, the door opened, and out came the boss, some lawyer, and some big breasted platinum blonde woman in a slutty joke of a hot pink skirt suit, her blouse only buttoned by a single button and barely holding watermelon boobs, a wholly exposed midriff, and a miniskirt resting on her hips trailing off at her mid-thighs, which had a peculiar bulge in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone's attention...\" the boss says to the floor, \"...turns out our Senior VP of Creative Development Allison Hedgewick was infected with the B-strain of The Flu, as you see here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha looked at the woman he was gesturing to, the buxom bimbo that was bouncing up and down at being mentioned, and realized, \"<b>THAT'S</b> the same 40-something Yale graduate that used to act like a total bitch to everyone under her? That's what the B-strain does to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silly, I like, told you already. My name's Alli!!\" Alli says to the boss in a sexy valley girl voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As her lawyer/guardian/son informed me, Congress recently enacted laws preventing the termination of B-strain carriers unless their reduced intellects or sexual promiscuity can be proven that they pose a hazard to the workplace, stating their condition is protected under the Americans With Disabilities Act. However, they can be demoted to positions within their intellectual purview. As such, her Senior VP position is now open for application, and 'Alli' here will be the new veep's secretary, as she still retains the capacity to do secretarial work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a secretitty!!\" Alli blurts outs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, we know...\" the boss facepalms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a cubicle mate pops her head over the wall. She was a wolf-girl woman in her 30's. \"I think The Flu put the fear of god in my man, because he got me <b>THIS</b>!!\" She shows her Sam and co. the engagement ring on her finger. As soon as Sam saw it though, her vision went trippy, most things seemed inverted, except for objects she saw made from gemstones and metal ore, which all had strange circles highlighting them, and highly specific data on every item, as though she were back in chemistry class.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Roughly five months ago, an undocumented comet struck the Earth. Luckily it was a very small one, thus it didn't throw up a lost of ash or impact the global temperatures much, but with it came a strange new alien virus that seemed to predominately affect women <i>(though a few men also seemed infected)</i>, with roughly just under half of all women and 1 out of 10 men on Earth beginning to show odd attributes, like extra body hair, sharper nails, elongating ears, and nubs forming at the base of the spines. Despite international quarantine effects, the virus kept spreading. Many women were growing outright fur, the nubs became tails, and many began to grow extra rows of breasts even as their originals grew larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen came the first mutation, as some women stayed normal from their hips up, but changed from their hips down, many gaining extra legs while dealing with their legs fusing together. This was known as the \"Tauric strain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext doctors discovered yet a new strain that was making roughly a third of all men that got the virus feminize while women with it began to grow animalistic penises, turning all infected with this strain into very buxom Furry or Taur women with both male and female genitals. A strange side effect of this strain was that it caused those infected with this strain, called the \"Futa strain,\" to have their libido and sexual endurance spike to inhuman levels, but their IQ's take a nose dive. Because of this, some also called this strain the \"Bimbo strain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the final strain to be classified emerged roughly a month after the infection began, as many women found themselves turning furry or tauric after the sun set, but seemingly reverted to normal with the sun's rays. This became known as the \"Were-strain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo doctors' amazement and shock, those that were infected but didn't have the simple base strain were found that they could have the other mutant strains, resulting in Taurs and Weres that also had the Futa strain, Weres more shocking in that they were normal during the day, but suffered from the bimbofying effects of the Futa strain when transformed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso discovered by lengthy study was that all infected females now had a monthly estrus like their animal counterparts when their libido went through the roof, and that the infected were now sexually attracted to, ad could be impregnated by, both humans and the animals they share traits with, meaning say a dog girl would be equally aroused by both her boyfriend and her Border Collie. In addition, when Weres hit their two to five day period of heat, they would remain in their transformed states even in daylight until their estrus ended or they were impregnated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for the rest of the world's populace, they possessed an immunity to the virus altogether that scientists are still trying to analyse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that we've covered the backstory of the virus, let us look in on the lives of a couple dealing with the virus, in this case, a girl with the Were strain, roughly around sunset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that you, Brianna?\" a male voice asks to the opening door of their apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm home Kevin. You know ever since I got infected I like to get home before dark. The idea of changing in public still feels... weird to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin cracked a smile, \"But you know one day you're going to have to get ready for such an occasion. The days <b>ARE</b> getting shorter, and by winter there will be no way you can get home before you change. Besides, you don't mind folks seeing you after you transform, so I don't see why this worries you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, still, growing fur, a tail, and three extra rows of breasts in front of a crowded subway car seems like it'd turn a few heads. Not to mention I always feel different after I change.\" Brianna whines as she blushes, the shy girl embarrassed to talk about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I think it's sexy, and personally I <b>LIKE</b> watching you change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... you've always been into that stuff...\" Brianna utters, before gritting her teeth as the sun set, \"Well, it's starting, so here's your wish...\" She pulls open her button-up blouse to reveal six new nipples running down her torso, beginning to gain mass behind them as white fur begins to emerge in her cleavage and russet fur grows on the backs of her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Brianna continues to change, what happens next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>To say that my morning was a bit more.... interesting then usual would have been the understatement of the century. I'm getting a head of myself here. Allow me to introduce myself, my name is Zachary Martin, but I go by Zack. I'm a not so usual 25 year old fresh out of university with majors in Psychology and Business Management. I'm an avid gamer and know to geek-out over mythology on occasion. Overall I'm a quiet guy, talking very little unless i'm explaining something or on subjects i'm passionate about, in which case i'll admit i tend to talk for hours on end if i'm able. I'm 6'2 with a nice slim and toned build from spending University on the track team. I have dirty blond hair, gun metal blue eyes and on the paler side of the spectrum with freckles here and there. Profession wise, I've been working as the head bartender in one of my cities most populat clubs, <b>\"Cerberus\"</b>, for the last 2 years. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet's move onto my partner in crime, mate, boyfriend or whatever term you want to use, Jason Rowin, or Jay for short. We've been together happily for the last 4 years and counting. Jay is one of the sweetest people i have ever met, kind to a fault, loyal and very caring. He can be a bit protective but i find it sweet when he worries over me. I met him by complete accident after i kinda \"ahem\" ran face first into his chest. To save myself some embarrassment i'll get into that later. He had a major and a minor, majoring in Criminal Justice and minoring in Music Theory (I am not joking, no matter how odd and amusing it sounds). He loves to play guitar and piano every once in awhile. He has a hobby in making songs and music tracks for one of his jobs. His main job is a bouncer and security guard at <b>\"Cerberus\"</b>, which fits him near perfectly with his large 6'6\" frame and being stacked with perfectly sculpted muscle (gotta love the football jocks with brains). He's a part-time DJ in the same club, going by DJ JayR. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe share a loft apartment in downtown. We both make enough to pay rent and monthly expenses with enough left over for any fun we may get up to. Plus Jay comes from a wealthier family who is more then happy to help out and loves me to death (especially his mother, who was rather recently \"morphed\" into a beautiful border collie)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI think that's enough background from now, don't you? Well let's get this show on the road!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~(9:00 am Saturday)~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the sun rose high in the sky over the city, it's light shone brightly through the blinds of the downtown loft and alighting on the face of a pale young man. The young man currently being assulted by the sun was me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ngh...\" I grunted as i scrunched up my face in annoyance and flipped over onto my side, closer to the large source of warmth to my right. I sighed happily as i snuggled closely to the big fuzzy chest of my lover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, big, <i>FUZZY</i> chest?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shot up straight in our bed looking down at Jay. Laying where he used to be the previous night was a large, buff doberman anthro. He kept his height and build, but he seemed a bit more lean around the waist. His skin, no FUR, was pitch black with spots of light brown on his upper pecs, covering washboard abs, forearms and hands and two angular streaks that resemble elongated lightning bolts under his visible right eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took a moment to study my lover's me body. I slowly reached over and ran my hand over his chest and stomach. One of Jay's legs kicked and from the content smile on his muzzle, i can only guess he inherited a spit that most dogs have. (you know the one i'm talking about) <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'oh this is going to be an.... interesting day' I thought with a sigh and reached over to shake Jay's shoulder. \"Jay, hunny, you gotta get up.\" He groaned in response as his ears flattened against his head. Unfortunately for him, i persisted. \"C'mon hun, you need to get up, something important just happened.\" With how i stressed the word \"important\", it was no surprise that he shot up like a bullet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened? Who's hurt? Where's the med kit!?\" He shot out of bed and ran to the rooms ajoining bathroom, giving me a nice view of his boxer brief clad rear, long thin tail and all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well at least that stayed the same~' I couldn't help but think as Jay rushed into the bathroom. From the sudden silence coming from that direction, I was willing to guess he saw his reflection. I got out of bed and stretched, feeling a few pops in my back before walking over to the bathroom. I poked my head in to see Jay examining himself in the mirror, bright emerald eyes scanning and taking in every detail until finally locking with my own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ya done now, hun?\" I asked with a cocked brow. He nodded and turn around, looking at his new padded paws<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, i'm.... good, i think.\" he looked up at me. \"We knew this could have happened to either of us at any time, but a DOBERMAN? Really? i was kinda hoping for a dragon.\" We both chuckled as i walked over and wrapped my arms around his neck, feeling his paws gently reast around my waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well either way, it'll take a bit of getting used to on both our parts. you need to get yourself checked out medically and have all your ids changed to match your new body. While you set that up, I'll call up the Boss and tell him of this recent development.\" By \"the Boss \" i'm refering to the owner of and head of security at <b>Cerberus</b>. I smiled at him and leaned up to kiss his nose lightly. \"I love you either way, just got to get used to the new you now is all\" He smiled back and me and hugged me close, which i quickly returned. We stood like that for a few moments just enjoying eachother's presence before pulling away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's get cleaned up and ready for this soon to be hectic day.\" The gleam in his eyes told me he wanted more then to clean up. I gave a sly grin as he reached over to turn on the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes well, allow the.... enlightening day begin\" i said as i tugged me by the waistband toward the shower.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a surprisingly tiring shower, I can safely say that i'm now <i>very</i> well acquainted with my lover's new body. If the shit-eating grin he's wearing right now and the tail threatening to go nuclear if it wags any faster is anything to go by, i'd say he's having the same sentiment, as well as enjoying his newfound stamina. I threw an irritated glare over my now bite marked shoulder as i grabbed a towel to dry off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next time, if you wanna go 3 rounds back-to-back, let me know, will ya? oh and warn me when YOUR GOING TO STUFF SOMETHING THE SIZE OF A BASEBALL IN MY ASS!\" I continued to glare as he rubbed the back of his head sheepishly, grin still firmly in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sorry hun, I kinda got caught up in the moment there..\" Jay chuckled nervously as he let out a \"hmph\" and walked out, letting him know that he could now dry himself off alone and to have fun with all that fur. \"W-wait! you gotta help me here! i won't be able to dry myself off alone with just a towel!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, i poked my head around the doorframe and gave him a cute little smile \"Should'ave thought of that before you knotted me without permission~\u201d I laughed at the cry of dismay that followed and quickly dried off and got dressed for a lot of movement as it was going to be a very busy day. \"Jay, i'm going to call Boss and get the day off, then get a check-up appointment for you. Dry off as best you can and get dressed, all your clothes should still fit you fine.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI headed out our bedroom down the short hallway and past the guestroom and second bathroom and into the open-planned living room and kitchen area. the latter of the two was seperated from the living room by a large island with a bar. The kitchen itself was modern with white cabinets, black granite counter tops and stainless steel appliances. In contrast the livingroom was a cozy homey feel with a nice big leather couch, hard wood floors, a cherry wood coffee table and a large plasma screen on the wall underneath an entertainment center occupied by an Xbox One, a PS4, and a blue-ray player for the various movies found in the cabinet next the set up. The walls were adorned by paintings, music posters and finally a set of japanese swords that i commissioned from a blacksmith years ago. At that fond little memory i grabbed my phone off the island and pulled up my contacts, going right down \"Boss\" and called away while examining the blades. After a few rings a gruff voice answered from the other end<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Talk to me.\" He said. The sound of papers being moved, shuffled and wrinkled was the telltale sign he was in his office doing something or other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Boss, it's me. I called because myself and Jay need the day off, something came up this morning.\" I said while running a hand over the western dragon engraved into the scabbard of the katana. 'Aaron did an amazing job on this...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm? what happened bud? You two ok over there?\" Boss asked, the usually subaudible growl that his voice had rose to a more refined sound in his concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we're both fine. But Jay morphed overnight while we were asleep. Now he's a doberman so we have to get him checked up and everything.\" I said, not noticing how my voice was getting lower and turned my attention to the hand running over the katana's sheath, only to find a black scaly paw in it's place. I yelled in surprise as i looked at my new black, white palmed hand and looked all over myself, seeing black and white scales, the latter of which was outlined by grey scales. I gulped as i tried to imagine my old body, only to find myself back in it seconds later. My jaw dropped as i switched between the two forms by thinking of them and settled bavk on human. \".....ummm, better make that for both of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up with you kid? Your voice just lowered 3 octaves before going back to normal\" He asked, concern overridden by curiousity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it umm, seems that i did a bit of morphing myself last night. I'll explain tomorrow ok? we'll both come in before our shift and explain the situation. I have to go Boss, we'll see ya tomorrow.\" I said as looked at Jay who had come rushing in when i yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok kid, take care of yourself and get yourselves checked out as soon as possible.\" He said and hung up. I sighed as i put my phone on the coffee table  and walked over to Jay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened, why did you yell?\" Instead of answering i just pictured myself as a dragon and transformed instantly. He gasped as he took in my new form. I had become a western dragon, wings, swept back horns and all. I had grown a few inches taller, gained enough muscle to match Jay and my hair had grown out to my shoulders and become a bright luminous white and my eyes now had black scelra, white iries and slit pupils. My body was mostly the same, aside from the angular dragonic head, claw tipped fingers and the row of spines goes down my back and new tail. Jay's jaw dropped open and almost hit the floor when i turned back. \"Oh come on! I wanted to be a dragon...\" I gave a surprised laugh as he pouted like a little kid<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"oh gods, only you could make laugh at a time like this.\" I said as i opened and closed my mouth a few times to get used to the new maw and the new deep voice. He chuckled as he went to the kitchen and started to make breakfast and i grabbed my phone to call the hospital just a few streets over to set up appointments. About 10 minutes and a few questions later we had appointments for noon.
