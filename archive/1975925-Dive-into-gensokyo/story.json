You were having way too much trouble coming to realization that you dropped through an creepy hole full of creepy eyes and found yourself in the middle of Japan than you were earlier. Even ignoring the lack of sense it made, thinking back seemed an awful lot harder than it was earlier! The more you tried to remember, the more dizzy your head got. It was a toll just trying to remember your name!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" speaking of which, Reimu got even more annoyed at you, \"I just asked you a question! Who are you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" as soon as you uttered a syllable, you had trouble controlling your vision. The image of an angry young miko was blurring in and out like a camera with a broken iris. As you tried adjusting your focus, your head began to wobble because you suddenly became dizzy. You were a wreck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, excuse me?\" you heard Reimu's voice echo in the blurred background, \"what are you doing?\"<br>\r\nGood question. What are you doing?! What's gotten into you?! Sadly, you couldnt answer that, because you had way too much difficult trying to remember anything. The only thing you could remember with no trouble was a voice. A young overly intrigued childlike voice...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Dont worry, Mr Al-Ahmadr,\"</i> you remember the voice saying, <i>\"His precious brain is fine. Just look at him. He's twitching with such anxiety. I bet he's having an extraordinary dream. I wish I could see what his dream looks like... when I do this.</i><br>\r\nThat boy's voice... why does it scare you so? W...was he doing something with your brain?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, a-are you alright?\" you heard Reimu's concerned echo which seemed distant, \"Oh geez! Your head is bleeding!\" It was too much. You were far too dizzy. It was a choir just standing. You needed to lie down bad. Lie down and rest. Sleep this really bad daze off. God youre so tired. So tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Thud!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mister? Mister?! Oh my god! Did he just pass out?! Oh no, what should I do?! Uh um... LADY HAKUREI!

It was two females wearing some sort of red/white cloths. You remember one of them as reimu, but you don't know about the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Are you ok? is everything under control?\" Women asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Um, yes. I'm ok now.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Both women and reimu sighed as they were glad you were ok. You wondered what happened to you, then reimu explained to you that you might had an brain hemorrhage so they called the doctor, but there were nothing wrong with the brain. You wondered how it happened and you wondered who that voice were. Just then other lady spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Well...I don't truly know who you are and the reason behind what's going on, but I do suggest you rest in our place for while.\" older lady spoke, \"And as for the introduction.. you could call me sendai hakurei and the girl next to me is my successor, hakurei reimu.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You nodded to the two and thanked the two. Reimu told you she put some sort of unusual thing with window next to you. You looked to the side and noticed your galaxy phone next to you. You thanked them again and they left to do some chores. As they left, you thought for moment on what you should do now since you might be in the safe haven now. You could feel that the gangs would not chase you anymore since you were in this area, but you had one thing in your own mind: who was that voice in your mind? who was this 'al-ahmadr' person. As you rested, your phone suddenly rung and your heart jumped. You picked up the phone and looked at the screen and it wrote:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You felt skeptical on this but you had thoughts on picking up the phone. question is, will you?</span></div></div>",

Youre not sure if this person is really your best friend or you just gave him that contact nickname as an irony (you really hope you didnt have that kind of sick sense of humor before you got amnesia!). Either way, you needed you know. You hope that this person calling really is a friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you answer the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallowed hard and carefully spoke, \"H...hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mike?! Mike, is that you?!\" said a rather excited male voice on the other end, \"GUYS! I got Mike on the phone!\" You heard a lot of rustling and muttering in the background before the guy spoke again, \"Thank god. We thought you were dead. What happened to you?!\"<br>\r\nYou felt nervous as you asked, \"I'm... sorry. Who is this?\"<br>\r\n\"What do you mean who is this?\" the guy sounded surprised that you asked, \"you dont recognize my voice? It's me, Zane!\" Zane. A slightly familiar name, but your mind is far too blurry to remember it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Z...Zane?\"<br>\r\n\"C'mon, Mike, we known each other since kindergarten!\" Zane assures, \"stop messing around. What's gotten into you?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" you shrugged your arms, \"I cant for the life of me remember anything at the moment.\"<br>\r\n\"What you talking ab-\" Zane suddenly stopped talking and you heard whispering in the back, \"... oh my god. No no, that's crazy. Michael's untouchable. There's no way he'd let Al-ahmadr do that to him!\" ...Again with that name.<br>\r\n\"Mike? Of course you remember me, right?\" Zane asks like he's trying to deny the inevitable, \"your old pal, Zane Rosewood, Detective of Paradiso County Police? I got our other pals Lydia, Ward, and Perez here too. Say Hi, guys!\"<br>\r\nIt's a good thing those guys could see the frown on you face when they all said hi. It felt really bad to forget something that important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zane,\" you swallowed, \"I dont remember them. I dont remember you, I dont remember anything.\"<br>\r\nYou heard Zane sigh hard, \"Damnit. What did that monster do to you? Ok ok, we'll worry about jogging your memory later. Where are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scanned around your surroundings. \"I'm not really where exactly. It looks some kind of Shinto shrine in the middle of Japan. Two kind mikos here are letting me rest here.\"<br>\r\n\"Japan? What are you doing all the way over there?\" Zane groaned, \"right, you dont remember. Nevermind, I'll run the phone tracker, give me a second.\"<br>\r\n\"Ok,\" you patiently waited for him.<br>\r\n\"What do you mean 'Location Unknown'?\" you heard Zane remark, \"you guys got a satellite orbiting the whole planet! Ugh, I knew I shoulda switched. Hang on, Mike, I got a plan B. Lydia, tap the phone!\"<br>\r\n\"Yes sir,\" you heard Lydia comply. It was then you realized far too late the little battery icon on the screen blinking red. The phone's almost dead!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, this might take a minute or so,\" your friend warned, \"dont turn off the phone until we pinpoint you.\" You got a bit nervous looking at that warning icon. You might not have another minute or so to spare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything yet, Lydia?\"<br>\r\n\"Location Unknown,\" you heard her answer.<br>\r\n\"Location Unknown?! Are you kidding?!\" Zane became furious, \"this is highly advanced 99.9% accurate technology youre using!\"<br>\r\n\"I'm... sorry sir,\" poor Lydia got nervous, \"that's what it says.\"<br>\r\n\"Forget it. Second time's a charm! Try it again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe warning icon was still blinking. Youre running out of time.<br>\r\n\"Zane, my phone's almost dead,\" youre forced to tell him.<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!\" he shouted over the receiver, \"Mike, I thought I told you several times to recharge your phone!\" Oh crap, that was a bad habit of yours?\"<br>\r\n\"Uh, sorry?\" was all you could say about it.<br>\r\n\"Quick, hurry up and find a recharger!\" he tells you, \"Lydia's gonna get another reading soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou checked the window sill again. Fortunately, Reimu put the recharger next to the galaxy phone! Lucky break that you didnt lose it! ...BUT it wouldve have helped you anyway, because the room youre in lacked a single electrical outlet to plug it in. No lamps, tvs, radios, clocks, any of that stuff. Bad sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, Zane...\" you swallowed hard again, \"I dont think this place has electricity.\"<br>\r\n\"Hold that thought, Mike! Lydia, go faster! His phone's about to die!\"<br>\r\n\"I'm trying, sir!\"<br>\r\n\"Michael, stay with me! Just a minute longer and w-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello? Hello Zane?! HELLO?!\" the phone's dead, \"aw crap.\" Looks like you stranded with even more questions and even more people you dont remember worried for your sake. You sat down on the floor, rubbing your head trying to remember something else other than vague names and a creepy childlike voice commenting about your brain. But you couldnt do for long because all it ended up getting you was a slight headache.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes after you gave up, the elder Hakurei came in through the sliding door with a hot cup of tea in her hands. She had smiled your as she placed it on the desk in front of you. Seeing the Miko's smile kinda lifted your spirits. Despite seeing a few scars on her face (and a couple on her exposed arms), it didnt do much to tarnish her natural beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you feeling?\" she asked you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little better, thank you,\" you gladly took the cup, \"I remember my name, at least.\"<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" she was curious.<br>\r\n\"Michael,\" you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elder Hakurei gave a hmph, \" 'Michael'. Of what family?\" You assume she asked what your last name is.<br>\r\n\"That...\" you lowered your head, \"I still dont remember.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's best not to rush it,\" she gave you a hint of encouragement, \"it will come back to you in time. Now drink your tea before it gets cold.\"<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" you took slow sips of the tea. You assumed it was some sort of an herbal green tea. It wasnt bad, but coulda used a little honey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... Lady Sendai Hakurei?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" she gave you her undivided attention.<br>\r\n\"I need to make a call,\" you tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of a call?\" she asked you, \"a bird call? A wolf call? ...Or perhaps a call to arms? I'm sorry, but we're peaceful shrine maidens.\" You looked at her oddly, then realized she got the 'call' wrong.<br>\r\n\"No no no,\" you correct yourself, \"I mean I need to use my phone. I think I can call up a friend of mine and left him know where I am, but the battery in it just died and I have to recharge it.\" As you talked, you noticed the Miko's smile getting a bit of a nervous twitch to it, like she's having a hard time comprehending what youre explaining to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Call a friend... battery.... er, I'm sorry, could you please repeat that?\" oh dear, it completely went over her head?!<br>\r\n\"Um,\" you skip the unnnecessary explanation and just get to the point, \"listen, do you have a place where I can plug in my phone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Plug in.... phone?\" she tilted her head questionably. Wow, this is TOTALLY going over her head!<br>\r\nYou got a little worried, \"Er, all I need is an electrical outlet. Is there an outlet around?\"<br>\r\n\"Out...let...?\" she shook her and shrugged her arms, \"is that some kind of noble city-slang?\" OH CRAP.  Where in the heck are you?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began to fear the worst as you asked one simple heart-pounding question. \"Do you know what a lightbulb is?\"<br>\r\n\"Um...\" she scratched the back of her head, \"... a bulb... made of light?\" OOOOHHH CRAP!! Not only do you have amnesia, youre in the middle of an unknown land without knowledge of modern technology! It seems like you didnt go back in time since apparently you still use your phone to contact people from the present, so where exactly is this place?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Michael,\" Lady Sendai Hakurei blushed embarrassed, \"Reimu is more savy when it comes to New World luxuries\" NEW WORLD LU-urgghh! \"but she's still in the middle of doing chores.\"<br>\r\n\"Nah, dont worry about it,\" you stashed the phone in your pocket and figured you'd worry about it later. Right now, your mind is still in the recovery process. \"Anyways, I have to thank you again for letting me stay here.\"<br>\r\n\"It's no trouble,\" she said with conviction, \"we havent gotten many visitors lately anyway. It might be because of the recent growth of monsters beyond these woods.\"<br>\r\nYour eyes widened, \"Monsters?\"<br>\r\n\"Hopefully they'll migrate further west by the time the season's over,\" she says. Youre still stuck on the fact that monsters apparently exists here. WHERE THE HELL ARE YOU?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's going to be a while until Reimu finishes her chores,\" Lady Hakurei states, \"since there's free time, I'd better make the most of it training so I dont let my body get rusty.\" And what a body she had. She looked incredibly fit for a shrine maiden. Maybe she doubles as a martial artist, too. \"If youre feeling better, perhaps you'd care to join me? Maybe it'll help improve your mind as well as your body.\"</span></div></div>",

She told her about what you have said and she thought for moment, then she turned her attention to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I kinda know.\" Reimu said, \"Maybe we should go see Rinnosuke-san about this.\" Reimu said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You didn't know who this rinnosuke and spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Who's this rinnosuke person?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"He's the shop owner who knows a lot about the outside world.\" Reimu replied. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n You thought to yourself 'outside world?' but for now you had some sort of relief that this rinnosuke person might have something to back you up with the phone. You thanked her and reimu nodded, turning to the sendai to ask where the rags so she could start cleaning the storage area. Sendai told her where it was and she left the scene. Sendai miko got up, telling you she'll start her training and parted way with you. You layed back, thinking about this zane person and others and shifted position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Zane...who are you?\" You muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You then relaxed your day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n -underground-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Deep within the underground district, a vortex opened, revealing a person in traditional Saudi cloth getting out. He was carrying the sword with him and once he walked west for while, he found the abandoned temple before him. The temple were like the Shinto shrine, but it was so old it showed it age. The Saudi man walked toward the temple and saw the seal in front of the door. He put his right arm In front of the seal and spoke one thing in Arabic. The seal then bursted in flames and before the man opened the door, he heard someone shouting stop. He turned around and saw a pink haired girl standing before the temple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You shall not free that demon within.\" Girl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The Saudi man was silent and then smiled. He snapped his finger and from behind her two mens appeared and captured her. The Saudi man continued to smile and spoke to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I am only using this...demon for the sake of others, young friend.\" Man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He then turned around and opened the door completely. The pink haired girl shouted 'no!' and Three object came out. One had the white haired oni mask, one was samurai armor which had some sort of Sanskrit  on it, and a katana that radiates evil. The man turned back to the pink haired girl with smile while the object floated around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Unfortunately, the great demon lord would rather possess a youkai rather then human.\" Saudi man said, \"Unfortunate, really. You'll be an honorary vessel for the one.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"No..No!\" Girl spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He was about to take the artifact to the girl until he noticed the things were gone. He turned back to see the green haired girl with black hair got it. The Saudi man were surprised to see this as the green haired girl observed the mask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Woow, I can sense the evil within! What is this!?\" Girl asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"No! koishi! get away!!\" Girl shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The mask then suddenly got to her face. Koishi struggled but with no luck as she tried to use her ability but then her strength went away, making the armor and katana surround her. The Saudi man gleed and then rose his arms.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"The resurrection of demon is now complete! now it will do what I say!!\" man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Body of koishi grew more and more until it was the mans size. The person looked at the Saudi man and then petted his shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"It seems.... you have released me...\" Voice spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yes. I need your strength to make chaos in this land!\" Man said, \"Then taking over it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The voice just scoffed and then both man and the person walked. Man told the mens to kill the pink haired girl, and they pushed the girl and shot many time at her. The girl thought she was going to die but a gap opened, letting her in and closed. The Saudi man tilted his head and then made 'tch' noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Sir. Is everything ok?\" Man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"My power is too weak, but it will rise.\" Person spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Good... now we shall take the first step.\" Saudi man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He and the person that was koishi walked toward the city. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n -overworld-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You were outside waiting for reimu to finish up what she was doing so you and reimu could go meet this rinnosuke person. Reimu came and once you two were ready, you two bid farewell to sendai and walked. Through the forest, it was was quiet and peaceful and within hour, you two reached the store. The outside looked messy as there were many things on display. Once you looked up you saw the sign that wrote 'kourindou' on it. You knew little of Japanese  but you didn't understand fully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Let's go in, mike.\" Reimu said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yeah, sure.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Once you got in, you two were greeted by....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>At the counter stood a grey haired man with oriental merchant style clothes with a nap sack at his front wearing glasses over a pair of eerie yellow eyes. You noticed feral animal-like slanted pupils in those yellow eyes, giving subtle hints that this guy aint entirely human. But with your current state of mind, as long as he aint lunging for your throat, it didnt bother you any.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared silently at him for a short period of time however, just making sure that it would remain that way. Though your memory was a blur, you vaguely remember having that kind of instinctual reaction toward peculiar kinds of strangers. Perhaps you've had a lot of bad run-ins with those kinds?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Rinnosuke!\" Reimu on the other hand cheerfully greeted the suspicious man with a childlike grin to match her enthusiasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reimu,\" Rinnosuke said to your caretaker, \"youre awful early today. I dont have any new wares. And it's fair to warn you I put up some special wards so if your little friend tries to steal something, she will be electrocuted.\" Electrocuted?!<br>\r\n\"Nah, that's alright, Rinnosuke. Marissa's not here today,\" Reimu replies casually, \"actually, I'm here cuz Hakurei Shrine's new star tourist needs some help.\" New star tourist? \"This is Michael. Our foreign customer.\"<br>\r\n\"A foreigner eh?\" Rinnosuke observed you with interest, \"guten abend! Ich heisse Rinnosuke. Das Eigent\u00fcmer von Kourindou, die antiquit\u00e4tenshop!\"<br>\r\nYou stared blankly at him, \"...Huh?\"<br>\r\nRinnosuke tilted his head, slightly baffled then turned to Reimu, \"the foreigner's not a German?\"<br>\r\n\"I think he's one of those Eastern European snow gaijins,\" Reimu's theory left you awful puzzled.<br>\r\n\"Oh. Well, I'm sorry. I dont speak Russian,\" Rinnosuke as you mouthed 'Snow gaijins?' with a dumbfounded look on your face, \"anyways, what can I do for you, foreign traveler?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Michael's got amnesia,\" Reimu answered for you, \"he says he cant really remember much.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAh, I'm sorry, Reimu,\u201d Rinnosuke apologized, \u201cI'm afraid I sold all my memory-boosting herbs to that rabbit from Eientei. But she traded them for these special blue raspberry-flavored pills. Not sure what they do, but theyre on sell if youre interested.\u201d Uh\u2026 is that even legal?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way!\u201d Reimu shook her head adamantly, \u201clast time we bought some of your pills, Marissa's boobs expanded to the size of watermelons and she couldnt walk for a week!\u201d You really shouldnt be hearing this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, what I need at the moment is a charger,\u201d you speak to the shopkeep, \u201cmy, er, phone is out of battery and I need to charge it with something. Do you have anything that can connect to this?\u201d You pull out your phone and hand it to Rinnosuke.<br>\r\nRinnosuke carefully observes the phone like he's practically mindblown by what it is. You really hoped he was more informed on technology than Lady Hakurei was.<br>\r\n\u201cHm\u2026 what exactly is this again?\u201d your heart sank a little when he asked but you kept calm and answered.<br>\r\n\u201cIt's a smart phone. It allows someone to make telephone calls nearly anywhere without the necessity of plugging into a phone jack.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOk, phone, PHONE! I know what THAT is,\u201d he cuts you off, \u201cthe problem is you currently cant make any phone calls with it?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt has no power,\u201d you explain, \u201cit runs on a battery but the battery used up all it's juice and needs to recharge.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHm,\u201d the shopkeep stares for another few seconds before finally opening a drawer, \u201cwell, if it's an electrical cord youre looking for, so far, all I have currently are these.\u201d He opens a drawer and shows off a bunch of power cords, extension cords, phonejacks all jammed into that one single drawer with discount tags tied to each one. \u201cDo you think any of these might work?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked through the drawer. Tons of different cords meant for a variety of electrical appliances from digital clocks to laptop chargers\u2026 sadly, none that match your phone.<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d you answer, \u201cthe cord has to have an end that plugs into this shape.\u201d You show him the port that the charger plugs in.<br>\r\n\u201cWell, sorry I couldnt help you,\u201d Rinnosuke shrugs his shoulders, \u201cmaybe that engineer girl down at the ravine could build something that'll help you out. Dont expect her to do it for cheap though!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, Mike. The shrine is on an air tight budget,\u201d explained Reimu, \u201cwe cant afford Nitori's outrageously overpriced junk at the moment.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI understand. I dont wanna be a major burden on you.\u201d Well, looks like that Zane guy will have to wait even longer. You cant help but wonder what he's doing right now. He and your other pals must be worried half to death about you! Maybe later, you could think of some way to 'barter' with this Nitori person?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! That reminds me!\u201d Reimu suddenly beamed as she turned to Rinnosuke, \u201cdid you finally fix those arcades yet! I got my bag of coins here with me!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAs a matter of fact I have,\u201d he said with an assured grin, \u201cturns out it was nothing a few good discounted extension cords couldnt fix.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAWESOME!\u201d she shouted with glee as she dashed toward one of the arcades! She stuck into a coin in the first machine she saw, which was Pac-Man, and her eyes were glued unblinkingly to the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she played. And she played. Until she got sick of Pac-Man. Then she went on to play Street Fighter II. And played. And played. And played and played and played, getting incredibly frustrated because she couldnt beat M. Bison (or Vega, since she'd technically be playing the Japanese version for obvious reasons, right?).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, Reimu? Shouldnt we be going now? We've been here long enough.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhen I'm done, when I'm done,\u201d she didnt even turn her head away from the screen. She still kept focused, still hammering on the buttons, still pumping coins into the machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry about Reimu,\u201d Rinnosuke whispered, \u201cthere's hardly ever a day she comes to my shop and pass up the arcades ever since I put them in. It was a financial gambit I do not regret taking!\u201d He laughed\u2026 then he noticed you werent laughing with him, so he stopped. \u201cListen, if you wanna talk to Nitori, her ravine isnt that far from here. It's only about half a kilometer west of here. If you hear the sound of running water youre on the right track.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think about it as you look over at Reimu, now glued to the Marvel Vs Capcom arcade. This was gonna take a while. You could be over at the ravine then come right back and she'd probably never notice you were gone!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust make sure you dont stay out after dark,\u201d Rinnosuke warns, \u201cthe forest is for the most part safe for humans, but at night\u2026 well the crazies come out and\u2026 well, some crazy youkai like to take advantage of lonely humans lost in the woods.\u201d<br>\r\nDamnit. You shoulda stayed and meditated with the Miko! Despite her lack of knowledge in modern technology, you were in much better hands with her than her pupil or little sister or daughter or niece or whatever the hell the relation is!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could mentally rant any more, you hear the desperation in Zane's voice in your mind again just before your phone died. You needed answers. He was the guy to get them from. But you have no idea where he is and he has no idea where on earth you are. Maybe if you can find this Nitori person, you can work something out and get in contact with him again.<br>\r\nOf course, that's provided you can before night time. Then Zane and the others might have even more to stress about...</span></div></div>",

With no other option, the crow girl flew away in retreating, screaming off the top of her lungs as she left! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Beep beep!*<br>\r\nSuddenly, a blue haired girl in a blue dress and a green cap emerged from the bushes and pressed buttons on a little remote. Immediately after, the angry swarm of killer bees descended on her!<br>\r\n...Well, actually they descended on the box she had in her hand which they immediately flew in. and with another push of the button, the buzzing came to an immediate stop. Remote control bees?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dumb crow. That'll teach you to scare away my customers,\" you heard her mumble. Something tells you she has a history with that Aya girl. But now wasnt the time. Blue hair already turned your direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that moron,\" she apologizes, \"I assure you she does not represent nor does she have affiliation whatsoever with Genbu Ravine!\" Ravine, she says? Is THAT the ravine Rinnosuke was talking about? <br>\r\n\"Er... thanks?\" you scratched your head, still a little dumbfounded by the surprise OCD paparazzi!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, humans shouldnt be wandering around these woods all alone,\" the blue haired girl lectures, \"quite a lot of dangerous youkai prowl around here looking for easy prey.\" Just as Rinnosuke warned.<br>\r\n\"Was uh, SHE dangerous?\" you asked.<br>\r\nShe sighed, \"No. Just irritable. Anyways what are you doing out here by yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm looking for a girl named Nitori,\" you answered, \"heard she might be able to charge the power of my phone. Nobody else apparently can?\"<br>\r\n\"I'M Nitori!\" she proudly exclaims, \"just need something to charge your phone? That'll be no trouble for me! Quick, come this way before anybody else sees you!\"<br>\r\n\"Ok,\" like a gullible fool, you blindly follow along this girl, blindly relying on fate that youre in good hands... but it's either depend on the kindness of strangers or continue wandering lost in the woods by yourself. And you'd rather not risk bumping into someone more dangerous than an annoying girl with a camera!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven more time passes as Reimu is STILL at Rinnosuke's shop, STILL wasting her time and coins on his arcade! Rinnosuke shoulda questioned that she has some sort of a dangerous gaming addition, but as long as she keeps pouring money into his machine, he's not gonna let it bother him whatsoever!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, somebody else is bothered by the fact that somebody hasnt returned to the shrine by now. In walks the head Miko of Hakurei Shrine, worried about her pupil's (and perhaps daughter's?) long absence. A quick greeting and question later, the shopkeep points over to the direction of Reimu, eyes still glued to the arcade screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reimu?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*GASP!* Reimu gasped the microsecond she heard Lady Hakurei's unforgettable voice call out by her name! She immediately stops what she's doing, letting the Sinistar devour her ship, and obediently turns to her mentor's direction!<br>\r\n\"L-Lady Hakurei!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reimu, was this seriously what you've been doing the whole time?!\" Sendai scolds her, \"You've just skipped out on your whole daily duty for that silly game?!\"<br>\r\n\"I'm tremendously sorry, Lady Hakurei,\" she bows apologetically, \"I've given into temptation! I wont let it happen again! I swear!\"<br>\r\nSendai sighs and shakes her head, \"We'll discuss this later, right now it's getting really late. Where's Michael?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, the young miko's eyes widened.<br>\r\n\"Uh, Michael?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you were with him last. Where is he?\"<br>\r\nReimu's eyes darted around the place. In all the time she spent glued to the arcade, she completely lost track of him! If he told her where he was going, she obviously wasnt listening!<br>\r\n\"Uhhhhh.... um.... hm....\"<br>\r\nSendai was getting impatient, \"Reimu, it's a simple question. Where is he?\" A simple question Reimu did not have the answer to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd unfortunately for her, Rinnosuke did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Lady Hakurei,\" he spoke up, \"last I remember, he was asking about a replacement phone charger. When we didnt have one, I merely suggested that the kappa at the ravine might have something to charge his phone, so...\" Sendai's nostrils flared. That was all she needed to hear!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You let a human in need suffering from amnesia wander off into the woods alone?!!\" she vented her frustration toward her pupils direction.<br>\r\n\"N-no! H-h-he just wandered off without my saying so!\" she pleaded, \"h-h-had I known, I wouldve never let him go off on his own!\"<br>\r\n\"Reimu! Do you have any idea what will happen to our shrine if words gets out we abandoned a helpless human in need that was already in our care?!\"<br>\r\n\"D-D-Dont worry, Lady Hakurei! I'll find him! I promise!\"<br>\r\n\"WE will find him!\" Sendai grabs Reimu's arm and drags her out of the shop, \"and after that, we're gonna have a LONG talk!\"<br>\r\n\"Y-yes ma'a-Ow!! Hey, that hurt!\"<br>\r\n\"Trust me, that pain's gonna pale in comparison to later, now get moving!\"</span></div></div>",

Who is it?\" you asked.<br>\r\n\"A youkai, now hurry and hide!\" without even much thought let alone objection, she quickly shoved you into a nearby closet! You didnt even get time to grab your charger, let alone new sword and gun! Thankfully, it had airholes-I mean gaps to see through to the outside. And shortly after being crammed in the closet, you spotted another girl barging into the basement. A pointy-earred brunette wearing a hat similar to that Aya girl, only her hair was in purple bowed pigtails and she wore a purple and black checkered skirt. Another 'Tengu' if that's what Aya called it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hi Hatate!\" Nitori greeted this girl, \"what can I do for you today?\"<br>\r\nThat Hatate girl sighs in disappointment like this wasnt her first time, \"Aya ran a fowl of some angry bees again.

Thankfully your amnesia was still strong enough to miss what she's referring to there, otherwise you'd be groaning with disgust!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh. OOOOOH!!!\u201d but Nitori finally gets it, \u201cone of THOSE, huh? Heh, sorry Hatate. I did make a few\u2026 to SELL of course.. but a couple of girls came by the other day and bought the last ones I had.\u201d<br>\r\nBut the Tengu girl wasnt ready to give up, \u201cW-well do you have anything that matches the size and shape at least?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNot unless you wanna blast your ovaries out!\u201d Again, thank you amnesia!<br>\r\n\u201cThen cant you make something that'll suffice?

You wish there was some way you could help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSheesh, get a hold of yourself, girl!\u201d Nitori ripped herself away from her.<br>\r\n\u201cThat's the problem! I CANT!\u201d Hatate remarked, \u201cmy special season came early and my dealer told me she suffered a medicine shortage. And I cant concentrate on doing my job and providing for my well being if part of me is too busy craving!! And that smell in this room isnt helping\u2026 wait a second!\u201d She started sniffing across the room, \u201cthat\u2026 smell\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat smell?\u201d Nitori asked.<br>\r\n\u201c*Sniff sniff*\u201d Hatate sniffed, \u201cTHAT\u2026 smell\u2026 *sniff*\u2026 it smells so\u2026 *sniff*\u2026 masculine\u2026 *sniff*\u2026 and inviting...\u201d her cheeks went red as she continued to sniff the air, \u201c...and untouched.\u201d You tried sniffing around for whatever she's sniffing, but couldnt smell anything!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow much you want for it?!!!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cFor what?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever's smelling like that!! Hurry up and sell it to me!!\u201d Hatate demanded.<br>\r\n\u201cI dont smell anything.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cC'mon! I know you have something that's smelling that fragrant! Name your price!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI honestly dont have anything like that,\u201d Nitori tells her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could see the tears running down Hatate's face as she gritted her teeth and trembled. She seriously looked like she was in absolute agony. It kinda triggered your chivalrous side. You felt guilty just staring over there and ignoring a poor girl in need. Had it not been for the amnesia, you'd probably know WHY she's feeling that way and why you SHOULDNT volunteer to help!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyways, you wondered if you might have something to offer her that could ease whatever is stressing her out. Surely, you could do something, ANYTHING to help her out!<br>\r\nBut just as you were about to come out of the closet, some iffy, fuzzy part of your brain was giving off a bad warning. Like a red-flag was triggering but you dont know why. Was it seriously THAT big a deal to help out poor little Hatate? </span></div></div>",

You knew him as it was Oswald Lombardi, Italian native who joined the mafia when he was 16 years old. He looked at you for moment and then scoffed at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"So the little puppy is still alive.\" Oswald said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Don't call me puppy, dammit!\" You spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Both reisen and kaguya knew he was one of the invaders who struck eientei.

The scythe looked gothic as it had uneven pole and long blade with mirror on the middle and it had the small gargoyle statue on the edge of the blade. The ladies were amazed to see this and you remembered his nickname from the family \"gothic grim reaper.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Now then, shall we begin?\" Oswald spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He then swung his scythe fast, landing hit on both reimu and yukari. Blood spurred and they both felt tremendous pain. They fell as both yukari and chen summoned their bullet and shoots him toward the chest. Oswald quickly deflected the bullets and ran toward the two to slash them until reisen used her ability, making Oswald slash on yukari and chen, only to be an illusion. You gritted your teeth as you felt helpless from this, and as both reimu and ran got up, reimu made the shield around you and the laides nodded.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Lets show him our power.\" Reimu said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n They all then started to bombard their bullets toward Oswald. He deflected many, but it was getting heavy. The ladies then took out the spellcard and activated it, making more attack on the man. The dust filled the area as you and others have hoped the attack finished him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"He's surprised us, but he was weak after all.\" Yukari said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Uh-huh.\" Reimu replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You clearly knew he was not the person who would not be defeated that easly. Just then, when the dust faded away, you saw Oswald standing with something on his hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Reimu..\" You spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Reimu looked around and saw him standing.

You wondered what happened until you heard the ladies scream. Their chest busted with blood and they were in pain, then suddenly a bullet were made from the pool of blood and attacked them. Yukari did her  best to open the gap, but few hit her and her shikigami. They knelt as the shield that surrounded you disappeared and Oswald smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Now then, I'll take this lunarian people with me..but it would be shame if I don't bring the traitors head with me.\" Oswald said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"How..could he have..a spellcard?\" Reisen mumbled in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He walked toward you with smile.

I\u2019m sorry about your friends.\u201d<br>\r\nYou lowered your head, \u201cThey\u2026 weren\u2019t my friends. But tell your master I said thank you. If she didn\u2019t show up in time, I\u2018m sure those two jerks woulda done away with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, you can tell her yourself,\u201d Reisen told you, \u201cMaster wanted me to confirm your vitals were still stable. Since youre awake, it\u2019s pretty obvious they are. I\u2019ll bring her over. Wait right there\u2026 er\u2026 like you have a choice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she was getting ready to leave, another memory raced into your mind. That other girl that was with the one that carried you. That wasn\u2019t really your sister Anna, was it?<br>\r\nYou coulda sworn Ms. Le Fey killed her. Or at least you HOPE she killed her, compared to the other things she could\u2019ve done to her! You weren\u2019t hallucinating when you saw her, were you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, wait Reisen!\u201d you called for her before she stepped out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d the bunny girl turned her attention to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust a quick question,\u201d you say right before taking a deep breath, \u201cwhen I was brought here, your master didn\u2019t have another girl with her, did she? A brown haired girl with green eyes and has a long cut mark from the end of her lip down to under her chin?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReisen answered.</span></div></div>",

You thought she was dead after she disappeared from the gang (rumor is that Ms.LeFay killed her personally). Moment later, a door opened and two people came in. One...was your big sis!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You cringed seeing that big long neatly clean cut from her cleavage, down her chest and stopping just above her belly button. It looks like it's been stitched up rather nice, but your awful confident it wasnt Dr. Eirin that made the cut to begin with. Knowing history, you had a pretty good guess who did this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" you pointed to the cut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Nephilim,\" was the answer to the $1,000,000 question. Just hearing the nickname alone saved a long lengthy story. The Nephilim, Le Fey's finest doctor. Despite being one of the Fey that've never been given a name, he's certainly made quite a name for himself. You havent had the <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">dis</span>pleasure of meeting him personally, but you heard a lot of stories. He's always studying species, always studying bodies, always researching them, always checking what makes each creature tick, always thinking of 'creative' ways to 'improve' on his subjects. Human, animal, fairy, whatever, if you've got a functioning body or a hollow shell, he'll want to have a look at it. You assume he's an organ harvester... that could be why your sister...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez,\" you whisper, \"does it still hurt?\"<br>\r\n\"It never hurt to begin with,\" she said with a little fear in her voice, \"it's just the stitches that are actually painful. I think he wanted it that way...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amazing that the cut was already sterilized and sanitized by the time she got here,\" Dr. Eirin was eavesdropping on the conservation the whole time, \"No infection or punctured organs or anything! I honestly didnt need to do much other than sew up the wound. Whatever crooked black market doctor did that... seemed really keen on ensuring she survives.\"<br>\r\n\"That aint necessarily a good thing,\" Anna ignored her intrusion and commented, \"usually if the Nephilim does that, it's either cuz he's taking something out... or putting something in.\" Your sister seemed a bit scared. You NEVER see her afraid! None of those fairy fuckers scare her! Not even Big Bad Maeve herself can get a rise out of her. But here she was... scared. This concerned you.<br>\r\n\"Did he take anything out?\" She shook her head. \"...Did he put anything in?\" She shrugged her shoulders. She didnt know!<br>\r\n\"I found no signs or traces of foreign matter in her bloodstream,\" Eirin stated, \"she will be fine. My nurses will continue monitoring her to ensure no potentially poisonous activity occurs.\" That's good news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna still looked pretty uneasy. Not that you blame her. She was officially one of the Nephilim's living subjects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look bro. Dont worry about me,\" Anna tells you, \"If Doc says I'll be fine, I'll be fine. Shouldnt you be busy THANKING her for saving our lives?\" Shouldnt YOU be telling HER that? Anyways, you should be thanking her.<br>\r\n\"Thank you Dr,\" you thanked her, \"we really appreciate everything you've done for us. If not for you... we probably wouldnt be dead, but knowing our former employment, we'd be praying we were.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEirin smiled and scratched the back of her head, \"Oh, well, it was nothing, really. It's just part of the job I was assigned, is all. Which reminds me. Ms. Whitestone, it's best that you get some rest. You havent slept at all since I found you and youre looking very weary.\"<br>\r\n\"Alright, doc,\" Anna complied, \"Alex, be sure to show your gratitude to Ms. Yagokoro properly.\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, Anna,\" you didnt care that she was trying to hard to act like your mother. You were just relieved to see she was alright after escaping the worst mafia in mythology! \u201cGoodnight, sis.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cTake it easy, bro.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter shutting off the light, you and the doctor stepped out of her room and went for a walk down the hallway. Well, actually you merely followed Eirin because you owed her a debt. Maybe it\u2019s cuz you were hanging around Le Fey for too long, but you still follow one of their basic rules. A fairy NEVER accepts nor gives free favors. You are always obligated to pay off a debt that\u2019s owed. And since this debt is saving your sister\u2019s life and yours, you were going to pay it off by any means necessary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour sister sure is quite a piece of work,\u201d Eirin stated, \u201cyou should be proud to have someone like her as a sibling.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI am,\u201d no contest there, \u201cI am in your debt for what you\u2019ve done for us, Dr. Yagokoro.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh it\u2019s quite alright. I was just doing what any doctor worth her license would do.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI STILL owe you,\u201d you emphasize, \u201cand I will STILL repay the favor in kind.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not necessary,\u201d she said that to the wrong man.<br>\r\n\u201cI beg to differ,\u201d you state, \u201cit was because my family couldnt repay their debts that we ended up in trouble with Le Fey to begin with. That debt cost them their lives. You have just saved us from possibly history\u2019s most notorious cartel that we have a debt with! I honestly owe you and I will personally do whatever it takes to pay you back!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026 my\u2026\u201d Eirin got a bit speechless, having no idea what to say at this point. You are stubborn, but Eirin earned payback. And simple gratitude cant come near compensating!<br>\r\n \u201cI will do whatever you tell me!\u201d you told her adamantly as you followed her to her office, \u201cI\u2019ll volunteer to help out in this hospital! I\u2019ll clean, I\u2019ll cook, I\u2019ll assist you and other nurses, I\u2019ll wash bedpans, showers and toilets\u2026\u201d you leaned in real close to her face and whispered, \u201cI know people that can get you stocked with top quality pharmaceutical drugs for dirt cheap!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAheheh\u2026\u201d Eirin laughed uncomfortably, \u201cI dont think your body has healed enough to do any volunteer work yet.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMy body is feeling great!\u201d you emphasize, \u201cthanks to your treatment, I feel TWICE the man I used to be! \u2026Which means I owe TWICE the debt to you!\u201d Eirin immediately regretted opening her mouth.<br>\r\n\"Er, I think you need to get some rest, too,\" she stated while she bent down and put some files away in her desk.<br>\r\n\"Then bright and early, I start repaying my debt?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, sure, fine!\" Eirin slammed the desk shut and groaned, \"for now, you need to relax and-SSS!!\" As soon as she stood back up, you heard a faint snap. Then she cringed in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright, Dr. Yagokoro?\" you rushed to her aid.<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah, I'm fine,\" Eirin exhaled as she rubbed her aching back, \"my back always acts up once in a while. Just one of the benefits of getting old, I guess. Heh.\" An aching back? That spells OPPORTUNITY for you!<br>\r\n\"I can massage you if you'd like.\"<br>\r\nYou made Eirin even more uncomfortable, \"Heh. Youre joking, right?\"<br>\r\n\"No I'm serious,\" you assure her, \"I'm very good at it. Maeve used to have me massage her clients whenever they had muscle pains. The daughters of the Erlking used to come by my house like once a month just to make me massage them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no point in arguing with you and she knew it. You wanted to repay the debt you owed her and you'd do so come hell or high water!<br>\r\n\"Grr.. fine,\" she groaned and leaned over her desk with her back to you, \"please make it fast.\"<br>\r\nYou crackled your knuckles, stretched out your fingers, blew on the fingertips, and brushed her long white braided hair out of the way.<br>\r\n\"Wow... who braids your hair?\" you commented as you brushed it a little more, \"havent seen such a professional braided pony-tail in a while!\"<br>\r\n\"Could you please just hurry with the massage?\"<br>\r\n\"Right, sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Gasp!*\" as expected, Eirin gasped and froze up, she clearly underestimated the intensity of your world famous massages!<br>\r\n\"Easy... easy,\" you whispered as your fingers caressed her sensitive pressure points, \"just relax...\"<br>\r\nAs your magical fingers eased her most painful parts to bliss, her eyes widened and drool started to drip from her gritted teeth! She bit her finger, trying to cover up a moan she desperately wants to let out! She was immediately reduced to putty by the time you worked around her shoulders! Through the mirror, you watched her eyes roll back and her jaw drop in sheer ecstasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was that, doctor?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A...ma...zing...\" she muttered with her mouth full of drool as she leaned over against her desk, \"c...can you... go... lower? P..lease?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh course, doctor,\" you happily obliged, working your magical fingers down her back. Her nails scratched against her table while she just barely stopped herself from letting out a scream.<br>\r\n\"L-Lower. Lower!!\" she had literally bent all the way over until her butt was over her desk as if she were presenting it! Your fingers worked their magic against the sensitive spots in her lower back and around her thighs.<br>\r\n\"OoooHh M-Mmmyy... ggooddness!!\" by the end of the massage, her body was shivering, her backside was instinctively pressing against your midsection, and the silly look on her face reeked of 125% satisfaction. If you didnt know any better, youd swear she was wanting the massage for something slightly more perverted than her silly back pain... but with the debt you owed her, you didnt care. She earned it and then some!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eirin, the cable's out again! I think Tewi chewed the-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a black haired woman in a pink dress and gazed wide-eyed at the awkward sight of Dr. Eirin bent over on her desk with a young man pressing against her and thoroughly and intimately massaging her mid-section! Both you and Eirin stared back in shock while the woman's face went flush with dumbfoundedness!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-Princess Kaguya, this isnt what it lo-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'LL COME BACK!!\" Kaguya slammed the door shut!</span></div></div>",

You could clearly tell that this 'kaguya' person misunderstood what you were doing. You decided to follow her so you got out and went where they ran off. It took at least 5 minutes to catch up with eirin as she was standing infront of the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Princess, it's misunderstanding!\" Eirin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"It's alright eirin, I'll give you some private time!\" Kaguya replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As you came to eirin, she lookes at you with worriedness. You both know it was misunderstanding so you spoke up on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Um..miss? Your misunderstanding something.\" You said, \"I was giving eirin a massage because her back was in pain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Silence lingered, then the door slided revealing kaguya herself. She was blushing and figiting little then turned her attention to eirin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \".....Are you sure?\" Kaguya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yes.\" Eirin answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She sighed and opened the door fully. Her kimono did suites her and both you and eirin waited to see her reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"If that's the case...then I apologize.\" Kaguya said, \"is he new?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Both you and eirin sighed in relieve,  and eirin introduced you to kaguya and vice versa. After few talk, eirin promised to get cable fixed by tomorrow. Kaguya were disgruntled by this but understood as it was getting late. You two bid farewell and you went back to your room to go to sleep. You plopped on the bed and looked up at the celing for moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I hope everything would be ok.\" You mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You closed your eyez and went to bed. Next morning came and you felt someone close to you. You shifted and when you opened your eyes slowly, you saw...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You werent really shocked let alone did you wake up with a jolt. You just found it a little odd that some young short black haired bunny girl with a little carrot necklace around her neck lying in your bed next to you was the first thing you saw when you woke up. What made it even odder was the smirk she was giving off. It didnt seem childish, playful, or uppity as you would expect any kid that loves to smile would make.<br>\r\nIf anything... it actually leaned toward, dare you say it, 'pervy'. For some reason, youre having a strange fear of Chris Hansen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, sweet thang!\" the young girl said in a disturbingly sexy voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H...\" you swallowed, \"hello. Who might you be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Inaba,\" she purred, \"Tewi Inaba. I'm the leading dame of these bunny babes living here. I'm also your cute little wake up girl!\"<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" you smiled nervously, but looked around for any cameras, \"how nice.\"<br>\r\n\"Did you have a good sleep?\" Tewi asked, then her smirk got even wider, \"...cuz Eirin sure did!\" And then you suddenly got a hundred times more uncomfortable! <br>\r\n\"Wh...what?\" you pretended to be dumb, but you knew exactly what this kid was talking about!<br>\r\n\"Not to worry, sweet thang!\" hearing her call you that again made you shudder, \"we at Eientei LOOOOVE to share!\" You did not like where this conversation was going. Long story short, somebody else mustve taken that back massage you gave Dr. Eirin the wrong way!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as your face went red, Tewi leaped out of your bed and ran to the door. \"You better hurry downstairs! You dont wanna be late for breakfast!\" Despite earlier, you follow her to the hospital lounge. Sitting at one of the tables, you see the nurse/patient from last night, Reisen and the princess that caught you and the doc in the act, Kaguya eating together. And as soon as the two saw you coming their way, both of them gave nervous red-cheeked stares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning,\" you said with a totally NOT nervous smile.<br>\r\nKaguya simply coughed while Reisen's bunny ears twitched.<br>\r\n\"M...Morning, Mr. Whitestone...\" bunny girl's eyes kept rolling back and forth. Yeah, shit definitely hit the fan. You got some esplainin' to do, Lucy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, listen!\" you sat at the table with them, \"if this is about last night with me and Dr. Yagokoro-\"<br>\r\n\"It's... it's fine!\" Reisen waves her arms, \"I completely understand master has her needs!\"<br>\r\n\"We didnt... er... it was just a massage! I'm pretty well known for massages where I used to work!\"<br>\r\nReisen almost spit out her coffee hearing that!<br>\r\n\"No, not THOSE kind of massages! Anyway, the doctor had a back pain so I massaged her back. Princess, the doctor and I already explained this.\"<br>\r\nKaguya turned away, \"Like Ms. Udongein Inaba said, it's alright, you dont need to excuse your actions...\" her face went red, \"I'm... quite happy for Eirin that despite her age she's still... um... a healthy woman.\"<br>\r\n\"Heh! Yeah!\" Tewi butt in and hopped in the seat next to you, \"doggy-style's been known to lose weight!\" You dropped your jaw hearing something like THAT come out of that brat's mouth!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Thump!*<br>\r\n\"Ow!\" Tewi got a thump on the head for that remark!<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Princess,\" thanked Reisen.<br>\r\n\"Dont mention it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed hard, \"Seriously, there is nothing on between the two of us. I just owe her a huge favor for saving me and my sister's lives so I'm doing everything I can to pay her back.\"<br>\r\n\u201cWow, Eirin\u2019s big pimpin\u2019 in da house!\u201d the hell did Tewi just\u2026?!<br>\r\n\u201cWELL\u2026\u201d Reisen rolled her eyes, \u201cregardless, it\u2019s nice to finally see master so cheerful this morning.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI agree,\u201d Kaguya sipped her tea, \u201cit\u2019s very rare we\u2019ve ever seen Eirin so.. chipper at this time of the day. Whatever you did certainly lifted her usual morning gloom.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it was the least I could do,\u201d you said, \u201cas long as sis is ok, that\u2019s ultimately all I care about. Believe me, the relationship I have with your doctor is strictly professional and for my sister\u2019s sake.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning, Alex!\u201d speak of the devil, along came Eirin giving you a rather bright warming smile. She not only greeted YOU specifically, but called you by your first name instead of \u2018Mr. Whitestone\u2019.<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning, Ei-\u201d you took a quick glance at the other three, \u201c\u2026Dr. Yagokoro!\u201d Her incredibly warming smile left the others more suspicious! Eirin did not concern herself with the others as she set a snazzy little custom-made Cartoony Chibi-Eirin mug full of hot chocolate on the table in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, it smells nice,\u201d you commented, \u201cyou brew it yourself?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little concoction I\u2019ve been working on for a while,\u201d  Eirin said, \u201cit\u2019s a kind of instant-beverage hybrid full of special super vitamins and herbal supplements for boosting the immune system guaranteed enhancement throughout the day.\u201d Interesting.<br>\r\nTewi snickered. \u201c \u201cEnhancement!\u2019 \u201c you heard her whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, it smells delicious,\u201d you compliment the drink and change the subject, \u201cso doctor\u2026 how\u2019s Anna doing?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s currently getting her physical,\u201d Eirin explained, \u201cA few of my nurses are still testing for any toxicity. So far, the previous tests came up negative, but I\u2019ll do my best to remove all doubt.\u201d Wow, that\u2019s comforting, \u201cAnd since this surgery is fairy-related, I\u2019m also having a specialist from one of the Fairy courts take a look at her this afternoon.\u201d That sparked a flag.<br>\r\n\u201cWinter or Summer court?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n\u201cSummer.\u201d You exhaled in relief. Ms Le Fey has loyal family in the Winter court. Granted, you dont trust fairies in general anymore, but it takes one knowledgeable on fairy influence to deal with fairy influence. Youre pretty sure the Nephilim did SOMETHING to your sister! Besides, the enemy of your enemy is your friend, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are the greatest, Dr. Yagokoro.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEirin giggled then turned to the others at the table, \u201cPrincess, the repairman will be here in a couple hours to look at the cable.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a relief,\u201d Kaguya sipped her tea, \u201cI\u2019ll be damned if I\u2019m missing a 24 hour marathon of House MD!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cReisen, did you remember to take your medicine this morning?\u201d<br>\r\nReisen\u2019s ears stood up on end, \u201cUm\u2026 uh\u2026 y-yeah, I was just about to! See?!\u201d She pulled out her little bottle and popped a pill in her mouth.<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good girl!\u201d Eirin patted her head, making her face a little red, \u201cTewi, did you dig any holes in the yard recently?\u201d<br>\r\nTewi gave the puppy dog eyed look  and pretended to act all innocent \u201cNooooo\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThen why did I just find poor little Chen this morning stuck in a hole right by the lake crying her eyes out?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026I was gonna get her out! Honest! It just\u2026 slipped my mind.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou know what\u2019ll help you remember?\u201d Eirin smiled, \u201cvolunteering to clean Ran\u2019s shrine for the rest of the month.\u201d<br>\r\nTewi\u2019s ears stood up on end! \u201cWHAT\u2026 B\u2026 BUT SHE EATS RABBITS!!!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAll the more reason to be on your best behavior!\u201d Eirin gave no fs. Well, it sounds like THIS family\u2019s gonna take some getting used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026 Alex?\u201d suddenly, the doc put her hand on your shoulder, \u201cI\u2026 think my back might be acting up again. Would you mind giving me another massage later tonight?\u201d All three of the girls eyed you attentively.<br>\r\n\u201cNot at all,\u201d you happily oblige, \u201cI\u2019ll do it whenever and however often you like.\u201d Again, that damn rabbit brat snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m really looking forward to it. Now if you\u2018ll excuse me, I have some rounds to make.\u201d And then your doctor walked off. Not like you didn\u2019t already notice from last night, but her dress does a very good job showing off her butt\u2026 especially with the way her hips sway side to side like that as she walks\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWOOO!! SHAKE DAT ASS, EIRIN!! *THUMP!* Ow!\u201d Another well deserved thump on the head for the pervy brat!<br>\r\nSome morning this turned out to be. It doesnt look youre gonna be able to convince these girls in any way that you and their doctor arent really intimate. So instead of uselessly explaining yourself more, you just ignore the stares and sip your delicious instant beverage.</span></div></div>",

You sweated little as you sipped some hot chocolate, you put the cup down and quickly thought on changing the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"S-say, what are you're plans ladies?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Huh? w-well, I'm going play some games today.\" Kaguya answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'm going to human village to sell..some medicine.\" Reisen replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I might go see some of my friends.\" Tewi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You breathed out, thinking that they would do something odd to you. You then quickly ate your breakfast, drank your drink and got up. You thanked for the food and was about to take the dirty dishes to the kitchen but reisen told you she'll do it. You thanked her and once you got to the hallway, you wondered if anna finished with her physical. You looked around but you couldn't find her, so you thought on where she might be. One thing you could come up is that she might be outside smoking since she was a smoker. You got out and with your right intention, anna was leaning on the wall smoking cigarette. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Anna?\" You spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She noticed you and then blew a cigarette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Wassup, little bro?\" Anna replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"nothing much...what happened to physical?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'm done with physical for while.\" Anna answered, \"I'm going to do it again on afternoon.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I see.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You came next to her and leaned on the wall. The sound of morning birds chirping were nice, and the light breeze were relaxing as well. You thought to yourself 'how did this happen?' as you did work with le fay for while. Anna done alot of hard work from difficult drug deal to destroying the mafias plot just so she could get money to keep protecting you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Did  dad say anything before he died?\" anna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Huh?\" You spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Anna looked at you. You remember that anna was at Chicago when your dad died. She weren't even in his funeral because she was busy with the fey. You thought for moment but couldn't' remember what dad said before he passed on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I don't remember.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Huh..\" Anna sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She then smoked few more time and then thew then walked toward the door. You followed her and when you two were at the hallway, you bumped to tewi. You saw her grinning face, letting you have some sort of doubting feeling inside you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"H-hey tewi, how's everything?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ohh, nothing. I was just about to leave.\" Tewi replied. \"By the way...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She trotted to you and hugged you. You blushed little and then she looked up to you with the puppy eyes. You could tell she was up to something, then she asked you a weird question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Say, alex. When you do the massage again with eirin, are you going beyond just massage?\" Tewi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You blushed more, then...</span></div></div>",

It was a hell of a surprise to both of you that your own sister would pull a gun on someone for something so silly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you mean by that?!\" Anna questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was a joke! It was a joke!\" Tewi shivered behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT DID YOU MEAN BY THAT?!\" she repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anna, get a hold of yourself!\" you try to talk sense into her, \"put the damn gun down!\"<br>\r\n\"What did she mean by massage?!\" the heck?! THAT'S all she's upset by?!<br>\r\n\"Are you freaking kidding me?!\" you raised your eyebrow, \"THAT'S why youre pointing a gun at a kid?!\"<br>\r\n\"Kid?! I-I'm the oldest employee in this hospital!\" Tewi stuttered, but you had no time whatsoever to question her age. Being oh so close to shot by your sister is a tad bit more important in this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex, what is she talking about?\" your sis cooled down a little, but her gun was still pointing at the little bunny girl.<br>\r\nYou sighed, \"I gave Eirin a massage last night.\"<br>\r\n\"You WHAT?!\" she put her gun down but she began raising her voice. Great, she's gonna scream so loud, the other patients are gonna hear it!<br>\r\n\"Look, it wasnt one of THOSE massages! She had a back pain and all I did was massage it away. Nothing erotic or sex-related whatsoever.\"<br>\r\n\"I dont care if you fucked her!\" holy snap she didnt?! \"uggh... what were you thinking massaging her?! You know the goddamn Fey are well aware of that technique you got!\"<br>\r\n\"W... what are you talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe exhaled hard. Youre awful confident you just asked her a dumb question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Havent you realized by now why I tell you 'DONT GIVE PEOPLE MASSAGES'?!\" aw crap, here comes the lecture that makes you feel stupid, \"think, Alex! I've lost count of how many of those elven sluts you had to rub down! That is a unique trait you have that can draw attention. If word gets out about your 'unique trait', Le Fey is going to find out and theyre gonna be coming here looking for you!\"<br>\r\nOH. Right! Those fairies know quite well of your massaging ability. That could be really helpful in finding you if word spreads about your ability. Too bad word is already out. Kaguya already knows it, Reisen already knows it, and Tewi already knows it. Who knows how many others know it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna turned her head to the shivering bunny and glared, \"Not a word of this gets out. You hear me, twerp?\"<br>\r\nTewi nodded heavily, \"Y-Y-YES MA'AM!!\"<br>\r\n\"Good. Now buzz off.\" Then Tewi, finally being a good girl for a change, ran off with her tail between her legs!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didnt have to be that hard on her,\" you say.<br>\r\n\"You wouldnt be feeling sorry for that brat after hearing half the crap she's done around here,\" she took another puff of her cigarette just before you snatched the cigarette from her hand and stomped it on the ground. \"HEY!\"<br>\r\n\"Youre scared to death about having nasty stuff being put in your body? DONT PUT NASTY STUFF IN YOUR BODY!\" it was your turn to lecture HER.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... not scared,\" she twitched, \"I just know what this bastard is capable of. I've been to a few of his lectures.\"<br>\r\n\"Eirin told me that she found nothing bad in you,\" you explain, \"and even if there's something, she's not gonna give up on you. She even has a specialist from the Summer Court coming to take a look at you.\"<br>\r\n\"Tsk,\" Anna tsked, \"same pointy-earred psychopaths. Theyre probably in Maeve's pocket, too.\"<br>\r\n\"No they arent,\" you tell her, \"they hate Maeve's folks as much as we do. Theyre as close to allies as we can get.\"<br>\r\n\"Close to allies, you say?\" Anna put a hand to her hip and tilted her head, \"I seem to recall one of those 'allies' tried to murder you for having the audacity to talk to her princess.\"<br>\r\nYou sighed, \"It was a misunderstanding. The Daiyousei just thought I was trying to kidnap Aurora, but she immediately apologized after Aurora explained that we were just chatting.\"<br>\r\n\"The Daiyousei still has a picture of you in her bedroom where she practices her projectile throwing.\" Geez! That dumb fairy actually has a grudge against you?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Regardless of that idiot, there are still plenty of good smart NONbloodthirsty fairies in the Summer Court,\" you keep your defense up, \"if youre really worried about what the Nephilim did to you, we're going to need their help.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna go lie down,\" and there she went, abruptly ending this conversation. But she only took a couple of steps before turning back to you one last time, \"you still dont remember hearing dad say anything about me?\"<br>\r\nYou shook your head. So she continued her trek back to her room. It was a very unwanted abrupt ending, but you hope what you said to her made her feel a little better. She was right about one point, though. You really shouldnt go around giving EVERYBODY that has a backache massages. SOME of these girls here like to gossip...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, I'll just massage Eirin,\" you tell yourself, \"nobody else. I cant massage anybody else. No special treatment for anybody else. No matter how much they-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Owwww... my back....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got to be friggin kidding me!\" you suddenly hear someone's voice call out behind one of the bushes and curse your sudden urge to help out those in need. At least those you know you can help!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is anybody out there?\" the voice from behind the bush called, \"somebody help... I cant get up...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour fingers were twitching with anticipation, ready to fix a back in need! You shake your head no but your fingers twitched YES! You remind yourself that this is a hospital, and it's already full of professionals that are capable of treating someone with a bad back! They dont need you! ...Then again, the HEAD doctor here needed you, so that's kinda gotta be saying something!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Somebody please help....\" the voice continued to call, \"my back... auuuggh... it hurts so muuucchh....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn your head back to the door and mentally prepare yourself to haul ass and call for help, but PHYSICALLY you dont move an inch. Part of you was 199% confident that you could fix that poor stranger's back with just your bare hands! There was NO back so far you couldnt treat with a single massage!<br>\r\nThis was like Clark Kent trying his hardest not be Superman while a burning school bus full of children was dangling off a cliff right in front of him! You just couldnt ignore it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGotta do something and fast! The longer you juggle around the choices to make, the worse this poor stranger's back could be getting!</span></div></div>",

As you closed your eyes and thought about some stuff, you felt little disturbed in your heart. you wanted to open your eyes but for some reason, you couldn't. You then suddenly heard someones gagging noise and chopping noise. You quickly opened your eyes and saw an disturbing vision infront of you: Anna and yourself with your face and cloth scattered in blood, holding an makeshift knife. You looked down and saw the whole member of eieintei laying on the ground filled with puddle of blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What..the fuck is this!?\" you shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You blinked, and the vision faded away.

Looks werent really your concern. What compelled you to sit next to her was the fact that it felt surprisingly warm being near her and you were stone cold after that nightmare. Even after spending quite some time working under the Winter Court, you never could get used to the cold. Then again, what MIGHTVE helped you loathe the cold more were the Snowmen in Maeve's winter garden... those poor bastards picked the worst time in the world to be immortal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put on a straight face while you secretly basked in the warmth of the human fireplace. You didnt enjoy the smell of her cigarette she was smoking. Sadly, this wasnt a 'No Smoking' zone. It didnt take you long to regret sitting next to her.<br>\r\nToo bad, cuz she turned her attention to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm? A guy?\" she raised her eyebrow like it was a surprise to see it, \"a HUMAN guy? Here in Eientei?\"<br>\r\n\"Er... yeah?\" was the best response you can give her what with you being a bit dumbstruck by her first impression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How the hell did you manage surviving the forests this time of year?\" she questioned you, \"it's practically a death sentence for male humans to be outside the Village what with them now doubling as food AND breeding stock for the youkai.\"<br>\r\n\"Uh... I... dont really follow,\" you said even more perplexed than previously.<br>\r\n\"Y... youre not from the Village?\"<br>\r\n\"What Village?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tilted her head while she took a quick drag from her cigarette. She squinted her eyes as the gears in her head turned. The longer she stalled in silence, the less you enjoyed the smell of the smoke!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait,\" she finally spoke, \"you wouldnt happen to be Anna's little brother, are you?\" Well what do you know!<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah!\" you nodded, \"Alex. Alex Whitestone!\"  Hearing that made her smirk and seeing that made you feel uncomfortable!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OOOOHHHH,\" she almost chuckled, \"I know who you are. Youre the guy who's poking the doctor, right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUuuuuuUUURRRGGGGHHH!! SERIOUSLY??!!! Word has already spread fast, it seems<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lowered your head, rubbed the aching side of it, mentally told yourself to calm down, took a deep breath, and finally answered.<br>\r\n\"I'm not...\" you took another breath and looked away, \" 'poking' Dr. Yagokoro. I just gave her a massage.\"<br>\r\n\"Massage?! Heh, I havent heard it called THAT in a long time!\"<br>\r\n\"No, a REAL massage!\" you correct her, \"she's been having problems with her back lately and I offered to help her alleviate the pain... and apparently she liked it so much, she wants me to do it again later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In that case,\" she leaned over and tilted her head, \"I got this terrible ache behind my shoulders ever since that stupid snobby princess shot me through a wall... would ya mind giving ME a massage?!\"<br>\r\nWorse timing to be incredibly hesitant. You told yourself you'd keep your massaging power to a minimum for the sake of your sister.<br>\r\nYou sucked in some air and turned away, \"I cant. I'm only doing it for Dr. Yagokoro.\"<br>\r\n\"Tsk!\" she snickered, \"older than dirt and she can STILL nail a guy a fraction of her age! ...Oh, I'm sorry. I never bothered to introduce myself. I'm Mokou. I\u2018m a\u2026 regular at this place.\" Odd how she was being vague when she said she\u2019s a \u2018regular\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice to meet you,\u201d you\u2019d shake her hand, but somehow making fun of Eirin\u2019s age kinda rubbed you the wrong way. Granted, how old is Eirin, exactly? \u201cSo\u2026 you come here really often?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYep,\u201d she nodded, \u201cme and the doc\u2019s master don\u2019t exactly get along and well\u2026 things break. A lot of things. Property\u2026 bones\u2026 pride\u2026 ya got a smoke?\u201d<br>\r\nYou stared at her with the most flabbergasted look you can make on your face, \u201cI dont smoke. And you already have a cigarette.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSo?\u201d Mokou says as she takes another drag.  Youre gonna have to put up with this girl a lot here, arent you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGOD NO!!! GET HER AWAY!! PLEASE GET HER AWAY!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh crap. As soon as you heard your sister screaming, you almost lost control. Hearing a big brave big sis like Anna scream in such a terrified voice was something you were never used to hearing. If even SHE is scared, then it\u2019s something meant to be feared by all!<br>\r\nFearing the worst, you rush toward her room while Mokou followed. You hoped that none of Maeve\u2019s stooges are in there torturing her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMs. Whitestone! Get a hold of yourself!\u201d you bust in to see Eirin and another nurse trying to restrain your sister as she struggled tremendously to break free of their grip! <br>\r\n\u201cHE KNOWS I\u2019M HERE! THE FUCKER KNOWS I\u2019M HERE!\u201d Anna was panicking like crazy, \u201cLET ME GO! WE GOTTA GET OUTTA HERE!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cUrggh\u2026 calm\u2026 down!\u201d Eirin ordered as she and her assistant struggled with your panicking sis, \u201cAlex, Ms. Fujiwara! Please help me restrain her!\u201d Again, she calls you by your first name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnna, it\u2019s me! I\u2019m here!\u201d you tried to talk sense into her while Mokou assistant the doc and nurse, \u201cyou dont have to panic. I am right here.\"<br>\r\n\"A...Alex...\" she calmed down a little bit, but breathed heavy, \"you... you gotta get outta here now!  Maeve knows we're here! Her damn surgeon is on to us!\"<br>\r\nOnce again with the Nephilim?!<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" you asked her, \"how is he on to us?\"<br>\r\nAnna pointed a shivering finger to her bed mate, the poor unconscious blue haired girl with the bad back.<br>\r\n\"W...what's wrong with her?\"<br>\r\n\"Look at her back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer bare uncovered back revealed two stitched up incisions across her shoulder blades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEirin sighed, \"Those incisions were already there when we found her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that type of incision!\" Anna added, \"I've seen in one of the Nephilim's lectures. He calls it the 'Wingless Angel'.\" Wingless Angel?! \"He mustve used that poor girl as a test subject and dropped her here as a warning! We need to leave now before godknowswhat happens to her!!\"<br>\r\n\"Ms. Whitestone, you need to relax! There's nothing wrong with-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoly crap. That blue haired girl's body is shaking! her arms were twisting awkwardly as she was shaking! It was already too late it seemed. The stitches on her back began to pop!

Anna struggled less and stopped, falling asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Phew...good thing I brought the strong sedative.\" Eirin spoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n You looked at anna, seeing her sedated by the drug.

What did your master do to her?!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI dont have any clue,\u201d you answered, \u201cit might be similar to what she had done to my sister.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeeing as though there are no physical changes to the paitents, it can be safe to assume that we\u2019ve arrived on time,\u201d said the elf in the scrubs no one noticed walk through the door. The wet brown hair, odd green optical orbs for eyes, and the outrageously big jaw that required a really big mouth-mask to cover it gave away her identity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlex, this is the doctor from the Summer Court I invited to take a look at Anna,\u201d Dr Eirin introduced, which was unnecessary,\u201d I\u2019d like you to meet-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDr. Powler,\u201d Margaret Powler (actually, that wasn\u2019t her name. \u2018Peg Powler\u2019 was another nickname given to her by the locals of northern England) A senior surgeon with ties to the Summer Court that\u2019s well known for her large jaws and teeth that could easily tear off limbs. Rumors speculate that instead of surgical knives, she uses her teeth to cut open flesh tissue during surgeries! She\u2019s gonna be your sister\u2019s doctor!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMr. Whitestone, so good to see you!\u201d Peg smiled, her wide cheshire/Glasgow grin barely concealed in her mouth mask, \u201cLady Aurora sends her regards! She also wishes to offer you refuge from the Winter mafia if youre interested.\u201d<br>\r\nThe Summer Princess herself is offering you refuge from her arch-enemy? That is a tempting offer, but you know better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d you turned her down, \u201cyou\u2019ll have to tell her I cant at the moment.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThe Princess, in her infinite generosity, cordially invites you to join her Court and you have the audacity to reject her?!\u201d the Daiyousei (by the way, is not her real name, either. She just loved that nickname from the locals in Okinawa during a trade so much that she adopted it!) was offended by your rejection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is his decision and we have to respect it,\u201d Peg at least accepted your refusal honorably, \u201cnow. These two arrived in here with carefully carved wounds believed to be experiments of the Nephilim, correct?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s correct,\u201d Eirin answered while you nodded and the Daiyousei looked to Cirno worried, \u201cso far, I\u2019ve noticed no odd changes. By the time they arrived, their wounds looked nearly healed.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDoes it happen that he just cuts open people and just fixes them back up without doing anything to them?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt does happen on occasion,\u201d Peg answered, \u201csometimes in the middle of surgery, he gets interrupted and is told by his clients to cancel whatever experiment he\u2019s currently on and just seals the body back up. Either that or maybe his clients have a change of heart and decide to focus on ANOTHER experiment instead. For example, one day a client could say \u2018Cut off Cirno\u2019s feet and put bird talons on them!\u2019 then the next they could say \u2018Change of plans! Replace Cirno\u2019s stomach with a wood chipper!\u2019.\u201d<br>\r\nThe Daiyousei cringed while Cirno still stared confused. Mokou reached into her pocket to pull out a cigarette, only to get it swiped away from the doctor.<br>\r\n\u201cI told you millions of times! No smoking!\u201d Eirin scolded her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeg arranged several of her fellow Fey surgeons to perform a thorough examination on your sister and the girl with icicle wings. She had urged everyone to step outside while they were at work. Daiyousei paced around in the hallway while Mokou decided to take her cigarette break in the ladies room.<br>\r\nThat just left you and Eirin who were walking down the hallway toward\u2026 actually you dont know where youre headed, youre just following Eirin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounded like you and Dai-chan had a bit of history back there,\u201d Eirin enquires.<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if you count nearly getting stabbed to death for inviting someone I didn\u2019t know was her princess to dance, then yeah we got history,\u201d you couldn\u2019t help but blab.<br>\r\n\u201cOh dear,\u201d Eirin frowned, \u201cthat sounds like something she\u2019d do. Perhaps the whole \u2018GREATER fairy\u2019 rank mustve gotten to her head. But what of Dr. Powler?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI had no personal issues with her,\u201d you say, \u201cshe\u2019s a darn good doc. I\u2019m confident my sister and whatshername are in good hands. Once again, I owe you, Dr. Yagokoro.\u201d<br>\r\nEirin smiled, \u201cYes you do. I believe you said you\u2019d give me another massage today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou certainly do remember. Part of you was sort of enthusiastic about it for some reason. Plus you were obligated. She saved your sister\u2019s life. And she means more to you than anything else in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI did say that Dr. Yagokoro,\u201d you politely admit, \u201cand I intend to keep my word. When would you like another taste of my patented technique?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ve already finished my rounds today,\u201d Eirin\u2019s smile brightened, \u201cand with Dr. Powler taking over, I\u2019ve got free time right now.\u201d<br>\r\n\u2018About damn time,\u2019 a part of you that was also slightly perverse made you think that thought! But then that reminds you! The other girls at this hospital! They think youre\u2026 with their doctor!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYoure um\u2026 not bothered that some of the uh, other girls are taking this the wrong way?\u201d you couldnt help but ask.<br>\r\nEirin just laughed as she stopped at a door, \u201cLet the little girls gossip! Us adults have an appointment!\u201d That was all you needed to hear to start rolling up your sleeves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you entered the room, you followed Eirin with anticipation to\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Eirin told you that the massage chair that the eientei had is broken due to Reisen putting too much strength on the patients back, making it break. You painfully laughed at what she said, as eirin helped you get some massage oils and such, she got her dress off and put some jeans on then laid down. You were not that embarressed as you have given plenty of massage in the past, even to your sis. You rubbed the massage oil on her back, you started to give eirin a good back massage. You heard her moan lightly as you gently stroked your hand on her back lightly, she felt the great massage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"How do you feel, eirin?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"So...good..\" Eirin spoke softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You smiled lightly as you continued to massage her back, you started to make a chopping motion against her back lightly. Eirin felt this and her voice became more and more mellow by the overwhelming feeling of goodness from your massage. You truly didn't mind this as you thought back in time, you remember that many female patients who got your massage became so soft on the body that they refuse to get up quickly after the massage. After 20 minutes of  back massage, You gave her a shoulder massage, making the massage experience for eirin more melting sensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Haa...haa....Mr.White..stone..\" Eirin spoke with mellow voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Y-yes?\" you spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Can you please...help me turn around?\" Eirin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You didn't know why she would ask that but you complied and turned her body around until she grabbed you and gently pushed you aside to the ground. You didn't know what was happening as eirin was now on the top mount, staring at you with some sweat and some steam on her body. You had the bad omen on what's in her mind as eirin licked her lips, she sighed in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"That was the greatest massage you ever gave me, Mr.Whitestone.\" Eirin said, \"Ms.Whitestone should be proud of herself for having such a great little brother like yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"E-eirin? What are you doing?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh, for giving me a great massage, I should give you a return gift.\" Eirin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Your thought was correct as she unzipped her jeans, she started to fiddle with your crotch. You were getting scared at what eirin was about to do as you thought to yourself 'why big sis is in sleep!?' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Better question is: will someone interrupt her?</span></div></div>",

You were understandably nervous considering you havent had much official experience with a woman before (Maeve's clients will never count in your heart) and this particular one is taking the lead in a major way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time these thoughts flowed in your head, you were already panting heavily thanks to how experienced Eirin was at gently caressing your testicles (considering she's a doctor, she'd have to be!). She leaned in close, ready to greet your open gasping mouth with hers. You couldnt help but gently stroke her nice long braided hair while you waited for her lips to lock with yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Knock knock knock!*<br>\r\n\"Dr. Yagokoro! Dr. Yagokoro!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SSS!!\" Eirin hissed as you felt the grip on your balls tighten a bit from her flinch! Thankfully, she didnt squeeze tight enough to hurt, but it still scared the hell out of you! She quickly got up off of you and immediately zipped up her jeans and put on a nearby shirt.<br>\r\n\"Quick! Hide!\" Eirin whispered as she pointed to the closet. Despite being confused that she suddenly now cares about her reputation, you did as you told and hid in the closet!<br>\r\n\"Just a minute,\" the doc called out before putting a finger to her lip and going, \"shh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-What is it?\u201d Eirin panted as she opened the door.<br>\r\n\u201cSomebody mixed up Ayane\u2019s heart medicine again!

Like some part of you deep down inside that had a thing for this doctor was hurting. Well, plenty of fish in the sea. YOUNGER fish, mind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEirin dashed out, forgetting to change into her work dress\u2026 and you couldn\u2019t help but admire how well the tight jeans hug her butt while she runs. Youre confident that hips like those have plenty of life left to bare a few babies!<br>\r\nUgh\u2026 why are you thinking stuff like that at a time like this?! You have far far far more important things to worry about than trying to knock up an older woman! Specifically that fate of your sister! She\u2019s always looked out for you when you were at your most helpless, now she\u2019s at her most helpless and really needs someone to look out for her. You shudder to think the kinds of mental trauma the Nephilim put her through\u2026 or intends to put her through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs you can see, class, this particular specimen is incredibly stubborn. Despite the numerous times I\u2019ve carved this hot needle into his chest, this human has still firmly refused to cooperate. Now most humans his age and physically shape would give up before the tenth slash. So far I\u2019ve made\u2026 let\u2019s see\u2026 17 slashes.

It was your first day as the part of the Le Fay gang as your father failed to meet the standerds that the Head of the family was seeing. Once the elevator opened, you two got out to see the head of the gang. The office room were like any normal business room that also included both the Irland and Scotlands national flag. You two walked toward the front desk, realizing that you saw your own sister standing next to Maeve. She noticed you and was in surprised but kept her cool. Maeve, who were wearing a mask, looking at the description on the paper about you and looked at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"So you're the son of David Whiterock, huh?\" Maeve spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Y-Yes, I am.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She put the paper down and leaned back on the chair. You felt something chilly about this women as Anna just stood with her custom made magnum.

Good thing at least you came in time.\" Maeve said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You didn't know what she meant as she ordered one of the member to get her some wine, he went to the cabnet and got the bottle and the wine glass. He came to the desk and put the glass down, opening the bottle and poured some. She smiled as she lifted part of the mask, she got the wine and sipped some and put it to the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"We were short of people, and some of our....men have shamed me and got off the crew.\" Maeve spoke as she put the mask back on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I..see.\" You replied with some horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She could feel the horror from you and chuckled. She looked at the paper again and looked at you one more time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You will be living in the apartment I provide with. Your older sister will be your neighbor.\" Maeve said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You were happy to hear that and once she dismissed you, you got out and within moment you saw your sis come out as well.

Princess Aurora still offers you asylum in her court and your sister... well, despite her personal opinion of us, she should be well aware that you'd be in safer hands with us than anyone under Countess Maeve. Especially that... harvester.\" You bit your lip and kept silent. Anna's probably worried not only for her sake, but yours too. For all you know, perhaps the REAL reason the Nephilim put that tracker in her was to use her to ultimately locate YOU.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We wont force you into coming with us if you dont want to,\" Peggy insisted, \"but we would rather leave that option on that table. Lady Aurora, despite the Daiyousei's dismay, would appreciate it.\" Well you wouldnt mind seeing Aurora again, especially without her damn lacky's blade to your throat! Yet for some reason, you couldnt stop taking quick glances at that sleeping overworked doc through the corner of your eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to go make a call to the the Queen and report my findings,\" Peggy got up out of her seat and headed to the floor, \"if youre interested in coming to the Summer Court with us, please let us know. The Princess still owes you a dance after all.\"<br>\r\n\"I'll think about it,\" was your best answer you could give her, \"and thank you for helping my sister.\"<br>\r\n\"Thank Eirin,\" Dr. Powler told you, \"she was the one who miraculously found a way to get a hold of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aggh.... gh.....ghha....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. 26 slashes and Mr. Tenship still remains silent. This, class, is a human of strong willpower. You will not see such an extraordinary trait in every lifetime. This, ladies and gentlemen, is why he's not a Snowman. Not even that displeasurable fate may be enough to shred him of his sanity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Egh... fu...ck... you... and yer... *cough* ...mistress!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think what this specimen needs is a different set of hands to handle him. Perhaps a woman's touch can succeed where a man's has failed. I will need a volunteer. Um, how about you, Ms. Mizuhashi?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-M-ME?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Youre perfect to test my hypothesis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no I'm not. I mean I'm not that special. I'm... not even one of your better students.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly! Youre one of my worst!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh.... wha?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is why I chose you. Youre lacking. Your peers know it. You cant compete with them. Youre clearly inferior even to this human, Ms. Mizuhashi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I-I'm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at him. He's nearly bleeding to death and he STILL has a stronger resolve than you. Dont you wish you had something like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er...p...professor... ?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such a strong resolve could make one... extraordinarily envious,\" the Nephilim whispered into his student's ear as he handed her the needle, \"...wouldnt you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**********************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning came and after having a bizarre nightmare that made almost made you develop a strange fear of snowmen, you awake from your bed with a stretch and a yawn, as ready as you'll ever be to face the day. You were still on the fence about going to the Summer Court, but hopefully you'll get time to think carefully about it. In the meantime, you better get up, get dressed, and get breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zzzzz...\" after waking up your bedmate, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning Eirin.... EIRIN?!!!\" Once again, you find her fast asleep. THIS time, she's fast asleep in YOUR bed! Youre gonna assume she got so tired that she suddenly passed out on the bed judging by the fact she hasnt changed out of her shirt and jeans (she didnt even unbraid her hair!) and there's a pile of medical papers spilled all over the floor.<br>\r\nStill, this totally doesnt help the image of you and her if someone were to see this (even though the image is looking pretty bad already!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eirin? Eirin wake up!\" you shake her a bit, but all it did was make her snoring louder and her drooling harder, \"C'mon Eirin! Wake up! What if someone sees us here like this?!\" And lo and behold you hear footsteps headed your way!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Whitestone? Have you seen Eirin?\" you hear Kaguya's voice as the footsteps got closer, \"she isnt in her room and the cable's out again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDang, she still wont wake up! Better do something quick!</span></div></div>",

She saw you two and gawked at what she saw and blushed. You couldn't come up on what you have to say as your mind was clouded with chaos and unknown words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"M-M-M-Mr.Whitestone, She-She-She's in your bed..!?\" Kaguya spoke with dumbstruck voice.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"Ms.houraisan, this is not what you think!\" You tried to explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You tried to get up to explain to her on what was going on but eirin, while sleeping, wrapped her arm on your arm, making you not to go see her. You could swear you heard her saying your name and then kaguya sweated little. Your adrenalin rushed as if she was going to kick you out or fire the doctor of eienter or even worse but she just backed off toward the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I, Um....well, I'm going to just ask reisen to help me out with cable.\" Kaguya said, \"See ya!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Wai-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Before you could even finish your word kaguya left the scene. You were slightly paranoid as if she would spread this event to the eientei, and probably to the whole other people! You wanted to get out but eirin was stopping you from doing so. You struggled but then you sighed, giving up the struggling as you remember what Ms.Prowler speaking about her working tirelessly about others. You layed down on the bed again, leaving the sleeping beauty alone. You looked at her sleeping face, noticing that she was actually more cuter when you look her more closely. Her skin was actually nice and her body temperature was in perfect condition. Her lips were moist and good, making you think of perverted mind about her in nakedness. You got embarressed and quickly got the mind off of it.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"What am I thinking? it's eirin, the one who saved me and Annas life!\" You thought for yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You then relaxed, waiting for eirin to wake up. It lasted for at least 5 hour, turning from morning to mid-afternoon. Eirin yawned and woke up,  rubbing her eyes only to see you close to her. She jolted and got off quickly from your bed with embarressement.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"M-Mr.Whitestone, Did I sleep in your bed!?\" Eirin spoke with embaressement.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"Yes you did.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You saw her face turn red and quickly bowed to you, apologizing to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'm so sorry, Mr.Whitestone! I was just very tired and couldn't open my eyes any further!\" Eirin apologized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Don't worry. I didn't mind at all, after all you needed some rest.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Eirin looked at you and bowed lightly again, thanking you and left the scene. You were glad at least she became aware of what happened. You got up from the bed and got out of the room. You were still worried about kaguya as if she would say something about what she saw you two so you got up from the bed and rushed out of the room to go see her until you bumped into someone...</span></div></div>",

It was one hell of a wakeup call for the rest of your body. Your blood was running colder than that overprotective so-called 'Greater Elf's little friend who was staring with shock and awe. Mostly awe. She thought that trick was cool. You thought about Anna tearing this maniac to sparkly pieces when she finds out what just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsk. Sorry. Reflex,\" the Daiyousei didnt sound very apologetic as she lowered her blade and let go of your arm.<br>\r\n\"Can you teach me to do that, Dai-chan?!\" Cirno beamed.<br>\r\n\"Of course not!\" the maniac objected, \"I dont want you learning my secrets! And I'm not done with you, Mr. Whitestone!\" The Daiyousei suddenly stopped you cold before you could resume your trek. You bit your lip and turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want?\" you tried to keep civil despite the fact she's the last person on earth you wanna be civil with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've spent enough time helping out your sister,\" she had the nerve to say 'we' when it was all Peggy, \"we need to hurry back to the Court before our Queen gets restless. Are you coming with us or not?\" Oh right. You still havent decided whether you wanna stay with Aurora or stay here. Thinking about it, staying with the Summer Court would probably be most ideal to evade your current pursuers. On the other hand... well... let's just say you've grown accustomed to certain people running this hospital. Man, you hope D didnt overhear Kaguya freaking out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... still havent decided,\" was your honest answer. And clearly not an answer she wanted to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean you havent decided?!\" the Daiyousei snapped.<br>\r\n\"It means he hasnt figured out if he wants to-\"<br>\r\n\"Quiet, Cirno! Mr. Whitestone, this is an incredibly simple choice to make. Her Highness has just given you a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity of safety and sanctuary under her protection and only an ignorant inbred fool like HER would be dumb enough not to take it!\" Yikes, she just took a crack at her own friend over there!<br>\r\n\"What's 'inbred'?\" Yikes, her friend IS an ignorant fool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ignored Cirno and addressed another major concern, \u201cWhat about Anna? Would she be able to come with me?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d the Daiyousei had the audacity to deny her asylum too, \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" you apologized, \"but I've gotten a bit attached to this place. I need a little time to think about it.\" Another answer she didnt want to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Powler and I have wasted quite a lot of precious time and energy coming here for the sake of your big sister,\" she warned, \"I'll give you no more than 24 hours to make up your mind.\" Just another day's worth of time to decide. \"But remember, you know you cant hide here from the Winter Court forever. Sooner or later, they'll find out youre hanging around this place and they WILL come for you.\" You know that. You know that all too well.<br>\r\n\"Fine, I'll give you my answer then,\" you agree but only because you have no choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As for YOU,\" Daiyousei glared at her oblivious comrade, \"you dont say a word of this to your Queen. Or you will feel my wrath.\"<br>\r\n\"....Can I say 'A word of this' to YOUR queen, then?\" thank the Heavens Cirno was as dumb as a doorstop! Then again, it could be because of the Nephilim. ...You HOPE it's only because of the Nephilim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Stab! Stab! Stab!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GYAAGGH!!

With her\u2026 er\u2026 masseur.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling like you peeked on Kaguya forcing Reisen to act as a cable reception conductor  for too long, you continued your trek. You know you shouldn\u2019t take your time, because SHE wants an answer by tomorrow. At the very least, you\u2019d like to have one last talk with your sister before you decide whether or not you should leave this place on your own and settle down in the Summer Court with the princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, the test results show that youre completely clean,\u201d you overhear Eirin in the other room, \u201cwhatever last remaining particle of that tracker that was still in you is officially wiped out of your system.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, alright,\u201d you overheard your sister respond with uncertainty, \u201cif you say so.\u201d She didn\u2019t sound very confident. Once again, you decide to eavesdrop just cuz it sparked your interest way too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m serious, Ms. Whitestone,\u201d the doc could tell how unconfident she was, \u201cyou don\u2019t have anything to worry about anymore.  \u201cMs. Powler finished scrubbing your insides clean. Whatever that maniac put in you, I guarantee, it\u2019s completely gone. It might take a little while to completely heal, but I\u2019m sure with a nice young body like yours, you\u2019ll be right as rain in no time.\u201d You peeked through the edge of the doorway just in time to see Anna sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk,\u201d she sighed, \u201cthank you doctor. I shoulda known better than to doubt you.\u201d Well, it\u2019s nice to see Anna\u2019s finally feeling better.<br>\r\nBut it seems the two werent done. Anna shifted in her chair a bit and smirked Eirin\u2019s way, \u201cSo\u2026 I heard you and my bro were getting along really well.\u201d<br>\r\nEirin flinched, almost dropping a little beaker she was about to put over a Bunsen burner. \u201cY\u2026yes. Your brother is\u2026 quite an effective masseur.\u201d Her face was getting as red as yours was! \u201cI\u2026 I dont think I\u2019ve met anyone that could treat my aching back as well as him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, he\u2019s really good at it,\u201d Anna was leaning in, still smirking, \u201cbut none of HIS patients ever got the luxury of getting a personal rubdown in their own bedroom like you did!\u201d Oh crap, she knew about that?!<br>\r\nEirin gasped and froze up! \u201cH-How did you\u2026. argh\u2026 Tewi was snooping again, wasn\u2019t she?! Listen, whatever that pervy brat told you, I assure you that-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Anna winked, \u201cI aint upset at all. I\u2019m glad you made my brother happy.\u201d You breathed a sigh of relief, but she was still not done, \u201cso\u2026 care to tell me what you and my bro have been doing alone?\u201d Even your sister took it the wrong way!<br>\r\nEirin sweated as much as you did, \u201cW-well, you see\u2026. W-what happened is\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019mon, it\u2019s ok,\u201d Anna gave another sly wink, \u201cgive me all the juicy details!\u201d  That really made you shudder hearing your SISTER of all people wanting you know about your sex-life (or lack of!).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough you couldnt help but be awful curious yourself about how good ol\u2019 Dr. Yagokoro will tell the story.

The surroundings changed from bamboo forest to somewhere pretty warm. You huffed as all of you walked and within 10 minutes you all reached the destination. It was a modern looking castle that had metallic walls with trees surrounding it. You all went in and went toward the throne room.

Darkened deep reddish rashes surrounded the long thick black charred skin that stretched from the top of her chest all the way down to her belly button. You can still feel the heat and smell the burnt skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... my... god!\" you gasped, \"D...does it hurt?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like a motherfucker,\" Anna answered coolly, \u201cRed Caps had a lot of fun with me that night.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cJesus, the Red Caps did that to you?!\u201d you shuddered to think of that little band of bloodthirsty midgets in bloody hats.<br>\r\nAnna shook her head, \u201cNo, I tried to perform a new escape trick on them\u2026 that involved fire,\u201d she looked down at her burn and sighed, \u201cit worked, but I don\u2019t think I did it right.\u201d No shit she didn\u2019t do it right!

On the plus side, it was a relief to find out she's alright, despite the burn scar of course. But you know the worst isnt over. Le Fey's gonna find out she fled and theyre gonna hunt her down.

You might as well be hiding from half of Nature itself.<br>\r\n\"Ugh...\" you rubbed your head, still aching as badly as ever, \"Reisen was right. I need to rest.\" Hopefully, you'll feel better mentally as well as physically afterwards. You lied back down in your bed and shut your eyes as you attempted to clear your head of negative thoughts. Removing Maeve Le Fey from your head was like trying to remove a facehugger from your flesh before it crams it's embryo down your throat, but slowly and surely, fatigue took over and your fears were temporarily set aside for a moment...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.............<br>\r\n<br>\r\n..................<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...............................*sniff*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Sniff* *Sniff*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Sniiiiiiff*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, who knows how much later,  you hear very close sniffing. It's not enough to wake you entirely, just enough to put you in sort of a half-sleep half-awake paralysis. With one eye barely squinted open, you could make out a purple haired silhouette with bunny ears leaning her head and against your chest and taking sniffs. Wait, is that Reisen? Those red glowing eyes of hers are a dead giveaway. What the heck is she-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Sniff! SnIIIIIFF!* \"Ahhh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, she's enjoying your scent. Flattered, but weirded out. Part of your brain that wasnt still asleep was dumbfounded as she sniffed your neck and arms as well, possibly savoring your scent! Does she usually do this?<br>\r\nCome to think of it, she DID say she was more of a patient than a nurse. Maybe this was one of her... problems she's been dealing with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow would probably be a good time to wake up before it gets too bizarre, but you were honestly a little intrigued by her behavior. You actually felt the urge to just lie there and see where Reisen goes from there. Then again, it might not be a good idea if she has... other issues. Still, it is tempting. Might as well have a little fun before you die.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Or before the Fey makes you beg to die!</span></div></div>",

You immediatly woke up, startling the bunny rabbit and making her get out of the bed and stand on the wall. Reisen was sweating and had her eyes on other way as you were sitting on the bed stairing at her.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"What were you doing reisen!?\" you asked <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I..Ah...I was checking on you!\" Reisen said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You had high doubts about that as she was looking the other way. You slowly got out of the bed to walk toward her until she noticed you getting up and rushed toward you and pushed back to the bed. You felt the pain from the shoulder as reisen immediatly put you under the blanket, you immediatly noticed her eyes becoming more insan looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Don't get ok? I will treat you to the fullest.\" Reisen said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Reisen, what are-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Before you could finish, she put her finger on your lips shushing you. You saw her grinning, revealing her rows of white teeth at you. You clearly noticed she was in complete insanity. She giggled little and then spoke to you with soft word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hush hush, Mr.Whitestone. It's getting late and I will give you comftorable sleep.\" Reisen said, \"And after that, you will having comfy stay days in and out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You were afraid by this and she grabbed your pjs and ripped it off, showing your upper body. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"Reisen, what are you doing?\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You might need a good night and having fun is best way!\" Reisen said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You knew what she would do: to have some...fun time with you! She then slithered her right hand down and touched your theigh. You were beginning to feel disturbed by this bunny girl and once she drooled little, she grinned again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I will now make you feel good!\" Reisen said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"NOO!!\" you shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Before she could even start, a syringe were stabbed on reisens neck. You looked at the entrance and saw both eirin and anna standing. Anna was disturbed by what she saw and eirin sighed as you saw reisen paralyzed by the syringe (some sort of drug injected?). Eirin immediatly came to you and got reisen off of you, then anna rushed toward reisen, grabbed her and slammed on the wall dispite her pain from the burn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What the fuck are you doing with my little brother, you fucking lunatic?\" anna asked. \"Having an early death wish!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I-I-I-I'm so sorry!! My little disorder kicked in and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Before she could finish, anna pulled out her customed magnum and shoved it her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Fuck your disorder, bunny! I should shoot you now!!\" anna shouted in rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You clearly remember anna being very protective to you. When you were in the lefay gang, she beat the shit out of the member who teases you, warning them to not to come close to you. Eirin splited the two apart and turned to anna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ms.Whiterock. I know your angry but please calm down. I don't want your wound to be worsen.\" Eirin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Anna were still in rage but knew what she was talking about. She then turned to you and walked toward you, then stopped infront of you. You could tell her anger was dying down but still annoyed, then touched your cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You alright, little bro? did that piece of shit harmed you?\" Anna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"N-no anna. Everything is ok.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She sighed in relief and got off from you and turned around. She walked pass eirin and looked at reisen and glared at her.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"Do something like this again, bunny. And I'll make sure I'll make rabbit stew out of you.\" Anna said, \"Good night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She went back to her room and eirin turned to your attention. You could tell she was tired and stressed out, then put hand cuffs on reisens wrists while she was slightly feared by the threat by your sis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'll take care of the rest. Sorry for the rude awakening, and good night.\" Eirin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"No problem.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n They  both left and you layed back on the bed, resuming in your sleep. Next morning came and once you got up, you noticed the sun were already up in the sky. You yawned once you stretched, someone knocked the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Come in.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The door opened, and eirin came in with tray of food. It was pancakes, fruit and a glass of milk. You thanked her as you asked eirin where anna was. She replied that anna already left the building, not telling her where she was going. You were worried about anna, but you also knew she was a strong women like your mother who never knew. As you took one bite of the pancake, eirin took clapped her hands and a shorter bunny girl came in with desert eagle and 12 packs of bullets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Anna told me to give you this mr.whitetaker.\" eirin said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n She then nodded to the little bunny girl, she handed to you. You remember that you liked handguns, and you always wanted desert eagle for present. You couldn't believe actually getting one. You then remember about last night, and put the gun on the side table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Say Ms.Eirin..what happened to reisen?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well...for what she did last night, she is punished.\" eirin answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What kind is it?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She answered..</span></div></div>",

Yep, you actually do those cutesy expressions.<br>\r\nDespite your cutesyness, Eirin's face went a little red as she explained, \"It's sort of a special device that ensures maximum restraint for youkai up to a thousand times the strange of the average human being.\"<br>\r\n\"Youkai?\"<br>\r\n\"Long story,\" sadly, the doctor wasnt in the mood to feed THAT part of your curiosity, \"anyways, as the patient is put in the happy chair, we sedate said patient with quite a large amount of sedatives which subdues their unruly outrageous behavior and gives them a sense of euphoria for at least a few hours. Not to worry, Mr. Whitestone. Ms. Udongein Inaba will not be a threat to you nor anyone else for quite a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeez. That was quite a mouthful. Then again, some hospitals could use 'happy chairs' to deal with certain patients that are too outrageous for their own good. If only there were enough happy chairs in the world to fix the Fey!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once again, I am very sorry about my assistant,\" Eirin apologized, \"she's not always this way. She is really very kind, trustworthy, and friendly to most everyone here. P..perhaps she just didnt take as much of her medicine as I specifically told her to. Again.\" Oh, 'again'?<br>\r\n\"It's alright,\" you assure her, \"water under the bridge as far as I'm concerned. Heck, if I wasnt sore, I'd probably say I was flattered she wanted to mount me!\" Why in Masakado's name did you just say that?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, the worst you got from that stupid remark was Dr. Yagokoro rolling her eyes uncomfortably, \"Yeah... well anyways, you dont have to be worried about the others. If any of the other rabbit girls begin to act odd around you, please dont resort to shooting them. Simply tickle them behind the ears. That usually calms them down!\"<br>\r\n\"Rabbit girls?\"<br>\r\n\"Another long story!\" Eirin groaned, \"anyways, you still have some of Reisen's green tea left over in the fridge. If you'd like me to throw it out-\"<br>\r\n\"No, it's fine,\" you tell her, \"I like green tea.\" And even if it was drugged, it'd probably only ease your stress over being a refugee! <br>\r\n\"Ok, if that's what you wish,\" she reluctantly said, \"if you'll excuse me, I'm going to clean your sister's wounds then I'm gonna be doing my rounds. Feel free to use the call button if you need anything.\"<br>\r\n\"Thank you, doctor,\" you thanked her, \"and I cant thank you enough for helping my sister. She's been through quite a bit. Our old boss did not like her... not as much as me, anyway.\" Whether or not Ms. Fey liking you more was a good thing or bad thing would remain a mystery that you had no interesting in solving!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have nothing to worry about anymore, Mr. Whitestone,\" she said with an assuring smile, \"now eat up. Your breakfast is getting cold.\" And with that, your doctor left the room, leaving you all by your lonesome in your somewhat cozy hospital room. Despite not having much of an appetite, you scarfed down your pancakes and drank your milk. Fruit wasnt part of your balanced breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you ate in awkward silence, you cant get what happened last night out of your head. Understandable, but not for the reasons that should be. You honestly believe you dont have that long to live. Youre deemed a traitor to the most historically renown mafia in existence, so you might as well start writing up your will with whatever little time you got. You'll never experience getting married, having children, you wont even get to know 'true love' outside of what those stupid Pixies loved to blab about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps you shouldve let Reisen have her way with you. At least you wouldnt have to die a virgin. Then again, if you got her pregnant, your kid would be the next in line to inherit your former position. Stupid blood contract.<br>\r\nFor all you knew, ogres could be marching toward this hospital right about now. For all you knew, that bunny girl that brought you your gun could be in cahoots with the Bogle brothers. For all you knew, Eirin could probably be on the phone calling up Agent Trips C. Urisk and telling him your exact location. ANYTHING was possible!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon man! Get a grip!\" you tried to assure yourself as you put your gun away in a little drawer, \"she's not friggin God! She aint gonna find you, otherwise she'd have already found you by now! Youre safe. Youre safe. You are safe.\" You kept repeating those words to yourself until your heart rate finally lowered to a normal beat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to take my mind off all this,\" you say to yourself just before conveniently finding the remote for your room tv. Being of the millions of millions of people out there that firmly believe tv is a great escape from reality, you grab the remote and turn on the tv to see...</span></div></div>",

Police theorised that it was the Le Fey gangs who were behind the crime.\" Anchor said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began to have massave headache. You were chased down by the Le Fey and now this! You were glad that both you and anna were not part of that massacre! Then the view changed from the news room to the park where the massacre happened. The news reporter who were aroudn 6'3\" Tall, blond caucasian women with brown eyes stood with good work cloth on and a mike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yes, last night there was a gruesome murder right here at the new york park. 200 people, who wer all mens were brutally murdered and then got there head cut off. The officials and the polices theoriesd that it was the Le Fey gangs who were behind this massacre as they are one of the most deadliest gangs to be known.\" Reporter said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The report continued and you had enough of it, so you turned off the tv. You laid back to get this headache off until a phone rang. You looked around and saw the desk, and once you opened the drawer you saw a cellphone ringing. You wondered how the cellphone came into the place, then you remembered that you had one and you put it away in the dark corner. Once you flipped the phone up, you saw your sisters name on the screen and you got the call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Anna?\" You spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hey bro. wassup?\" Anna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'm fine. I just saw a news saying that new york police found 200 gang mens dead.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n There was an awkword silence for moment and then anna spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I guess Le Fey found way to kill off one of the minor american gang wannabee.\" Anna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You had reoccurence that if anybody, major gangs or minor gangs, pisses her off there would be a hell to pay for them. Heck, last year one of the gang leader dared to threat the Le Fey leader, only to realised they signed their own death wish as 24 hours later their whole gang were annihilated. You sighed and spoke to your sis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Say sis, where are you right now?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"It's highly confidential, so I can't really say.\" Anna replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Why?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Who knows if this phone call is bugged or not. Besides I don't think-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 'RAAWWRR!! I'M GONNA EAT YOU!!!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You heard an young girl voice. you wondered who this girl were then you heard your sis speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 'Not now, Lady flandre, I'm furrently busy speaking to my younger brother.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 'Oh come on, Anna! your very entertaining!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 'I will play with you more after this phone call, so please wait just for minute.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 'Muuu..fine.

You forgot to take your vagina pills again!\"<br>\r\nKaguya suddenly jumped from hearing the rather young high-pitched voice of the small kid-sized blacked haired girl in a pink dress with a little carrot tied around her neck and dare I say it, bunny ears. Of course, bunny ears. That appears to be the major theme with the majority of the girls here, doesnt it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that wasnt as much of an issue as what's currently going on. Kaguya glared at the twerp in anger.<br>\r\n\"TEWI!!\" she shouted, \"what do I always tell about MY patient confidentiality?!\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, that you dont want other people to know about your vagina problems?\" Tewi answered in such a carefree tone, \"dont worry, I never tell anybody about those bad bugs in your cooch!\" Holy shnikeyz! Kaguya's blood was boiling! Not that you could blame her. You probably shouldnt be hearing this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHY YOU LITTLE TROLL!\" she was clenching her fists at the bunny kid, \"after all that money MY father puts into this place, THIS is how you show your respect?!\"<br>\r\n\"Whoa whoa whoa, take it easy!\" you try to cool her down, \"she's just a kid, you know how they get.\"<br>\r\n\"Tewi Inaba is not a kid,\" Kaguya angrily stated, \"she's an even older hag than Eirin!\" Your eyes narrowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, watch your mouth, brat,\" Tewi put her hands to her hips and pouted in a cutesy expression, \"I used to be the one that changed her diapers back when you were a little crybaby with no bowel control!\" Man, Tewi was merciless. Anyways, if what Kaguya was saying is true, that's awfully impressive how someone like her managed to stay looking young for so long. Then again, youre pretty sure a LOT of your former co-workers were a lot older than they looked. specifically, boss lady!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you tried to cool down Kaguya's urge to commit child(like) abuse, Tewi turned her attention to you.<br>\r\n\"Oh! You must be Alexander Whitestone,\" she had already known your name, \"the new guy Reisen tried to ka-boink last night!\" Your eyes narrowed again. That did not sound right coming from a kid(?)! \"Sorry about her. She likes to skip on her meds every once in a while.\"<br>\r\n\"Er... no... problem?\" it didnt take long to make the conversation uncomfortable.<br>\r\n\"Anyways, I'm Tewi Inaba,\" she introduced herself, \"I'm the head of the rabbit youkai here in Eientei, not to mention the oldest and most adorable employee here!\" She gave a cutesy smile to match. You didnt take notice, cuz the words 'Rabbit Youkai' were making you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you, Tewi,\" you humbly greeted her.<br>\r\n\"Not nearly as nice as it is to meet YOU,\" Tewi gave what you really REALLY hoped wasnt a pervy smirk, \" 's about time we finally get a strapping male around here. This place is a real taco fest!\" Kaguya face's wet red and she facepalmed.<br>\r\n\"Heheh...\" you laughed nervously, trying to keep a straight face. Unfortunately, the loli-bait still kept talking!<br>\r\n\"Seriously, there is nothing but girls in this hospital,\" she explained, \"the vast majority of my species are female and our male birth rate is extremely low, so we're slowly and surely becoming endangered.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's terrible.\"<br>\r\n\"Yep,\" then Tewi's pervy smirk came back on her face, \"so ya better brace yourself when word gets out to the other girls that we got a guy here!\u201d Here\u2019s hoping tickles behind the ears are their bunny-kryptonite!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWill you PLEASE leave already, you annoying loud-mouthed munchkin?!\u201d Kaguya was getting incredibly sick of her. Cant blame her.<br>\r\nTewi rolled her eyes, \u201cAlright alright, Princess Crab-panties. I just came here to give you your special pill of the day.\u201d She handed Kaguya a pill and a glass of watch which she reluctantly swallowed.  \u201cNow if you\u2019ll excuse me, I gotta go switch Eirin\u2019s birth control pills with Sweet Tarts again. Welcome to the family, Alex!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cTh\u2026 thank you,\u201d you nervously thanked her as she walked off, leaving you with a disgruntled Kaguya having a hard time properly venting her rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be ashamed,\u201d you try to comfort her, \u201cmy mom had a\u2026 disease of her own.

Besides, according to that news report, it seems they\u2019d rather be busy devouring other phony gangs and criminal syndicates than hunt you down to your last breath! If they were still interested, the news report would involve your friends and family being shook up by those bastards instead of street scum!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpeaking of which, there\u2019s still a bit of free time before lunch,\u201d Kaguya hopped up off your bed, \u201cwould you care to join me in one of my favorite past times of anonymity?

You wondered if your account were deleated, so you decided to play the game. You told her you would play and she understood, and she clapped her hands and one of the rabbit came in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Bring us two laptops ok?\" Kaguya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"yes, princess.\" Rabbit spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She left the room and 7 minutes later she came back with two laptops and gave it to kaguya. Once she left, kaguya helped set up the laptop for you and she booted the WoW up. As she handed the laptop to you, you saw the screen that needed password. You typed in your password to see if your account is still active. Few seconds later, the game loaded with your character in level 50 with good weapons and armor! You wondered why your character leveled up and had good items, then remembered one thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Anna..\" You mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Did you say something?\" Kaguya asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Um..no. Anyway, what's your class?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Mine level 80 mage.\" Kaguya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You were surprised to hear that.  You have heard that there were people out there that go beyond the game by not going out for many weeks just to play WoW. You then told her about your character and then you two started to play the game<br>\r\n<br>\r\n -Unknown mansion-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n At the far area on the opposite direction of eientei stood a red mansion. Inside the mansion, two people walking through the hallway. One..was anna with her maid outfit. Other were a tall man with short black hair, tanned skin and a butlers cloth. He was annas friend, and she always called him arnold as he had some resemblence to arnold schwarzenegger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I cant believe your still alive, anna.\" Arnold said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Heh, I'm too tough to kill arnold.\" Anna replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I told you, I'm not arnold..\" Arnold replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n They then stopped and went into the room. The room were throne room, and they both knelt before the girl who were sitting on the chair. It was a blue haird girl with pink dress and hat, and it had a bat wing on her back while the maid with grey hair stood next to her. She was remilia scarlet, the vampire who rules the mansion and the maid was Izayoi Sakuya, her personal maid. Arnold were found here first and was placed as employee butler, and when he scouted anna she became the personal maid for remilias younger sister Flandre Scarlet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"How is Flan? is she doing well?\" Remilia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"She is growing interest in me, lady scarlet.\" Anna replied.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"Hm...and how about meiling?\" remilia asked arnold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"She is still kinda uptight with me, but we get along.\" Arnold replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She made 'hmph' noise and then told sakuya to make some tea for the two. She understood and once she left, remilia ordered the two to stand up. Once they did, remilia stood up and came to the two with smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I know you two are in troubled time...hell, even annas brother is hiding in that bamboo forest.\" Remilia said, \"Fear not, as I and the rest of the scarlet mansion members will keep you two safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Thank you, lady scarlet.\" anna replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Good...well then...umm..anna?\" Remilia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Anna looked at her and noticed her blushing. Anna just smild and spreaded her arms, knowing what would come next. Remilia smiled and then jumped onto anna and clutched on her tight. Dispite the pain, anna endured it so remilia could have some time with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Uu~, this IS fun!\" Remilia said, \"But are you ok? I know your hurt with that burn..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Don't worry, lady scarlet. I just need an hour of hydrotherapy, thats all.\" Anna replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ehehe..\" Remilia replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Just then, both sakuya and the girl with a blond hair and red dress came in. It was flandre, remilias sister, were getting jealous that remilia were hugging on her. She rushed toward her and hugged her from the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Your not taking my anna oneesama!\" Flandre said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"She's for everyone flan!\" Remilia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n They both argued and sakuya came next to arnold with smile. She gave one cup to him and poured some tea to him, and he thanked back to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You have fun time, do you?\" Arnold said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"It's always a fun day.\" Sakuya replied, \"By the way, lady patchoulie needs your attention.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Understood.\" Arnold replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He took few sips of tea and gave the cup to her and went while anna kept busy with the twin sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n -eientei-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n At eientei, both you and kaguya were in one of the dungeon mission that had one of the powerful weapon. Your character continued to beat the enemy down while kaguya supported your character with the powerful offensive magic. It was surprisingly great and once you two defeated the boss, you two got the good amount of money and the weapon, giving you two the high five.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"That was awsome!\" kaguya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"IT was. You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Lets now go to the next mission!\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You nodded and was about to do the next mission until...</span></div></div>",

Kaguya sighed as she logged off the game and as you did the same, you two put the computer down. Kaguya then turned to eirin with some smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Did you had fun princess?\" Eirin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh yes, he is fun person to be around.\" Kaguya replied, \"By the way, what are we having for lunch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Eirin opened the tray and showed both you and kaguya an omlette stuffed with rice. You remember eating this once or twice when you were with the Le Fay gang as anna liked it. Kaguya were happy and eirin told her the table were ready and kaguya nodded then turned to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Lets play more warcraft after lunch, ok?\" Kaguya spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Princess..he's one of the patient. I don't think-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I don't mind eirin.\" You interrupted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She sighed and told you she and the rest of eienteis crew will have lunch and she'll return within hour. You understood and she told you if you needed something, just call out. You nodded and the two ladies left the patients room. You rested little and looked at the food, not having enough appetite, you would save it for later then lay down on the bed to get some rest until you heard someones stomach growling. You looked at the window and saw a brown haired girl with red/white cloth, green hat and a cat ears and tails. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Umm..are you alright?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She didn't say anything, but just stairing. You wondered what she was staring then you traced her eyes toward your food. You clearly understands now that this girl was hungry as you noticed her drool was coming out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"..Do you want it?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"A..are you sure?\" Girl asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hey, I'm offering.\" you answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She then came in through the window and came to your area. You helped her get onto the bed and lowered the table to her side. She thanked you and started to eat the food. You noticed she was enjoying the food, and you wondered who this girl were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Um..who are you?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The cat girl swallows the food she was chewing and drank some water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'm chen. Nice to meet you.\" She replied with smile, \"And what's yours?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'm Alex.\" You answered with smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Heehee, cool name.\" Chen replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You blushed little by her smile and then she continued to munch on the food. After 20 minutes, she finished the food and petted her stomach. You were glad at least seeing other eating something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Say um..chen? why are you here?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I was told by tewi chan that a new patient were here.\" Chen replied, \"So I wanted to meet this new patient. Are you the one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You nodded and then she she smiled. She came close to you and then once she stopped, she spoke to you with little blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Um..alex? I have a favor to ask..\" chen asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"and that is?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She then put her cap down, revealing her full head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Would you please..pet my head?\" Chen asked.</span></div></div>",

The more stress relief, the better! So without even a second thought, you rubbed your hand across Chen's head!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChen actually shivered with glee from the touch. She constantly nuzzled her head against your hand as you stroked her hair. You could seriously hear her purring from your affection!<br>\r\nAlso like a cat, she tensed up with you scratched her behind the ears. Both her tails wagged with ecstasy as she practically lost herself in your pettings.<br>\r\nDespite keeping a straight face, inside you were going \u201cDAWWWWWW!\u2019 like you were petting a real adorable cute kitten. Heck, she was adorable, you actually picked her up and held her in your arms as you pet her! She not only purred like a kitten, she squeaned like a little girl!<br>\r\nYou remembered last minute about the pain in your back, only to realize the pain wasnt happening. You feel just fine!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk maybe you got a little carried away. But it was probably cuz you never had pets.<br>\r\nSadly you never had a pet, mainly cuz your dad had this bizarre believe that most pets had connections with members of the Fey that could communicate with them. Hell, he kept bug repellant all over the place cuz he thought the Fey trained BUGS to spy on their lackies!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShame. You honestly wanted a cat. You weren\u2019t a dog type. You preferred cats cuz they were typically laid back, calming, easy-going, and despite being a little hyperactive once in a while, were very patient. A type of pet you could get used to.<br>\r\nAnd so far, Chen was the closest you had to that kind of pet\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t until Chen suddenly flinched and almost scratched you by accident that you realized the third person in the room. The bunny girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red-eyed bunny girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red-eyed bunny girl that tried to mount you last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nREISEN! Already out of the Happy Chair, eh?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you tried your best to keep your poker-fest going, Chen was not as strong-willed. You could feel her trembling under Reisen\u2019s glowing red-eyed stare. Although Reisen\u2019s barely surprised stare didn\u2019t seem threatening to you, it seemed to spook Chen pretty good. Then again, it\u2019s probably cuz she\u2019s already used to the kind of \u2018patient\u2019 this bunny-girl is!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-H-H-Hi, Ms. Udongein Inaba!\u201d Chen quickly hopped off you and bowed.<br>\r\n\u201cHi Chen,\u201d Reisen nonchalantly greeted her, \u201cI see you met our new patient, Alex.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cY-y-y-yes! That\u2019s right! Met! Just met! That\u2018s all!\u201d Chen for some reason emphasized, \u201ca-and now that I\u2019m done meeting Alex, I\u2019d better go catch up to Tewi! Nice meeting you, Alex!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNice meeting you too, Chen!\u201d you said as she made a dash out of the room. And then it was just you and Reisen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know you shouldn\u2019t be thrilled to see her since what happened last night, yet you dont feel you should call up Eirin yet. Keep your guard up, but dont assume the worst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Reisen,\u201d you say as you inch toward the drawer with your gun in it.<br>\r\n\u201cHi Alex,\u201d she lowered her head and put her hands behind her back. Even her ears dropped to match her slightly embarrassed expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see youre out of the Happy Chair,\u201d you commented.<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d she said uncomfortably as she tapped the collar around her neck, \u201cwith a little\u2026 parting gift.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNice collar,\u201d you compliment.<br>\r\nShe kept her head low as she corrected you, \u201cNice\u2026 SHOCK collar.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe you in your mind let out a gasp as you continued looking unphased. She just said she\u2019s wearing a shock collar. Not exactly something HUMANS are meant to be wearing (then again, she aint human, so maybe YOUR standards don\u2019t apply to her!)<br>\r\n\u201cSh\u2026shock collar?\u201d<br>\r\nReisen nodded, \u201cMaster ordered me to wear it for the rest of the day. She says if I so much as touch you, I\u2019ll get electrocuted.\u201d WOW.<br>\r\n\u201cYikes!\u201d that shattered your unphased fa\u00e7ade like a brick through your window, \u201cthat\u2019s a bit harsh!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaster knows best,\u201d the ill bunny girl admitted, before finally unloading, \u201cMr. Whitestone! I\u2019m very VERY sorry about what I did last night! I don\u2019t know what came over me, but what I did was inexcusable. I couldve hurt you or worse! Please forgive me, Mr. Whitestone. Y-Your sister isn\u2019t still here, is she?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, she\u2019s currently at a friend of hers,\u201d you answered, \u201cand dont worry. It\u2019s alright, I\u2019m fine. I know, uh, accidents happen.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat wasnt an accident,\u201d Reisen said with shame, \u201cthat was my failure to quell my own illness. But you have my word! I\u2019m gonna work twice as hard to fix up! I\u2019ll double or triple my prescription intake if I have to! I\u2019ll do whatever it takes to make sure you dont see that horrible side of me again! I\u2019ll also do whatever to takes to make sure you don\u2019t see my Nightmare Mode either.-EEP!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, she twitched in shock like she just blurted something she absolutely shouldnt have!<br>\r\n\u201cNightmare Mode?\u201d unfortunately for her, your ears were burning.<br>\r\n\u201cN-no, no! It\u2019s.. nothing!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s a Nightmare Mode?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 not really anything you have to worry about,\u201d she was an abysmal liar, \u201cit\u2019s just a tiny little iddy biddy unnoticeable phase I tend to go through every once in a full red moon.\u201d That vague revelation only wanted you to know about it more. Not that you were quick to question her about it, though. Reisen was feeling miserable enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyways, you dont need to be too upset about last night,\" you assure her, \"had I not been wounded, I'd have been flattered that you were interested in me. It's not everyday I get glomped by a cute nurse!\"<br>\r\n\"I'm... not really a nurse,\" Reisen said despite her cheeks were flush, \"um, speaking of, I noticed you were able to carry Chen in your arms with no problems. Does that mean youre not hurting so much anymore?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm not hurting at all!\" you rotated your shoulders and stretched out to prove your point, \"there's no ache or soreness or anything! And I havent taken any painkillers at all since I first woke up in his hospital!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! Great!\" Reisen beamed, \"in that case, there's still a bit of free time before dinner. If you'd like I could take you on a tour of Eientei! Since you'll be here for a while, you could use a decent guide to show you around.\" She was just about to take your hand but flinched back only centimeters away from coming in contact! (just barely sparing the electrocution!) \"Err... if that's alright with you!\"</span></div></div>",

She felt the shock from the shock collar, but she endured it and helped you get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Th-thanks, reisen.\" You thanked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n *cough* no problem, alex.\" Reisen replied, coughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Both you and reisen got to the stance and went out of the room to let you get know more about the area. Luckly for you, reisen showed you nearly everywhere that she could show. You seen rooms from patients room, kitchen, living room and so forth. You were getting to know more about this place until you heard someones voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Die, you fucking princess!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Bite me, asshole!!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n You obviously knew one of the voice belonged to kaguya, but you didn't know the other voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh, ms.mokou is here again..\" Reisen said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Mokou?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"She's princess's rival for while.\" Reisen answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You were becoming intrigued by this and went out to see what was going on. Reisen told you not to but since you didn't, she followed you for the protection purpose. Onec you got outside, you saw many colorful bullets spraying through the air and on ground. You looked up and saw kaguya floating firing against a long white haired girl with red pats and white shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"This time, I'll beat you to death!!!\" White haired girl shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ha! We both can't die so you're making yourself stupid mokou!!\" Kaguya shouted.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"GRRR!! YOU DAMN SNOB!\" mokou shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n They both gotten ready to attack and many bullets were sprayed more. Many bullets flew toward you, and luckly knew how to dodge them. Reisen wanted to help but if she touch you, she'll be shocked again. As you dodged more, the bullet stopped and the two girls were panting little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Give up, mokou. You know you'll lose.\" Kaguya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Never.\" Mokou replied, \"Lets end this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n They got their spellcard and attacked both. You knew something was wrong so you dashed toward the entrance until the fire that came from mokou and the rainbow bullet from kaguya shot both of your legs. You screamed in pain as you fell, you immediatly put the fire out with the bucket full of water that happened to be next to the entrance. Both girls noticed your scream and immediatly stopped the fighting. Reisen immediatly went in to get eirin to help you out. You felt pain from this and both girls came to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh no, oh no!!! I'm so sorry!!\" KAguya said, then turned to mokou \"If you didn't shot that fire, he'll would have been fine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"me!? you shot that rainbow bullet!\" Mokou replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  You really getting annoyed by this argument and then reisen came out with eirin. She saw the burn mark and she immediatly picked you up then turned to kaguya and mokou.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I shall talk to you two later.\" Eirin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She then took you in and went into the emergency room. She immedialty took out the pain killer and injected it on your leg. Once done, she took out some sort of bowl filled with green goo in it. She quickly got brush and put the goo on the wounded area. You felt no pain but you felt tired and went to sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n How long you passed out?</span></div></div>",

She was holding her hands on her neck and knelt down with heavy breathing as if she couldnt' breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Reisen!? are you alright!?\" Eirin spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Gu..Gaa..GAA!?!?\" reisen gagged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You felt an sudden fear in your heart as eirin tried to calm the crazy rabbit, she then screamed high making eirin jump back. You jumped little as well, and 5 seconds later reisen stood up with her red eyes glowing. Your fear grew more then she clutched the shock collar and broke it easly. Eirin and you were shocked by this and reisen staired at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Nice seeing you again...little shit.\" Reisen spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Rei..sen?\" eirin spoke softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You quickly realised what happened: Le Fay used her power to communicate using a host! You don't know how she managed to use reisen but you showed no fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ms..Le Fay.\" You spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ha! I knew you ran off to somewhere more...obsecure area.\" Le Fay spoke, \"I'm so glad your still alive...so I could slowly kill you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You feared she would say such quote, then she spoke up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hehe..but don't you worry now, little shit. I have some business taking care in this world.\" Le Fay spoke, \"After I eradicate the rest of the petty gangs, I will enjoy killing you first while letting your tough sis anna see your Torture.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You..you knew she's alive!?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Le Fay continued to smile and quickly got on top of you, putting her hand on your throat as eirin summoned her arrow and pointed at Le Fay. She continued to smile and then spoke to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Have you not forgot that once your in my family, the blood of the kins have special power.\" Le Fay said, \"That includes cheating death...Longer life, and so forth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You gulped, and she got off from you. She snickerd and then turned her attention to eirin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"And as for you...since I have borrowed your little bunny girl, I shall curse her blood with my...blessing.\" Le Fay said, \"Until then...take care of this traitor until I meet again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She closed her eyes and left the scene. Eirin put the bow away and then once reisen opened her eyes, she breathed fast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"M-master eirin! alex! Are you two alright!?\" Reisen asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I think that's our question reisen.\" Eirin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Reisen gotten depressed little and then touched her neck. She quickly realised that her shock collar was gone and once she looked down, the collar were there broken. She was happy but depressed as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"*sigh* I can't believe something like happen.\" Eirin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I know.\" You replied, \"I'm more shocked to hear that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n You then remembered that le fay was talking about your big sis. You wanted to call her in case if she was ok, but you feared that le fay would be there in no time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Would you call your sis?</span></div></div>",

Besides, there's no one else you can tell at this point. The authorities cant help. Your dad was IN the authorities and they couldnt save him!<br>\r\nYou pulled your cellphone out of the drawer and called up your sis, hoping they didnt bug the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer phone rang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it rang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it rang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, Anna! Pick up!\" you whispered with your fingers crossed. But it rang. \"Damn it, Anna! Pick up your fucking phone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HELLO. NO ONE IS AVAILABLE TO TAKE YOUR CALL.\" You groaned at the sound of her pre-set automated answering machine. She didnt even have the common courtesy to record her own voice. \"PLEASE LEAVE A MESSAGE AFTER THE TONE.\" *Beep!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anna, it's me!\" you have no choice but to leave a message, \"you need to call me back ASAP! Maeve knows I'm here! And she knows youre still alive! Hurry Anna!\" And you hang up, hoping she'll get the message... and that you werent too late.<br>\r\nYoure pretty sure youre not too late. She's a damn good survivor. And even if you are too late, Maeve aint gonna hurt Anna. She said she'd rather make her watch you die.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooks like you got no choice but worry about yourself at the moment. As well as those around you. Reisen\u2019s now vulnerable thanks to you. Question is, HOW did she end up vulnerable?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReisen?\u201d you turn to the ill bunny girl, \u201cdid you talk to anybody recently?\u201d<br>\r\nReisen tilted her head question as her ears curled, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou somehow miraculously managed to impersonate my old ex-employer,\u201d you told her, \u201cthat couldnt have happened out of sheer random! How do you know Ms. Le Fey?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMs La\u2026 who?\u201d she raised her eyebrow at you, \u201cwhat impersonation? What are you talking about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you even remember what just happened between now and when you started choking?\u201d Eirin asked.<br>\r\nReisen shook her head, \u201cI remember feeling like the collar got a hundred times tighter\u2026 that\u2019s all.\u201d Well this is a problem. She doesn\u2019t even remember the sudden possession nor does your boss\u2019s name ring a bell to her. You had to come up with possible ways for the Fey to get in contact with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEirin, was Reisen seriously restrained in the happy chair the whole time?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\nShe nodded with certainty, \u201cAbsolutely. Like I said before, there\u2019s no way she could\u2019ve broken out.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWas anybody else in there with her during that time?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe a fellow nurse or two,\u201d she said, \u201cbut we have cameras. And I\u2018m always watching the cameras. ALWAYS.\u201d That sounded a little creepy. But anyways, that weeds out one possibility. If she hasn\u2019t come in contact with Le Fey, perhaps she\u2019s been drugged? That so-called \u2018fairy dust\u2019 she sells to the cartels is known to  provide a hell of a buzz\u2026 almost close to possession.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about the medicine you used on her?\u201d you asked the doc, \u201chave you changed any of it recently?\u201d<br>\r\nEirin shook her name, \u201cNope. We make the medicine ourselves and we\u2019ve been buying our herbs and medicinal components from the same suppliers for years.\u201d But then Eirin lifted her chin and made a thinking pose, \u201cYou know\u2026 come to think of it, there was a delay in our shipment of menthol leaves last week and the supplier never said why.\u201d Red flag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is just a suggestion and you dont have to take it,\u201d you say, remembering your place before you suggest, \u201cbut I would recommend asking your supplier more about the delay. If they seem shady or suspicious, just tell them your kids could use some more \u2018pixie stix\u2019.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t have ki-\u201d her eyes widened as she got your hidden meaning, \u201coh. Oh! OHHH! Oh dear! TEWI!!\u201d she suddenly shouted, \u201cSTART WHIPPING UP AS MANY DETOX DRINKS AS YOU CAN! I NEED TO MAKE AN IMPORTANT CALL!\u201d And with that, the doc dashed out of the room faster than an electronic rabbit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, you find yourself alone with Reisen, who seemed to be poking you then flinching back, probably scared she was gonna get another shock despite the collar being destroyed.<br>\r\nYou'd ask her to stop it, but you noticed a look of panic on her face.<br>\r\n\"What's happening to me?\" Reisen questioned, \"what's gonna happen to me? Did I just get poisoned? Am I gonna die?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Youre gonna be fine, Reisen,\" you assure her though deep down you were unsure, \"it's no big deal.\"<br>\r\n\"No big deal? No big deal?! I was suffocating!!\" she suddenly snapped, \"I honestly couldnt breath and the next thing I know, you all act like I was possessed or something! Am I possessed? Am I gonna die?!\" She had every right to panic. The Fey not only have tabs on her but are now using her against her will and doesnt completely realize it yet. Youre not sure if they'll end up hurting her, but you do believe as long as youre still alive and a-ok, they cant afford to hurt her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon! Please stop looking at me in silence like that!\" Reisen got a bit paranoid, \"if you know something, please tell me! What has just happened to me?!\"<br>\r\nShe wanted answers. But you dont know how she'll take the truth that Maeve had cursed her and you got no idea what it'll do to her! If you had to guess, youre sure she'll flip out. And considering she's already ill to begin with, bad things could come from it.<br>\r\nBut if you keep quiet about it or lie to her, who knows what kinds of damage Maeve's curse will do to her. Even if Maeve doesnt want Reisen to die, you can bet she could think of other ways to 'mess' with her physically and mentally. And you knew some of the ways the Fey messed with their prey physically and mentally, many you wouldnt wish on your worst enemies!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould you lie to her or come clean and tell her she's cursed?</span></div></div>",

You were glad that she was calming down then gotten ready to tell her what is going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Listen Reisen. My ex-boss, Maeve LeFay, is well known Female criminal boss in my world. She uses her power to curse anyone who became one of her gang so they could never leave.\" You explained. \"Me and my sister have a cursed blood that passed down by my father. LeFays curse are eternal, and some says her curse is both blessing and evil at the same time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Wha...is that true?\" Reisen asked, shaking in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Unfortunatly, yes.\" You replied, \"Once she cursed victims blood, it will never go away.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n This made reisen more paranoid and she shook more. She then gazed at you for moment and suddenly she felt her heart skip and opened her eyes wide. In her vision, she saw half of your body covered in blood and half of you face as skull. Her fear grew, then she then screamed in high pitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"IYAAAAAA!!!\" Reisen screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She got up and pointed her finger at you. You realised the curse started and she summoned the bullet at you, trying to kill you. You were in fear as you couldn't move by the wound, you prayed for god that she wouldn't shoot until someone jumped behind reisen and smacked her neck, causing her to fall down unconciously. The person revealed itself to be chen and she came to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Are you alright, Mr.whitestone?\" Chen asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yes, thanks chen.\" you replied, \"Wheres tewi and others?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"They are under the treatment that eirin told to give.\" Chen replied, \"What happened here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You didn't want to tell her what was going on, so you just told her she passed out. Moment later few bunnys came in and saw reisen on floor, and took her to her own bed room. Chen then told you she have to go home to tell her owners what happened. As she left, you lied down to get some rest and then closed your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n -office-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Eirin finished giving out the last detox medicen to the rabbits and she took some pills to calm herself. As she was going to write the report, she heard some sort of voice. She turned around only to see nobody, and when she turned back she heared again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Tewi! stop whispering!!\" Eirin shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n There were no voice, and eirin wondered why there were no voice. She leaned foreward and looked at the mirror and saw a tall women with long grey hair in kimono standing at the door. She turned around but no one was there, making eirin agitated little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What..who was that?\" eirin spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Then suddenly..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 'Curse will spread through blood, and nothing can stop my curse.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Eirin shivered and turned back to see the mirror only to find out the figure was gone. She wondered if she left until the same women were next to her, softly touching eirins back, making her shiver in coldness. The tall female giggled and spoke to eirin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 'I will send mad hatter...to make the insanity uproar..'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The female vision then faded away, making eirin breathed harder. She wonderd who that person were and what she ment by 'mad hatter'? she then ordered three rabbits to retreave the teacher in the human village to discuss about this..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Meanwhile...</span></div></div>",

How did you know?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWell I just saw her pointy ears just now...and I just wondered.\u201d Eirin replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWell She is a fairy. I knew her since my childhood. I mean, when I started going to school she always beatened up the bullies by using poisonous plants against them or used fire magic to interrogate anyone who tries to harm me.\u201d You explained, \u201cI think it\u2019s overprotective but I do respect her as my sis.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She understood and both you and Eirin was about to go in until you two heared an insanely laughing noise. You turned around and saw an middle aged man with a hat that had a card that wrote \u201cin this style 10/6\u201d and had formal British clothes and a walking canes on. Eirin didn\u2019t know who he was but you knew who he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWell, Well. If isn\u2019t it the little March hare to Maeve herself.\u201d He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWhat the hell do you want, mad hatter!?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Eirin asked you who he was. Mad hatter, supposed fictional character from Alice, somesome materialized by the power of Maeve\u2019s power. He was truly mad as he always had the tendency to have tea party with guests, but end up in blood bath since he brings the guests to le fay herself for not being tortured in the fictional world. Mad hatter just laughed and put off his hat and greeted Eirin with some respect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cHow do you do lady? I am just your average hatter, that\u2019s all.\u201d Mad hatter said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cYou\u2019re never normal, you\u2019re completely mad!\u201d You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cHaha, I know. Anyway, I came here to take that rabbit of yours, lady.\u201d Mad hatter spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Eirin felt disturbing vibe from his grin and gotten ready to fight by summoning an arrow and bow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cIf you are talking about Udongein, then you\u2019re at dead end. I will not let you pass.\u201d Eirin said, \u201cmr.whiterock, please go in so I could fight him.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cBut-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cGo!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n With that word you nodded and went into the building as you hear the hatter laughing insanely. You rushed toward the living room and saw Reisen talking with Tewi and you got to her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cAlex-sama? What\u2019s going on?\u201d Reisen asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cListen, one of my former employer sent one of her member to kidnap you. I\u2019m here to see if your ok.\u201d You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n This freightened the bunny and her haunting memory came back. She breathed heavy as you could guess that she was afraid. Both you and Tewi came to her to calm her down as she was truly scared, she could hear the mad batters insane laughter from afar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cNo..I..I...i don\u2019t want to be alone.\u201d Reisen said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cYour not alone udon-Chan. Here here.\u201d Tewi spoke in soft word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWe must find a way to hide you.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You two then got Reisen and looked for somewhere to hide. You looked and looked but it was no where until you realize you could hide her in the closet in your room. You took her to your room and hid her under the closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cDon\u2019t do anything until dr.yagokoro finish fending him off.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cAlright.\u201d Reisen said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You then closed the door and told Tewi she will guard the front in case mad hatter comes in. She nodded and went out for a lookout and you guarded the door. Outside the building, Eirin shot many arrows but the hatter just dodged her attack. He smiled and spoke to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cHey lady, why does a raven likes the writing desk?\u201d Mad hatter asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWhat in the world are you talking about? How should I know?\u201d Eirin answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He then came before her with a cup full of tea mixed with mercury in it and forced her to drink it. She felt the pain and knelt as he laughed, he looked down at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI have no clue as well! Now then...\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n He came into the building and saw few bunny defending the area but the hatter splattered some tea from tea pot, making it spread and slippery to the bunnies. As he advances, he meets Tewi with a mallet ready for a fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cYou have to go through me first!\u201d Tewi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The hatter..just smiled and fully swung his cane, making hard hit on tee is face, causing her to fly away and he got inside. You saw him with smile and you were afraid but gotten ready to fight,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cNow now, just hand over the bunny girl and I shall stop fighting.\u201d Mad hatter said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of you!\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He sighed and was about to attack until Reisen bursted out of the closet.

You slowly turned and saw Reisen, only to be more taller and muscular then before. Her red eyes were pure red as her teeth were clenched, Mad hatter just laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cHahaa! Is this the lunatic mode I\u2019ve heard before? Impressive!!\u201d Mad hatter spoke in glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cAlex...samaaa..is miiine!!\u201d Reisen roared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She then took step forward and violently thrusts her fist toward mad hatter. He dodged the attack, only to get little skin wound on him. He wiped his blood and looked at it and laughed as you didn\u2019t know what to do now other then shitting your pants. Mad hatter then glees at her as Reisen gotten ready to attack,  Mad hatter got out a coin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI do hope you\u2019ll be enjoying this ms.rabbit.\u201d Mad hatter spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He threw the coin and Reisen punched his stomach, making him fly back and smash through the walls. You could swear you heard him laughing as you saw the coin in the floor, you picked it up and saw a label of le fay on it. You were worried then Reisen roared again and turned her attention to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cAleexx...saaammaa.\u201d Reisen spoke with deep voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cR-Reisen?\u201d You spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You then saw her going to hug you. You showed her the coin and she suddenly felt the pain and roaring in aching voice, then fell to the ground. You saw her returning to normal self and you looked at the coin. You didn\u2019t know why or how the coin made Reisen return to normal but then you remembered her saying about the blood curse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cDammit, why does she do this!?\u201d You spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You then grabbed Reisen to see if she was alright. She then slowly opened her eyes and looked at you and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cAlex sama. I\u2019m glad your ok.\u201d Reisen said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cMe too.\u201d You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You then saw Eirin coming in with blood trickling down her mouth. You asked if she was alright,and she just said said she\u2019ll be alright and looked at Reisen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u201cWe need to...*cough*..measure plan so no danger would come.\u201d Eirin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cYour right. I\u2019m so sorry this happened, it\u2019s my fault.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cDon\u2019t say..that...it\u2019s their fault that they attacked us first.\u201d Eirin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n They then decided to draw a plan later as they are hurt. Meanwhile outside the open field, Mad hatter was on the ground laying. He then slowly got up, giggling while coughing blood. He took his hat and covers himself, warping to an secretive area. He coughs blood and then suddenly he hears the noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cDid you get the specimen I ordered, hm?\u201d Voice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cNope, sorry..hahaha! She was more then..*cough*..meets the eyes.\u201d Mad hatter said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Then the cloaked person came out and came to him. The person touched his body and looked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cYour organs are punctured. You need surgery now.\u201d Person said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cAs you say..doctor, hehehe.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey then left the scene.

The kind of face hinted that they found something out that they didnt like. Like maybe your suspicions were correct.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what happened?\" you cut the small talk and asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I told them exactly what you told me,\" Eirin explained, \"then they seemed to be in denial until I told them my kids could use more pixie sticks-\"<br>\r\n\"Which is ridiculous cuz everyone knows she doesnt have kids,\" Tewi butted in, then whispered way too loud, \"SHE'S BARREN. EEEEGGGGHHH!!!\" Then Tewi started squealing in pain when Eirin began to squeeze one of her bunny ears a bit too hard!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPretending you didnt hear that (although feeling sorry for her!), you questioned, \"Then what happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He gave the phone to someone with a voice I didnt recognize,\" he explained, \"claimed he was his new 'supervisor' and tried to sell me a nutrition supplement called 'Aos S\u00ed Lite'.\" BINGO. Aos S\u00ed Lite. One of Le Fey's more popular 'fairy-dust'-laced drugs they used to sell as a dietary supplement. Guaranteed to lose weight... because it alters the metabolism in far more ways than one.<br>\r\n\"You could probably use some,\" Tewi insisted, \"those thighs of yours are showing off a little celluli-EEGGHH!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's...\" you took a breath, \"a Le Fey tainted product. They definitely got a hold of your supplier, alright.\" Eirin's eyes widened and gritted her teeth as you continued. \"Whatever supplies you bought from them recently, you need to get rid of them. Destroy them.\"<br>\r\n\"D-D-DESTROY THEM?!!\" she was freaking out, \"ALL OF THEM?!\"<br>\r\nYou frowned and nodded, \"All of them. If a patient so much as smells one of Le Fey's drugs, it could taint them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arrrgghh! Good lord, I...I just got through a really bad shortage and money's really tight!\" Eirin began to panic, \"I mean, that supply was EVERYTHING we have left! And I cant afford to just replace it all!\" Yikes! Did you hear that right? The whole hospital could be filled with Fey poison! Looks like Reisen may be the least of your problems. If Maeve is bored, not even Eientei is a safe haven for you anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Told ya we shouldnt have wasted all that cash on breast expansion research,\" you heard Tewi mutter.<br>\r\nEirin was seriously on the verge of tearing out of her hair, \"Ughh... the Emperor's gonna murder me! How am I gonna explain to him I need a loan cuz of a bad deal with the cartel?!\u201d Dang it! You owe her big. As much as you hate, HATE to do this, you have to do what you have to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHang on Eirin,\u201d you speak up, \u201cmy sister\u2019s gonna be coming by later. I can ask her about getting a quick restock of medical supplies She knows people that know people\u2026 that steal from people who steal from people.\u201d  Yep. Anna knows people that steal from hospitals. Imagine the numbers of lives that youre about to doom because of this suggestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEirin nodded, \u201cThank you, Alex. Tewi, you did already give everyone their detox drinks, right?\"<br>\r\nTewi sighed, \"Yeah... but you know a lot of the girls hate the taste! I cant convince everyone to swallow that crap!\"<br>\r\n\"Fine! Just make sure the big-risk ones swallow it down. We can handle a few minor-threat freak-outs. Let\u2018s just pray none of them involve a certain Princess and hated pyro-mancer.\"<br>\r\n\u201cYou want we strap Reisen back to the Happy Chair?\u201d Tewi asked.<br>\r\nEirin sighed, \u201cShe already broke her shock collar. I cant afford to replace another Happy Chair too!\u201d She\u2019s right. It\u2019d probably be useless to try and restrain her if Maeve can break her out of it. But she did say she was too busy with gangs from back home to deal with you. It seems you got time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMs. Le Fey said she wont kill me until she gets rid of a couple of minor-league gangs first,\u201d you explained, \u201cshe doesn\u2019t lie. She cant lie.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat makes you think that?\u201d Tewi said.<br>\r\n\u201cNo, SERIOUSLY,\u201d you continued, \u201cshe\u2019s completely incapable of lying. One of the major laws of the Fey is that theyre forbidden from telling lies. They can twist the truth to deceive others, but they cant flat out lie.\u201d Fortunately, humans are exempt from that law... which is why you were able to lie to Reisen. A terrible lie, but perhaps necessary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA fairy that still sticks to their traditions, eh?\u201d Eirin said, \u201cthat\u2019s both admirable and scary.\u201d She didnt have to remind you. \u201cWell, we\u2019d better double check on Kaguya and Mokou, make sure they havent gone through a similar episode.  As for you, your legs are pretty wounded, so I recommended keeping off your feet for a while. If the hurting stops, youre free to walk around for a little bit. Just make sure to give those legs plenty of rest in between and try to refrain from wandering too far or leaving Eientei.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wont,\u201d you assure her, \u201cand thanks again for saving me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEirin smiled and bowed before ushering her head to her little assistant and then the two headed off. As soon as they left, you eyed your bandaged legs. They were still a bloody mess, but they weren\u2019t hurting. You felt virtually no pain from them. Either the medicine Eirin used is really good or just a really good painkiller. It doesn\u2019t look like it was tainted Le Fey crap though, otherwise you\u2019d probably be hallucinating tiny little people with butterfly wings gnawing at your bloody wounds!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou edged to the end of the bed then slowly and carefully put one foot off the bed and gently placed it on the floor. No pain. You then put your other foot on the floor. Still no pain. So far so good. You then slid out of the bed and stood up on your own two feet. Even after taking a couple of steps, no pain was coursing through. Much like with your arm, you had absolutely no trouble walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, the wounds looked pretty bad. Maybe it\u2019s best to go back in your bed and lie down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026Eh, maybe after a little more walking. You still had some time to kill until Anna comes. <br>\r\nIf you didn\u2019t look at the wounds, you could forget about your injuries as you headed out of your room.<br>\r\nWhere do you plan on heading?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It's really important.\" Reisen turned her head to you with intrigue and panic in her red eyes.<br>\r\n\"Tsk! You kidding?! After last night?!\" Anna obviously wasnt wanting to hear that, \"you cant be serious!\"<br>\r\n\"I am serious,\" you told her, \"it's very important... and very private.\" You looked down at Vivian, \"it's... not something she should be hearing.\" Reisen's face blushed and Anna's eyes squinted with disgust! Ok, maybe you said it wrong, but you prefer to keep it brief and simple!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can I be sure this nutcase wont try to hurt you again?!\" Anna questioned. Ms. Udongein Inaba seemed offended by the 'nutcase' crack, but she kept her cool.<br>\r\n\"I-I wont!\" Reisen told her while constantly shifting her eyes to the window, \"I'm perfectly fine. In fact, I plan on spending the rest of the night locked up in my room after our talk!\"<br>\r\nAnna's eyes locked onto Reisen's. Sadly this bunny girl was not gonna be on good terms with your sis.

Not exactly sure why she was so damn interested in that big smelly hairy short-tempered  Bigfootesque beast, but to each his own, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna gritted her teeth and blew air before leaning down at Reisen and whispered, \"If I catch you even THINKING of doing anything funny with my little brother, I'm gonna use you to teach my little girl about 'Wabbit Season'!\" Reisen, backed into a corner, merely nodded in agreement. \"C'mon, Vivian. Let's go chase the kitty!\"<br>\r\n\"Yay!\" Vivian shouted in excited as the two chased after Chen. As soon as Anna's back was turned, Reisen stuck her tongue out at her as she left!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reisen?\" Her bunny ears stood up on end, spooking her for a split moment before turning around to face you, \"can we talk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I-If this is about g-getting more intimate with me, t-tonight's not a good night!\" she said while blushing and constantly darting her eyes out the window... \"p-perhaps tomorrow!\" On one hand, you got to admire Reisen's boldness, but on the other...<br>\r\n\"No, no, it's not like that,\" you assure her.<br>\r\nHer cheeks stopped blushing, \"...Uh...oh... oh, ok.\" for some reason, she looked a little disappointed, \"...then what is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite feeling bad, you didnt have the guts to confess that she was cursed.

You had to think of some middle-ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wanted to check up on you and make sure youre ok,\" you tell her.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm fine,\" she answered with little concern, \"why?\"<br>\r\n\"I was... just worried is all,\" you tell her, \"are you feeling any different from before the uh, sudden outbreak?\"<br>\r\nShe shook her head, \"Not that I know of.\"<br>\r\n\"Good,\" you say with relief, \"cuz if you are feeling worse, if you worried my boss mighta done something to do, please tell me as soon as you can.\"<br>\r\nReisen tilted her head and raised her eyebrow, \"Why are you telling me this? Should I be worried?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah,\" you shook your head, \"I think she just wanted to scare me that one time just to rattle me up! She loves doing that. But seriously, she's too busy cleaning up street trash at home to concern myself about me, let alone you. She'll probably forget about us long before she finishes her little rival gang vendetta.\" That was another lie. She wont forget about you. The Fey have a very good memory. You smack an elf in the face on their birthday, then 10 years later, he\u2019ll suddenly crash your birthday party and deliver you a smack a hundred times stronger!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... just in case you... see or hear anything funny going on, you can tell me,\" you said to her, \"I'll be happy to listen and help out if I can.\"<br>\r\nFortunately for you, Reisen seemed more grateful for your concern than suspicious of it. Then again, it could be because she was already tensing up to begin with what with the way she cant take her eyes off what's outside. You didnt notice anything of interest outside other than the full moon outside. It had a nice reddish glow to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-thank you, Alex,\" she said, \"I'll make sure to remember that! Now if you'll excuse me-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know...\" you changed the subject before she could, \"we never did get around to finishing that tour.\"<br>\r\n\"Sorry, maybe tomorrow,\" she was incredibly hesitant, \"it's... it's getting really late!\"<br>\r\n\"Well, how about we just gaze at the stars?\" you offered, \"the moon's looking awful bright tonight. Odd... I dont recall it glowing THAT red before!\"<br>\r\nBut Reisen shook her head, \"Not tonight! Tonight, I'm gonna be very VERY busy!\"<br>\r\n\"Oh? You need a hand?\" you offered.<br>\r\n\u201cNo no no no no no!\u201d she was pretty adamant to shoot you down, \u201cI\u2019m just gonna go take a super quick shower and get right to work!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIf you\u2019d like, I can help wash some of your hard to reach places.\u201d somehow that incredibly perverted remark slipped out of your mouth! Reisen\u2019s eyes widened, a hundred times more shocked than you should\u2019ve been! Fortunately, instead of smacking you in the face and running off screaming for help, her face was completely reddened with blush, possibly considering it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cG-G-G-GOOD NIGHT, ALEX!\u201d she immediately ran off! You continued to stare at the bunny girl hauling ass, still refusing to take no for an answer! She was hiding something, you knew it! It probably wasnt your business, but since technically it was HER who made the first move, you had to make it your business!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, maybe it was something TOO personal and that you shouldnt pry into matters that dont involve you. You had enough problems with that while you were working for Maeve!<br>\r\nThen again AGAIN, maybe since your personal involvement with the Fey left her cursed, you should keep a closer eye on Reisen. Even if Ms. Le Fey wont personally involve herself with Reisen\u2019s curse, that doesnt mean she doesn\u2019t have OTHER plans for her! So maybe for Ms. Udongein Inaba\u2019s sake, you SHOULD pry!</span></div></div>",

If Reisen has some personal demons she needs to deal with (and it's flippin obvious she does!), it'd be best to give her some space for the time being. Besides, you've caused that poor ill bunny girl enough trouble already. You only hope Maeve wont be bothered to mess with her as she's already busy enough on her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you hear the sound of the running water and finish fighting off the thoughts of Reisen in the shower and washing her hard to reach spots, you shut your door and then argue with yourself whether or not you'll lock it. As tempting as it was to imagine said bunny girl sneaking in your room was, the risks involve were not worth it. You lock the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet another hell of day down. Only the rest of your life to go. But at least you werent alone. You still had your precious sister... as well as her 'daughter' to keep you company. And let's not forget the inhabitants of this hospital. This should prove to be an interesting stay. Provided Anna doesnt decide to drag you out of there, of course.<br>\r\nRegardless, it's still better than hanging around Le Fey. Way too many psychopaths.<br>\r\nYou shake your head. No, you need to get Le Fey out of your head. You are safe here. Eirin's alert of their influence and Anna has connections that'll keep them away! So relax. Just relax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you hop in your bed and relax. Relax enough to fall asleep. See? That wasnt so tough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later, you hear rustling over at your door. You wanted to get up, but you couldnt budge an inch. You couldnt so much as open your eyes. A sleep paralysis, perhaps.<br>\r\nProblem, because you can hear the knob rattling a bit. Somebody must really wanna get in.<br>\r\nOdd. Why's it so cold all of a sudden?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Kink! Kink! Kink! Crack!*  Uh oh. The knob rattling finally stopped. You could hear the door swing wide open! And unfortunately, youre still too deep in your sleep paralysis to do anything about it other than listen. And listen you did. To the sounds of the stiletto heels tapping against the marble floor as an awfully cold presence approached you.On instinct, your body shivered from the sheer cold of the presence. It was a familiar cold too. It reminded you so much of Winter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello again, little shit...\" your body tensed as you heard the voice of pure sadism whisper in your ear, \"did you miss me? I missed you.\" You shivered as you felt her icy cold hands caress your cheeks. \"You didnt seriously think I couldnt find you, did you? You didnt honestly think there was ANYWHERE in the world you could hide that I wouldnt find you... did you?\" Damnit body, move! MOVE! Why wont you move?! There is evil incarnate right in front of you!! \"Oh, I missed you so much since we last met face to face. I really need to pay you back for that lovely scar you've given me. Oh, the FUN we're gonna have together... it'll be truly Hell on Earth.\" And then you felt those icy cold lips press against yours once more...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026\u2026..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"!!\" you FINALLY managed to woke yourself from the paralysis! But by then, Maeve was nowhere to be seen. Her ice cold aura was completely gone. Just a bad dream? ...Or maybe it's another one of her tricks to mess with you?<br>\r\nEither way, it was a relief to not see that bitch again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zzzz...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr at least it wouldve been if you didnt notice the 2nd guest sleeping in your bed! To your surprise you spotted that purple haired bunny girl fast asleep next to you.<br>\r\nTo an even bigger surprise, Reisen looks rather different than earlier! She's bigger. Quite a bit bigger. She had a bit more of a muscular frame, too. Her suit and dress were torn up, failing to conceal her washboard stomach with sixpack and even weller-endowed bosom somehow sealed in a blue and white striped bra that practically begged to be pulled off out of fear she might suffocate! She musta hulked out in the middle of the night! But how did she get in-oh, the doorknob\u2019s ripped right off the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh! Maybe she\u2019s a were-rabbit! That would explain why she suddenly wanted to lock herself in her room ASAP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis would be the part where you\u2019d be scared shiteless, however, you honestly werent. You seemed awfully comfortable sharing your bed with this beastly side of Reisen. Somehow you\u2019ve been staring awful attentively at her for about 5 minutes and see no interest in taking your eyes off her. Maybe it was a pheromone or something, but something was drawing you to her. This Reisen was just breathtaking! It was taking a little bit of willpower to prevent you from snuggling up to the She-Hulk bunny girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat and the rational part of you that wasn\u2019t still asleep! You still havent forgotten the last time she snuck in your room. She almost hurt you last time cuz of her mental instability. Who\u2019s to say she wont now that  gone grizzly? Bet your ass that Maeve didnt make it any easier! Maybe you should find a safer place to sleep before she wakes up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over at your clock, it was barely 2am. Still way too early and youre very groggy. Youre already here in a nice cozy bed but with a potential dangerous yet potentially huggable bedmate. What should you do?</span></div></div>",

You got up slowly and got out of the room without any creaking noise and walked toward the kitchen. You found the fridge and took out a gallon of milk and took out a glass and poured some. Once you put the gallon away and took few sips, you noticed someone coming into the kitchen. It was vivian and she had half asleep, and noticed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hi, brother whitestone.\" Vivian said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hey.\" you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She asked you to pour some milk for her. You nodded and once you did you gave it to her. She thanked you and started to chug the milk down. You were surprised to see her chug down the milk as if she was a thirsty person who haven't had drink for a whole week. After 30 seconds, she chugged all the cup and breathed out and asked you to put it in the sink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Thank you, brother whitestone.\" Vivian said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"N-no problem.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Just as you drank your cup of milk, you saw vivian walked back to her room.

And since youre not as combat-hardened as Anna should Ms. Fujiwara turn her violent rage on you for some godforsaken reason, it's in your best interest and best health to sleep in your sister's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you walk down the dark hallway, treading cautiously with each steps considering many of the tenants have incredible hearing what with their bunny ears. One in particular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zzzzz... AlEx...SaaammmAaaAaa...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou overheard that she-hulked out mentally ill bunny ear call your name in her sleep as you passed by your room. Though her voice did sound awfully alluring despite being slightly deepened and feral, you held out and resisted the bunny-siren's call.<br>\r\nWhen you finally reached Anna's room, you quietly peered open the door, trying hard not to wake her. She's got a nasty habit of attacking people that suddenly wake her from her long sleep! Bad experiences, you think.<br>\r\nFortunately when you get in, you find her sleeping very soundly, hogging all the covers on her bed to herself. Not that you could share them anyways what with her having a pretty small bed. At the very least, at least the floor was nice and warm at least compared to everywhere else in the hospital for some unexplained reason. Sleeping there wont be much of a headache for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you set a pillow on the floor and made your bed there, you glanced over at Anna, seeing one of her pointed ears she usually keeps hidden under her hair out in plain sight. She hates when you do this (or at least she TELLS you she hates it), but against your better judgement, you couldnt help tickle the pointy end of her cute elvin ears!<br>\r\n\"!!!!\" and as usual, she shivers with what you assume is glee from your tickling! Her fingers and toes were literally twitching from your tickling, naturally! But you stopped after a short while cuz you didnt wanna wake her. With that fun out of the way, you made your bed on the carpet.<br>\r\n\"Good night, Anna,\" you whispered before falling asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****************<br>\r\n\"S-Sis! W-what are you doing?!\"<br>\r\n\"Shh!! Not so loud! And I told you not to call me that while we're alone!\"<br>\r\n\"B-But Anna! Why are you...\"<br>\r\n\"Alex... you said you'd do anything to help me feel better, didnt you?\"<br>\r\n\"We-y-yeah, but-\"<br>\r\n\"And he really REALLY hurt me. How could someone just stand me up like that?!\"<br>\r\n\"That was really awful of him. B-but still...\"<br>\r\n\"Please Alex... I'm just so lonely right now. I dont feel that way when I'm with you. Please stay with me a little longer...\"<br>\r\n\"A...alright si-I mean Anna.\"<br>\r\n\"Closer, Alex...\"<br>\r\n\"O..ok. L-like that?\"<br>\r\n\"Closer...\"<br>\r\n\".....\"<br>\r\n\"Good boy.... now lie down.\"<br>\r\n\"A-A-Anna?\"<br>\r\n\"Trust me. Just lie down... and let me get a little more comfortable..\"<br>\r\n*******************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly zip right up out of bed with your head sweating and your heart racing! Your face was red like a cherry after re-experiencing such a scandalous memory in your dream. It was certainly a unforgettable experience for you which, suffice to say, kinda expedited your whole transmission into adult hood! You certainly hope Anna didnt have ESP or anything like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, she was already gone. She left behind a note on her bed. It simply read: \"Alex. Off with Vivian to see her 'dad' for a deal. Will be back soon. -Anna.\" Ugh... her 'dad' (at least that's what she called him). Speaking of unforgettable experiences... well, let's say you'd rather lock yourself in a basement with just you and she-hulked Reisen than spend another day at HIS house! You'll bail on your sis before she makes you hide out at that place again! You dont know how Vivian can enjoy being there, but you certainly cant!<br>\r\nOh wait, there's more. At the very bottom of the paper read: \"P.S. I thought I told you a million times to STOP TICKLING MY EAR!!!\" You exhaled hard and headed out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the very least, it was morning. Unfortunately, morning didnt matter much in Eientei. Just meant the beginning of a new day of pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO! NO! NO!!\" just minutes after waking up, you suddenly heard Reisen screaming. \"I'M NOT TAKING IT! YOU PROMISED IT'D ONLY BE ORAL MEDICINE FROM NOW ON!!\" You rush over to the living room just in time to see the dispute being the mentally ill bunny girl (thankfully shrunken back down to normal size!) and her boss, the white haired doc.<br>\r\n\"I know, Reisen,\" Eirin said, \"but we had no choice but to chuck out a lot of our old medicine. All we have to treat your problems at the moment are suppositories.\" Oh man, you stumbled upon the WRONG argument this morning!<br>\r\n\"I'm not taking them!!\" the bunny girl screams, \"I HATE taking them!\"<br>\r\n\"It's all we have for you, Reisen,\" says Eirin, \"I'm sorry, but youre just gonna have to bare with it for a little while.\"<br>\r\n\"UH UH!\" she vigorously, \"you promised the suppositories would stop! YOU PROMISED!!\"<br>\r\n\"Reisen, you can whine about this all day,\" the little brat Tewi had to open her big mouth, \"but these pills are STILL gonna be going up your bunny-hole regardless.\"<br>\r\n\"Shut up you little brat!\" Reisen freaked out at her, too, \"get away from me!!\"<br>\r\n\"Rei-\"<br>\r\n\"No no no no NO!!!!\" she screamed and ran off past you, \"morningalexsama!\" you made out her giving a sweet smile at you for about a microsecond before she zipped down the hall and probably to her room.<br>\r\n\"Mor...ning?\"  you were a little too out of it process all of it in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the dust cleared, Eirin lowered her head and groaned. \"I knew this was gonna happen. I just knew it.\"<br>\r\n\"Morning, Dr. Yagokoro. Morning Tewi,\" tired of being left out, you finally speak up to the remaining two in the room.<br>\r\nTewi smiled your way while Eirin failed to make eye contact. \"Good morning, Mr. Whitestone. I'm... I'm sorry you had to witness that.\"<br>\r\n\"A patient doesnt like taking her medicine?\" you pretend to be ignorant of the situation out of politeness and tact.<br>\r\n\"Nah, she just doesnt like taking it where the sun dont shine,\" but Tewi knew not the meaning of the words 'polite' or 'tact'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm sorry you had to toss out all that medicine,\" you apologized, \"I'm sure Anna will get you restocked soon. ...Er... she's... probably off doing that right now.\"<br>\r\n\"I dont think we can wait for very long,\" Dr. Yagokoro states, \"too many of our patients need immediate treatment. And little Udongein is certainly one of them. By the way, your bedroom will be under major repairs for a little while.\"<br>\r\nYou inhaled and exhaled, \"...I know.\"<br>\r\n\"If you'd like, I got plenty of space in MY bed for ya,\" Tewi stated with a wink which made you feel extremely uncomfortable, \"and just in case you get any primal urges... dont worry! THIS loli is legal!\" You spit out your orange juice after hearing such a disturbing statement. Then you realized you didnt have any orange juice today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tewi, am I gonna need to put YOU on the suppository regiment too?\" Eirin warned.<br>\r\nThe little brat quickly flinched, \"N-N-No, not at all Ms. Lady Yagokoro! I'll be good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of which,\" the doc added, \"I'll be heading out for a little while. I need to find some cannabis plants to sedate Reisen when we have to give her her medicine...\" Cannabis? That's legal here? You got a few friends that'd be thrilled to hear that news! Youre not one of them, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, Eirin!\" Tewi came up with a brilliant idea, \"you dont need to do that! Just have Alex give her the suppository!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!\"<br>\r\n\"What?!\" you couldnt believe your ears and neither could the doc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, it makes perfect sense!\" Tewi suggested, \"she's clearly gaga for him. I'm sure she'll let HIM give it to her!\"<br>\r\n\"Are you serious?!\" Eirin got upset, \"I cant ask Alex to do that!\"<br>\r\n\"Think about it, Eirin,\" she continued, \"she's tried to glomp him before. Heck, she probably woulda glomped him last night too! Lord knows he can persuade her to let him shove this little baby up her butt. She probably wouldnt mind if he shoved something much much bigger and juicier up there, too...\"<br>\r\n\"TEWI!\"<br>\r\n\"Eirin,\" Tewi had her hands to her hips and gave the big doctor that look, \"dont pretend 'Alex-sama' cant get that done. If ANYBODY can get that purple-haired loony to take her medicine, HE can!\" They both stared at eachother for what seemed like an hour in total silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...But Eirin lowered her head and caved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Whitestone,\" she turned to you, looking very uneasy, \"this... I know this is hard for me to ask you this, and I wont blame you if you turn this request down, but we would... we would very much appreciate it if you... you...\"<br>\r\n\"Would you plug Reisen's thicc booty with this little sucker for us?\" again, Tewi with no shame...<br>\r\nNonetheless, it was a hell of a request to ask. But darned if you couldnt pull it off if you tried. Question is, would you?</span></div></div>",

Besides, if Anna realize you put it in Reisens bossom, she'll kill anyone in her sight even if it had reason. You politely declined her and Eirin understood, telling Tewi to do some business in the human village. You offered help since that you could do. They nodded and both you and Tewi got out toward the human village. While walking, Tewi were snickering little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What's so funny?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh, nothing. I personally thought you would put the medicine into little udon-chans rabbit hole.\" Tewi replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just don't want to get into trouble, that's all.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Mmhmm, but I kinda had feelings you do.\" Tewi replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You blushed and within hour you two reached the village. It looked like a small town with plenty of business buildings, apartments and restaurants. When you got through the entrance and walked through the street, you immediatly saw a sign of the restaurant that wrote:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Southern cat\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n (Isn't that restaurant..?) you thought, then turn to Tewi, \"say Tewi, we should get some breakfast over there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Tewi looked at the restaurant you pointing and looked at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I don't have money right now, you know?\" Tewi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I got some spending money from Anna, and I'm starving.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well...alright, I could put something in my stomach.\" Tewi agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You thanked her and you two went into the restaurant. It had many tables and the wall had many southern USA country side stare from Mississippi to arizona. The atmosphere were very southern comfort then a waitress came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Welcome to southern cat, how many will be seated?\" Waitress asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Two.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Alright, follow me please.\" Waitress replied with smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You and Tewi followed her and you two got seat. She gave you two the menu and told she'll be back soon for the order and left. You looked at the menu and quickly knew it was the menu you know as it was the guy who owns this restaurant back at your world.  You thought for moment to ask if he was here and Tewi spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some of these stuff looks delicious.\" Tewi spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"It is.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n After moment you two decided and the waitress can't back with a water and got her order form ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What is your order?\" Waitress asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yeah, I'll take pecan-praline pancake with side of biscuits with sausage gravy and coke.\" You ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'll take cheddar cheese grits casserole with side of cinnamon rolll with icing, and a carrot juice.\" Tewi ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Alright..your order shall come soon.\" Waitress said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Before she could leave, you stopped her to get answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Excuse me, but does a man named Marcus Benedict currently here?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Marcus Benedict, one of the few people in the LeFay that you actually get along as he is a heavy set African American from Deep South. He says his ancestors were brought from Liberia as a slave and after the war his great-great-great grandfather started the restaurant business and it was an instant hit for locals, both white and black dispite the heavy discrimination they felt. Marcus was picked by Maeve herself to be a head chef in cafeteria for both elites and normals, and he was THE man to go to when some needed advice and some great southern comfort food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Why yes, he's currently cooking right now.\" Waitress said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Can you call him out when he's not busy?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'll try but don't expect anything.\" Waitress said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Fine.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She left and it took.,,</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You didnt feel like disturbing your sister this late at night. You know she and little Vivian are having it worse than you are and you didnt wanna burden them. Sure, it wasnt like they'd say no, but you'd rather settle this yourself. Part of you wanted to go back to your bedroom and cuddle up with the were-rabbit that was sleeping in it, but a tiny fraction of you was already explaining in broad detail why that wasnt a good idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you decided to crash in the living room. On the plus side, it was much warmer than your room was. It could be cuz of the warming atmosphere coming from that white haired girl that had a fight with Kaguya earlier sleeping on the couch. Not wanting to wake HER up (despite how comfy the couch looked), you decide to sleep on the floor. Fortunately the floor was awfully soft. The carpet didnt feel bad on your back. And thanks to the warm girl, you didnt need a blanket. If it werent for the nightmare with Maeve, you wouldnt have any trouble getting to sleep at all. <br>\r\nIt was tough, but after a while of tossing and turning, you finally manage to slip into a deep sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had absolutely no dreams throughout the night. Perhaps your brain was too scared to conjure one, but it was ultimately nothing but a long black deep sleep. But considering, any night that doesnt end with a nightmare involving Maeve is a good night.<br>\r\nWow, the floor is incredibly comfortable. And somebody was generous enough to put a blanket over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHang on a sec. This aint the living room. It\u2019s not even one of the hospital rooms. You find yourself in a snazzy bedroom decorated with cool Vegas themed decorations like a poker table desk, a couple of signs of playing cards, a \u2018Girls! Girls! Girls!\u2019 neon sign, and an actual slot machine in the corner. Kinda reminds you of the time Anna took you to Las Vegas\u2026 and one of her fellow \u2018associates\u2019 introduced you to your very first strip club! Ah, the memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou even have a bunny girl fast asleep in your bed as well.<br>\r\nOh no wait, that\u2019s Reisen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026REISEN?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou almost let out a yipe, but barely stopped yourself before it came out your mouth! How did you end up in her room?! And wasnt she fast asleep in YOUR room? Apparently, she had enough time to change out of her tattered office shirt and skirt and into cute pink pajamas with little crescent moons on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, this was incredibly awkward and you need to get the hell out of her room asap before-too late, the alarm clock is going off. You froze up stiff as a board listening to the cheesy J-pop playing on the clock which causes your bunny bed mate\u2019s ears to twitch and wake up with a yawn and a stretch! As soon as she pressed the button on the clock, her eyes locked with yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes widened as did yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cR-R-Reisen!!\u201d you pleaded before she said a word, \u201cth\u2026 this isn\u2019t what it looks like!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cM\u2026 Mr Whitestone, sir,\u201d she put a hand to her cheek and her face went flush, \u201csneaking into my bedroom? That\u2019s incredibly scandalous!\u201d As expected she took your sudden appearance in her bed the wrong way. Despite that she doesn\u2019t seem all that upset about your intrusion, you try to plead your case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo no no! You got it all wrong!\u201d you tell her, \u201cI didnt sneak in here! I was sleeping in the living room!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEven after I told you not to come, you ignored my warning and still snuck into my bed regardless of the potential risk of irreparable bodily harm you could\u2019ve faced?!\u201d it was kinda scary to hear her say that with such a swooning smile, \u201cthat\u2019s so bold and manly!\u201d Hell\u2019s. Bells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI swear Reisen, I honestly dont know how-\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDont worry, Mr. Whitestone!\u201d she said with a wink, \u201cI can keep a secret!\u201d Well, on the plus side, she\u2019s not gonna rat you out. No point in continuing to defend yourself in vain. Might as well just shut up and accept it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTh-thanks, Reisen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter clearing that up without any casualties,  Reisen hopped up out of bed and began undressing out of her pajamas despite you right there next to her! Still being both a gentlemen and a bashful idiot, you quickly turned away and allowed her some privacy as she changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell Alex, if you really want to thank me,\u201d you picked up a slight hint of mischievous in her tone, \u201cI could really use a hand this afternoon.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cUh, how can I help?\u201d you politely asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d she paused for a few seconds, \u201c\u2026you see\u2026 I\u2019ve got an\u2026 uh\u2026 appointment with a\u2026 trader down at the Human Village later. And er\u2026 I could use a hand lugging some\u2026 special supplies I\u2019m gonna be buying from him.\u201d That was a lot of pause. If that didnt arouse suspicion, you dont know what did. She was less secretive about it than Anna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat kind of special supplies,\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n\u201cOh you know, just\u2026\u201d another pause, \u201cspecial vitamins. Gotta keep this lovely physique in tip top shape, after all.\u201d FAR less clever about it than Anna too.<br>\r\n\u201cAre these vitamins legal?\u201d you got straight to the point.<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 some places they are,\u201d Reisen didnt answer your question very well, \u201cwell, theyre not TECHNICALLY illegal here. Theyre just hard to get. Eirin wont stock up on any of them for some reason.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDANG IT! You thought you were done with this whole drug dealing business!<br>\r\nWell, you learned your lesson this time! You have had it up to HERE with drug dealing of any kind! Youre gonna put your down and tell her \u2018No Way Jose!\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026No youre not. Youre gonna have a hard time trying to tell her youre not gonna do it. You still havent forgotten when Maeve took over her body. She\u2019s still vulnerable. And you lying to her telling her she isnt didnt help her any. You\u2019d hate to see her get into even worse trouble because of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEr\u2026 aint it a little dangerous to go off into the woods outside of Eientei\u2019s borders?\u201d you at the least try to talk her into not going.<br>\r\n\u201cFor YOU it would,\u201d Reisen answered, \u201cthe wild monsters around love to prey on lost humans. But they wont dare lay a claw on you if they see ME following you. I could tear the neck out of one of those foul-smelling swamp bitches without so much as getting my gorgeous hair dirty!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou believe that. You saw her she-hulk out last night. Youre still wishing to motorboat that side of her too.<br>\r\nStill, she\u2019s already had one bad encounter with Le Fey. You\u2019d really hate to have her go through another one.<br>\r\nThen again, you\u2019d also really hate to be in the middle of drug dealing as well as risk getting busted for it after your sister\u2019s efforts to get you out of that life for good!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026 you up for joining me?\u201d Reisen finally finished changing into her suit and dress, \u201cI promise I\u2019ll give you a REALLY good share if you do!\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You could tell yourself that you just wanna look out for the poor bunny girl in case she runs into trouble with bad people, but you'd be lying. Even if she wasnt in danger (let alone with Le Fey), you'd still go with her. The truth was simply peer pressure. It was shameful, but you needed friends. As many as possible before Anna moves you to the NEXT safe house!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter giving yourself a mental apology, you tell that mentally ill bunny girl, \"Sure, I'll go. Wouldnt be safe letting a cute girl wander off on her own.\"<br>\r\n\u201cOh goodie!\u201d Reisen giggled, \u201cI know I'll be safe in your big strong arms. Now let's get moving!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWait, I havent even changed yet\u2026 oh right,\u201d you never changed out of your clothes from last night, \u201cuh, how are we gonna explain this to Eirin later?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo worries,\u201d she assured, \u201ctoday is her only day off. Which means she's gonna be forced to spend the entire day playing Street Fighter with the princess\u2026 and keeping her from breaking any more controllers or TVs.\u201d Dang. ...You'd kill to have a day off like that! Not literally, of course!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd surprising no one, she was quick to grab your arm and drag you off with her!<br>\r\n\u201cHey, arent we supposed to have breakfast, first?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n\u201cWe'll get something when we get to the Village! Now c'mon! C'mon!\u201d You tried your best to keep up with her so she wouldnt inadvertently dislocate your arm! You got plenty of odd stares from other patients as she dragged you down the hall (including a snickering Tewi) as you shouldve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough the thick bamboo forest, you had to carefully watch your step, cuz there were loads of traps lying around to keep predators and invaders out. They were there for good reason, cuz as soon as you left the safety of the bamboo trees, you could spot youkai lurking in bushes, no doubt staring your direction, waiting for when youre the most vulnerable.<br>\r\nOne white haired youkai with canine ears spent the most time tracking you down from a distance. You felt her feral red eyes on you the whole time and youre quite certain ignoring her was not gonna make her go away. You got incredibly nervous the moment you spotted a sword in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDont worry,\u201d Reisen whispered, \u201cthey wont come near you. Cuz they wont come near ME.\u201d Thankfully, she was 100% right. Dozens of youkai around every corner and not a single one did anything but merely observe.  A long awkward but safe walk later, the two of you come across a huge 20 foot brick stronghold with a manned gate. Reisen flashed her Eientei ID to the gate guard, then the guard gave a signal, and the pathway into the heavily populated village opened up for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being called the Human Village, the place was heavily populated with a wide variety of unique people. There were people were animal ears, animal tails, animal faces, extra limbs, extra tails, wings, horns\u2026 you'd wage a guess and say that least 60% of the Human Village population were non-human, which, though you support cultural diversity, kinda defeats the whole purpose of the name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of, you got a huge taste of cultural diversity when a rather tall muscular woman with a red horn on her head grabbed your ass! You flinched, but you pretended not to notice as she's most likely just drunk. She sincerely reeked of alcohol.<br>\r\nUnfortunately, she wasnt done. The oni lushed whistled so loud, it popped your ears!<br>\r\n\u201cYO! SWEET CHEEKS!\u201d she shouted out to you, \u201cwhy dont you come shake that fine ass over here?!\u201d You ignored her verbal sexual harassment and kept walking. However onis arent the type to be ignored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHEY TWERP!\u201d she began stomping toward you, \u201cdidnt you just hear me?! I said get your a-\u201d Then this big bulky brute of a she-beast stopped cold in her tracks once Reisen gave her a cold glare. \u201cWhoa whoa! Sorry, Reisen! Didnt know he was yours!\u201d And she quickly trotted away, not wanting a piece of that bunny girl!<br>\r\n\u201cSorry about Yuugi,\u201d Reisen groaned, \u201cshe and her friend dont know when to keep their big mouths shut.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe uh\u2026 trader said he'd be near this tea shop,\u201d Reisen said, \u201che said to look for a flag with a two-headed eagle on it.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cLike that one?\u201d you pointed over to the big bald gent in the black business suit waving the Russian flag with the imperial emblem. Wait a sec! You recognize that bald gent with a horseshoe mustache like Hulk Hogan! OLEG! If that ruskie multi-lingual bodyguard is here, than his boss must be around some-THERE SHE IS!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SASHA!!!\" squeal the lovely young blonde slavic high-ranked FSB agent with glee! The woman in the black parka bearing her FSB badge dashed at you and quickly wrapped her arms around you, squeezing you tight. Reisen's eyes and ears twitched, but you didnt notice! You were far too thrilled to see your favorite non-english speaking client/arms dealer of your sister's again!<br>\r\n\"Mikaela!\" you shouted with delight as you returned her hug, \"wow, it's so good to see you again! You too, Oleg.\"<br>\r\n\"It's been a while, Mr. Whitestone. Good to see youre still in good health,\" Oleg kept his cool demeanor while Reisen was still twitching.<br>\r\n\"\u042f \u043f\u043e \u0442\u0435\u0431\u0435 \u0441\u043a\u0443\u0447\u0430\u044e!\" Mikaela sighed, still holding you tight, \"\u042f \u0432\u0441\u0435 \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f \u043e \u0442\u0435\u0431\u0435 \u0434\u0443\u043c\u0430\u044e! ...Ah... \u0442\u0435\u043f\u043b\u044b\u0439.\"<br>\r\n\"Ms. Yurazinksi misses you as well,\" Oleg stated, \"as you may have noticed.\" Wow, she's nuzzling against you. Wow, she's chilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHEM!\" Reisen loudly cleared her throat and Mikaela finally let go of you... though there were still stars in her pearly blue eyes. \"I take it you know eachother, Alex-sama?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah!\" you nodded enthusiastically, \"Mikaela Yurazinski is one of my sisters' clients and fellow dealers. She kinda runs a special business outside of her day job.\"<br>\r\n\"We would appreciate it if you refrain from speaking too much about my boss's privates matters,\" Oleg warned you.<br>\r\n\"Sorry Oleg,\" you apologized and continued introductions, \"Mikaela, this is Reisen.She works over at the hospital my sister and I are currently staying at.\" Oleg translated what you said to Mikaela.<br>\r\n\"\u041f\u0440\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0442,\" she extended her hand offering a handshake, but Reisen just stared back at you suspiciously and gave a courteous bow. Mikaela paid it no mind and turned her attention back to you. She was speaking so fast, it was too difficult to type out all the questions she had for you, let alone for Oleg to translate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, she merely wants to know how you've been doing,\" he said.<br>\r\n\"Currently, we're on the run,\" you answered, \"sis and I kinda broke out of Le Fey and now theyre hunting us down.\" Oleg translates. Mikaela frowned and was about to give you another hug, but Reisen pulled you back toward herself! \"Uh, heh. Luckily, Reisen and her faculty were kind enough to offer us refuge and safe haven.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u042d\u0442\u043e \u044d\u043b\u044c\u0444 \u0441\u0443\u043a\u0430 \u0437\u0434\u0435\u0441\u044c \u0441 \u0432\u0430\u043c\u0438?\" Mikaela was looking all directions with a stern glare in her eyes as she asked. Oleg gave an uneasy look, but translated, \"Er... she is asking if your sister is here with you?\" Youre awful sure he's just being polite.<br>\r\n\"No, she didnt come. It's just me and Reisen.\"<br>\r\n\"\u0427\u0435\u0440\u0442\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043d\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0446.\" Mikaela sighed then went back to smiling. Oleg wouldnt translate. Again, just being polite. Mikaela started speaking energetically, saying way too many spontaneous things for me to type out... but your bunny-girl companion was quick to shut her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me!\" Reisen cut her off, \"uh, Mikaela, was it? I hate to um, break up your little reunion, but we have a certain DEAL to make, remember?\" Oleg nodded and translated, to which Mikaela pouted her lips<br>\r\n\"\u041f\u043e\u0437\u0436\u0435! \u041f\u043e\u0437\u0436\u0435!\" she waved her hand dismissively as if implying that the deal can wait. Then she grabbed your hand and your companion's stare got cold again!<br>\r\nMs. Yurazinski says a few things and Oleg translated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She wishes to um, discuss particular matters with you personally over breakfast first,\" Oleg said.<br>\r\n\"I dont think we have time for that,\" Reisen stated. Oleg translated.<br>\r\n\"\u042f \u043d\u0435 \u0433\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0438\u043b \u0432\u0430\u043c.\"<br>\r\n\"With all due respect, she was asking Mr. Whitestone, not you,\" Oleg had to be the bearer of bad news. The mentally ill and definitely perturbed bunny girl curled her lip. She seems to be getting along worse with her than Anna did!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were more than happy to want to spend more time with Mikaela despite the whole language barrier thing, but your long-earred friend seemed awful uneasy about her being around you. Not wanting to see a fight break out, it was up to you to make the decision. </span></div></div>",

You told reisen to hold on the deal for later, and she was disturbed but gave into your request.  Mikaela was happy after you accepted her offer and went to the nearest shop. Once you all sat down, you all ordered the food and waited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"So what is the things you ask me?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Mikaela spoke to Oleg and he translated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"She speaks that one of the closest member of ours suddenly disappeared from us, only to come back 3 days later with mass bloodstains on her.\" Oleg translated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You had thoughts since you knew another female who were close other then your big sis. She was very powerful and knew a lot about medical field that she was like reisen in outside world. Mikaela took out the photo and showed it to you, revealing your point. The photo showed a woman with long grey hair, red shirt, green dress and a medic pack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Isn't she...nightingale?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n She was Anastasia nightingale, the direct descendant to Frances parthenope Verny, sister to Florence Nightingale. She was rich girl as her father is a multi-billionaire real-estate venture while her mother is the president of pharmaceutical company. She saw the world of gangs and violence at age of ten, and decided to use her money to be a nurse to help the wounded, just like her ancestor Florence. she was smart to the point she got an PhD at age of 20 and she started to nurse the wounded secretly by using her money to buy good medical goods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Mikaela questioned her about it and she told her she was clearing some gangs,\" Oleg said, \"we didn't know what she meant until we got onformed that she killed all of top-elite of Le Fay gang.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n You were very shocked to hear that. Oleg told you that the rumer spread that the Maeve herself went hiding after the incident.  You cringed to hear that and mikaela spoke to Oleg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Anyway, the point is that Anastasia disappeared again and heard the word that she is somewhere in this world.\" Oleg spoke, \"and she wants you to help her with finding her since she is very important nurse to us,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Alright, I'll help.\" You told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You had the idea since your big sis thinks of her as a close friend since they were important to her. You heard rumer one time that they were hard core lesbian, but you never knew. After you all get breakfast and finished it, Oleg paid for you all and got out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well then, let's go now!\" Reisen said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You nodded and you three followed reisen. You three then reached the destination and sent in then suddenly..</span></div></div>",

The kinda shi-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly answer your phone just after realizing you forgot to set it to vibrate! You got a few odd stares from Reisen and Oleg... while Mikaela was actually whistling the rest of the song!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H...Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex?! Where the hell are you?!\" were the happy cries of your beloved sister screaming into your ear, \"youre supposed to be here babysitting Vivian!\" She just had to shout loud so that everybody around you could hear it!<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry sis. I cant do that right now,\" you swallowed, \"I'm busy doing an errand with Reisen.\"<br>\r\n\"Ugh!! Reisen?!\" as expected, the R-word was a curse, \"youre letting that mentally ill pill popper do her dirty work?!\" Reisen lowered her head.<br>\r\n\"No, I'm just helping her out,\" you said, \"we'll be back soon.\" But that wasnt good enough for Anna.<br>\r\n\"Ergh! Alex! Did you not forget she went berserk earlier?!\" she had to remind you, \"did you not forget she tried to take advantage of you while you were sleeping?!\" And like a sorry puppy, her bunny ears lowered over her face with shame and her hands covering whatever her ears couldnt.You were incredibly thankful Mikaela didnt understand what Anna just said... although youre pretty sure she asked Oleg. But you shook your head and mouthed 'NO!', so the generous lug played dumb!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, I'm fine alright?\u201d you assured her, \u201cbesides, I'm safer in her hands. No wild crazy youkai around wants to touch her.\u201d Reisen's mood suddenly changed immediately, she quickly raised her head with a smug smile on her face. \u201cIt wont take much longer. Anyways, I'm glad you called. Mikaela's been asking-\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMikaela?!\u201d Anna quickly cut you off as if the M-word was just as big a curse to her, \u201cwhat were you doing talking to Mikaela? I told you several times to keep away from her!\u201d Mikaela, despite her lack of a grasp in the English language, squinted her eyes.<br>\r\n\u201cActually she bumped into us,\u201d you took a deep breath, almost hearing Anna's blood boiling, \u201cshe's asking about-\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cLet me talk to her,\u201d Anna quickly cut you off.<br>\r\n\u201cAnna, I know what youre about to do. Please dont-\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAlex,\u201d her voice got stern, \u201cput her on the phone now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cringed, knowing what's about to come, but you were powerless to prevent it.<br>\r\n\u201cAnna wants to talk to you,\u201d you handed Mikaela the phone. Oleg translated and Mikaela's stern face matched Anna's tone!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnya,\u201d her accent was void of emotion when she answered your phone. Next thing that happened was plenty of shouting in Russian from both sides! They were literally yelling at at each other from both directions of the phone. Anna may have been the bilingual sibling, but she could not get along nearly a fraction as well with her special russian client/arms dealer as you could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two went at it, your bunny girl friend was holding back the urge to chuckle at her rival's expense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as you saw Mikael's eyes widen with intense fury (Anna mustve said something incredibly insulting), you quickly swiped the phone out of her hand!<br>\r\n\u201cI'm really REALLY sorry!\u201d you quickly apologized to your infuriated comrade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnna what the hell is the matter with you?!\u201d you scolded your big mouthed sister.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat's the matter with ME?!\u201d Anna snapped back at you, \u201cwhat's the matter with YOU getting near that slimy cunt?!\u201d Oleg thankfully didnt translate that to his boss, otherwise she'd probably stomp that phone of yours to pieces!<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, 'slimy cunt',\u201d Reisen whispered to herself and giggled.<br>\r\n\u201cThat 'slimy cunt' youre talking about bailed us out of who knows how many problems you got us in!\u201d you correct her.<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, and you know what she wants in return?\u201d Anna asked you, \u201cyou being her personal fuck-toy. Did you know she brags publicly to her fellow dealers in Moscow about getting her dirty untrimmed slavic 'kisku' rammed in by you?!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201c\u041a\u0442\u043e \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0437\u0432\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043a\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0443?!\u201d Mikaela screamed as Oleg was holding her back. Reisen failed to hold back a burst of laughter, but she quickly restrained herself and whistled innocently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlex, do I have to remind you of the kinds of bad people she hangs out with?\u201d Anna continues, \u201cespecially the ones that wanna kill her? ESPECIALLY a few that work with her in the FSB?! Honestly, I trust that mentally ill rabbit rapist a lot more then HER!\u201d Reisen arm thrusted and muttered 'YES!' as if that was a compliment!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm not trying to join her posse! I'm trying to get along with her cuz she's a damn decent ally!\u201d you couldnt nail this fact into your sis's thick skull any deeper, \u201canyways, she's asking about Nightingale. Anastasia Nightingale.\u201d<br>\r\nThere was a long silence on the other end after mention the name until she finally asks \u201c...What about her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give her footnote version of what Oleg translated to you and there was yet another long silence on her end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...So the top Le Fey execs are dead then?\u201d she questioned, \u201cOFFICIALLY dead? Not faking their deaths?\u201d It struck odd how THIS was her top interest, but you answered yes.<br>\r\n\u201c...Well, that takes care of one hell of a loose end,\u201d she had the nerve to comment.<br>\r\n\u201cWell, do you know anything?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAlex, just forget about it,\u201d Anna's warning took you by surprise, \u201cyou dont need to worry about her.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBut Mikaela, what about-\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cALEX. TRUST ME,\u201d she emphasized, \u201cI'm gonna be gone for a while. I need to clear up a few things. When you get back here, I need ya to look after Viv, ok?\u201d<br>\r\nYou sighed hard, \u201cFine.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThanks. Love you.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cLove you too, Anna.\u201d *Beep*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry. She doesnt know anything about Anastasia,\u201d you lied, \u201c...and I'm really sorry about her attitude, Ms. Yurazinski. Please dont take anything she said seriously. She's\u2026 not quite all up there, if you get what I'm saying.\u201d After her bodyguard's translation, Mikaela cooled down an awful lot.<br>\r\n\"\u044f \u0442\u0435\u0431\u044f \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0449\u0430\u044e!\" she said with a sweet smile. There was no translation needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, now that THAT'S finally settled and over with,\" Reisen stepped in front of you, wanting to finish what was started, \"...about those pills you wanted to sell me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou waited patiently (though you were very uneasy) as the deal was going through. Mikaela pulled a prescription bottle of blue colored tablets with the prescription label clearly ripped off. Oleg summed up the effects of it (ie, migraine reducing, stress easing, mild aphrodisiac side-effect, etc.) Reisen was quick to reach for it, but Mikaela snaked it away and rubbed her fingers with a stern look on her face.<br>\r\nReisen curled her lip and reached under her blouse (you turned away not to stare) and handed a bill that had a picture of Kaguya on it! Mikaela looked at the bill questionably, demanding to know what it is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is an official Lunarian 10,000 note,\" bunny-girl explained, \"one of those babies is normally worth roughly 48,000 in US dollars, however thanks to the current occupation happening on the moon, the distribution was suspended and these bills have been discontinued for many years, making them an extreme rarity. I'm thinking by now, they should be at least triple their original value.\" After the translation, Mikaela looked into her phone (possibly google searching info on the Lunarian notes) and after seeing the results, her eyes widened, and she quickly nodded, offered her a black suitcase full of those bottles, and concluded the exchange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Yurazinski thanks you for your business,\" Oleg insists before turning your direction, \"she also asks if YOU might be interested in her wares? She's willing to offer a very generous friend discount.\"<br>\r\nYou shake your head, \"No thanks. I'm good.\" With that out of the way, you all say your goodbyes. Mikaela offers to shake Reisen's hand again only to once again get rebounded with a polite bow. You offer to shake Mikaela's hand, who gladly takes it... and then gives you a little kiss on the cheek!<br>\r\nYou naturally blushed as Reisen naturally crushes one of her newly bought pill bottles (somehow, the pills were still ok!).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was she an old girlfriend of yours?\" Reisen asked out of nowhere as she was trying to opened the crushed bottle.<br>\r\n\"Nah, just a friend,\" you told her, \"a very helpful friend. I wish Anna appreciated her generosity as much as I did. Well, now that that's over with, let's head back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why the rush?\" suddenly she wasnt so impatient anymore, \"let's just hang out here a little longer. I got an extra vitamin with your name on it!\"<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I dont do drugs,\" you explained, despite the fact you worked in that kind of business!<br>\r\n\"Theyre not drugs per se!\" she corrected, \"theyre more like herbal supplements. Really effect herbal supplements that help you unwind. Come on. Unwind with me!\" She actually offered you a pill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd... rather not,\" you tell her, \"I need to head back fast and babysit my sis's kid.\"<br>\r\n\"PLEEEEEEAAAAAAASSSSSEEE?\" she suddenly gave you the sad puppy dog look... although her glowing red eyes hinted naughty ambitions!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n..........</span></div></div>",

Please understand.\" You explained to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She was little resistant, but gave in to your words and two went back toward the bamboo forest. When you two went in and walked, you felt like someone looking and looked at the top, seeing an long purple haired woman in black Arabian shirt and bra, and a skull mask. She noticed and disappeared, and reisen looked at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Something wrong, Alex-sama?\" Reisen asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"..no, it's nothing.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You two then reached the eientei and were greeted by Vivian..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n -underground city-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n In the underground city, Anna walked through the busy street talking with someone on her phone. After the call, the black fog were summoned, revealing the same female you saw walking with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What's the update?\" Anna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Your brother is currently safe, master.\" She replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Anna just nodded and reached at the certain house and got in. Once they got in, they went upstairs and went in the room, seeing a fat African-American with red shirt and blue jeans sitting on the chair. He noticed them and got up and they shook hands,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Long time no see girl.\" Man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yes Marcus, long time.\" Anna replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n His name is Marcus Benedict, one of the former member of Le Fay's top chef. He was ordered to resign from Maeve for medical reason and he became both a high school chef and a preacher. He may have retired from Le Fay but continued to cook some southern cooking to maeves top elite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Have you called Anastasia?\" Anna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Sure did, said she'll be here.\" Marcus replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She nodded and all three waited for 20 minutes then finally the female came. She looked at Anna for moment and they got an friendly hug. Once done the four sat on the chair to have private meeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"As you might have know, Anastasia have defeated ALL of that bitch maeves top elites,\" Anna started, \"now that they're gone and Maeve went hiding, I can safely announce that we are taking over the family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The three clapped their hands and Anna continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"This couldn't be done without the sacrifices of our rebels...including adalgar.\" Anna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Adalgar, one of the former member of Le Fay and member of Anna's cause, died at the hands of Le Fay for rebelling against her. Anna took that death serious and continue to struggle against her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"He was a good man,\" Marcus said, \"I hope his soul is resting in kingdom of heaven.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yeah...anyway, I am now renaming the family name from Le Fay to Galactic mirage.\" Anna announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n They clapped and she told them it will take at least a whole week to get the necessary papers to be looked. They nodded and before Anna left, Marcus stopped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What?\" Anna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Do you think you could ask Hassan to deliver this good old rum cake and triple chocolate brownies to your little bro?\" Marcus asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Anna looked at Hassan and she didn't say anything. She sighed and ordered her to deliver it to him. She nodded and took the stuff and went into darkness and Anna begun her work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n -eientei-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You were taking care of Vivian as you two played the game of cards. Reisen and Tewi were there to join as well and after 20 minutes, the cards were done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'm so glad I could play with you, uncle Whitestone.\" Vivian said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Me too.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  At the hallway eirin was walking with one of the patient until the door were knocked.

I wonder who?\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You got the package and noticed the handwriting. You felt familiar by this then smelled something sweet from the package. You opened up the package then you saw a big rum cake and ALOT of brownies sitting next to it. You had some idea who made this then reisen looked at it and were amazed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Wow, that's a lot of sweets!\" Reisen said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Is it from chef!? I hope it's from chef!\" Vivian replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I hope so.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Eirin then offered to cut the cake so you three could eat it.

You noticed her eating happily then suddenly she started to twitch little. You had idea that this was made by none other then Marcus as he always makes food that's so good that the person who eats it would react to the deliciousness intentionally or not.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"This..IS...GoOoD!!!\" Kaguya shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She scarfed on the brownie and took another one. Her eyes were tearing with joy and her mouth area gotten little dirty from the chocolate. After eating the second brownie, she dropped the game system (eirin managed to catch it), shivering with the sugar rush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Um..princess?\" Reisen asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'm going to find moko-tan and play with me for while!!\" Kaguya said with fast talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She then left the scene and went out. You now know this sweets were made by none other then Marcus himself. Eirin sighed and left with the cake, coming back later with sliced cake and some tea. She handed over some brownies as well and thanked for the snack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You decided to eat..</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Of course you turn your attention to the rum cake! Your favorite! The perfect combination of sweet, doughy, cakey, glazey, and so forth. The rum cake to you was the best cake that Mr. Benedict would bake for you. Must be something about that rum glaze he pours on it. It's got quite a kick and you just cant stop at one slice. Sure you werent much of a drinker, but when it came to rum cake, you had to make damn sure you had a designated driver to take you home!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard somewhere that he gets his rum glaze from Mikaela's private russian rum stash (but dont tell the FSB she doesnt have a liquor license!). It was kinda the reason Anna's very hesitant to let you have rum cake. She has this crazy theory that Mikaela's trying to get you drunk. Can you believe that?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you enjoyed a slice of rum cake, the mentally ill drug-bunny next to you was smiling your direction while gorging on carrot cake.<br>\r\nYou hated when people stared at you while you were eating, but you were getting used to Reisen's obvious affection so much that her big shiny slighty hypnotizing eyes had a sport reserved in the corner of your view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want some?\" you offered her a slice of the rum cake.<br>\r\n\"No thanks, Alex-sama,\" she happily declined, \"one of the labels on the drug-I mean vitamins bottles said not to consume alcohol while taking these.\" So she'll gladly gorge on illegal prescription drugs yet somehow she drinks responsibly? Ugh, you need a little more rum cake to flush out this nagging inconsistency!<br>\r\n\"Can I have some, Uncle Al?\" Vivian asked.<br>\r\n\"Sorry Viv,\" you had to turn her down, \"not until youre 21. ...Or 18. ...Or... hey Reisen, what's the legal drinking age where youre from?\"<br>\r\n\"10,\" answered Reisen. Vivian's eyes beamed.<br>\r\n\"We're not gonna be adopting that custom,\" you still turn her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, the glaze in the rum cake was not only delicious, it was strong. Despite barely even noticing the alcoholic aftertaste, it had a rather high volume to it. It's not even your second slice before you experience the early signs. You eyes have a hard time focusing and you slurred a little in your speeches. You have a hard time paying close attention to most of what's going on. Youre quickly reacquainted to some white haired girl in red suspenders, but you quickly forget her name. That Tewi brat made a perverted joke when you told her about being reacquainted with your sister's client, but it goes in one ear and out another. You recall Reisen holding back the urge to choke the little brat however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was Karaoke. Unfortunately, nobody sang songs you heard of and their jukebox didnt have System of a Down. Not that you had much energy to sing thanks to your inability to stop eating rum cake slices!<br>\r\nThe Mokou girl inadvertently set part of the room on fire and while everybody freaked out, you were tipsy enough to think it was a cool fire show... up until Eirin broke out the fire-extinguishers. As the doc put the extinguishers away, the Princess roared her head off at the pyromancer in suspenders for nearly burning the place down, the two had a fight, Tewi took bets, but the fight quickly came to a sudden stop after Reisen pulled two of her new vitamins and crammed each one down their throats! By the time Eirin returned, the two were hugging each other in a blissful daze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, you got a bit lightheaded and you dont remember much about what happened the next hour or so, but it didnt stop you from eating one more slice of intoxicating rum cake and become more intoxicated!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear,\" Eirin carefully observed you, \"just how many slices of that rum cake did you eat.\"<br>\r\n\"I uhhhh... los count affer da sevond!\" you slurred.<br>\r\nTewi sniffed at the cake, \"...OH WOW! That is strong! I felt it go right up my nostrils! This is like pure grade-A oni brew right here!\"<br>\r\n\"Aw dammit, ah knew Mikalalela put her juice in it,\" you mumbled, \"Annie's right. She DUZ wanna see me *HIC* drunk!\" Despite your head getting dizzy and your vision getting blurry, there's one thing you can see quite clearly... the lovely glowing red-eyed bunny babe in the corner of your eyes still smiling your way. Suffice to say, your inhibitions were hanging by a thread. Because Reisen was looking mighty fine at the moment. If you had a fraction of the etiquette your former male Fey co-workers had, she'd be getting the rug-burn right about now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for someone that DIDNT tickle your fancy at the moment, the old wrinkly saggy-titted crone Eirin sighed in disapproval. \"Looks like youre gonna need to rest that off. I better get some aspirin ready for your incoming hangover,\" she mused before turning to Reisen, \"could you please take him to his room?\"<br>\r\nThe bunny babe's ears twitched as her gorgeous smile never left her gorgeous face, \"Yes, master.\" she said with her gorgeous voice, \"come on, Alex-sama.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she helped you up. Well, she didnt just help you up, she helped you to your room. WELL, she didnt help you to your room, she actually carried you to her room with her bare hands! WEEEEELLLL, not so much her bare hands, more like her one shoulder! She actually had you in an over the shoulder carry hold and did not looked strained one bit by your weight as she was nonchalantly walking off with you in tow!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow Rei....yer strong...\" you commented.<br>\r\n\"I did a lot of weight training at my old job,\" she replied, \"...I had to.\" It showed. You remember seeing quite a bit of muscle on that OTHER form of hers... on all the right places, by the way.<br>\r\nIt seemed a little degrading being carried by a woman in such a way (even if said woman is a freaking bunny-earred powerhouse), but being rather drunk off your ass, such petty issues dont concern you. You way too busy enjoying the view of Reisen's short-skirted backside swaying so rhythmically.... are those striped panties youre barely making out?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being tipsy and distracted, you did see your room... that Reisen just passed right by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh... Rei?\" you slurred, \"we juz passed mah room.\"<br>\r\n\"I know,\" she said with a giggle, \"we're not going THERE.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no point playing dumb or even denying it. You may have been tipsy, but you were quite sure what's about to happen as soon as she takes you to wherever youre taken to.<br>\r\nBut you know what? At this point, you welcome it! Youre feeling kinda antsy yourself, so if this gorgeous bunny babe wants to get her rocks off with you, who are you to turn her down (even if you had much of a choice to begin with)? Youre friend downstairs was sober, up with the chickens, and ready and willing to pump some life-giving seed into bunny-chick vaj!<br>\r\n...And maybe pump a little in her backdoor if she keeps swaying her hips like she does!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf only the sober could see the drunk you right now. He would not believe that both you and him are one in the same!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we are,\" Reisen said as she entered a room, possibly her room, and set you down on a bed, then closed the door and locked it.<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry to keep you waiting,\"  she apologized, she smiling your way, \"and all that pent up stress I left you for just leaving you hanging last time. Well, dont worry!\" She hopped on the bed and climbed on top of you, \"this time, they'll be no distractions. Just me and you...\"</span></div></div>",

You two kissed for good 2 minutes then got off from you. Her red eyes were beautiful in your blurry vision, blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ever since you came here, Alex-Sama..my heart were beating like crazy whenever you came closer to me..\" Reisen spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You tried to listen to her but you started to feel drowsy after those rum cake you took in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I just can't hold back my feelings anymore,\" reisen spoke, \"Alex-Sama..I think I fell in lo-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Just before she could finish off her sentance, she saw you sleeping.

She giggled for while then took out a cellphone for kids that Anna bought for her. She dialed some number and held on her ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"..hi mom, it's me...yeah, I'm having lots of fun...mm-hmm..oh, chef's coming over!? Great! When?...tomorrow afternoon? Great!..I miss you mom..I hope you come home soon..\" Vivi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She then hung up the phone and went to see if Kaguya were up to play.

You were about to say something but the hangover from that rum cake hitting you hard and just didn't speak. They then noticed you and Marcus came to with smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"My man! Long time no see!\" Marcus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Mm, I have a hangover so please tone down.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Rum cake..aw damn, sorry 'bout that.\" Marcus replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He then left to get your share and once you sat down, eirin asked if you took some aspirin, and you told her you'll take it later. Marcus came back with food and once he gave it to you, you all thanked for the food and started to eat. You remember the taste as he was talented chef even to the point many high skilled chefs wanted him at their restaurant but he rejected the deal since he was still with LeFay at the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"This is terrific, mr.benedict.\" Eirin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"The balance of flavor is so perfect it's just amazing.\" Reisen said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Thanks, ladies. My mama taught me a lot from that to her special gumbo soup.\" Marcus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You could tell he was continued his passion of cooking as you took the bite of Mac, you noticed Vivians mouth were little dirty so you got the napkin and told her to be still. You cleaned it up and once she thanked you, you all continued to eat. After lunch, Marcus cleaned up the table with the aid of the bunnies, he came back and sat down next to reisen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Anyway, I came here for a good reason.\" Marcus said, \"it's about Anna.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What about her?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He then put his hand on his chest and mumbled something then suddenly a light were made. All of you closed your eyes and once you all opened up, you saw a golden goblet on his hand and he put it in the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"This, brothers and sisters, is the sacred holy grail.\" Marcus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Everyone gasped as you were fully know what the item is. Holy grail, the artifact that supposed to be blessed with the blood of Jesus Christ when he was at the cross while other says about the last supper. You couldn't believe what you were seeing to the point your hangover went away for moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Marcus...is this the real holy grail?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Real as my souls existence.\" Marcus said, \"when I first heard the word, Maeve was the owner of this grail until she became very jittery about it and let me take care of it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Does it have any form of power?\" Kaguya asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I searched for it, and this one have three abilities.\" Marcus answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You listened to him and he spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"This grail has the power to give the holder eternal life, eternal youth, and the unlimited power to grant wish.\" Marcus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You shivered by this and thought that Maeve owned this holiest artifact. You asked Marcus what's this got to do with Anna and he nodded and continued to talk.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"Anna knows the existance of the grail, and her eyes were fixed on that.\" Marcus spoke, \"but she don't know that Maeve gave the grail to me, and she is looking deep into it so she could get the grails power.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"What wish is she thinking?\" You asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"That, I don't know. She never tells me about it.\" Marcus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Is it alright to tell this info to us?\" Reisen asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Absolutely not, but I can sense she won't ask since I was not that close to Maeve.\" Marcus replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You sweated little as he put the grail and light engulfed and sank into his chest. He then told you he should get going back since Anna's expecting him to come back to her. You nodded and he got up until all of you heared a banging noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What's that noise?\" Vivian asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"It's coming from outside.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Both you, reisen and Marcus got out to see what was going on then you saw the green haired woman with big chest and tattered cloth on her. Both you and Marcus clearly know who she was as she was none other then Maeve herself!! She looked very pale and her body had many scars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Maeve!?\" You spoke with shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Alex..please, help me!!\" Maeve said with fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She grabbed your waist (reisen looked at her with narrow eyes) as you didn't know what was going on then you saw a young female with black cloth, short purple hair and a skull mask on her face. You didn't who that person were then she took out some kunai.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Targets fear is growing..initiate elimination..\" Girl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She then jumped and threw many kunai at her. Marcus took your hand and moved so you could be safe and reisen took Maeve and dodged the attack. The masked female were very fast as she was at maeves direction, reisen shot many bullets at her but it dodges the attack. Maeve just grabbed at reisen and then the female threw two kunais and hit in both Maeve and reisen. Reisen fell as you came to them, the female jumped back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"The poison that is on the kunai is very potent...the target will die.\" Female said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She then engulfed herself in the darkness and left. You told Marcus to get eirin and he left, thinking about the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n (Hassan knew she was here?) Marcus thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As he got in, you were talking to both reisen and Maeve. You didn't know why Maeve was this way as she was very powerful fairy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Whatever happened to your power, Maeve?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Erg...my power..is gone..\" Maeve spoke in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You were surprised to hear that then Marcus came back with eirin and took them into the E.R.

You and Marcus went in the room, seeing the two ladies on the bed with antidote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You alright reisen?\" You asked the bunny girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yes, thank you for asking Alex-Sama.\" Reisen spoke with smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You smiled then turned to the fairy queen who was your former boss. You still couldn't believe that you're seeing the queen of fairies laying on the bed with no power within her. Your head was filled with questions but you had one question that stood in your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Tell me Maeve, explain to me what happened after nightingale killed every last top executive except you.\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Maeve didn't say anything for moment as Marcus stood next to you, she then started to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"After nightingale killed them, she fought me directly. I had the upper hand at first until the Hassan of cursed arm appeared and struck me.\" Maeve explained, \"I fough both them but they they overwhelmed me so I fled. I fled fast and hid at my secret palace until I was caught by the Hassan of hundred faces and somehow took away my power and hunted me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n You couldn't believe what she was saying. You thought for moment, reminding  yourself on this Hassan character then you heared Marcus's phone ring. He got it and talked for moment then hanged up the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Sorry my man, but your sis really needs my attention now. I must go now.\" Marcus said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh..well, I'm glad I could see you again.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  He nodded and got out of the room. You wondered about Anna but you trust her and went to the kitchen to get some glass of water then once you walked you heared some chattering noise. You were no eave dropper but it got your attention and got on the door to listen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"...so your telling me to kill that Marcus person?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n You know the voice were Tewis voice then other spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"If we had that grail, we can easily defeat junkos authority and free our people!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n That voice were belonged to Kaguya and Tewi spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"But if he get killed, don't you think Alex's sisters going after your throat?\" Tewi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'm immortal, she could never kill me.\" Kaguya said, \"now please send your best bunnies after him.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n You were terrified to hear that and left quietly.

In all honesty, it was the shine of the card that first caught your attention before the woman did! But nonetheless, from your view the grey haired woman bared a striking resemblance to the woman in Mikaela's photo. The sunglasses werent doing a good job hiding her identity.<br>\r\nQuite possibly at the same time, Mikaela and Oleg spotted her and noticed the resemblance too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nightingale?\" your sister's client/arms dealer called out. Quickly, perhaps too quickly, she jerked your head your direction. And then immediately after, she dashed off!<br>\r\n\u201c\u0421\u0442\u043e\u043f! \u0421\u0422\u041e\u041f!\u201d Mikaela screamed as she chased after her with Oleg following. Not wanting to ditch a close friend (emphasis on 'close') you follow Mikaela and chase after Nightingale. Not wanting to lose a close friend, her drug dealer, AND her close friend to a drug dealer, Reisen followed you along!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u0421\u0442\u043e\u043f, \u0447\u0435\u0440\u0442!\u201d Mikaela demanded. Nightingale didnt listen. She ran down the streets, through the alleyways, pushing people out of her way as she attempted to flee you. Despite being a hassle to move through tight spaces and crowds of peoples, you and your Russian entourage werent far behind. Cant help but wonder why Nightingale is running away to begin with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnastasia realized this and decided a new strategy. She mumbled possible obscenities under her breath and by the time you reached a three-way cross-street, she dropped a smoke bomb on the ground! In the blinding smoke clouds, the four of you inadvertently separated and ended up taking a different cross street. You werent sure where Reisen, Mikaela, or Oleg went, but your choice of street still had Anastasia in your sights!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou followed the runner all the way to what looked to be a nice fancy bar. Part of you felt an immensely strong aura from that bar, but you charged in there too quickly before you could question it. After a little bit of scanning around, you spotted Anastasia handing a small package sealed in packing paper to a woman in a black dress with a red and yellow Chinese-style tabard with a matching oriental crescent moon crown on her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, the aura was indeed electrifying, but again, you took no heed to it as you called out like an idiot, \u201cNightingale?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe music stopped. Everybody in the bar stopped what they were doing. Even the armed ones. And every single person in the bar looked your way. Something told you were just stumbled into the wrong neighborhood.<br>\r\nAnastasia backed away as the woman in the black dress got up out of her seat and approached you. Part of you felt incredibly uneasy staring into her red eyes. They kinda reminded you of Reisen's, only instead of alluring, they felt intimidating and hostile. The aura strengthened and you couldve sworn you saw four purple flames sprout from behind her for a brief moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMay I help you?\u201d she asked, casually sipping her drink while her eyes dug into your soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had bad feelings, but you stared back and kept your cool.<br>\r\n\u201cI have business with Nightingale,\u201d you pointed over to her. You spotted a few armed drinkers begin to raise their weapons, but the woman brushed her hand downwards, and thankfully they lowered them.<br>\r\n\u201cI dont believe you do,\u201c she states, \u201cI'm afraid this is a private event and you were not invited. So if you could kindly be on your way, that would be most appreciated.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBelieve me, I mean no disrespect and I'm sorry to intrude uninvited,\u201d you humbly tell her, \u201cbut an associate of mine\u2026 and hers need to have a word with her.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYoure going to need to tell that associate she's far too busy,\u201d she strictly declined.<br>\r\nYou swallowed hard, took a glance over at Anastasia\u2026 and you got curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, I'll leave. But before I go, I'd like to ask her something\u2026 it's about Le Fey.\u201d The room got quiet again. You really shouldnt be involving yourself in such matters, but there's a few things you need to know now that it's in shambles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough it got incredibly awkward when the red-eyed woman in front of you tilted her head suspiciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cALEX!! GET AWAY FROM HER!!\u201d speaking of red-eyed women, Reisen darted into the bar like a bat of Hell and stood in front of you as if trying to shield you from this woman!<br>\r\n\u201cReisen?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cStay back! Dont get near her!\u201d Reisen warned her before turning the woman's direction. \u201cL-Leave him alone, Junko! He has nothing to do with you!\u201d The woman's eyes widened with intrigue. History together?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell!!!\u201d Junko sighed ecstatic, \u201cdo my eyes deceive me or am I staring at the mentally broken spawn of Udongein-Inaba?\u201d Geez, the odd look in her eyes as she stared at Reisen was making YOU uncomfortable! \u201cAre you seeing this, Chang'e?!\u201d Junko suddenly shouted to the ceiling, \u201cone of your mistreated, wounded, and scarred ex-soldiers has graced my presence!\u201d<br>\r\nThe poor bunny girl was beginning to shiver, but she remained still, shielding you from whatever Junko was capable of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, it seems like only yesterday when you were such a cute little kitten,\u201d Junko stroked one of Reisen's bunny ears, making her shiver even more, \u201cmy, how you've grown into such a lovely young woman. I bet your former comrades would agree. You remember them, dont you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHEY! \u0421\u0423\u041a\u0410!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just then, Mikaela and Oleg busted into the joint with a handful of Kalashnikov-wielding militants at her side. Both sides drew their weapons ready for a showdown as one of the militants dragged you out of danger. The moment of surprise gave Reisen time to back the hell away from Junko too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u0415\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u0432\u044b \u043a\u043e\u0441\u043d\u0443\u043b\u0438\u0441\u044c Sasha, \u044f \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0442 \u0432\u044b\u0440\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0432\u0430\u0448\u0438 \u044f\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0438 \u0441 \u0432\u0438\u043b\u043a\u043e\u0439!!\u201d Mikaela made a damning threat to Junko and you probably dont wanna know what she said.<br>\r\n\u201cYou've got some nerve, young lady\u201d Junko glared, \u201cbarging in on a private matter recklessly pointing such  weapons our direction\u2026 and you dont even have the decency to wipe your feet! That carpet is expensive!\u201d<br>\r\nMikaela could give less a shit about the carpet, but the last thing you needed was a bloodbath. You hoped they could be civil before bullets started flying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss,\u201d Oleg spoke up, \u201cwe dont wish to resort to needless bloodshed. My boss has some important business with Ms. Nightingale. It should only take a moment.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever business you had with my subordinate does not concern me,\u201d Junko stated, \u201cand it no longer concerns her either.\u201d<br>\r\nOleg translated to Mikaela. Mikaela squinted her eyes and replied back.<br>\r\n\u201cMy boss wishes to-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know what she said,\u201d Junko interrupted her, \u201cI know she's young and stubborn, but she needs to understand that meddling in affairs that dont involve her can result in such nasty consequences. Youre lucky I'm still generous enough to allow you, the boy, the rabbit, and your fellow thugs the opportunity to leave this place with your lives.\u201d Junko then squinted her eyes, \u201cBut if you dont put down your weapons then turn around and leave this instant, I may have to reconsider.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is leaving you with so many questions. But questions dont matter if you dont still have a life left to ask them. Youre willing to walk out calmly... but is Mikaela? Just how important is Anastasia to her? And how important is Anastasia to you?</span></div></div>",

Though you didnt take much notice, Anastasia was staring at you as you left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u0427\u0435\u0440\u0442!\" your angry ruskie broad cursed repeatedly, \"\u0427\u0435\u0440\u0442! \u0427\u0435\u0440\u0442! \u0427\u0435\u0440\u0442! \u0427\u0435\u0440\u0442!\" She then spoke a bit too fast to soak in even for bilingual people but her verbal reactions summed up what she was nagging. The way she was pinching her fingers hinted she was talking about how close she was, she made a little walking gesture with her hands followed by a grabbing motion, then she pointed toward the bar she was leaving, then clenching her fist, and then grabbing a fork and thrusting it upwards. To be honest, it was always fun to watch Mikaela's nagging charade game... at least until it occurs after having a major argument with your sister!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs fun as it was to watch her vent, you had to tune her out. You were still thinking about the fate of Le Fey at this rate. With the top elite members of the Winter Court dead, there's no doubt the entire family is in disarray. Titania and her Summer Court would no doubt take the opportunity to strike Maeve while her gang is wounded. What would become of the blood contract? Does this mean you and your family are finally free? And your father... IF he's alive... is he finally free, too?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright, Alex-sama?\"<br>\r\n\"Sasha! \u0422\u044b \u0432 \u043f\u043e\u0440\u044f\u0434\u043a\u0435?\"<br>\r\nBoth Reisen and Mikaela derailed your train of thought as they asked you in unison, then turned to one another and gave each other cold stares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, I'm fine,\" you assured, \"thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry about... that woman,\" Reisen apologized, \"if I had known SHE of all people were in this village, I'd have never let you come with me today.\"<br>\r\n\"You have history with this Junko woman?\" you asked.<br>\r\n\"More like the Lunarian Kingdom has history with her,\" she answered, \"she's one of the biggest reasons Princess Kaguya is seeking refuge in a hospital on earth instead of her kingdom on the moon.\" Mikaela seemed to be listening in, but had no translator present, \u201cUm\u2026 look, I know you probably have certain secrets that I shouldnt know about for my own good. When it comes to her, we've got certain secrets that you shouldnt be knowing about for your own good too. I've taken a huge risk just telling you this much!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded. You understood. It's probably best you dont know who Junko is or what she's capable of. If SHE has anything to do with the inevitable Fey civil war, she must be a force to be reckoned with!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey uh, Mikaela?\" Reisen turned her attention to your russian comrade who seemed to take no notice. \"Mikaela?\" she asked again. Again, Mikaela paid no attention. \"Mikaela? Mikaela!\" Reisen nearly shouted, but still no response.<br>\r\n\"Mikaela?\" you called out to her.<br>\r\n\"Sasha?\" you friend was incredibly quick to respond to you!<br>\r\nYou pointed over to Reisen, \"My friend wants to talk to you.\"<br>\r\nMs. Yurazinski frowned and turned her head to Reisen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our uh... deal?\" the bunny girl makes hand gestures, miming pouring pills out of an imaginary pill bottle in her other hand, then rubbing her fingers together. Her nonenglish speaking dealer sighed hard and motioned for her bodyguard to come over. Oleg came and she spoke out her response to which he quickly translated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My apologies, Ms. Inaba.\"<br>\r\n\"Udongein-Inaba,\" Reisen corrected.<br>\r\n\"Ms. Udongein-Inaba,\" Oleg corrects himself, \"but due to newly unexpected circumstances, the deal will have to be put on hold for today.\" Although you had no qualms with that, SHE certainly did!<br>\r\n\"Youre kidding!\" she whined, \"do you know how many hoops I had to jump through to even arrange this deal?! I had to reschedule previous plans, call in sick to work, bribe co-workers, my own master doesnt even know I'm here!\" Too much information!<br>\r\n\"We are very sorry to cause you so much trouble,\" Oleg apologized even though his boss probably wasnt that concerned, \"we will arrange for a personal driver to take you safely home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe groaned hard disappointingly as her bunny ears lowered down to her face. \"This was a total waste! C'mon, Alex. Let's go.\" You nodded and you were just about to follow along with Reisen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil Mikaela grabbed your arm. Even with the thick gloves, her grip was chilly! Your other friend's bunny ears immediately stood on end!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, your grabber said something to Oleg who quickly translated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid Mr. Whitestone needs to come with us,\" he stated, \"he has become a vital witness and potential target. For his safety, he will be put under our protection.\" Aw crap.<br>\r\n\"NO! No! No no no no no!\" Reisen grabbed your other arm, \"he's already under Eientei protection! We're already keeping him safe from danger.\"<br>\r\nOleg translates, Mikaela squints her eyes at Reisen and responds.<br>\r\n\"With all due respect,\" when Oleg starts his translation off with that statement, it's probably cuz his boss was talking smack, \"he will need more protection that a hospital/drug house in the middle of nowhere. Which is what we can offer him.\"<br>\r\nReisen's glowing eyes widened with anger. \"Did YOU just call MY home a drug house?!\" oh snap, she was plucking her earrings out, ready to unleash fury on that smart-mouth dyevushka!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait wait wait! Please dont!\" you told your enraged pal to hold back, then turned to Mikaela, \"Mikaela, you know Anna isnt gonna approve of this.\"<br>\r\nAfter her bodyguard's translation, Mikaela sneered, \"Tsk!\" with a scowl, she went off on a rough rant. As she was talking, the bunny girl decided it was an appropriate time to pull out her phone.<br>\r\n\"Er, w-with all due respect,\" oh god, here we go, \"your sister needs to understand how generous my boss has been to her. Ms. Yurazinski has personally bent over backwards to ensure errands and reliable clients to ensure that Ms. Whitestone is financially capable of being on the run. And if your sister commits an action that any of her clients find incredibly offensive, my boss has personally taken matters to keep said clients from destroying contracts... let alone calling out hits on your beloved sister. HER enemies become OUR enemies.\" She's got a point. Anna owes quite a bit to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you know she called your sister a bitch about six times in that whole rant?\" Reisen suddenly spoke up, \"look.\" You turned your head and she showed you the little vocal translation feature on her phone. \"That last sentence, although the translation is kinda sloppy, it looks to me like she said that if she had her way, she'd clip Anna's clitoris off and sell her to a Chechen brothel.\" Good lord, it DOES say that! You looked at Mikaela with disgust as Oleg began to sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as grim as that was, Anna has said much MUCH worse about HER too. Regardless, youre in the middle of a tug of war between a mentally ill bunny girl and a crazy slav with a loose tongue! Best to make your choice while your arms arent permanently dislocated yet!</span></div></div>",

His father was a chef, and his father was a chef, then HIS father was a chef, and his father was the head of a Liberian cartel known for smuggling drugs through baked goods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Marcus!\" you quickly rushed over to greet the big lug.<br>\r\n\"Little Al?\" he squinted his eyes to get a good look at you, \"is that you? Damn, aint seen you in like forever!\" One customized high-five and chest bump later (dont question it), \"how ya'll been doing? Still on the lamb cuz ya got Le Fey up in yo ass.\"<br>\r\n\"You already know the answer to that,\" you sighed.<br>\r\nHe chuckled, \"Damn right. Who dont? Hang on, ya still got a hankering for rum cake?\" DO YOU?!<br>\r\n\"You bet I do!\" No one makes rum cake quite like ol' Marcus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold it!\" Anna got in the middle of the guy moment, \"you still using Mikaela's stuff for the glaze?\"<br>\r\n\"Ya'll know it,\" he answered proudly.<br>\r\n\"He's not hungry!\" she immediately cuts you off, \"in fact, you can take rum cake off the menu permanently from now on.\"<br>\r\n\"Anna!\"<br>\r\n\"Alex, we are DONE dealing with that woman,\" she tells you, \"we do not need income that badly. I told you over and over to stay away from her! I told you numerous times what kind of terrible human being she is! I even had to tell you repeatedly why you shouldnt be sitting in the same room alone with this woman! This is the THIRD time she tried to the kidnap you!\"<br>\r\n\"Anna, she only tried to kidnap me TWICE,\" you correct her as if that freaking matters!<br>\r\n\"Alex! There was clearly rohypnol in your drink over in Saint Petersburg!\" she stated, \"what do you THINK she wouldve done if you ended up drinking it and passed out?\" You can keep denying that she's clearly bad news despite saving your sister's bacon who knows how many times. But Anna's right. If you wanna get out of the shady mafia business for good, youre gonna have to ultimately say 'Pahkah' to Mikaela.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess this means shitcan the eggnog too?\" Marcus asked.<br>\r\n\"Yes Marcus,\" Anna answers, \"shitcan the eggnog.\"<br>\r\n\"Damn...\" he frowned, \"that was like one of my best sellers.\" And so he went to the back to clear out the stock. Damn shame. You REALLY loved the eggnog too. Especially when it's laced with that sweet imported 'sugar' that Ms. Yurazinki is known for dealing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As for YOU rabbit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"!!\" Reisen's ears immediately stood up on end as soon as your sister turned her attention to her! Anna's cold stare burned into the soul of that poor mentally ill bunny girl that put you in harm's way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dont think I'm gonna forget what you did to my brother any time soon,\" Anna gave her a cold warning. The black robed woman edged up behind Reisen as if surrounding her. \"The only reason I'm not skinning you alive after nearly getting my brother abducted is because I need you.\"<br>\r\n\"W-W-what do you want?\" Reisen stuttered, \"I-I-I dont know anything-\"<br>\r\n\"You got a lot of nerve lying to me!\" Reisen made Anna angry. Bad move, \"you think I dont know you got history with that woman who's currently employing one of Mikaela's old associates?\" Oh dear, she already found out.<br>\r\n\"Er... l-look, for master's sake, for the princess's sake, I dont wanna get any of them in trouble with her!\"<br>\r\n\"Dont worry, I'm not gonna get them involved,\" Anna assures, \"just YOU. Alex, could you please step out? We need to have a private talk with Ms. Inaba.\"<br>\r\n\"U-Ud-\"<br>\r\n\"Shut up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was understandable to be worried for Reisen's sake.<br>\r\n\"Anna...\"<br>\r\n\"Dont worry, we're not gonna hurt you,\" your sister tells you, \"you have my word.\" You felt uneasy for that bunny girl that got you in trouble, but you trust your sister's word. You nodded and stepped out, hoping for the best.<br>\r\nYou sighed in deep relief, thankful that your sis didnt decide to relocate you again. You were getting awful sick of moving around so much. You could really use some more friends and you cant do that if you cant stay in one place for more than a while!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood outside in the hallway waiting patiently for whatever conversation they were having to be over. Judging by the fact you dont hear Reisen screaming, you could tell your sister kept her word.<br>\r\nSpeaking of which, despite such a terrible episode, youre still reminding yourself of Anastasia. It probably shouldnt be your business anymore, but now that she played a key role in practically destroying the Winter Court, you have questions that you think she might have the answer to. One of them, the most pressing of all them, involves the fate of your dad. Not even sis will tell you what really became of him if he isnt dead and you heard stories about what Maeve's people do to traitors and you'd way rather he be dead than put to such drastic activities! But if he ISNT dead... well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a violent pornography. Choking chicks and sodomy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then your phone went off, knocking your train of thought off the tracks. Honestly, you didnt feel like answer the phone, but you peeked at the caller ID. Unknown ID. Probably another stupid telemarketer.<br>\r\nYou exhaled, waiting for the System of A Down song to be over so it'd be sent to voice mail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sasha? ...Sasha?\" Mikaela?! How did she get your phone number?! Oh right. You got drunk off rum cake this one time and you gave it to her willy nilly! What kind of mafioso are you?! Anyways, you greeted your teeth in thought as she continued to call you by your nickname. You thought about it, then you thought about your sister, then you thought about how mad your sister would get if she found out that Russian fucker was calling you on your phone.... then you...</span></div></div>",

It was an incredible relief that she looked unharmed after whatever she went through with your sister behind closed doors. In fact Reisen was so fine, she was seen signing the leg cast of a young patient in a wheelchair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared as she carefully scribbled her name in kanji with a purple marker and even added a cutesy little anime bunny-girl face at the end of it. Certainly no sign that Anna horribly abused her beyond repair there!<br>\r\n\"There we go!\" Reisen finishes her autograph with a chipper tone in her voice.<br>\r\n\"Wow! Thanks, Reisen!\" the little girl in the wheelchair beamed, admiring the stylish penmanship and little art design.<br>\r\n\"Make sure you dont let it get wet for a while,\" Reisen says, \"the ink takes a bit of time to dry.\"<br>\r\n\"I wont!\" the girl promises, \"and I promise I'll take good care of it until the cast comes off!\"<br>\r\n\"That wont be very long now,\" Reisen assures, \"with Dr. Yagokoro's treatment, that leg will be healed up in no time.\"<br>\r\n\"When it does, can we go play volleyball on the beach soon?\"<br>\r\n\"I've already picked out my new swimsuit!\" Hmm. There's a beach nearby?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyways, Reisen gives the young patient a friendly and careful hug and she rolled off on her way. And as soon as she was out of there, that was your moment to strike!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Reisen!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"!!\" she suddenly froze up. You didnt know why, but you coulda sworn it out of fright. It took her several seconds to finally turn around and greet you with a friendly smile. \"Hi Alex-sama!\" Though her smile looked genuine, her eyes quickly beamed around you like she was checking for something behind you! You had a feeling you knew who she was looking for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was it with Anna? Are you alright?\" you asked her, \"she didnt hurt you, did she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, she didnt, I'm fine,\" she tells you, \"forthemostpart.\"<br>\r\n\"She absolutely didnt hurt you?\" you observe her to be safe, \"she didnt leave you any scars or anything?\"<br>\r\n\"No no no no!\" she brushed you away, \"nothing like that.\"<br>\r\n\"So what happened?\" you ask, \"what did she do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, she questioned me about how I knew your friend Mikaela,\" Reisen explains while still looking around for Anna, \"I told her what I knew, I told her about some my contacts and their connections with certain groups. Then she asked me to call up one of them to set up a deal with her.\" Ugh.. of course! She's STILL doing this shit and now she just dragged Reisen into it! Well, to be fair, she was already a part of this mess before, but now she's forcing that poor mentally ill bunny drug mule into even deeper shit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then after that, she let me go.\"<br>\r\nYou sighed. But then her ears lowered as she finished with regret, \"But not before telling me that if she ever caught me putting a hand on you again, she'd stick so much C4 up my ass that my cough would trigger an explosion.\" DAMN IT, SIS! She can sure be a handful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry about her. Dont worry, I'll talk to her-\"<br>\r\n\"No, that's ok,\" she assured her with a defeated frown, \"it's... probably for the best.

Heck, I might end up trying to take advantage of you again like that one night.\u201d And that's an issue, why?<br>\r\n\u201cI'm prepared to take that risk,\u201d you made no effort trying to hide your excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the very least, it made Reisen smile, \u201cDont worry, Alex-sama. I'm sure you'll find someone else easily. There are plenty of suitable available girls here.\u201d Aww\u2026 but you didnt even get a chance to be raped by She-Hulk Reisen yet!! \u201cBesides, you dont need to worry about me.

Plus, she sure knows how to rock a bikini when she finally musters the guts to put one on!\u201d Wow. It's one thing to discover that Reisen is bi, but it's another to see her swooning over an old friend. It kinda warms your heart, but youre not only still jelly, youre TWICE as jelly now that you find out this crush of hers is a girl!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d you swallow pride (and a little sadness), \u201cif something does manage to spark between the two of you, I hope you have a great time together.\u201d You could hope for a threesome, at least!<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, Alex-sama,\u201d your bunny-earred friend (emphasis on FRIEND) smiled. To everyone's dismay, the smile didnt last long. She quickly reminds herself of the OTHER bad thing that happened today. \u201cOH! A...about that\u2026 (gulp) woman we met at the bar.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you mean Junko?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSSSH!!\u201d she quickly shushes you while glancing everywhere for eavesdroppers, \u201cdont say that name so loud! If anybody hears that we bumped into her, all hell will break loose!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe's a lot of trouble for you guys, isnt she?\u201d your curiosity sparked.<br>\r\nReisen just got uncomfortable. She didnt look willing to talk about her. \u201cLook, just\u2026 just pretend we never bumped into her in the first place. And please dont breathe a word about her to the others, I dont want them to start panicking.\u201d<br>\r\nShe bites her lip and gives you a pleading look with her big alluring red eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, Ok! I wont say anything!\u201d you cave, \u201cI promise!\u201d Not like it'll matter, anyways. You probably aint seen the last of her and her ilk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cREEEEEEEISEEEEEEEN!!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou almost jumped out of your skin suit and Reisen's ears sprung up with fright! That loud shout came from Eientei's own Lunarian princess who suddenly appeared out of nowhere, standing right beside you!<br>\r\n\u201cY-Y-Y-Your majesty?\u201d Reisen bowed nervously as Kaguya glared back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaguya took a deep breath before shouting into the bunny's face...</span></div></div>",

She sweated a lot trying to make an excuse on what she should say as she can\u2019t say she had a deal with Mikaela about the drugs. You breathed in, out and took it to the front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cPrincess, I wanted to see the village and I needed an escort and a guide.\u201d You explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Kaguya looked at you as the bunny looked at you as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cLook, if you needed one you could\u2019ve asked wither me or eirin!\u201d Kaguya replied, \u201cgoing without permission is no go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI understand, please forgive me for my action.\u201d You apologized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Kaguya didn\u2019t say anything for moment and then sighed. She then warned her not to repeat this again and walked away since she\u2019s expecting a delivery from the human village, then suddenly a voice were heard from the entrance. You all went and saw a long haired female with a t-shirt written in Chinese and a jeans on.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cChinese food delivery for houraisan.\u201d Female said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cM-Mao? Is that you?\u201d You spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She was called Mao, a head of her Chinese food delivery restaurant. She delivered some of the best Chinese food you ever tasted before. Heck, even La Fey likes her cooking to the point she gets it from her four times a week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cAh, hello Whitestone. Why you here?\u201d Mao asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI\u2019m basically hiding from Maeve. Me and Anna broke off from her gang.\u201d You explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Mao tilted her head and puts the food down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cLe Fay gone! She\u2019s not around anymore!\u201d Mao said in her slurred Chinese accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWhat...do you mean?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cMaeves agents dead. All her top is dead. I saw it when I deliver orange chicken to them!\u201d Mao replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You couldn\u2019t believe what you just heard. Maeves men\u2019s were all dead? You thought to yourself that it was near impossible since they were near immortal and very powerful. Kaguya coughed and took out her money as they exchanged food and money, Mao turned to your attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWhat happened to Maeve? Where\u2019s she?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWho should I know? She was long gone when I arrived. Now I see you later.\u201d Mao replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As she was about to leave, you asked where she currently stays, and she replied that she\u2019s currently staying at the human village with her restaurant. She bid farewell and left the scene. As Kaguya went to the living room to eat the Chinese food and both you and reisen thought, you were greeted by...</span></div></div>",

How come you havent called?! ...Oh right, is it because youre in hiding?\" All these questions and more were asked by Big Yumi while you were too busy being smothered in breasts to properly respond. Not that you wanted her to let go, cuz you were practically in bliss that could only come from something as Heavenly as Big Yumi's embrace! Nothing could take your mind off any and all hardships (from simply frustrating to life threatening!) quite like one of Yumi's big warm soothing hugs!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, all good things, for instance Yumi's hug, come to an end. It took a while for you to snap out of it after she let go of you... huh? Where's Anna? Where did she go? Yep, you completely missed her goodbye, but youre awful sure it was business related, so you dont pay it much mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y...yeah, it's great to see you too, Yumi,\" was all you could mutter to your super-sized hugger! Man, you hope neither Reisen or Mikaela ever find out about this!  ...Well, maybe not so much Reisen, anymore. \"*Ahem!* I'm sorry I wasnt able to get in contact with you lately. Obviously, I'm supposed to be laying low. Currently, this place here, Eientei, is treating me real well. Everybody's here's really nice... especially this one nurse here, Reisen!\" Perhaps TOO nice!  ...Youre gonna miss that 'nice' once she and her friend, Youmu become a thing! ....unless there's a potential for a three-wSHUT UP!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm really glad youre doing alright,\" Yumi smiled down at you, \"I'm ESPECIALLY glad Goro was just lying when he said Maeve put cement bricks on your feet and dumped you in the Hudson River!\" GEEZ! A little much, Goro?!<br>\r\n\"H-How about you, Yumi?\" you asked her, \"did you get a spot in any upcoming movies?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah... just one,\" she answered, \"it's not a big film. Mainly a local one. It's a horror movie, 'One Hundred Hands of Fate'. I'm play a waitress down at a cafe the leading heroine visits a lot that ends up getting attacked by the demon!\"<br>\r\n\"Interesting!\" you say as you fantasize Big Yumi in a waitress uniform, \"does your character end up dying?\"<br>\r\nShe shakes her head, \"No. She does scream a lot... which is why my voice is a little hoarse.\" You didnt notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Ding da ding!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you heard a dinging noise coming from Yumi's back jean pocket. Yumi laughed nervously as she pulled out her smartphone from her pocket (cute little cartoony stickers all over it!)<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I almost forgot I was in the middle of a text conversation with a fan,\" she apologizes as she fiddles with her phone.<br>\r\n\"You got fans?\" it sparks your interest.<br>\r\n\"She's my ONLY fan,\" she mumbled as she typed up a response to someone by the name of 'Sumireko Usami' on the screen. Normally, you'd feel bad about eavesdropping on her private conversation, but Yumi just mentioned you on her response so it's now youre business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Sorry for the late reply', she writes, 'I just got reunited with an old friend Alex for so long.'<br>\r\n'OOO! DAT GUY U THOUGHT WUZ DED?!!!11' Sumireko replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She knows about me?!\" you got a little worried and Big Yumi got a little nervous.<br>\r\n\"Only tiny little snippets!\" she explained, \"I kept you completely vague! Honest!\" You got upset with her, but it went away fast when she replied 'Yeah. Thank the gods I was wrong. You have no idea how much I missed having him around.' Aww, Yumi!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'AWWWW X3 HOW KEWWWTTT!!1' Sumireko responded, 'liek out of a tragic story! Ur long lost bf rises frum beyon teh grave!!!!1'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYumi quickly replies, 'He's not my bf'<br>\r\n\"Urghh...\" she groans and deletes the last two letters.<br>\r\n'...boyfriend! He's a close friend! He's also the brother of one of my big bro's'  Yumi looked back down at you for a few seconds with a nervous expression, then added, 'former co-worker.' Dude! Why did you have to say THAT! Now she's gonna Anna's starring in pornos!!! And dear lord, if ANNA finds out such a rumor spread...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Pix plz!!! PIX PLZ!!! SHOW ME PIX!!!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... she wants me to take a picture of you.\" You figured that's what she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yumi... I'm kinda supposed to be laying low,\" you remind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dont worry, I'll add a black bar to censor your eyes! I promise!\" Will that even work?! But being a gullible fool that you were, you shrug your arms and say, \"Ok. Go ahead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Big Yumi didnt just settle for a simple picture of you. She got a bit clever. And kinda clingy! She actually bent over close to you, wrapped her arm around you, then lowered herself as she closed in against you, resting her head against yours as she smiled for the camera! That picture she took successfully manage to capture the shade the red on your cheeks! Geez, she might as well have sent Sumireko a picture of you smothered in her breasts while youre at it! ....Something you would not even CONSIDER rejecting!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen after a little editing, Big Yumi posted that pic of you and her to her fan. Perfectly captured Yumi's sweet heart-melting smile with her eyes closed behind her spectacles... as well as the brief expression of bashfulness on your face... with a tiny black bar conveniently covering your eyes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if it wasnt embarrassing enough, Sumireko's very first reaction to seeing that pic was:<br>\r\n'LAWWWWWLL!!! ^o^!! OMG!!! HES LIKE A TEENIE TINEE DWARF CUMPARED 2 U!!'<br>\r\nYou werent THAT short! At least you didnt think you were.<br>\r\n'EVERYONE is compared to me!' Yumi agreed.<br>\r\n'Dats right! U gotz a total killer bod!!!!' Sumireko added, 'ur bf is lucky 2 nab a hawtie like u!!!!'<br>\r\nYumi couldnt help but smile at her fan's compliment. She was just to type out 'Than-'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'PUT UR BF ON VID-CHAT!!!!' was Sumireko's next immediate message!<br>\r\nVid-chat?!! As in Video Chat?!!<br>\r\n'CMON!!! I WANA TALK 2 HIM!!! PLZ?!!! PRETTTY PLZ!!!!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYumi seeked too reluctant to enter another reply to her fan. All the while, she was looking down at you... almost with a pleading expression!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I have a filter here to put a bar over your eyes while we chat,\" she offered.<br>\r\n\"Yumi, again. I'm supposed to be laying low,\" you answer, \"what if she shows this vid off to her friends and her friends show it off to certain people?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I PROMISE! I WUNT TELL NEBUDY BOUT UR BF!!!' Sumireko added another message... almost as if she heard you! 'CROSS MY HEART HOPE 2 DIE ^_^!!! PLLLLLLLLLLZZZZZZZZ???????'</span></div></div>",

I would really super hate to watch one of my heroes suddenly drop out and quit their true calling just cuz of some IRL drama\u2026. HEY SILLY RABBIT! QUIT LOOKING AT ALEX LIKE HE'S A BOWL OF TRIX!\u201d Sumireko suddenly shouts over to Reisen who immediately turns away, \u201cI know he's eye-candy, but he's YUMI'S eye-candy!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cS-Sorry...\u201d Reisen lowered her head and tried to hide her obvious blush, \u201cf-force of habit.\u201d Wait, what was that supposed to mean?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSumi! That's enough!\u201d Yumi had to scold her fan then shook her head and turn to you two, \u201cgeez, she's a lot more overprotective than big bro!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat's not saying much,\u201d you couldnt help but let those words slip out of your mouth.

Big Yumi shut off her phone and put it back in her pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm sorry about her,\u201d Yumi apologized to your bunny-girl friend whom HER friend chastised, \u201cshe's overzealous sometimes, but she seems well. Plus, she meant it when she said she'd keep everything here secret.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cW...well, that's good\u2026.\u201d Reisen answered awful nervously, but quickly changed her tone when she changed the subject, \u201cOH! Right!

I mean actually Vegas sexy bunny-girl costumes!\u201d OH!<br>\r\n\u201cOH!\u201d both you and Big Yumi replied in unison.<br>\r\n\u201cLady Kaguya says youre required to dress up, too,\u201d Reisen then tells Yumi whose eyes widen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM-M-Me?!!!\u201d she said with widened eyes behind her spectacles and a blush. You were simply at a loss for words.<br>\r\nBut Reisen nods, \u201cShe says youre required. We're gonna need to have you fitted for your specially made suit!\u201d The thought of Big Yumi dressed as a playboy bunny just left you feeling awful flustered. It took way more effort than it shouldve to fight off the nosebleed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd thankfully to you and your pervy imagination, she reluctantly agrees. \u201cO...ok. If I have to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Reisen still wasnt done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlex-sama, you need to dress up, too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared back at her in silence, trying to process what she just said.<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026 as what?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAs a bunny-girl.\u201d<br>\r\nA couple of seconds later...<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026 a bunny-GIRL?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOf course.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWAIT! WHAT?!!\u201d you raised your voice in a panic, \u201cME?!! A BUNNY-GIRL?! BUT I'M A GUY!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThe mistress says everyone has to dress up,\u201d Reisen repeats herself. You couldnt believe what you were hearing! Is Kaguya serious?! Does she not see how obviously wrong that is?! What is with that weird look Yumi's giving you?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 if we're doing a casino theme, shouldnt I dress up as like a dealer or magician or something?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo, the mistress is gonna be the magician,\u201d the real bunny-girl answers.<br>\r\n\u201cThis\u2026 this aint gonna work!\u201d you object, \u201cI-I'm a guy! I cant dress up like that\u2026 it\u2026 it just aint right!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThose are her orders,\u201d Reisen states, \u201cyou have to do what youre told. Otherwise you have to face the consequences.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat kind of 'consequences'? Are they even worse then dressing in drag as a playboy bunny?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome Alex, just do it,\u201d Big Yumi looks down at you and tells you with encouragement, \u201cI'm sure it'll look really good on you.\u201d Errr\u2026<br>\r\n\u201cMe too,\u201d you heard Reisen whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of their stares were making you feel very uneasy....</span></div></div>",

(and that's assuming something wont go haywire and cause it to last more than 24 hours!).<br>\r\nYou'd rather dress in drag than 'temporarily' sacrifice your manly bits!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thank you, Dr. Yagokoro,\" you respectfully decline the drink, \"I'm very wary of consuming anything that'll.. er... alter THAT part of me!\"<br>\r\n\"Dont worry, Mr. Whitestone,\" Eirin assures you, \"it's completely safe and I guarantee you you'll be back your manly well-endowed self by the end of next morning!\" ...'Well-endowed'?<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" you turn her down, \"I cant afford to take that chance. Me and my... er, manly well-endowed self have been together all my life to risk losing it!\" In other words, you wouldnt trade away your penis for anything in the world!<br>\r\nEirin doesnt bother to attempt to persuade you any further. She puts the can away and shrugs, \"Alright. Just please try not to add too much attention to yourself, ok?\"<br>\r\n\"You dont need to tell ME about that,\" you groaned as you walked out of her office and into your room where, against your pride and dignity, squeezed on that neatly skin-tight bunny-girl costume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, despite being a tight suit, it was refreshingly stretchy in the important parts. It doesnt squeeze up where you really dont want it to. The chest didnt seem baggy and fit suitably for flat chested people like yourself! The bow-tie collar was a little tight, but you could breathe fine. It's a good thing youre one of those guys that shave your legs so the net stockings certainly didnt bother you (hey, the things you do when the weather gets too hot and humid!).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all, it fit fine. You sure as fuck didnt enjoy looking at yourself in the mirror, however. Degrading. Simply degrading. It took all the willpower you could muster to march out that room baring that abysmal outfit for all to see!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026 my\u2026 god!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd wonder o'wonder miracle o'miracles the very first girl to spot you in your brand new ensemble was that pervy brat, Tewi! You didnt have time to note how cute she looked in her little bunny-girl costume, cuz she was leering at you with disgust!<br>\r\n\u201cYou actually put it on?! I cant believe you actually put that stupid thing on!\u201d this twerp was ostracizing you while your face went red with humiliation!<br>\r\n\u201cIt's not like I had much of a choice...\u201d you grumbled, \u201c...and I wasnt about to take one of the doc's weird sex-altering drinks just to avoid embarrassment!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou SHOULDA done that!\u201d Tewi remarked, \u201cat least you'da probably been thought of as a hawt chick with a hawt body dressed in a hawt outfit!\u201d She cringed with disgust, \u201c...Instead of a\u2026 cross-dressing weirdo that probably hangs out in special bars at night!\u201d How the hell would this brat know about that kind of thing?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm certainly not,\u201d you tell her, \u201cI am still all man!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cCoulda fooled me,\u201d she flat out dissed you, \u201cSorry Al, but seeing you toss away your man cards with that tranny getup kinda ruined whatever chances you had with me. I prefer my prime bucks all man with a lot more integrity and a helluvalot more dignity!\u201d Why the hell does it matter what SHE thinks of you?! ...And why the hell are you feeling a little hurt by her opinion of you?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the plus side, two particular girls entered the scene who would not ridicule you! You went from embarrassed and emasculated by a kid who you TOTALLY didnt want to have as a mate\u2026 to being flat out stricken with absolute awe at the sight of Reisen AND Big Yumi themselves now sporting THEIR bunnygirl outfits!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReisen looked astonishing in her outfit (minus the bunny ears for obvious reasons!). The tight snug suit of hers properly adjusted to and hugged every juicy curve of her exquisite body like it was just painted on her! You wouldnt be surprised if she could mount you while still completely clothed in that outfit and STILL manage to get herself pregnant! Now you suddenly wish you'd taken advantage of this gorgeous moon rabbit's advances on you and gleefully sired her half-breed children BEFORE your sis scared her away!<br>\r\nBig Yumi was quite a sight to behold as well. She looked back at you with a very nervous look, embarrassed that her customized queen-sized bunny-suit fit her tall slender body so well! Her net stocking-clad legs seemed to go on for miles and far beyond the mountains that were her breasts clad in only skin-tight black PVC-fabric was the serene face of a bunny goddess in spectacles blushing with stage fright despite her bunny ears pointing upwards with anticipation! Seeing Yumi of all people in such a scandalous ensemble made dressing in drag WELL WORTH IT!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were at a loss for words at the sight of the tall bunny goddess and her shorter but equally endowed bunny servant! If you were any less mentally sound, you'd be building a special sacrificial altar dedicated to them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looking good, Alex-sama!\" it took the thumbs-up approval from servant of the goddess herself to finally snap you out of your trance!<br>\r\n\"Y...You too, Reisen....sama,\" you repaid her approval ten-fold. You then turned to Big Yumi herself who was having a very hard time giving you eye-contact because she was still shy about what she was wearing. \"Yumi... you look amazing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y...you think so?\" Yumi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Judging by the way his tongue's unrolled half way across the room, the answer's 'DUH!' \" Tewi just had to butt in, but she would be right if you were a Looney Tunes cartoon character! \"Honestly, Alex doesnt just fail to keep a sense of male pride, but he cant even manage to show a sense of modesty around lovely women! Ugh, can you believe just how shameful our poor little Al just made himself today? .....Uhhhhh.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTewi's eyes kinda widened as she noticed Reisen and Yumi were too busy staring oddly at you to acknowledge her. And by odd, I mean Reisen's red eyes were widening as she was panting heavily as she was gazing your way while Big Yumi's glasses seemed to give off an eerie twinkle as she trembled a bit, not noticing the drool running down her lip! Perhaps they were just as excited to see you in your bunny girl suit as you were to see them in THEIRS!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UGGGHHH!\" Tewi groaned with disgust, \"I'm surrounded by weirdos! So help me if you pervs humiliate me in front of the ad agency...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat reminds me!\u201d Reisen spoke up, \u201cthe ad crew wants us to get our pictures taken to put on fliers.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cPICTURES?!\u201d you cringed out of fear that certain people would be seeing those fliers! And not just Anna or Mikaela\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep,\u201d she continues, \u201cand to save money, the princess is having us all to go in pairs! Each two girls getting their pic together. And well\u2026 everybody else has their partner, so that just leaves us!\u201d<br>\r\nYumi's eyes widened from realization, \u201cOh! So that means...\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYep!\u201d Both Reisen and Yumi turned their heads toward you.<br>\r\n...Suddenly, that fear just miraculously vanished! For the time being, it didnt matter WHO was gonna be looking at those fliers! As long as it meant an opportunity to get your picture taken alongside the tall bunny-girl goddess or her lovely bunny-girl servant, that's all you cared about!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww crap! How come I didnt get the memo?!\u201d Tewi whined! So she's lacking a picture-partner as well! Talk about convenient! Well, lucky for her, she can just take the girl you didnt pick!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuestion is, who do you choose to get your picture taken with?</span></div></div>",

Aladdin was my favorite Disney movie, I loved the setting and the mythos it revolved around.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat disgusting hollywood perverted cartoon written by illiterate infidels did not do the proud glorious mythos justice,\u201d Ash suddenly got a bit defensive.<br>\r\n\u201cMy favorite Disney movie was Mulan,\u201d Yumi interjected. Sadly, Secret Female Wei Warrior Yumi was not nearly as breathtaking as Belly Dancer Yumi, \u201cit was also based on an actual historic events.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo it wasnt,\u201d Serenity asserted, \u201cit was based on an old chinese ballad in the 11th century.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhich derived from her legend recorded in Yan Xiyuan's 'One Hundred Beauties'!\u201d Yumi quipped.<br>\r\n\u201cThat only referred to Chinese women of folklore,\u201d Serenity quipped, \u201cnot historical documentation.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat was typical how historical documentation was recorded back then!\u201d Yumi remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them bickered and you were too busy zoning out over Yumi as a belly dancer. All the while, another particular bunny girl in bunny girl attire was rushing over after overhearing awful news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPst! Hey! HEY!\u201d you finally snapped out of it when you heard someone quietly calling over to you from behind the doorway. Sure enough, it was OTHER bunny goddess you were lusting over, peeking out from the doorway jerking her head her way. She certainly didnt have to tell you twice!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it, Rei-sama?\u201d you didnt even realize you gave her such a formal address out of nowhere. She totally notice and briefly swelled up before quickly resuming her panicked expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBad news!

Oh dear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY...yeah\u2026.\u201d you were beginning to panic just like Reisen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just overheard the princess talking with one of the ad agents,\u201d she took a deep breath and continues, \u201cthey're gonna have a couple of us serve as waitresses there.\u201d WAITRESSES?! As if you werent already embarrassed by sporting this stupid ensemble (and getting awful used to it after seeing Reisen and Yumi sporting it as well!), now you gotta bring it out in public and bus tables?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Wait a minute!

She knows way too much about me! She knows my freaking family name! Oh god, I can still feel that creepy ass gaze of hers gaping into my soul!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReisen. Reisen!

If the princess even finds out that Junko and us crossed paths, she's gonna wonder why! Then she's gonna find out about\u2026 you know\u2026 that deal between me and the skank.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we'll just need to keep our distance,\u201d you suggest, \u201cdont give direct eye contact and try to stay in the background as often as we can.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHEY YUMI! THAT BUNNY-GIRL'S TRYING TO MAKE OFF WITH YOUR GUY AGAIN!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you can hear the familiar shouting of Big Yumi's #2 fan (you became #1 ever since she wore that bunny girl outfit!). Apparently Yumi and Serenity needed a 2nd opinion on the historical accuracy of Mulan, so they got her on the phone and as she was giving her totally unbiased opinion, she caught sight of you and Reisen! ...Not sure why Sumireko's in a bunny girl costume too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-YUMI-SAMA! THIS ISNT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE!\u201d Reisen got incredibly defensive.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat does it look like?\u201d Serenity asks, not getting the picture.<br>\r\n\u201cLike Rei-Rei over there was trying to get all touchy-feely with Bunny Babe Yumi's other bunny babe!\u201d quipped Sumireko before Yumi groaned and set her phone to mute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyways, you seemed pretty jumpy,\u201d despite her nosey fan being too nosey, she did notice something was up.<br>\r\n\u201cJ-Jumpy?!\u201d Reisen kinda lost control of her voice, \u201cme?!\u201d<br>\r\n \u201cYeah, is something wrong, Reisen?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSomething we need to know about?\u201d Serenity got suspicious herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you gave a quick glance at eachother before answering...</span></div></div>",

As you coughed, you wondered what she meant until you remembered Marcus! You didn\u2019t want to believe it, but you told the driver to go back to Eientei. As you got back, you saw blood trails and saw Marcus with blond girl in white skirt and white knights armor.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n \u201cMarcus!? Why?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry man, junkos order.\u201d Marcus apologized, \u201clet\u2019s head back, saber.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cY-yes master.\u201d She replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Marcus got the smoke bomb and hit the ground, making a smoke. Once gone, they vanished. After you got in, you saw patients and bunny rabbits hurt, even eirin! You got to her and she looked at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cMr.whitestone..Junko knows where Lady Kaguya is...\u201d eirin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You were mad as the Eientei crew came back with Yumi and Serenity, you got so mad you blamed....</span></div></div>",

You've passed some check points and once you've got through security, you passed the prison cells, seeing some people inside and you got to other elevator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"How long it will take?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Soon.\" Man replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You two got in and door closed then got up. After a minute, it stopped and door opened, revealing a hallway and you two walked them you stopped ar the door. The man orders you wait and went inside. After two minutes he came out and tools you in. You saw a normal looking office and you immediately saw Simon doing some paper work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Simon!\" You spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He stopped what he was doing and looked at you. Yoj were mad at him for what happened at the bamboo forest, then Simon leaned back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'm glad your awake, alex.\" Simon said, \"tell me, is your eyes showing rebellion?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"How did you know I was at gensokyo? And where's the others!?\" You demanded to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Simon took out a cigar and clip the end. He lit the cigar and once he huffed, he leaned forward the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"The interpol hired me, ezikiel and jack to look for unusual area to find criminal, and I found gensokyo.\" Simon said, \"as for others, they are in prison.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You got mad and tried to get to him but the young man grabbed you so you couldn't go near him. You hated this as you were now in prison, you wanted to get out. Simon just smoked his cigar and put it down, then stood up and walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"If my brother, your father, didn't make pact with that filthy gangs you've gotten a great life.\" Simon said, \"thank goodness my predecessors captured his sorry ass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What? He-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"He's in this prison, serving time.\" He interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You were mind blown that your father was alive. After few minutes, door opened revealing another man in uniform. He saluted to Simon and spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Me.Whitestone, the fairy continue to resist your demand.\" Man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Continue to torture her.\" Simon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yes, sir.\" Man replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He saluted and left. You had one person on your mind on who this fairy was and you asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It was..,</span></div></div>",

You gasped in horror as they walked, the guard pushed her down to the floor very strong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Anna!!\" You shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Anna didn't say anything as she got up slowly, Simon walked toward her and stood infront of her. He then grabbed her throat and lifted her up as you struggled with no hope, Anna looked at him with no emotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You filthy monster, ruining the life of civilians and their children..\" Simon said, \"how does it feel to be at the hands of mortal humans?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Anna didn't say anything then spat on his face. Simon slammed her to the ground and kicked her stomach hard. You shouted her name as she coughed up blood, Simon wiped off the spit and looked at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'll tell you something Alex. This is a pure example of what happens if a monster or a freak of nature tries to be tough.\" Simon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n This made you snap, making you struggle and break free from the guard and stealing a gun then shot Simon four time on his chest. The second guard started to shoot you but you dodged and shot his head, then stole the keys to the shackles and freed Anna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"We'll be ok, Anna.\" You whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You picked her up and started to run as few minutes later Simon rose from the ground, melting the bullets through magma and went to the desk and pushed the button hidden under the desk. You were running with Anna then suddenly an alarm was rung.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 'Prisoner escape, prisoner escape. All personnel must be ar their destination'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Shit.\" You mumbled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Just then, you saw a man hiding his face with skull mask appear. You didn't know who he is then Anna lifted her head, then got off from you. The man bowed to her as she was breathing heavy, she kept her cool.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"Did you free the others?\" Anna asked.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n \"Yes master, certain people have been freed.\" Man replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She nodded, despite herself wounded. He told you to follow him to the meeting point and both of you did follow him. The surroundings had many prison cell and many others, that you believe both you and Anna would get out alive. There were guards stood in your way, but a man threw a dagger at their throat, killing them within minutes then after 15 minutes of running, you three got to the huge open room made of thick mirror, revealing fishes swimming around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What...the hell?\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, so the prison is under the ocean.\" Anna said lightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Wait, is that even possible?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Just then, you saw Marcus, adalgar and Anastasia calling your name. You were glad they were alive and well, and once you three got to them, they greeted you and Anna with respect, then Anna turned to adalgar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Are you ready for escape?\" Anna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"It'll take some time, but we can escape to gensokyo.\" Adalgar said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You were happy to hear that and he told everyone to back off. Once did, he turned around, taking out a hatchet and started to chant some incantation then suddenly, a magic circle were summoned and he continued to recite the incantation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I hope reisen and others arn't worried.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Anna didn't say anything until a huge noise were made. Everyone except adalgar turned around and saw the three wise men and the personnel come in. You knew they would come, then both Marcus and Anastasia came infront, summoning their guns and your sister got off from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Anna?\" You spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Just then, she summoned a rocket launcher and shot a round toward them. It hit them, killing few guards and they continued to fight while adalgar continue to chant. Simon gotten low on patience then turned to ezikiel and jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Let us commence assault.\" Simon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"About time!\" Ezikiel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Jack nodded then he swiftly used his power and mad a javalin made of pure ice and threw it toward Anna. You got frightened but Anna dodged the attack while ezikiel sent shockwave but Anastasia summoned a metallic rod and threw it, preventing it to hit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"How long it's gonna take!?\" You asked adalgar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Few more incantation, and we're home free!\" Adalgar replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hurry up!!\" You demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Just then, you saw Anastasia summoning a grenade launcher and shot few rounds, exploading at the enemies, making Simon and others stunned for moment, the adalgar breathed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Open! The gate to the other world in the name of Uruk!\" Adalgar shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He then swiped the hatchet fast and the huge gap were opened. You saw a familiar building then it struck you: it was eientei!! You were relieved to see this then from afar Jack what's going on and gotten annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I will not allow it!!\" Jack shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He then spedly ran and were infront of you, ready to engulf you in ice. You were unable to move as he was too quick. Before he could touch you, you were pushed away by Anna. Your eyes opened wide as Anna smiled at you, jack pounced her, engulfing her lower body with pure ice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Anna!!\" You shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Go! You must live!!\" Anna shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Just then, Simon came forward as Marcus grabbed you to go with him, you refused to go without your sister. Simon was smoking and looked at the changeling, then scoffed at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You're brave and strong for living this long, you damn fairy.\" Simon said, \"now I will punish you for all the evil you've done.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"Bite me, asshole.\" Anna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He puffed smoke, turning his arm to magma and swiftly punched her chest. You're eyes were open and blood and fire splatter the ground, Anna fell to the ground. Marcus grunted as Anastasia holder her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Anna..? Anna!? ANNA!!!\" You shouted in despair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to go now!!\" Adalgar shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were in total shock and Marcus picked both you and Anna up and ran as Anastasia shot few rounds of uzi and they all went in the void, and it closed. Simon and others didn't speak for moment then Simon turned around and looked at ezikiel and jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"We missed them, but we will find them again.\" Simon said, \"get to work.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n They nodded and everyone left the scene.</span></div></div>",

You looked at them then turned to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"They...are my loyal..assassins...they will now..be under..your care.\" Anna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She then closed her eyes and breathed her last breath. You cried as Eirin and others grieved at her. 30 minutes later, all of you made a grave for Anna with elven star symbol on her gravestone.

She told you that you alone cannot go there since it's protected with barrier. You wondered how you could go there then Eirin turned to reisen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Reisen, I want you to guide Alex to hakugyokuro.\" Eirin said.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"Yes, master.\" Reisen replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You were happy to hear that she'll help you get to the place, then you saw the three assassin come to you, telling you they'll follow you. You told them to be here in case something happens, and they understood and obeyed your word. You then had idea that you could take one ally with you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Any one of want to come with me?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'll stay back, since I'm kind of tired.\" Marcus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You nodded and decided to take..</span></div></div>",

She had short silver hair with green dress on as she noticed you three she stopped training.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cReisen? I didn\u2019t expect you to come here. Do you have business here?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cActually, Yes youmu.\u201d Reisen replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n (So her name is youmu) you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Reisen explained to her what happened and she listened.

But in all honesty, youre still worried about Reisen and what Maeve may or may not have in store for her. And after seeing that grizzly, albeit gorgeous, form last night fast asleep in your bed, there's quite a bit of her that you know nothing about. For the meantime, you wanna keep an eye on her and you'd way rather not run the risk of putting your sister's adopted daughter in danger of her should she lose control. It's bad enough youre getting yourself involved!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there's no way youre gonna say all that to Anna! If she thinks youre worried, she'll probably relocate you somewhere else and youre sick of constantly hoping from place to place just to hide from Le Fey!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Anna,\" you quickly come up with a different excuse, \"but I promised Reisen I was gonna help her deliver a few things to the Human Village.\" Reisen's ears raised as her eyes sparked with interest your direction.<br>\r\nAs soon as you said the R-word, Anna gave the bunny girl next to you a suspicious look. Crap, you didnt mean to get HER in trouble with sis!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s just to pick up some medicine,\u201d you lied to her, \u201cthat\u2019s all.

Bye Auntie Reisen!\u201d Reisen\u2019s bunny ears twitched hearing that.<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t call her that, Viv,\u201d your sister whispered to her kid.  You thought it was cute at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as soon as the two left the two, Reisen did too!<br>\r\n\u201cHee!! Did you hear that, Al?! Did ya hear that?\u201d she squeaned with delight, \u201cshe called me Auntie Reisen!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI heard, Reisen, I heard,\u201d you tell her, still feeling pretty bad about refusing to babysit your niece. You know it\u2019s the right thing, but you arent able to feel good about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell what are we waiting for? We cant keep standing around,\u201d Reisen picked up her things, \u201cthat v-dealer wont be sticking around forever!\u201d Time to burst her bubble.<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going, Reisen,\u201d you had to let her down.<br>\r\n\u201cBu\u2026but you just told Anna-\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt was a lie, ok?\u201d you tell her,<br>\r\n\u201cWhy did you lie to-\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNevermind that!\u201d you cut her off, hoping not to give away the truth, \u201clook, I just don\u2019t want you going to some shady dealer and putting bad drugs in your system, ok?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ill bunny girl smiled sweetly, clearly taking your affection the wrong way.<br>\r\n\u201cAww\u2026 you really care that much for me?\u201d she said with a blush. You bite your lip and just let her believe what she wants to believe.<br>\r\n\u201cOf course I do!\u201d you answer, \u201cit\u2019d be an awful waste if I let such a young pretty energetic woman like yourself piss her life away being a junkie!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 heh\u2026 not really young,\u201d she scratched her head and gave a slightly embarrassed smile, \u201cand honestly, I kinda really need these vitamins.

Theyre too weak and they taste incredibly nasty. These vitamins that DO work, master refuses to stock them cuz she thinks theyre too strong! But when I take them, they make me feel much better. I\u2019m not stressed out, I\u2019m not panicking, I'm relaxed and full of more energy, I\u2019m not going into violent rage fits, I\u2019m not hurting people almost beyond repair!\u201d GEEZ! WHAT THE HECK IS WRONG WITH THIS SCREWY RABBIT?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dont believe me, I'll prove it to you!\" Reisen pulled out a little bottle of blue pills.<br>\r\nYou raised your eyebrow, \"What are those?\"<br>\r\n \"These arent meant for me,\" she explained, \"the dealer gave them to me for free and said they work great for males. Something about 'increasing male enhancement', whatever that means.\" Oh dear. She gave him THOSE kind of pills?! Your eyes widened, having a bad feeling what she's planning. \"Go ahead take one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, no thanks,\" you immedately turn her down, \"I-I shouldnt be taking those!\"<br>\r\n\"Dont worry theyre perfectly safe,\" she assured you, although you noticed an odd twinkle in her eyes, \"I swear you'll be better than ever when you take one.\"<br>\r\n\"No, I'm not taking one of those. Sorry Rei-\" for some reason,  you had a hard time looking away from her twinkling red eyes. They were particularly twinkly this time around. So intriguing. So beautiful. So intoxicating. You just couldnt look away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put one in your mouth, Alex-sama,\" she whispered. Her voice echoed through your ears and ran circles around your mind. You had suddenly forgotten why you didnt want to take those vitamins.<br>\r\n\"Yes, Reisen,\" you obediently plucked a little blue pill in your mouth. Hm... blue raspberry flavored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Swallow it,\" her voice echoed and the eyes twinkled. You happily swallowed that pill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReisen quickly gave an arm thrust and muttered 'YES!' under her breath. Immediately after getting that out of her system, she took your hand.<br>\r\n\"Let's head back to my room,\" she whispered with a smirk, \"and see if that lucky little pill made you feel better?\" You had absolutely no intention not to.<br>\r\n\"Absolutely Reisen,\" you obediently followed her as the pill worked it's magic into your system...</span></div></div>",

You quickly realized that reisen used some sort of stronger version of viagra or something and was about to call someone until reisen pushed you back to her  bed. You then started to feel hot in your chest as your heart beat little faster and your manhood was getting more stiff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"My, oh my! I guess that medicine is a strong kicker.\" Reisen spoke<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"It's...too strong!\" You spoke with heavy panting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Reisen noticed your stiff manhood and smiled. She quickly unzipped your jeans and pulled everything down including your underwear. Your manhood was stiff and was tall and excited now thanks to the drug, and reisen was blushing little and came closer to it. Your mind was mixed with confusion as reisen gotten closer, she opened her mouth and covered your manhood with her mouth. Her wet tongue and her moist mouth was perfect for her to do some exciting job as she started to suck on your manhood. It felt good for you as she was sucking your manhood with perfect syncro, you felt more and more excited by this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Reisen...it feels....good..\" You spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"It does, doesn't it?\" Reisen replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She sucked your manhood little more harder, then she stopped it. She then got up, pulled her pantie down revealing her glory hole in front of you. She had some purple forest down their but it was trimmed nicely and you noticed her second lip was moist. Reisen giggled as she was becoming more and more excited, she leaned toward you and smiled in front of your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Lets make this day a perfect day for us.\" Reisen said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She then put your manhood into her glory hole. It was warm and wet inside her as you somewhat could feel her cervix with the tip of your manhood. She started to go up and down, humping you with all might. You felt the urge rising more as both of you were having a marvolous time: Doing the deed with in reisens room. You sweated and the urge was getting into climax as your manhood was becoming more and more stiff, getting ready to shoot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'm going...to cum!\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Haa...Haa....I'm cumming...I'm cumming, I'm cumming, I'm cumming, I'M CUMMING NOOOOW!!!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n With the scream reisen shouted, your manhood spewed the love juice into reisens uterus. It shot like an volcano as it wouldn't stop for moment, reisen continued to hump more to feel the climax within hers. After few second of climax, she laied down on top of you with smile and sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"That was....just good, alex-sama.\" Reisen said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yeah...\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Your head was blank as if you didn't care what Anna would say or do if she finds out that you screwed the bunny girl. You then noticed that your man piller was still active and it was strong. Reisen noticed it as well and smiled as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well well, I think we need more time to ourselves, won't we?\" Reisen spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Just before you could say anything, you two heard someone slamming the door open.

You and reisen was confused on why she was naked until you immediatly noticed her crotch being moist and dripping with love juice. You and reisen realized she was watching you two humping together and masturbating on it. You were surprised to see this but reisen was annoyed by this and got off from you. You could feel the air circulating your hard leg that still active, reisen came to the loli bunny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Tewi! were you just watching me making love with alex-sama!?\" Reisen asked with some anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hey hey, udon-chan! you know I'm a girl too, and you're hogging up the only male here?\" Tewi responded with smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You wanted to say something but you noticed that reisen would not take anything from you so you just didn't say anything.  Reisen became more upset and stomped her foot as tewi laughed sarcasticaly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'm not hogging Alex-sama. He wished to become my mating partner!\" Reisen said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I don't recall him saying anything.\" Tewi replied, \"But anyway...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She then trotted toward you and jumped on top of your lower abdominal area. You felt her wet area touching your manhood as you saw her cunningly smiling at you, she laid on top of your body, touching your chest with her finger. You felt shiver from this, telling yourself your no pedophile but the drug that reisen gave you were still strong and tewi giggled lightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hehe, guess udon-chans did her best. But now you're doing with me now.\" Tewi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"TEWI!\" Reisen shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Reisen was about to pull her aside from you until tewi told her to give her ears. Reisen didn't want to but gave in and gave ears to her. Tewi whipsered to her ears as you didn't know what she was saying. Reisen nodded and blushed for second, then smiled. She got off from tewi and then went to the desk and got the tissue. She wiped herself down there and once she threw the tissue away, she came back and got on top of your face. You could clearly see her womanhood and her butt showing before your eyes and reisen spoke to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Don't worry alex-sama. We'll handle this in fun way.\" Reisen said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What are you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"We're going to do this the fun way, ok?\" Tewi interrupted your speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You then felt the tewis womanhood touching your manhood. It was slow at first and you felt the bunny girls tightness but within second it went in, breaking her hymen and it went full in while reisen put her womanhood on top of your face. You couldn't breath well as tewi started to hump on you, reisen started to rub her womanhood through your nose. You were getting more and more excited by this as you heard both reisen and tewi panting lightly and the humping was slow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"This feels...good..\" You spoke lightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I can see, alex-sama. we'll make this day a great day!\" Reisen said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'll help out get your desire.\" Tewi replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The two bunny girls then started to hump more faster as they started to feel the climax. You felt the urge of climax as well as tewi was humping up and down more and more faster, hearing reisens moaning more louder. Your manhood was getting more and more stiff until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'm..cumming..I'm CUMMING!!\" You spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'm CUMMING I'M CUMMING NOOOOW!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n With both tewi and reisen shouted the word in unison, your manhood shot alot of stuff into tewis womanhood as reisen splashed her love juice on your face. All three of you felt the climax as it twitched many time, then relaxed afterwords.  You felt as you wanted to get out but the drug was still kicking in and reisen looked at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh alex sama, we all should have fun until that drug fades away..\" Reisen said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yeah...\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n All three of you continued to have a good time and it took...</span></div></div>",

The phrase 'time flies when youre having fun' was no more an honest statement than during your fancy little pow-wow with three eligible bunny girls. You've completely underestimated the resolve of a youkai and perhaps they underestimated the resolve of a strong-willed human like yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo many hours passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGranted, Tewi gave up and fell asleep after the first two-three hours, possibly because despite her true age, her youthful body still has it's limits. The rest of the time it was you and Reisen continuously going at it nonstop like nothing else in the world mattered. To you, nothing else did besides Reisen.<br>\r\nThe quick and nimble movements of her hands and legs, her perky breasts that jiggle exquisitely when she bounces, her luscious lips sucking on your senstive tip, the squeals she made when you hit her sweet spots, her plump ass that made squelching sounds made whenever your thighs smacked into it, the way she twitched and thumped the floor with her foot when you nibbled her bunny ears, and of course the way her glowing red eyes seemed to never leave your sight when you were at it. It was phenomenal. She had even stopped calling you 'Alex-sama' and started calling you 'my buck' (ie, 'Feels good, doesnt it my buck?' 'Yes, my buck, harder!' 'Let it all out in me, my buck!) despite you not even knowing what a buck was! The number of orgasms you had just didnt matter because the urge never faded. The urge continued. The urge never wanted to end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, despite the urge, the rest of your body tired out long before your excited member ever did! Fortunately, Reisen seemed to tire out as well and fell fast asleep in your arms... her serene smiling face stained with your jizz.<br>\r\nBut by the time you could finally relax and take a break, you noticed the clock and saw over TWELVE HOURS had passed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy crap! 12 hours?!\" you forced yourself, carefully lifting Reisen's head off you and leaped out of the bed, gathered your clothes, and quickly put them back on! You limped out of the room, exhausted and incredibly sore. Not even the insanity workout made you feel a fraction as bad as this! And no sooner were you aching did your Superego finally decide to return from vacation!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you limped awkwardly down the hall like your were jive-walking to the Bee Gees' 'Stayin Alive', thoughts of the tremendous sin you have just committed raged into your mind! You didnt just fuck a nurse and/or mental patient in need at this hospital, you fucked TWO of the nurses and one was practically a kid! How the hell are you gonna explained this to Anna and Eirin when they find out? And theyre gonna find out. There's no way they COULDNT get pregnant after the tumbling you gave them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuuucckk...\" you groaned in pain and in worry, \"fuck! Fuck! Fuck me! What was I thinking?! I cant support a couple of babies! I dont even have a job here! Why did I have to take that stupid pill?! Damnit, I'm so screwed...\" <br>\r\nSpeaking of, all the while there was still quite a tent pitched in your legs screaming 'IT WAS TOTALLY WORTH IT!'<br>\r\n\"Stop it!\" you mutter to your erection as you rearranged your pants, but it was not going down, \"stop it already! C'mon, cut it out!\" It's not long before you get awkward stares from onlookers.<br>\r\n\"Whether youre a brother or whether youre a mother, youre stayin alive... stayin alive!\" you fool the onlookers with your singing and phony jive-walking all the way to the shower room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take your time washing the filth of those bunny girls off you (and pluck some hairs out of your teeth!). Despite the shower being relaxing, you still feel miserable the entire time, still having perverted flashbacks that would no doubt get you kicked out of Eientei if not possibly arrested. And worst of all, your stupid dick STILL remained erect and ready to service whoever and whatever despite the rest of your body saying no! Even the coldest shower couldnt calm it down. Hell, you were even fantasizing a second round with Maeve!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was in that blue pill?\" you wondered as you stared at your crotch in disbelief, \"if Viagra did something like this, it would be recalled!\" With the last moments of the shower, you thought of what to say when others get suspicious (and if Reisen starts calling you 'buck' instead of 'Alex-sama'!) But the more you thought, the more you thought nothing but Reisen and what you did to her and what more you want to do to her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease tell me this effect isnt permanent,\u201d you hoped as you put your clothes back on and walked out. Maybe this is comeuppance for putting Reisen in danger\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! Anna's brother!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd lo and behold, someone was waiting for you just outside the door. Oh goodie, it's Kaguya. The Princess that even the head of the Eientei is working for. The boss of the boss of those bunny girls you've ravaged the hell out of!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rearranged your pants to hide the awfully big erection before facing her. \u201cY-Yes? What is it, Ms. Horizon?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat's Houraisan-sama!\u201d she corrected you, \u201cThe Inaba girls were supposed to be fixing my cable this afternoon and they never got around to do it!\u201d You swallowed hard. \u201cI know Tewi's not in her room, but I kept knocking on Reisen's door and she'd never answer it!\u201d Wow\u2026 she didnt hear the screams the three of you were making earlier? Reisen must have some pretty good sound proof walls in her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh?\u201d you pretend to be naive, but Kaguya already knew something was up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou were seen with those two last!\u201d she knew, \u201cwhat exactly were the three of you doing the last couple of hours?!\u201d Well crap.  Aside from having a harder time hiding the beast downstairs just THINKING of what you were doing the last couple of hours, you get the third degree from the Princess in charge, herself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to think hard and fast. Could you come up with a convincing lie? Or would it be best to just come clean before you get in any more trouble than you already are?</span></div></div>",

Besides, youre not entirely to blame. You were drugged.Hypnotized and drugged. So technically, you were raped! YOURE THE VICTIM, HERE!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sweated, twitched your lip and did your best to conceal your erection before taking a deep breath and answering Kaguya's question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou see, Horseman-sandra\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHourisan-sama!\u201d she vented in correction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-sorry,\u201d you apologize, \u201ca-anyway, I was with Reisen and Tewi last.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDoing what?!\u201d she questioned you with suspicion. With every last ounce of courage you had to summon, you answered the question as truthfully as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was sleeping with them.\u201d Kaguya's cold eyes widened after you said that. \u201cWait! What happened was\u2026 well, Reisen was offering me one of these blue pills she had...\u201d Kaguya gave a different suspicious glare as you continued. \u201cI refused, but then somehow I couldnt stop staring into her eyes and suddenly happily swallowed the pill and\u2026 then she and I were going at it\u2026. then Tewi joined in, and then next thing you know, I was mating with them for about 12 hours. And I didnt have a condom.\u201d That did not feel good confessing, but perhaps it was necessary to get that monkey off your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnbelieveable!\u201d Kaguya rightfully fumed and stomped around, \u201cdamn that filthy pill-popping perverted Udonge! Even after Chang'e knows how many times I stepped up to the bat for her, she's STILL pushing drugs?! I told Eirin we shouldve had her fixed! Maybe then she wouldnt be so-wait.\u201d Kaguya suddenly stopped stomping and turned your direction with a curious look on her face, \u201c...Twelve hours?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being just as flabbergasted as she was, you answered, \u201cYes.\u201d<br>\r\nThe lunarian princess stared at you in complete shock. Not anger. The anger looked to be gone from her facade. Now she was stricken with disbelief. Still\u2026<br>\r\n\u201cHourisan's mama, I am deeply DEEPLY sorry for-\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cA lowly earthbound human\u2026 was honestly able to continuously mate with my two subordinates for 12 straight hours?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cEr, yes.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAnd that part of you is STILL enthusiastic?!\u201d she pointed to the bulge in your pants you neglected to hide! You cringed in embarrassment and to no avail readjust your pants to cover the uncoverable! Seriously, that thing of yours could wave down a cab in New York!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while, the wheels in Ms. Hourisan's head were turning faster than ever!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is incredible!\u201d Kaguya exclaimed to herself out loud, \u201cfor once, that Udonge's unhealthy addiction is actually a spectacular benefit! One simple pill and he managed the strength to sire offspring for at least 20 female moon rabbits!\u201d<br>\r\nHer sudden interest felt awfully uncomfortable. You should be happy she didnt get p.o'ed at kick you out of the hospital or make rabbit stew out of Reisen,  But now, youre having bad feelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is a tremendous opportunity!\u201d Kaguya was stating out loud, \u201cwith such a prime surrogate buck, I'll have a massive army in no time! No longer will daddy have to pay tributes to that insane witch and her spawn of circus freaks and traitors!\u201d HOLY CRAP, IS SHE DECLARING WAR ON QUEEN TITANIA?! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMr. Whitestone, you are just the kind of person the Lunar Kingdom needs to free our people!\u201d your paled as she began to plead, \u201cmy pets-I mean subordinates are brave, strong, fearless soldiers, but they are slowly diminishing in numbers their species lacks the significant number of males to breed with.\u201d A really awkward time to receive a history lesson on moon rabbits! \u201cWhich is why I need you to impregnate as many of my subordinates as possible to ensure more future soldiers to fight for the Lunar Kingdom!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWh\u2026.wh...wha\u2026.you...\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI think the average amount of babies a moon rabbit can birth per cycle is 3,\u201d Kaguya starts doing the math, \u201cso if I put you up for breeding at least 12 hours a day with 2 moon rabbits per half hour, I should have at least 52,560 new potential soldiers by the end of the year!\u201d Good lord! Anna seriously didnt sign you up for this, did she?!<br>\r\n\u201cDont worry Mr. Whitestone,\u201d Kaguya states before you could get a word in, \u201cI'll make sure our head doctor Eirin properly treats you so you dont get any toxicity from Reisen's fertility pills.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBut-\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat reminds me!\u201d she cuts you off, \u201cwith so many new soldiers, we're going to need more doctors to treat their injuries! EIRIN! GET OVER HERE! I NEED YOU!\u201d Must she shout so close to your face?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn her beckon call, Eirin rushes over to the princess.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it, princess?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\nDear ol' Kaguya did not hold anything back, \u201cYou still have fertile ovaries, dont you?\u201d One hell of a tactless question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-O-Of course I do!\u201d Eirin got on the defensive, \u201clast time I check, which happened to be very recent, I still have the body and energy of a woman just a fraction my age!<br>\r\n\u201cGood,\u201d Kaguya turned to you and pointed to the doctor, \u201cMr. Whitestone, impregnate her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHAAAAAT?!!\u201d both you and Eirin blurted out in unison as loudly as possible. Kaguya didnt flinch a bit from the screams, although you saw blood dripping down her ears.<br>\r\n\u201cYou heard me,\u201d the most ironic statement yet, \u201cEirin, as your liege, I order you to mate with Mr. Whitestone and breed as many potential future doctors as possible.\u201d Your face went red, but for some reason, you raised no objections. Part of you wanted to see where this is going.<br>\r\n\u201cP-Princess, y-you cant be serious!\u201d the doc attempts to talk sense into her, \u201ch-he is not only a patient in need, but your client's own brother!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAnd her brother has bounds of potential to rescue our people from practically enslavement!\u201d exclaimed the princess, \u201cdo you have any idea what kind of reproductive dexterity he has when you give him one of Udonge's illegal drugs?!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIllegal drugs?! Is she STILL-...ugh, a-anyway, y-you know I cant-WE cant ask him to do something like that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut Eirin, we NEED the army,\u201d Kaguya gave her doc a serious look, \u201cthe Lunarian Kingdom is going outnumbered and running low on funds. Junko's tribute demands are only getting higher and higher! Daddy cant afford to keep paying her not to level our kingdom to ash!\u201d Eirin got eerily silent while her liege continued, \u201csooner or later, we need to stand up to her. And we need the soldiers necessary to do so. As well as more doctors and nurses to look after those soldiers!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou may be ignorant on their situation, but you could see the intensity in Kaguya's eyes. She was dead serious and Eirin knew it. Eirin was at a loss for words, it seemed like there was no way she could argue it. You couldnt blame her. If you were in her shoes, you'd probably be just as speechless. Not that you arent already!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, there was an awkward silence and you still didnt bother saying a word, because you sorta got a slight kick out of watching Eirin blush and sweat.<br>\r\nIt wasnt until Eirin finally raised a finger to ask you a question before breaking the silence, \"Um...Mr. Whitestone? Er... how... forgiving is your sister?\"<br>\r\n\"Not very,\" you gave her an honest answer. Anna almost choked Reisen half to death, youre sure Eirin wont be in any better shape if she were to suddenly barge in on you two at it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Whitestone,\" Kaguya pleaded, \"on behalf of my family, my kingdom, my people, and my pets-I mean subordinate, I cannot stress enough how important your cooperation is. In exchange for your refuge from Le Fey, we ask that you offer your assistance in liberating ourselves from the tyrannical divine spirit's maw!\" ...By impregnating your doctor? Then again, you are being hidden away from your old employers for practically free. It doesnt seem very fair on their end, does it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, youre still aching, and youre awful sure that if and when Anna finds out... well, it's probably gonna be a messy scene.<br>\r\nDare you?</span></div></div>",

Youre not sure you can put up with any more! A dozen girls in one go is ENOUGH for one night!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully for your current mortal shell, Eirin and Reisen werent noticing you. They seemed too concerned with whatever they were doing. Despite the thoughts of the worst case scenario filling your mind, you couldnt help but eavesdrop. It was like a natural impulse for you. Reisen scooted up close to Eirin anxiously while her master was eyeing a little tiny thin device in her hand uneasily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat's it say, master? What's it say?\u201d the overactive bunny girl quick, trying to peek over.<br>\r\n\u201cNegative,\u201d Eirin said with a disappointed sigh and a spirit-broken frown on her face to match, \u201cI'm not pregnant.\u201d Oh\u2026 that's what it is, huh? Aw, that look on Eirin's face was really tugging at your heart strings!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDont give up,\u201d Reisen tried to cheer her boss up, \u201cI'm sure you'll get a baby real soon if you keep at it.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI think it's too late for me,\u201d the doc said with defeat in her voice, \u201cI'm already past my prime. I dont have nearly a fraction of the energy all the girls around here have anymore.\u201d She tossed the little device in the trash.<br>\r\n\u201cDont say that!\u201d the bunny girl remarked, \u201cyou've gone more stamina than any one of us put together! Youre strong, smart, resilient, and you got a gorgeous bod that even the princess is secretly envious of. Seriously, I overheard her!\u201d That's for sure. She sure had a smoking body for a woman her age! ...Er, how old is she, anyway?<br>\r\nEirin chuckled, \u201cThanks, Reisen. But not even supermodels can escape the inevitable course of age. Maybe I shouldnt have devoted so much of life to my studies and actually gone out and mingled a little more. I just have to face it. My biological clock stopped ticking a long time ago.\u201d She tried to keep a straight face, but you could tell her heart was breaking. You'd rush over there and give her a big hug if you werent worried they were gonna double-team you until you died of a heart attack and drug overdose!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo it hasnt!\u201d her loyal subordinate disagrees, \u201cyou still have it in you! You just have to mount Alex-Sama a few more times! Youre sure to have a bouncing baby girl or boy in no time!\u201d You almost hyperventilated hearing that! Fortunately, Dr. Yagokoro wasnt that eager.<br>\r\n\u201cI almost threw out my back fucking him that ONE time!\u201d she exclaims a little louder than she shouldve, \u201cI dont know how you and Tewi do it, but there's no way I can go at it for hours on end!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReisen just giggled and smirked and her ears twitched. You got a bit suspicious of that response and so did her master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that?!\u201d Eirin questioned as the cheeky bunny girl smiled slyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWeeeelll\u2026.\u201d Reisen rolled her eyes, \u201cif you REALLY wanna know my secret\u2026 I know of this special super secret drug shop that sells really good 'vitamins' for 'endurance enhancing'!\u201d Uh oh.<br>\r\nSure enough, Eirin was not amused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReisen, youre still skipping on your meds and buying illegal drugs?!\u201d she was steamed, \u201cI specifically told you hundreds of times not to do so!\u201d<br>\r\nThe bunny girl lowered her ears with shame (TEMPORARY shame) \u201cI know I know\u2026 but they are VERY good drugs! Seriously, Eientei could really use the kinds of medicine they have to offer\u2026 especially now that we're in such short supply!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cFor the last time, we're NOT going to a black market dealer!\u201d Dr. Yagokoro adamantly refuses, \u201cif the princess's father ever found out we stooped to that level, we would lose everything!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBut master, we've got an incredibly low stock now that you dumped out all the tainted stuff!\u201d the bunny drug pushed pleaded, \u201cand this store has practically everything we need for all our needy patients!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWe're not going that route!\u201d snaps the doctor, \u201cnow never bring it up again!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk ok,\u201d Reisen was smart enough to back out, BUT... \u201c...but I'd at least consider checking out the hormonal drugs they sell-\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cREISEN!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWait, master! Hear me out!\u201d she pleads, \u201cthere's this one drug they sell call 'Venus Infinity'. It's an outrageously strong hormonal enhancement for females and it guarantees 100% fertility or double your money back!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cJust a useless sells ploy with fine print that goes on for miles,\u201d Eirin shrugs.<br>\r\n\u201cBelieve me, it isnt!\u201d Reisen shakes her head vigorously, \u201cI know of one 80 year old human woman from the Human Village bought a bottle\u2026 and only months later, she gave birth to twins!\u201d The flying hell?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was so unbelievable, even Eirin did a double take, \u201cTWINS?! From an 80 year old human?!\u201d<br>\r\nReisen nodded, \u201cYeah, and obviously human females about their age are LONG past their baby-making prime! If a wrinkly old prune like her could still make babies, you'll have NO problem!\u201d<br>\r\nThe doctor squinted her eyes and sneered\u2026 but she seemed pretty speechless. It looked difficult for her to flat out brush off such a potential improvement after hearing such an unbelievable anecdote!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEr...\u201d she moans, \u201c...I\u2026 guess\u2026 this place might be worth browsing. JUST browsing! And if you tell ANYONE about this..\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI wont tell a soul! You have my word!\u201d the bunny girl winks, \u201chang on, I'll call Mr. Hokuo and see if the store's open today.\u201d<br>\r\n'Hokuo'? That name rings a bell. ...Didnt Anna used to go to a doctor named Hokuo? The medicines he prescribed to her were pretty shady\u2026<br>\r\nNah, it's probably a coincidence! There's quite a lot of people out there with the last name Hokuo! Probably plenty of doctors named Hokuo, too! ...Are they plenty of shady doctors that prescribe shady drugs most likely not approved by the FCC named Hokuo?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuffice to say it sparked your interest. Must be a small world if Anna's friends have ties with your new friends here. Whether it's a good thing or a bad thing remains to be seen.<br>\r\nPart of you feels like tailing Eirin and Reisen and find out how deep this particular rabbit hole goes. The other part of you is too exhausted and doesnt feel it's any of your business and just wants to take a nice quiet nap!<br>\r\nDespite your body being a little weak, your mind and will are still strong. Should you follow these two in secret later and find out more about this Hokuo and his most likely not legal drug store or ignore it, finish your shower and get some rest?</span></div></div>",

Spying and infiltration was kinda one of your specialists in Le Fey. And Hokuo is bad news.<br>\r\nIt certainly wouldnt hurt to keep a close eye on Eientei's head doctor and your drug-pushing bunny-rapist in the shadows and make sure they dont go down certain routes you've been trying to steer clear of. Anna would understand. Then again, she might try to kill Reisen afterward, so you better come up with a good explanation for her later!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo being careful to tread carefully on the wet floors, you leave the shower stalls, tread carefully around the few bunny girls passed out in the hall that are still recovering from their fun time with you, and headed back to your room to get a new change of clothes, your fake elvin ears, your lens-less glasses, then glanced over in Tewi's room to snap a picture of the bamboo forest's trap layout.<br>\r\nAfter preparations were complete, you waited for Eirin and Reisen to get a good distance to assure them that nobody was tailing them before tailing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kept hidden away in the bushes as you followed the two on their trek toward the village. Thankfully you had no pursuers of your own. At least THIS time around. Your instincts were warning you not to wander these woods alone often and you knew better than you doubt these particular instincts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately you managed to find a group of tourists traveling on foot and found it pretty easy to blend in. Nobody suspected you even when you were putting on your glasses and pointy ears! Then again, maybe of the tourists in the group didnt resemble one another or speak the same language.<br>\r\nAnyways, you stuck with the group, pretending to be listening to their chatter until you got through the guards' checkpoint, then quickly broke from the group and continued tailing Eirin and Reisen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to listen in to their conversation, but all it consisted of was mostly \u201cSERIOUSLY? A human?! 80 years old?! Twins?!\u201d \u201cYep!\u201d \u201cI dont believe it!\u201d \u201cIt's true! Would you like me to take you to her later?!\u201d \u201cI'd rather not\u2026 I'm not even supposed to be here to begin with! What if Junko's goons are around?!\u201d \u201cNobody's gonna know! Trust me!\u201d except for a brief mention of this 'Junko' person, nothing of interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOccupied by your eavesdropping, you shouldve paid more attention to the road. Despite being called 'Human Village', barely any one you've come across was 'human'. Some had animal features and appendages, some had odd colored skin, extra limbs, extra eyes, extra heads, and so forth. At this point, it wouldnt be surprising if youre actually the only human left in this village.<br>\r\nNevertheless, you have to keep a cool head and pretend it doesnt scare you in the slightest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try not to give anybody prolonged stares as you continue tailing the rabbit and the doctor. Unfortunately, the two of them slip through a large crowd of people and you had to swim through that crowd, trying your best not to get lost. To your dismay, the crowd happened to be a crowd of big, drunk, bulky, fowl smelling oni! You knew from experience ala a job overseas that oni arent necessarily the easiest type to move out of your way. And they love to drink. And fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c!!!!\u201d<br>\r\nAnd sometimes get a little frisky like when one of them slipped their hand in your backpocket and gently caressed your ass right now! Like a frightened cat, you froze up and quickly jerked around! You assumed it'd be that tall muscular blonde oni girl in chains sipping a sake bowl, but she was a few yards away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe likely suspect standing right behind you was a pink haired girl in a white and green dress with a thorny rose motif panel over it, little chinese-style buns in her hair, and a bandaged cast covering her entire right arm from the shoulder to the fingers. She didnt look like an oni, not at first glance anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, the odd distant stare mixed with the blush was giving you funny feelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHic! What?!\u201d she suddenly got defensive, \u201cWhat's with that look youre giving me?!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cUh...um...\u201d you had a hard time coming up with an answer what with the grilling you were receiving!<br>\r\n\u201c...OOOHH!! I get it!\u201d she stated, wobbling a little, \u201c\u2026you think just because I'm the only person here standing behind you, you automatically assume that I'm the one that grabbed your backside!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cEr, I didnt...\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI'll have you know,\u201d she waves a finger in your finger like she's about to give you a lecture, \u201cthat I, Kasen Ibaraki, would never in a thousand years stoop to such a perverse low as to fondling an attractive foreign elven bystander's athletically toned backside! Shame on you for even considering such a disgusting allegation!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she vented her denial, you noticed Eirin and Reisen were moving further and further away! This Kasen girl is just wasting your time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHowever, I might be willing to overlook your unjust rudeness,\u201d Kasen continued, \u201cprovided you help escort me back to my house. I seem to have indulged myself a little too much in the *hic* refreshments consisting of fermented rice,\u201d in other words, SAKE, \u201cand as a result, I feel a bit too intoxicated to walk home by myself.\u201d<br>\r\nC'mon, youre gonna lose them! Hurry up!<br>\r\n\u201cIt would be an awful travesty if someone were to take advantage of me while I'm so vulnerable.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI'm sorry, ma'am, but I'm a little busy-\u201d aw crap, she grabbed your arm! Aw crap, she's got quite a grip!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA little busy to help a defenseless human in desperate need?!\u201d aw crap, she's offended! \u201cdo you pointy-ears not have any idea the kinds of dangers a frail intoxicated human girl like me have walking home all by myself?!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI-I-I'm really sorry, but\u2026 ergh\u2026 hey, that's a little tight!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou have some nerve, you insensitive treehouse cookie baker!\u201d now youre really regretting wearing the stupid elf ears, \u201cFirst you accuse me of molesting you, now youre flat out willing to ignore my plea for help?! I expected this selfishness from that emo elf girl at the bridge, but not from a handsome foreign passerby with a physique begging to be fawned, groped, and inevitably mounted by oni brethr-I mean oni strangers!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoure losing sight of them! You wont be able to catch up if you dont break away from this girl quick! You start to struggle in her grip, but Kasen doesnt even seem the least bit phased by it. It's almost as if she's got super human strength.

You were... pretty amazing yourself.\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks, sweet-thang!\" she said with a wink, \"if ya ever wanna take a break from that pill-popping rug-muncher, my room's just around the corner. I might not have the youthful stamina Reisen has, but just spend ONE night alone with me and I'll show you things that are too risque even for Eirin's private novels!\" C'mon, shouldnt you be repressing an urge to puke after hearing that?! Youre not seriously considering taking the bait, are you?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggled keeping a straight face as Tewi stood up on her tippy toes and kissed your cheek before darting off.<br>\r\n\"Nope! We're not doing that!\" you tell your pal downstairs who got way too anxious for his own good!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of anxious, word seemed to have got out awful fast about Kaguya's plan regarding you. On your way to the bath, you've tried your hardest to ignore the stares you've gotten from some of the workers here. To deny that word got out fast would not only be deceit, it'd be stupid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuite a few of the moon rabbit employees gave you friendly glances, one girl sweeping the halls gave you a smile, one girl bringing over a tray of snacks gave you a playful wink, in another room an older moon rabbit who looked to be teaching younger rabbits glanced your way and licked her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks to that brief distraction, you bumped into a nurse in the middle of bending over to pick up her papers!<br>\r\n\u201cOhh!!\u201d she let out what sounded a lot more like a moan than a surprised yelp! And instead of jumping up in surprise, she remained bent over with her bottom still pressed against you as if she was waiting for you to do something\u2026 OH! SHE THINKS YOURE GONNA-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I-I'm so sorry!\u201d you quickly backed away and apologize, \u201cI-I wasnt l-looking where I was going! I-I-I'll be more careful next time!\u201d You quickly sped off, glancing over at the disappointed expression on the nurse's face.<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026 Anna's gonna be pissed,\u201d you whispered to yourself, \u201cthere's gonna be a bloodbath, I just know it. She's gonna turn this hospital into a rabbit butcher shop.\u201d Those horrible thoughts lingered on your way to the shower room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...And you'd get even more free time to reflect on those horrible thoughts because somebody's already using the shower. Granted, there was more than 1 shower stall, but there was no specific section for men. In the middle of the steamy fog, you only saw one female figure currently washing herself in the shower room. Still, it was one too many for your taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC'mon, you knew this was gonna happen sooner or later,\u201d you whispered to yourself, \u201cit's a hospital full of just women and they only have a few rooms for bathing.\u201d You had a point. Sooner or later, youre gonna have to share a shower.<br>\r\nBut that was before you knew the princess expected you to be some sort of breeding stallion for these occupants! What, you think nothing's gonna happen if you waltz in there, strip naked, and get wet with another bunny girl?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face gone red as you felt like biting the bullet at this point. You've already done worse. You've already screwed the head doctor for crying out loud! Yep, youre already in a huge load of trouble, so what's another situation in the shower?  Whatever will be will be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bit your lip and tried ignoring the bunny girl's humming, wishing she would shut up so you can have some peace and quiet while you think!</span></div></div>",

You quickly know it was Anna's gun as you got out, you saw her standing with her magnum pointing. You didn't know why she was doing that until you saw someone came out from the bamboo forest. It was a male with black cloth and had some vein-looking things on his jaw area. You know who he was as he was adalgar, one of Maeve's men who were very powerful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Adalgar..\" You spoke as you came to Anna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Adalgar looked at you two and gave you two a dark smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"It seems you two have lived for long time.\" Adalgar said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What do you want? Did Maeve ordered you to come to kill me?\" Anna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Adalgar gave a stern look then chuckled. You felt a strong evil from him and then he spoke to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'm afraid Maeve and her gang no longer in operation,\" Adalgar spoke, \"after I slaughtered them with the power of Angra Mainyu.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n You heared about the name, but your brain didn't come up as adalgar smirked, he then gets covered with black/reddish things and it started to form as a larg worm. You felt fear as the worm were big, it was also ominous power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Now then, I shall kill you first Alex!!\" Adalgar shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The worm screamed and rushed toward you. You couldn't move by fear and as the worm gets closer, you felt someone push you to the side. You looked and saw your sister smile at you then gets hit by the worm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Anna!! No!!\" You shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  The worm rose and munched on then spat out, revealing half dead body of your sister and went back to its master. You felt anger by this and turned to adalgar as he was disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Man, I wanted to kill you, but I got that damn useless changeling.\" Adalgar, \"but oh well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He then saw many bullets fly at him and he dodged. You saw the eientei group come and defending you, then adalgar just smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well, Alex. It seems you have guardians. Now excuse me as I will spread the glory of Angra Mainyu.\" Adalgar spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He then drowned himself in darkness and fled. You became sad as you came to your half dead sister, eirin  came next to her and then looked at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"There is some vitals, I can save her.\" Eirin said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Please!\" You responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Eirin then told reisen to pick up the mess and follow her. You waited inside the building for at least 12 hours and after that you were called by Tewi that your sister is ok now. You thanked her and went to see eirin and once you meet her, she spoke to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Now Alex, I must tell you that ms.whitestones body were heavly damaged, I have put her old body into regeneration machine while I transported her brain to a clone body.\" Eirin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"A..clone body?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She nodded and when she took you to see her, you saw your sister in the clone of...</span></div></div>",

This bunny girl looked like a cross between Reisen and Tewi, or if Reisen and Tewi had a kid, or if you had a kid with Reisen and Tewi after their ovums suddenly merged into one. She had Reisen's body, Reisen's shape, Reisen's matching hair style, yet her skintone looked similar to Tewi, her eyes had a similar shade to Tewi's, the color of her hair was black like Tewi's, even Reisen's business suit was as pink as Tewi's dress with a carrot charm around her neck instead of a tie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared questionably at the sad bunny girl then took a glance over at Eirin then right back to the bunny girl.<br>\r\n\"Anna? Is that you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didnt answer. She was too busy holding back a sob. Her eyes quickly watered, her teeth clenched, and finally began bawling. It was rare, like once in a red moon, to see your sister cry. And when that happened, you had absolutely no idea how to make her stop. As you held your sister lovingly letting her sob on your shoulder you turned your head to Eirin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That body was the only one we had on short notice to save her brain,\" the doctor explained, \"she was a mixture of DNA between my two hardest working employees. She possesses the physical strength and maneuverability of Reisen without the uh, mental imbalance, as well as the intelligence of Tewi without the rather unnecessary desire to make everyone miserable with her pranks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look what they done to me, Alex!\" Anna continued to sob, \"my body! My physique and beauty! My goddamn species! Gone. All gone... now I'm a fucking Frankenstein creation!\" It's even worse that she had to be in the body of the two particular girls you were <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The body her brain is currently in,\" Eirin continued, \"was originally part of a Hourisan experiment to increase Lunarian soldiers as well as preserve the moon rabbit race by means of combining existing DNA and creating clones... but... well, you came along and offered your... *cough* ..assistance...\" The bunny girl with the brain of your sister glared at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anna, let me explain-\"<br>\r\n\"I already know the whole sleazy story!\" she cut you off, \"honestly, if I didnt owe her my life, I'd have crammed that pretty braided pony-tail into a trash compactor!\" Eirin gulped. \"Also...\" Bunny Anna lowered her head, \"it's my fault that Eientei was attacked. I shoulda known better than to trust that fucking Persian.\"<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" you asked her.<br>\r\nAnna's bunny ears lowered along with her head in shame, \"A while before we fled Le Fey, I made a pact with Adalgar and tried to forge a coup against Mo..Maeve. Maeve caught wind of it pretty fast. I thought Adalgar sold me out.... but I guess it turns out he had his own plans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady Kaguya is incredibly upset that you almost compromised our sanctuary location to OUR enemies,\" Eirin nagged, but flinched as soon Anna gave her a cold glare with Tewi's eyes, \"er...um, anyways, I'm afraid the only reason she hasnt expelled you from Eientei is because your brother agreed to aid us in the eventual liberation of the Lunar Kingdom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna gritted her teeth angrily. You knew how badly she wanted to beat the crap out of Eirin, but she's what is keeping her alive and the remains of her original body from decomposing.<br>\r\n\"It's not like I can call up a few friends for help,\" she groaned, \"nobody's gonna recognize me like THIS. Ugh, of all the bodies I have to be in, it just had to be the one resembling those two filthy sluts. How long do I have to wait until my real body's recovered?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid it might take longer than I originally hoped,\" the doctor admitted, \"that attack she received left behind remnants of some dark Zoroastrian energy trying to eat away at it. Sadly, I'm not well educated in Zoroastrianism. Now if it was Athenian or Spartan, those I'm familiar with. But not ancient Persian\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, that would be my luck,\u201d Anna scowled, \u201cnext thing youre gonna tell me is that your boss wants me to fuck my brother to breed more of her filthy army.\u201d Your eyes widened when you heard her spout that.<br>\r\nWorse even, Eirin looked pretty uneasy. Dear lord, she didnt say she wasnt going to! She just didnt answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEr, anyways, Lady Kaguya wants to have a word with you later,\u201d she suddenly changed the subject, \u201cshe's rather upset with you at the moment, so I'd recommend easing on the tone.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I'm so goddamn scared of that pampered neet,\u201d Anna rolled her eyes, \u201cwhere are my cigarettes?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYoure not allowed to smoke while youre using that body,\u201d  Anna banged her fist against the wall when Eirin told her that, \u201cand because we still need to preserve it and keep it in tip top condition until your body recovers, youre going to be going on a special diet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as soon as Eirin says that, a young short blue-haired bunny girl rolls in a cart with a glass of bubbling white liquid.  It looks like boiling milk, but youre awful sure that it's definitely not. And even if it is, it's probably not from a cow or any animal that youre aware of that lactates!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour diet will mostly consist of my patented vitamin shakes. Not only because theyre delicious and very nutritious, but it's practically the only thing that body can easily digest at the moment.\u201d<br>\r\nAnna cringed with disgust at the drink.<br>\r\n\u201cIt smells worse than the Nutraloaf they serve down at the State Pen!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat's because it's made from the healthiest parts of various youkai. The liver, kidneys, intestines\u2026 also part of a bull youkai testicle, because it's rich in protein.\u201d ...I uh, honestly squinted my eyes as I typed that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, by the way!\u201d the young rabbit girl reached into her suit pocket and pulled out a bottle of vitamins, \u201chere are the Folic Acid supplements you asked for!\u201d<br>\r\nEirin gulped hard as Anna's Tewi eyes stared coldly her way.<br>\r\n\u201cTh-thank you, Reisen II!\u201d hm, another Reisen, eh? \u201cc-could you see Mr. Whitestone to his room? Anna and I need to have a private talk about the Persian mythos.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young rabbit girl nodded, \u201cYes master! This way, Mr. Whitestone!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWe'll talk later, Anna,\u201d you tell her just as Reisen II grabbed your arm and dragged you off. And boy did she have a heck of a grip! She's almost as strong as Reisen I!<br>\r\n\u201cYeah...\u201d you heard Anna mutter. That new body of hers will take some getting used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, you have a situation of your own you need to deal with. Your personal escort was leading you down the opposite end of the hallway where your room is, she's holding your hand an awful lot tighter than earlier, and she's incredibly fidgety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026 the room is in THAT direction,\u201d you correct her.<br>\r\n\u201cUm, er, I-I-I'm\u2026 t-taking a shortcut!\u201d she stuttered anxiously<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShortcut to WHERE, Little Reisen?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEEP!!\u201d Reisen II flinched with fright like Eirin did with your sis, and quickly let go of your arm and smiled innocently like she just got sticking her hand in your pant-I mean the cookie jar!

You better hire a better one.\" Adalgar said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \".. Who are you? Why did you come here?\" Person asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Adalgar didn't say anything and evilly smirked as from behind two people came in. It was wakatsuki no yorihime and wakatsuki no toyohime, two lunarian princesses. They were brutally bruised and bleeding bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Lady chang'e! Stay away from him!!\"  Yorihime shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"He is pure evil!!\" Toyohime shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Then suddenly two shots were made, and when they fell it revealed Anna...but she was different as she had black dress and had dyed yellow hair. She puts her saw-dust shotgun away, revealing the vein looking thing on her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You didn't..kill them?\" Chang'e asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Stunned, to be correct.\" Adalgar replied, \"after all, I'm pretty tired after killing half of that rabbit soldiers and extinguishing their fire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Chang'e were speechless and one of darkened rabbit came and informed that one of the lunarian escaped. Adalgar ordered to send five darkened rabbit soldiers to track the escapee and kill it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n -eientei- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n It was getting late as it was almost dinner time and you've just finished having your 50th climax on the two bunnies.

He took some bullets but then a goo got to his wounds and healed it, making ran shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Don't think I'm stupid enough to get hurt easily, fox bitch.\" Adalgar said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Who are you? And what purpose do you have in this world?\" Ran asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Adalgar didn't say anything until a darkness rose up. Once gone, you were shocked to see your own sister on his side. You didn't know why she was there then adalgar noticed your confusion and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Your wondering why that useless changeling is with me.\" Adalgar spoke, \"simple, there were little chunks of her organs and her right leg in the maw of my worm, so I have fiddled with it and voila! It became powerful right hand woman!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You've gotten mad and was about to hurt him but ran stopped you. You felt weak that you couldn't do anything then five darkened lunarian soldiers were summoned and adalgar clapped his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh I wish I could stay, but I must get these two goddess's flame put out.\" Adalgar spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" stop!!\" Ran shouted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Ran was about to fire but the lunarian soldiers blocked her then adalgar and his companions faded into darkness.

Reisen leaned in close toward Reisen, still keeping that smile on her face as Reisen began to sweat and shiver! You looked over to Reisen then back to Reisen and back over to Reisen one more time and sensed an awful lot of hostility between Reisen and Reisen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-M-Ms. Udongein Inaba!\" the younger Reisen stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just where exactly did you think you were going with Alex-sama?\" the elder Reisen questioned, her smile was less sincere and an awful lot more intimidating at the moment.<br>\r\n\"I...I...I was just... he-helping him to his room? L-L-Like Master Eirin ordered!\"<br>\r\n\"REALLY?\" the mentally ill and incredibly stern bunny girl questioned her junior, \"that's not the direction of his room. In fact... that's actually the direction of YOUR room.\" Reisen II got more and more uncomfortable. You wanted to step in, but the tension coming off of your druggy friend was a bit too much even for you!<br>\r\n\"If I didnt know any better,\" Reisen's smile widened, showing teeth, \"I would think you were attempting to mate with my Alex-sama.\"<br>\r\n\"I-i-i-...\" the poor girl looked helpless, \"...w...we...b-b-but the Princess said we all got to-\"<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" Reisen tilted her head and her bunny ear twitched.<br>\r\n\"Th...l...\" Reisen II swallowed, \"Lady Kaguya said we could share him!\"<br>\r\nYou heard Reisen I's knuckles crack!<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Little Reisen, I didnt quite hear that,\" Reisen smirked and her eyebrow twitched, \"what did Lady Kaguya say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe poor short haired hopefully not mentally ill bunny girl shivered, dare not mustering the courage to repeat herself. \"N....nothing. She didnt say anything.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh. Ok then,\" her superior's tension finally eased, \"well then, if you'll excuse us, I'll be escorting Alex-sama to his room, then!\" And with that, she grabbed your hand and escorted you with her.<br>\r\n\"W-Wait! That's not where his room i-\"<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" Reisen turned her head back to Reisen II, who quickly shut her mouth.<br>\r\nReisen II lowered her head, \"Nothing, Ms. Udongein Inaba.\" Sheesh. Poor girl. Even as the two of you walked away, she still stood there with her head hung low. You could feel her self-esteem practically crushed under her senpai's shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you really have to be so rough on her?\"<br>\r\n\"You dont have to worry about her,\" Reisen assures you, \"the sooner the lower-ranks understand their place, the better.\" Cold as ice. Despite her rather mean side, she still showed a bit of compassion to you and your sister. \"I'm really sorry about what happened to your sister. But dont worry. She'll be just fine. Master knows what she's doing.\"<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" you thanked her, \"and I'm really sorry about the whole Adalgar debacle. We'll do whatever we can to make sure trash like that doesnt sneak into Eientei again.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou wont be doing it alone,\u201d Reisen added, \u201cI myself know quite a bit of Persian culture from Zoroastrian to Ismaeli Shi'ite. I'm also very fluent in Farsi and will do whatever it takes to help your sister get her body back!\u201d  Aw, that's so decent of her\u2026 she's really a good girl, you know, despite raping you for several hours straight! \u201cIn the meantime, Anna will enjoy being a moon rabbit! Keen eyesight, long life, strong immune system, enhanced strength and intelligence\u2026 she might not wanna turn back.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we'll see,\u201d was your only response to her statement, \u201cbut thanks for your help. We're gonna need it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReisen smiled as she opened the door to her room and invited you in. You knew what was coming (and even worried a little about potential Maeve influence!), but like with Gilgamesh and the spear, youre ready for it and embrace it!<br>\r\nYou try not to be TOO distracted by the flashy neon signs and the casino music in the background as you kept your focus on the bunny girl.<br>\r\n\u201cSorry to drag you here,\u201d she said, \u201cyour room's kind of a pig stye right now. And I had absolutely nothing to do with it, I swear! (this time)\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt's alright,\u201d you say, \u201cit\u2026 kinda reminds me of Vegas.\u201d Ah, the nostalgia.<br>\r\n\u201cWell feel free to make yourself comfortable\u2026 again,\u201d Reisen's face blushed, \u201cI'm gonna go get us some drinks. I wont be gone for long!\u201d She dashed off, leaving you to bask in the ambiance of her casino-theme bedroom alone. Your sister probably never knew of your secret gambling addiction and this was kinda the perfect place to revel in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldnt decide what to do first. Play some cards? Spin the roulette wheel? Pull the lever on a slot machine?<br>\r\nHey, how about checking out the room that's marked 'VIP Only'?<br>\r\n\u201cDont mind if I do!\u201d you say to yourself as you opened the door. Unfortunately, it just turned out to be Reisen's closet. Although the clothes she had on hangers were awful intriguing to look at. She had way more than that simple business suit and skirt. She had a neatly cleaned nurse's outfit with matching cap, a slightly dusted and worn out military uniform with the name tag in unfamiliar language, a pretty pink kimono that youre sure she'd look great in, a cute sailor school girl uniform for some reason, a bunny girl outfit...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou squinted your eyes staring at the bunny girl outfit. It even had the the matching bunny ears and bunny tail.<br>\r\n\"Huh,\" was all you could muster spouted as your mind was briefly blown.<br>\r\nAnywho, Reisen's wide variety of unique clothes went on from there. Not sure if you could consider many of those to be practical and more 'cosplay', but to each his or her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter skimming through a dozen of her hung clothes, ending with a power rangers uniform and a kaiju suit, you were gonna leave the 'VIP Only' room... until you spotted something at the very end of the room that was next to impossible to unsee. You stared blankly and unblinkingly for quite a bit of time, practically speechless at the sight. Dont blame you, considering youre staring at...</span></div></div>",

Despite her clearly drugging you and raping you along with her little comrade for dang near half the entire day, you seemed quite a bit relieved to see her after what's been going on with your sister. Stockholm Syndrome, perhaps?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReisen's ears twitched upon hearing your footsteps and she quickly turned her head your direction and smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Master! Hi Alex-sama!\"<br>\r\nEirin just hmphed suspiciously as if suspecting something was off.<br>\r\n\"Hi Reisen,\" you greeted her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's your sister doing?\" was the first question she asked, \"is she alright?\"<br>\r\n\"She's doing better now,\" you answer, \"it's not exactly the uh, recovery she wanted, but she's in far better shape now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course she is,\" Reisen says, \"that's because Master's looking out for her. And there's nobody on the planet that can save lives quite like her. Anna-chan will be good as new in no time flat.\u201d<br>\r\nYou believe her. It was a godforsaken miracle AND an ungodly miracle she managed to properly place your sister's brain inside another well-functioning body. Dr. Frankenstein could take notes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEirin, instead of being flattered, just stared sternly at her mentally ill patient and subordinate.<br>\r\n\u201cBy the way, Reisen,\u201d the doc was quick to dominate the subject, \u201cit's awful late in the afternoon. Did you remember to take your morning pill?\u201d<br>\r\nReisen's ears and eye twitched upon hearing that question. Suffice to say, she was no good at making a poker face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cU-uh-uh, I was\u2026 just about to right now!\u201d the bunny girl quickly pulled out a pill, popped it in her mouth, then washed it down with some tea. Then she cringed at the godawful taste that came with it. \u201c...There! Done!\u201d Not good enough for Eirin, unfortunately.<br>\r\n\u201cReisen, I shouldnt have to constantly remind you every day to routinely take your medicine on time,\u201d she lectured, \u201cthe last thing we want is another one of your 'episodes' occurring because you forgot to take a pill. And you know what we have to do when we have to treat you too late.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReisen tensed up in her seat. If you had to make a daring guess, you'd say she was clenching her butt cheeks. Yikes.<br>\r\n\u201cI know\u2026 I know..\u201d the rabbit girl whined, \u201cbut could you at least add some sort of flavoring in them? They taste horrible and they leave a nasty aftertaste that doesnt go away for hours! I've eaten expired K-rations when I was serving that didnt taste as foul as those pills!\u201d Well, god help you if YOU ever get sick!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will admit that our current tablet medicine cabinet is certainly peculiar tasting,\u201d Eirin states, \u201chowever, that's because they have preservatives necessary to ensure very VERY long shelf life. And if the mere price to pay to ensure we have good medicine that lasts a long time is taste, so be it. And I cant afford to tarnish such preservatives with any artificial colors or flavors.\u201d It was a battle of words that Reisen could not win. Of course that means that Reisen will most likely still get her drugs elsewhere\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave you tried mixing it into your food?\u201d you offered a suggestion, \u201cthat's what we used to get our dog to take his medicine when he hated to just take the pills themselves. We just mix it in the middle of his dog food and he scarfs it down without even realizing it.\u201d You realize it's incredibly silly and perhaps offensive to compare Reisen to your dog\u2026 but to be fair, even your dog handled being in heat better than her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI've tried that on a lot of moon rabbits,\u201d Eirin answered for her, \u201cdidnt work on any of them. They've got far too keen a sense of smell and could easily sniff the pills out and pluck them right out of their food.\u201d So they got a keen sense of smell to go with their keen sense of hearing.<br>\r\n\u201cIt's a major survival factor that gives us moon rabbits an edge!\u201d Reisen brags, \u201cthese noses of ours are trained to sniff out unknown intruders, poisonous additives in our food and drinks, and even nearby fires, armaments, and mines hidden on a battlefield!\u201d Makes for a damn decent marine! \u201cBy the way...\u201d Reisen's cheeks started getting red, \u201cyou smell really good today, Alex-sama...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldnt fight off your own blush from her flattery and obvious invitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReisen,\u201d Eirin got a bit cross with her subordinate, \u201cneed I remind you that he's still a valued guest here?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cRight, right!\u201d Reisen nodded obediently, \u201cAlex-sama, I'm really sorry about the teeth marks I left on you the other night!\u201d Eirin cringed as your face got even redder. \u201cIf I had known the princess was planning to share you with others, I swear I would not have tried to mark you like I did!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReisen, did you seriously bite him?!\u201d Eirin questions as you showed her Reisen's faint teeth marks on your back. They didnt hurt but\u2026 well, if a somebody walked in on you shirtless, theyre probably gonna be at a loss for words.<br>\r\n\u201cJust gently!\u201d the bunny girl with loose lips noted, \u201cI didnt draw blood, honest! I only used enough force to show that he was my buck and no one elses.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm gonna try REAL hard to pretend you did not just do that!\u201d Eirin was doing her damndest to keep from blowing her top, \u201cbut only because Mr. Whitestone and I are far too busy to come up with a suitable punishment!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAre you gonna try to impregnate yourself with him again?\u201d Reisen made an educated guess.<br>\r\n\u201cOf course not!\u201d Eirin said with a blush, \u201cthat\u2026 official order by the Princess has already been fulfilled.\u201d It wasnt an 'official order' to suck you off! \u201cNow I'm just waiting for the results of the test to come through.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh c'mon, you cant stop at just one time,\u201d Reisen couldnt stop, \u201cyou should do it at least 20 times to make absolutely sure!\u201d Now twenty sounds like an awful lot\u2026 but you kinda lost count how many times you and Reisen went at it.<br>\r\nEirin was having a really really hard time not losing her cool, \u201cTw-twenty ti\u2026 urghh...\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDont worry about hurting Alex-sama,\u201d the wascally wabbit kept on going, \u201che incredibly resilient! He's got more stamina in his human blood than all of my fellow GI girls put together!\u201d Not gonna lie. You still cant wrap your head around how you managed to mate with that mentally ill veteran for so long!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReisen, am I gonna have to put you back on the suppository regiment again?\u201d Eirin warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC-Can Alex-sama be the one administering them?\u201d both yours and Eirin's eyes bug out after hearing that pervy bunny-girl spout out, \u201c...I can only ask that you please be gentle. That hole is still virgin and very sensitive. ...A-although it might help if you were to stick your tongue in there, first...\u201d WOW. Kinda hard not to unhear that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI should probably have you checked for sexually transmitted diseases as well,\u201d Eirin murmured to you.<br>\r\n\u201cHEY!\u201d Reisen understandably took offense to that notion.<br>\r\n\u201cAnyways, speaking of drugs,\u201d Eirin added, \u201cMr. Whitestone, I could use your assistance. Since Tewi's not in today, I need an extra hand dealing with some special customers. A few buddhist monks from Myouren Temple wish to finalize an opium deal with us.\u201d Opium? OPIUM?!<br>\r\nBy the way, Reisen, you do know what day it is, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! Right!\u201d Reisen nodded, \u201ctoday's the monthly opium shipment to Hakurei Shrine!\u201d MORE opium?! <br>\r\n\u201cIs everything packed and ready?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cUh huh!\u201d Reisen nodded again with enthusiasm, \u201ceverything's counted for!\u201d With that, she was heading off, \u201cI'll set up and start leaving right after I take a nice warm shower!\u201d Her red eyes glowed your direction as she said that. A familiar enticing glow. \u201cSee you later, buck-sama.\u201d her voice suddenly sounded more alluring than earlier. You couldnt help but eye the enticing spring in her step as she left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cAlright, help me get this place organized,\u201d Eirin ordered you, slightly snapping you out of your little daze, \u201cthe monks will be here soon.\u201d</span></div></div>",

After few minutes of organizing you saw the doc holding couple of bag filled with greenish brownish stuff inside. You knew that it was indeed a processed opium as you did remember seeing drugs sold between Maeve's men's and the locals in secret areas. After tgat, one of the rabbit came in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Doctor yagokoro, the monks are here.\" Rabbit spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, let them in.\" Doctor replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She nodded and eirin asked you to come with her as the witness in the work. You nodded and followed her to her doctors room and after few moment a yellow/brown haired female with a unique dress came in, accompanied with a grey haired girl with mouse ears and a tail! You were just silent as the two female greeted the doctor, they noticed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Doctor yagokoro, who is this young man?\" Yellow eyed female asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"He's Alex Whitestone, special guest living with us for specific reason.\" Erin responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I see, greetings!

They talked about the daily life and the medical check up, then finally after eirin jotted down on the paper, she handed over the processed opium to nazrin, then Shou handed over a small bag of money toward her. Eirin nodded and put the money to the side. As the two monks were about to leave, they started to sniff and turned to you. You had some bad feeling as they came close to you, they sniffed your body from head to toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Um...excuse me, why are you sniffing me?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Mm..the fragrance is just perfect...mellow, with hint of cinnamony spice..your smell is good.\" Shou spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Indeed, I haven't smelled this for quite while.\" Nazrin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You flustered little then eirin spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies, please refrain yourself from our guest.\" Eirin spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n They did, but they immediately resumed sniffing your body like if they were addicted to drugs. Eirin then gave an evil vibe, causing all of you to flinch and they got of you. Shou and nazrin stood up blushing and thanked the doctor for the opium then Shou turned to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I hope we can meet again, Mr.Whitestone.\" Shou said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Y-yeah.\" You replied hesitantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n They bowed and left the scene. You were glad the business were over and saw eirin counting the money then put it in the safe. You were glad to see the business went well and eirin stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I think I'm going to take a quick break, you can have free time.\" Eirin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Alright, thanks eirin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n After she left, you left as well.

You had slight idea what your sister did as you came close, Anna noticed you and put the cigarette on the bin and turned to your attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey Anna.\" You greeted uneasily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hi.\" Anna replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You felt little uneasy but at the same time you were used to seeing your sister naked since you had embarrassing memory that you bathed together with her when you were very young. She always helped you with scrubbing your head and your body from neck to your toe (specially your man hood since she says it's the dirtiest part, but I digress) and once you were old enough to bath together and told her you can bathe together,she was little disappointed but respected your decision. When you and Anna worked together under Le Fay, you saw her naked body when she was asleep most of the time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hey Anna? Why're you and Kaguya naked?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I wanted to test out this body so I gave the neet princess sex education.\" Anna replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She rose her blanket, revealing a sex toy from dildo to vibrator. You didn't know where that came from and Anna explained her accomplance took some from a shiny room that the door that just wrote 'Reisen' on it. You breathed in and out heavily, having idea on who the property owner is. You then wondered if Kaguya would be mad for doing this and turned to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Anna, don't you think princess would be mad?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"She agreed to mate with me since both me and her wanted to know more about the body I am currently in.\" Anna replied \"and it's not as bad as I expected.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What about Dr.Yagokoro? Reisen and others?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Aside from that rabbit whore, I'm sure Dr.Yagokoro will understand as the princess have agreed to test out the body.\" Anna responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You sighed and Anna asked you if you could help her get up and take her to shower room so she could clean herself. You were aware that she couldn't do that by herself so you offered to help her take shower. She chuckled and accepted your offer as you helped put pantie on at least and lifted her onto your back to give her piggyback ride and walked. After few minutes of walking, you two got to the shower room and you put her down. You unclothed yourself and once you revealed your naked body, Anna chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You surely changed, Alex. I still remember when your third leg were like a tic-tac.\" Anna said with smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Whatever Anna, let's go in.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lifted her up and went in. You were told by eirin that the shower room were communal ms it had medical soap, shampoo, bathtub filled with warm water fused with herbal essence and it also had a sauna.

Much like earlier, something was attempting to draw you toward her and resolve her obvious lonesomeness, but you tried your damndest to hold back for Anna's sake!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" speaking of which, Anna notice the widened distant look you were giving. Thankfully, she couldnt see where you were looking!<br>\r\n\"Uh... nothing!\" you assure her, \"just... I'm just a little paranoid somebody might be watching us and get the wrong ideas, if you know what I mean!\" Not a bad cover. 8.5 out of 10, even!<br>\r\n\"Tsk! Like I care who's watching,\" she groans with impatience, \"for all we know, all those bunny-earred lesbos are distant relatives of each other!\" Well, both Reisen and Tewi do share part of the same family name... but that's not a topic you wanna discuss right now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still...\" you try to maintain your composure but youre a bit too focused on Reisen running a bar of soap across her naked body whilst humming to herself, \"the last thing we need is even MORE pointless gossip!\"<br>\r\n\"Stop worrying so much and start cleaning me, already!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" you were more than happy to change the subject and you carefully sit your sister down on a bench while catching glances at the bathing bunny girl and pretend to watch for onlookers behind Anna, \"what shampoo do you want me to use?\"<br>\r\n\"I dont care,\" she wasnt picky. You look over at the brand of shampoo Reisen had poured on her head and ran down her long hair just before dunking her head in the water and went for THAT brand! If it's good enough for HER it's good enough for your sis!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou squeezed some shampoo out of the bottle with cute little bunny cartoon characters and kanji letters you cant read and poured them in your sister's hair, carefully spreading it out through each long strand.<br>\r\n\"This smells funny,\" Anna complained.<br>\r\n\"You said you didnt care what shampoo I use,\" you tell her, \"besides, I dont smell anything.\"<br>\r\n\"You seriously dont? Cuz the odors kinda burning through my nostrils!\" she complains some more, \"ergh... I dont think I'm ever gonna get used to this enhanced sense of smell.\"<br>\r\n\"Alright, fine,\" you get a bucket and rinse out the shampoo, \"better?\"<br>\r\n\"No, it's STILL lingering.\"<br>\r\n\"It'll go away,\" you tell her, \"do you care what soap I use?\"<br>\r\n\"As long as it doesnt reek like the shampoo did.\" For reference (TOTALLY reference), you try to make out the brand name imprinted on the bar Reisen was currently brushing up against her beautiful legs she was lifting in the air. You had carefully follow the soap bar from the end of her foot all the way to the beginning of her thigh still submerged in the water to make out the name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grabbed the 'Vatika' soap and brushed it up against a sponge and got to sponging on Anna!<br>\r\n\"How is this?\" you asked as you scrubbed her arms.<br>\r\n\"It's not bad,\" she shrugs, \"has a little bit of a chemical smell to it, though.\"<br>\r\n\"It smells all natural to me,\" you disagree.<br>\r\n\"Of course, youre a guy, you'd never understand,\" you ignore her as you continue scrubbing her. Shortly later, she sniffs again, \"...Uh... hey, bro? I thought you said you'd never do heroin.\"<br>\r\n\"I dont,\" you state.<br>\r\n\"Then how come I smell it on you?\" wow. Some enhanced sense of smell. Not even YOU can smell it on you.<br>\r\n\"Oh THAT? I think it's cuz Eirin needed me to help her assist an opium trade with a couple of Buddhist monks.\" Saying it out loud, it actually sounds absolutely ridiculous!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna squinted her eyes, \"What do a couple of Buddhist monks need with opium?\"<br>\r\n\"Hell if I know. I was just there to assist.\" For obvious reasons, you make no mention of the mouse and tiger girl getting way too interested in YOUR scent.<br>\r\n\"...Where does Eirin keep the opium?\"<br>\r\n\"No, Anna! Dont even think about it!\"<br>\r\n\"Aw, c'mon! I'm not gonna do anything! I'm just curious!\"<br>\r\n\"Forget about it!\" She scowls irritably as you continue scrubbing her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take your time scrubbing Anna's new body with the sponge not so much to keep her new body clean but more as an excuse to take as many glances as you can behind you at the naked bathing bunny girl who previously filled herself with your seed and may currently have one of your millions of little sperm cells stirring inside her ovum doing it's very best to create life! Besides obviously oggling her lovely body in all it's glory, you cant help but draw your view to her glowing red eyes every time theyre in your vision!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach time you gazed, you imagined it was her that you were currently sponge-bathing, carefully lifting her bra and scrubbing her cushiony breasts with your bare soap-soaked hands in a slow circular motion and even scrubbing her sensitive nipples until theyre squeaky clean!<br>\r\n\"Ooohhhh...\" your sister quietly moaned in a voice that reminded you more of that bunny girl over there. You continued imagining Reisen in front of you currently getting your soft soapy hands worked down her chest, all across her ticklish belly button, and then slipped under her panties.<br>\r\nYour sister who you pretended was Reisen gasped as she felt your fingers wriggling through her sensitive skin hidden by her colorful bush. She gasped even louder when your soapy fingers traced across her nether lips... and one even slipped in between them to ensure her inner layers were clean as a whistle!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh!!!!\" one loud moan from your sis was enough to snap you out of your trance and realize the type of outrageously shameful behavior you were showing!<br>\r\n\"S-S-S-sorry!\" you stuttered with your face all flustered with embarrassment, \"t-too much?\"<br>\r\nSurprisingly, Anna was panting, but was not complaining. \"Damn.... someone got ballsy. ...Maybe this new body wont be so bad after all!\" You swallowed hard and rinsed her off. By the time you were finished with Anna, Reisen was finally finished with her bath. You took your time drying her off with a towel only because Reisen took her time drying off her soaking wet body dripping from head to toe.<br>\r\n\"Will you stop looking over your shoulder? Nobody's watching us!\" Anna got a bit impatient with you constantly glancing back.<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I just... dont wanna take chances!\" you tell her.<br>\r\n\"Ugh, youre STILL gonna be such a prude even after getting all touchy-feely with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bite your lip and say nothing as you assist Anna with putting her clothes back on... all the while, wishing you could help Reisen clip on her awfully distracting blue and white striped bra... as well as properly adjust the cup area and er... motorboat her concealed breasts to properly test for comfort as the cottony alluring stripes fill your entire view!<br>\r\nBy the time you and Anna got fully dressed, you only caught less than second of the mesmerizing striped panties surrounding Reisen's hips before they were completely hidden away in her skirt, narrowly avoiding becoming enslaved by them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, that irresistible bunny girl left, though remnants of her irresistible charm remained in your mind. Nonetheless, you finally had no trouble carrying your sis off to her room without any distractions.<br>\r\n\"You think you'll be alright?\" you asked her as you gently placed her on her bed.<br>\r\n\"I'm more concerned about you,\" she tells you, \"god only knows what other filth that slovenly princess wants you to sleep with.\"<br>\r\n\"You didnt seem to have a problem with her when you were letting her test your sex drive!\"<br>\r\n\"Heh, and to be honest, her test was kinda low,\" Anna smirked, \"...maybe YOU can teach her a thing or two?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's it! That's quite enough of all that! Time to end this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye sis!\" you said goodbye and headed out.<br>\r\n\"Later bro!\" she called just before you shut the door. And that took care of that. With a sigh of relief, you headed over to your room to contemplate and mentally prepare for whoever else Kaguya's gonna have you sleep with.<br>\r\nSpeaking of which, the first girl of this place that got such a luxury still lingered in your head. Thoughts fill your head of heading to her room asking about her trip to Hakurei Shrine was, if you could go next time, where she managed to get her special drugs, how long she's been a drug dealer, where she got herself such bedazzling striped underwear, and many many other things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course the more you thought about her, the more perverted the thoughts got, so it's probably not a good idea to head to her room! The best option would be to return to your room and clear your head until youre called.<br>\r\nThen again, you've been pretty tensed up thanks to that bunny girl. Is it really such a bad thing to have her help you relieve said tension? ...Er, most likely through a civil discussion, totally not via another multi-hour session of banging! Nope! Not at all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUgh... make up your mind, already!</span></div></div>",

Too bad the humming was rather distracting. You pretend to pay it no mind while you occupy a shower stall, close the curtain, and undress. The warm water was very relaxing and it felt really good against the certain aching parts of you thanks to certain girls! The bar of soap had a nice gentle lavender scent which went well with the soothing warm water to ease your woes.

Like a siren's melody.<br>\r\nAs usual, you get too curious for your own and decided to take a gander over at whoever this woman was that had the lovely deep voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your curtain and quietly sneak over toward the stall the humming was coming from and as luck would have it, she didnt close her curtain! And as MORE luck would have it, the humming came from a familiar purple haired bunny girl with an unbelievable amount of stamina! And as even MORE luck (some possibly bad) would have it, Reisen had went through a change just like from last night!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly hide out of sight before this beastly amazonian possibly unstable form of hers could spot you. Thankfully it didnt, considering she was happily washing herself under the rain of her shower head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou really shoulda sneaked out of there while you had the chance, but you were not in the right state of mind to. Your frail male mortal mind was completely vulnerable to the magnificent sight of this lovely bunny girl's gorgeous grizzly form in all her glory!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReisen's lovely red eyes, despite being bloodshot, twinkled with the smile on her serene face while she happily bathed. You stared lovingly at her rather large jumbly tits now free of the uncomfortable restraints of her bra no doubt bearing milk of the gods! A boobjob from those babies would make any male die with a smile on his face.<br>\r\nYour eyes lingered down her toned and slightly ripped stomach, still filled with her seed you've spent several hours pumping into her! Her reproductive region wasnt in plain sight, although you did see the purple haired bush leading toward it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour conscious was locked up in a little cage in the corner of your mind screaming for you to get out of there before Reisen notices you! It reminds you of the damage she left to your room and demands that you imagine what she could do to your body if she spots you! Too bad nobody was listening to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReisen turned around facing away from you, giving you the best opportunity in the world to sneak out of there, but instead your eyes linger down to her plump backside even plumper and rounder than ever. You'd be lying if you said you never considered pounding her backdoor during that session hours ago, but you didnt wanna hurt her.<br>\r\nThe longer you stared at her bathing, the more and more you began to lose yourself. Rationality was fading and your conscious was getting harder and harder to hear. You didnt realize how much your fingers were twitching or how much drool was running down your lip. How you managed to keep yourself from rushing toward her regardless of how badly she could beat the hell out of you was a mystery!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she bent over to scrub her feet and you just lost yourself right there. Aside from raising her plump ass in the air, you caught a perfect view of her holy vagina you've become well acquainted with that was begging you to get reacquainted! A position like that was just asking to be mounted! You immediately thew rationality and life preserving instinct right out the window at you walked right into her stall! And without even thinking what you were doing, you ducked under her and pressed your lips between her legs!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAaAaAaAH!!!\u201d her deep voice let out a high pitched yipe. By the time she dropped her soap, you were already showing off that trick with your tongue to her pink vaginal lips! She leaned down and her terrifying yet beautiful bloodshot eyes locked onto yours. Normally, you'd start running like hell or at least constantly apologize over and over for surprise cunnilingus, but you were still staying right where you are and your disobedient tongue was still slurping where it didnt belong!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlEx...Sa...Ma\u2026.?\u201d she panted heavily, unable to speak clearly cuz of the work you were doing to her down there. You grasped her legs and felt them shivering as your licking intensified. You started to slowly smooch her little love-bead, making her gasp loudly! You gently licked and nibbled it, making her dig her sharp nails into the wall!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your work intensified, Reisen had an even harder time holding back her squeals! In no time, she rolled her eyes back and let out a long high-pitched (for a deep voice!) moan and you found yourself soaked in her love juices! You finally came out from under her and she quickly dropped to the floor shivering with ecstasy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever just possessed you to go down on Reisen in amazon-mode quickly vanished! Your eyes widened and you quickly went into terror mode after considering the consequences of your actions! Youre not sure what came over you, but you just did what you most likely would never do. Though it was kinda ballsy, it was incredibly reckless. Fortunately, she's so blissed out at the moment, you can see the hearts spinning around her head!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to disturbed, you wipe her pussy juices from your mouth then quickly but quietly head back to your shower stall to gather your belongings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProblem is your belongings werent there! Your clothes are gone! And before you could wonder where they went, you saw a soaked letter left behind.<br>\r\nIt read 'Ya want 'em back? Cum get 'em back! N bring dat tongue o' yers wit ya! ;p -Tewi'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh! That little brat!\u201d you growled. Shoulda known a cheeky little brat like her would do something like this! Wonderful. Now you get to walk outside naked and HOPE you can find her room to get your clothes back!<br>\r\nYou gulped hard, nervous about what youre about to do, but it's either that or stick around with she-beast Reisen and hope she doesnt recover any time soon. You step out of the stall breathing heavily, and look toward the exit, and cover your manhood with both your hands...</span></div></div>",

Then again, it could be due to the fact that Reisen is a former soldier (possibly suffering from PTSD), while Kaguya's only military experience was from Call of Duty. Maybe it's unfair to make such an equation, after all you werent cutting out early like you did with Eirin. But in all fairness, you had high expectations for someone of royal blood and was expected to deliver such high expectations fitting for someone of royal blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she manages to hold out for about five hours, definitely exceeding that of an average human, but she was pretty submissive and it was you doing most of the work\u2026 or rather most of the thrusting. Tewi stuck around to give support (mostly kissing you while you were pumping into her master). It was an experience, but compared to the most and second most unforgettable sexual experiences, it was quite a long way off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lost count of the number of times you've ejaculated into the princess, but unless her ovaries were protected with a Trump wall, there's no doubt you knocked her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took until you noticed Kaguya's moving starting to slow down dramatically for you to comprehend that she's had enough and decided to finally stop and catch your breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 how was it?\u201d the princess panted with a smirk on her face, \u201cwas it not\u2026 the most unforgettable magical experience in your mortal commoner life?\u201d It really wasnt. But she had spunk!<br>\r\n\u201cThat was\u2026 incredible!\u201d you tell her, being a little more generous, \u201cthank you, your highness for giving me the tremendous opportunity to sire my offspring with you.\u201d<br>\r\nKaguya smirked as her face swelled up with pride, \u201cHmph.  Yes, you should count your blessings. Before you, I was still but a fair untouched virgin maiden.\u201d Tewi rolled her eyes. \u201cNow I have a future Prince of the Lunarian Kingdom currently stirring inside me.\u201d She rubbed her belly. \u201cMay he grow to become the finest, most handsome Emperor in all of Houraisan lineage!\u201d Sadly, that doesnt make you, the father of said prince, anything. No prince consort, no page, no grand vizier, not even chief eunuch!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, gag me,\u201d Tewi groaned, \u201cnow that you had your fun with Alex, can I have a piece of dat smexy ass now?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAbsolutely not!\u201d Kaguya ordered as she quickly put her dress back on, \u201cyou have a job to do! You still have to help me set up the studio for my thrilling conclusion of my Dark Souls III Livestream playthrough!\u201d Oh god, she's got a Livestream?!<br>\r\nTewi groaned with disgust, \u201cOh c'mon! Youre seriously gonna continue that stupid playthrough?! You spent over 4 hours trying to fight the Twin Princes and almost tore the place apart in your ragefest!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cFirst of all, that's only because Mokou sent her little troll army to spam my Stream Chat with hateful comments!\u201d listening to this made you cringe, \u201csecondly, I have a good feeling about this one! Now that our precious stallion of Eientei quelled my stress, I'm more psyched than ever!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, now that THAT business is settled,\u201d you couldnt wait to end this conversation ASAP, \u201cNOW may I have my clothes back?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cTewi, give him back his clothes,\u201d Kaguya ordered. The sneaky brat grumbled, obviously cursing under her breath about her princess, but handed back your clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm going to need to wash off all that er, 'perspiration' and change clothes before my Gensokyo famous Livestream begins,\u201d the princess announced, \u201cAlex, you are free to leave and mingle intimately with the other inhabitants.\u201d She said as she headed to her own private bathroom, before stopping, \u201c...unless you care to join me as my co-commentator?\u201d You had to think about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFOR A SECOND A HALF.<br>\r\n\u201cThat's alright,\u201d you turn her around while you headed to the door, \u201cI should probably-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlEx...SaMa\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou overheard an awfully familiar voice down the hall. Oh dear, you can see the glowing eyes of a certain amazonian she-beast from the shower hours ago! You quickly shut the door\u2026 but you can hear her footsteps.<br>\r\nYou remain completely silent, trying not to make any sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlEx SaMa? \u2026.AlEx SaMa?\u201d you hear her call out. Sweat dripped from your brow. Why in the hell did you have to do what you did to her?! What possessed you to go down on a completely unstable side of that mentally ill bunny girl?!<br>\r\nOh right. Cuz you found her irresistible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou still do. You still had a bit of energy left and you wanted to make up for that slightly lackluster performance with the Lady of the Eientei. If she-beast Reisen was yearning for you just as much as you were yearning for her, what's the sense of keeping a girl waiting? Sure she could and probably might end up hurting you, but those are the risks you take, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWAIT. DID YOU SERIOUSLY JUST THINK THAT? YOU SERIOUSLY THOUGHT GETTING HURT POSSIBLY REALLY BAD WOULD BE WORTH A MOMENT OF PLEASURE?! What is wrong with you?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou need to think rationally. The rational choice would be to keep your distance and hide out. Even if it meant joining a stupid livestream\u2026 at least you'll be safe. Bored and/or irritated, but totally safe, right?</span></div></div>",

It most likely wasnt good news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever they were arguing about, it was probably best you not intrude on it. You'll just have to introduce yourself to the other girl later. Being a good little brother (from another mother), you give the two their personal space and head to your room.

Have you forgotten the tremendously large debt you owe me after I covered for your many agonizing mistakes?/\u201d<br>\r\n\u201c/I havent forgotten,/\u201d she stated while gritting your teeth, \u201c/you'll get your money./\u201d<br>\r\n\u201c/You dont even need to do that,/\u201d Anna's tone of voice changed, \u201c/you know there's still an easy thing you can that'll make me completely forgive that completely\u2026/\u201d<br>\r\n\u201c/NOT. HAPPENING./\u201d Anna shoots down that offer immediately!<br>\r\nMikaela sighed, \u201c/Look Anya. I know how you feel about sweety Sasha. I dont blame you. If I were you, he'd be in the infirmary treating the rug burn right now. But you know he only sees you as a big sister and nothing else./\u201d<br>\r\n\u201c/If you say one more word about Alex, ONE MORE WORD, I'm gonna put up my life-savings as a bounty on your disgusting ass!/\u201d<br>\r\n\u201c/Ugh, how rude.

WAIT!/\u201d Mikaela finally changed her tune a little, \u201c/listen. I heard about what happened to Adalgar. He was a valued customer of mine. God rest his soul./\u201d Anna merely hmphed as Mikaela continued, \u201c/We both want revenge, but I cant afford to get my hands dirty. Which is why I'm calling you./\u201d<br>\r\nAnna raised an eyebrow, \u201c/...What do you have?/\u201d<br>\r\n\u201c/I have a paper trail on one of the assassins that killed Adalgar,/\u201d she answers, \u201c/the dumb mudak spent the night in a hotel and paid with a PERSONAL credit card\u2026 a simple leak and trace on the transaction pulled up all of his personal info. I have his name, address, phone number, bank account info, insurance info, his fucking Twitch and Patreon account, EVERYTHING you need to find him and pay him a nice visit./\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis intrigued the elf mafioso. It was an offer she couldnt refuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c/Give it to me!/\u201d she demanded.<br>\r\n\u201c/Ehhhh, not so fast,/\u201d but unfortunately, there was a catch, \u201c/this isnt info I give for free. I may be vengeful, but I am still a lady of business./\u201d<br>\r\nAnna sneered but shrugged it off, \u201c/What do you want, Mikaela?/\u201d<br>\r\n\u201c/I want YOU to give me the location of your brother./\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...And then it immediately became an honor she couldnt ACCEPT!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c/There is no way in hell, I'll let you-/\u201d<br>\r\n\u201c/Dont worry,/\u201d Mikaela assures you, \u201c/you have my word I will not harm him in ANY way. I will not even try to abduct him this time. Cross my heart. Hope to die. I will not make your brother cry!/\u201d<br>\r\nAnna inhaled and exhaled hard. It was a difficult choice to make. As much as she didnt trust her with her darling bro, she needed that info. She needed answers from that fucker who wrote Adalgar off. And Mikaela's info is ALWAYS genuine. Satisfaction guaranteed or triple your money back!<br>\r\nAnna took a little time pondering the offer. With a little regret for her decision, she answered...</span></div></div>",

She looked at it then turned to her comrades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Anastasia, Marcus. I want you two to stay here while I take care of business.\" Anna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"But girl, the target might be dangerous.\" Marcus spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'll summon Hassan to do some spying, besides, I'm risking my life for it.\" Anna replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You wanted to know what's going on and Anna just told you she got urgent business, then she got up and bid farewell. You felt uneasy as Marcus asked permission to make dinner for the place, and eirin granted. He left to kitchen as you were now left with Maeve, Oleg and nightingale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Who would you talk to first? </span></div></div>",

She wasnt somebody you'd take the time to have a chat with without enough witnesses around.<br>\r\nMikaela, on the other hand, you know like the back of your hand! Well, sorta. She's infinitely nicer to you than she is to Anna and it comes in handy whenever your sis screws up at her client's expense! The only major drawback is you two dont speak the same language, but that's what Oleg is for! Well that and to make sure nobody's putting their grubby hands where they dont belong on his boss!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo against the millions of times Anna demands you specifically not to do, you approach Mikaela and smile. Oleg on instinct reaches for his gun but Mikaela grabs his hand and smiles back at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been a while, Ms. Yurazinski,\" you politely greet her, \"how have you been doing?\"<br>\r\n\"Sasha!\" she calls you by your special nickname as her eyes beam, \"Is good see you, hah!\" Close enough. In no time whatsoever, Mikaela smiles over to Nightingale and beams. \"Nightingale. Piss off?\"<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Nightingale is rightfully perplexed by her sudden happy insult. Your eyes just widened.<br>\r\n\"Um... what my boss MEANS to say,\" Oleg properly translates, \"is that if it's alright with you, she wishes to speak with Mr. Whitestone in private.\"<br>\r\nShe squints her eyes at the smiling Russian but shrugs and walks away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that wasnt the end of it.<br>\r\n\"Oleg. Piss off?\"<br>\r\n\"Hm?!\" Oleg did a double take as your eyes were still widening. Mikaela said something to him  as she pointing to you and herself repeatedly. You had a guess as to what she told him. Oleg, his facial expression hinted disbelief, objected to the order. You assumed he was arguing that you and her couldnt understand eachother without him. And he would be right. But Mikaela seemed to brush the objection off and repeated one more time with a smile, \"Piss off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOleg turned to you and shrugged his shoulders, \"Er, she's quite adamant that she wants to speak with you in private. That includes myself.\"<br>\r\n\"Well... I didnt learn much Russian since last time we met,\" you explain to him, \"did she learn more english?\" The big bald bodyguard bit his lip and shook his head. \"But how am I gonna talk to her then?\" Oleg once again shrugs his shoulders.<br>\r\n\"If you'll excuse me, I'll be outside, taking my smoke break,\" he quickly walked off. And then it was just you and her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You not piss off,\" Mikaela pointed at you as if that was her best way of telling her to stay in her broken english. You kinda wished somebody would pass by and interrupt the awkward silence between you and her. You didnt care whether it was that little brat or that pampered princess (you MIGHT care if it was that mentally ill bunny girl however!), just somebody ANYBODY to make this less awkward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... you wanted to speak with me alone, Ms. Yurazinski?\" you ask her despite the fact you know she couldnt understand you.<br>\r\n\"Sasha,\" Mikaela repeats your nickname and edges closer to you.<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" you try to think of something to say as she edges even closer, \"that's a nice jacket you got. Is it new?\"<br>\r\nSurprise, she doesnt answer the question. Instead, she reaches into one of the pockets and pulls out what looks to be a box of candy. Some russian brand, you had no idea what it's called or what it is.<br>\r\nShe offered you a piece. \"\u041f\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0441\u044c.\"<br>\r\n\"What is it?\"<br>\r\n\"\u041f\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0441\u044c,\" she repeats. Anna warned you to never EVER eat anything she offers you. Considering she's got an incredibly wide variety of drugs of different shapes and sizes, you never know if she's being polite or she's trying to drug you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut because youre a nimrod, you gladly pop it in your mouth. \"Thanks!\" It taste like a mix of lemon and some fruity berry you couldnt quite put your finger on. That means it's candy, right?<br>\r\nWhatever it was, Mikaela smile brightened. Then she reached into her jacket and pulled out a nice fancy blue tie she quickly wraps around your neck and properly adjusts for you. It was a nice tie... even though it didnt go with your t-shirt!<br>\r\n\"It's nice, thank you,\" you properly thanked her, \"I'm... sorry I didnt give you anyth-\" She wrapped her arms around you embracing you in a nice loving cool hug. Not warm. Cool. You blushed as she nuzzled her head against your chest.<br>\r\n\"Ahhh... \u0442\u0435\u043f\u043b\u044b\u0439,\" she sighed.<br>\r\nNaturally, you couldnt help but blush. Mikaela wasnt a very social wallflower (at least according to your sister), but you, for some reason, she had no trouble getting close to. And to be honest, if Anna didnt always try to scare you by reminding you the bad things she's affiliated with (as if SHE'S any better!), you'd probably be going out with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSasha?\u201d she whispered.<br>\r\n\u201cY-Yes?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201c\u041f\u043e\u0446\u0435\u043b\u0443\u0439 \u043c\u0435\u043d\u044f.\u201d<br>\r\nBefore you could ponder what she said, she had puckered her lips and was aiming 'em towards yours. Not sure if was instinct or hormones, but instead of backing away like a good boy, your lips drawn to hers like a damn fool about ready to receive her incoming kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut suddenly, somebody grabs the side of your head, turns it sideways, and you feel your lips being pressed against somebody else's! And you easily tell by the familiar taste of her lips and tongue who it was! Lo and behold, it's your favorite purple-haired mentally ill bunny girl that almost took out your back during that 12-hour love session!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikaela was flabbergasted that somebody just gone and snatched up her favorite Amerikanski boy-toy right from her lips! If she had learned of your newly assigned job, she'd be heartbroken!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi Alex-sama!\u201d Reisen greeted you as soon as her lips parted from yours.<br>\r\n\u201cH-Hi Reisen,\u201d you said with a blush and Mikaela stared unamused. You suddenly felt a rather large bit of tension suddenly amplify between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u041a\u0442\u043e, \u0447\u0435\u0440\u0442 \u0432\u043e\u0437\u044c\u043c\u0438, \u044d\u0442\u0430 \u0448\u043b\u044e\u0445\u0430 \u043a\u0440\u043e\u043b\u0438\u043a?\u201d Mikaela asked confused. And possibly disgusted. You had a good guess what she asked, but was completely oblivious to the intense international potty-mouth she's got.<br>\r\n\u201cUh, um, Ms Yurazinski,\u201d you try to introduce despite the language barrier, \u201cshe's friend and worker of Eientei here. This Reisen. Reisen U..do\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cUdongein Inaba.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSorry. Reisen Udongein Inaba,\u201d you then turn to Reisen, \u201cReisen, this is an old client of my sister's. A BELOVED client. Mikaela Yurazinski.<br>\r\nMikaela stared coldly at Reisen while Reisen just sweetly smiled back.<br>\r\n\u201cReis,\u201d was all that came out of Mikaela's mouth.<br>\r\nReisen gave a polite bow, \u201c\u3053\u3093\u306b\u3061\u306f! \u30a2\u30ec\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u69d8\u304c\u7e70\u308a\u8fd4\u3057\u79c1\u3092\u72af\u3055\u3068\u79c1\u306e\u81a3\u3092\u306a\u3081!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou werent surprised that Reisen could speak another language (it was most likely closest to her native language, anyways), though your eyes would be popping out of their sockets if you understood what she said! Mikaela's eyes beamed a little in suspicion and silently some of the words she heard her say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Alex-sama!\" the bunny girl with an international potty-mouth of her own turned her head to you, \"I heard about your affair with the princess. Are you alright? She didnt hurt any part of you, did she?\" Your face quickly went red. She already heard about your romp with Kaguya?!<br>\r\n\"\u041f\u043e\u0447\u0435\u043c\u0443 \u0422\u044b \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u0435\u0435\u0448\u044c?\" Mikaela asked, raising an eyebrow.<br>\r\n\"Er, n-n-no, not at all!\" you ignore the russian dealer and try to keep straight face, \"it... it didnt even take that long. Most of the time was simply helping with her game streaming.\" You really REALLY hope no one you know will watch it... especially that one part where she screaming to her rival Mokou that she got too distracted from humping your brains out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so glad to hear that!\" she beamed, ignoring Mikaela's suspicious glare, \"then I certainly hope youre up for another breeding session with me! I know it's not my turn, but I'm sure the princess wont mind. I've made sure to have taken the proper supplements and hormonal drugs to ensure the best odds of being pregnant!\" Oh if Mikaela knew english...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er... well, I'll have to put a raincheck on that one,\" you tell her, \"right now, we kinda have guests.\"<br>\r\nReisen looked over to Mikaela and smiled back at you, \"It's fine. Sharing a mate is very common with moon rabbits... as you've already experienced. She's welcomed to go after me!\" You cringed as Mikaela kept her suspicious stare going.<br>\r\n\"Er, Reisen... that's not how it works with humans.\"<br>\r\n\"You want me to ask her?\" she turned to Mikaela.<br>\r\n\"NO! DONT ASK HER!\"<br>\r\n\"Hey Miki-chan, do you wanna have Alex-sama's babies too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou facepalmed with embarrassment, but remembered she doesnt speak english so it's a load off your back she cant understand what Reisen just asked.</span></div></div>",

You looked and it wrote:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 'Isn't that the building Le Fay used to own?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yeah, why is it burnt down?\" You spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You then remember Anna saying she had business, and you had the idea that this might be her doing. You groaned and leaned back on the futon as Mikaela thought for moment then smiled, getting on top of you. You were tired and wanted to tell her that but it was too late as she got your penis, she puts it in her vagina and started to hump on you. After good 10 minutes, your seed were shot into her uterus and she leaned on top of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Sasha..\" Mikaela spoke softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Mikaela..\" you spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You two kissed and after few minutes Reisen woke up and all three of you put some pants and went toward the bathing area to take some hot bath.

It was Anastasia and she was carrying a magnum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ms.nightingale?\" Oleg spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNightingale just looked at him and looked back at the front.

It was Anna and she was carrying the black sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Anna.\" Nightingale spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She came to the lady and shook her hand. Anna smiled and turned to Oleg.

Oleg knew what she was going to do as she would go see her brother. Oleg grabbed her shoulder to stop her but she immediatly turned and swung her sword, stopping. Close to his neck areas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not think you could stop me, damn Russian.\" Anna spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Oleg was offended and was about to act until Anastasia grabbed his arm and slammed him down the ground and put a magnum on his head. Anna huffed and ordered Anastasia to keep him down and went in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n After good bath, the three of you got out refreshed.

You had some idea that you might be expelled from eientei for what happened then Eirin opened her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Me.Whitestone, are you alright?\" Eirin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'm alright.\" You spoke, \"look, about Anna, she-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not worry, I'm not here to expel you.\" Eirin said, \"lady scathatch here explained everything.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n You looked at the female and she nodded.

Why did she kill Mikaela?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Your sister is the primary successful object that infused with malevolent spirit that would shatter the essence of the ulster cycle.\" Scathatch said, \"the foreign malevolent spirit known as Angra Mainyu.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You heared about it as it was part of Zoroastrian belief on the opposite of spenta Mainyu, the good spirit. You didn't know why Anna would hide this from you and scathatch continued to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"She was the subject brung by medb herself to see the effect of the spirit.\" Scathatch said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n (Medb? Did she mean Maeve?) you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"After months of tests, it succeeded and she used the changeling as a tool of war..the tool to destroy the essence of the ulster cycle.\" Scathatch said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Why would she want that?\" Eirin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"She saw the cycle a nuisance so she wanted to destroy it. But she didn't want to do it herself, so she used Anna as a scapegoat to achieve her goal.\" Scathatch explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were at loss: you couldn't believe she became like that. Just then, a knock came and a male around your age with spear on his back in.

You then realized that scathatch were the person who taught him to fight and gave him the powerful spear, the Gae Bulg. You were very honored to see such person then setanta spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Did something happen while I was gone?\" Setanta asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Medbs right hand have reactivated.\" Scathatch teplied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n This made the warrior worried,  but then turned calm.

I no longer supply you with anymore weapon you fucking elvin twat!/\u201c Mikaela shouted in rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c/Eat shit and die, whore mongrel!/!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n With that, Anna cut the phone off and threw it to the wall. Her rage was fuming as she had the urge to beat up anybody until she noticed 3 rabbit co-workers. They noticed her as well and got frightened by her glare and dashed away from her. Anna  knew if she don\u2019t release her anger she would be in trouble so she went outside to get some fresh air then she saw the immortal pyromancer standing, smoking cigarette. Mokou were also annoyed as there were some youkai who annoyed her, and she was trying to put the anger away.

Mokou then suddenly felt a dark vibe from her as she summoned fire, Anna spoke an elvin words and from ground a pentagram appeared and a sword were summoned. The sword were pure black with odd red lines on the blade, and Mokou saw some sort of vein looking line on her neck reaching her cheeks and the light in her eyes disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey pyromancer, battle with me now.\u201d Anna spoke, pointing the sword at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cHeh, bring it on.\u201d Mokou replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Back in the building, you were talking with eirin and reisen as they met in the living room. Then suddenly, Reisen and eirin felt an massive evil vibe from outside. You noticed them as they were shivering then you heared some noise from outside. You and others, despite the fear, went outside and saw the two females fighting. Mokou threw many fire while Anna deflected the fire and swung her sword, revealing a dark purplish aura and it hit her strongly. It decapitated Mokou but resurrected immediate.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \u201cDamn! Where did you get that power!?\u201d Mokou spoke in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI use my inner power without hesitation, that\u2019s why.\u201d Anna responded, \u201clet\u2019s continue.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The dark purple aura engulfed the sword and rushed toward the pyromancer. All three of you realized that Mokou was in bad shape and both eirin and reisen knew if they won\u2019t stop Anna she\u2019ll be in trouble so they rushed and reisen got in front of Anna and strongly pushed her back while eirin helped Mokou up. Anna slowly got up as the eientei crew defended Mokou, you came to your sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnna, what happened to you?\u201d  You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cMove little brother, or I will make you move.\u201d Anna replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was not the sister you always knew and you didn\u2019t want her to hurt Mokou any further so you stood up against your sis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI won\u2019t move Anna, so stop what your doing now!\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Then suddenly you were on the ground, not knowing what\u2019s going on.

You put your cloths on and once you got out of the room, you walked through the hallway to find a bathroom. You were still feeling embarressed as you went through the whole night having fun time with the two girls, hoping you didn't impregnate them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I truly hope I didn't made them pregnant.\" You thought to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You then reached the restroom and went in.

You then noticed that Anna wasen't around, and you thought maybe she would come back when shes done with the little work with the client. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Say Dr.Yagokoro, have my sister or her daughter came back?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Unfortunately no. I am worried about her.\" Eirin replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You felt worried about Anna and her daughter as if they were in trouble or something.

It sounded as if she was in pain, and you gulped your saliva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Anna, it's me. Why didn't you come back last night?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Sorry little bro...*pant*...some of Maeves men saw me and we had little...gun exchange.\" Anna answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Your arm hair jumped as the maeves men finally found where Anna was? In the gang, Maeve wanted Annas head so bad she ordered any men who found her and brought her head to the head women, the person will get promoted to the vice-leader of the gang.

You bowed to her as she noticed you and eirin and put the brush down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ah, Eirin and the young man.\" Akyuu said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She stood up and came toward you two.

You had to turn away, however, cuz it was still kinda gruesome to watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your sister saved, you gladly thanked Eirin a couple of times while she had an awful hard time trying to keep a straight face with you (probably cuz she knows about the whole 24 hour session you had with two of her employees!) and she awful quick to get out of there and leave you and your sis with some privacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna, understandably gave an odd expression, \u201cGeez, what's up with her?\u201d<br>\r\nYou swallowed hard and tried to keep your own straight face going, \u201cUhhh\u2026 maybe she witnessed something really shocking this morning and it's still stuck in her head.\u201d Sometimes you didnt necessarily have to lie to Anna to cover your tracks, \u201c...so um, how did the whole arms shipment thing go? You know, before Maeve's ambush.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lowered her head in shame. Bad news.<br>\r\n\u201cTerrible,\u201d she groaned, \u201cI think someone dropped a dime to Maeve's goons about our shipment and somebody on the inside drilled a couple holes in our boat. Everybody's alright, we got to the lifeboats on time\u2026 but we were only able to save a handful of weapon crates from sinking to the bottom of the ocean.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAww, dang,\u201d you sighed, \u201chow many crates did you lose?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we managed to save about three,\u201d she gulped, \u201c\u2026.out of about 70.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cJesus!\u201d you cringed, \u201c...th...then what?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cLong story short, the buyer was pissed, the supplier was pissed, I'm now tens of thousands of dollars in debt\u2026 and\u2026. er...\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what?\u201d you asked her.<br>\r\n\u201c...Mikaela tore up our contract.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMIKAELA?!!\u201d That was a name you didnt wanna hear bad news about! Anna was referring to none other than a powerful ally/wealthy arms dealer/well ranked FSB agent/really good friend of yours, Mikaela Yurazinski! A very lovely young Russian arms dealer that you really got along with and was very generous with providing your sister with sidejobs that pay well! You dont really understand why Anna doesnt get along with her considering she owes her big time, but Mikaela seems to like you a lot (despite the two of you completely unable to understand eachother cuz neither of you speak the same language!).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou lost a contract with Mikaela?!\u201d you STILL couldnt believe what your sis didnt say, \u201curgh\u2026 did you two have a fight?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWe didnt have a fight!\u201d Anna got defensive, \u201cwhen I had to break the bad news with her, she started running her mouth, I replied in kind, I forgot what happened next, and before I knew it guns were blazing between her fellow ruskies and mine.\u201d<br>\r\nYou face-palmed. And you thought what YOU did earlier was dumb.<br>\r\n\u201cYou realize SHE was the one providing your whole arsenal, right?\u201d you question your sis, \u201cyoure not gonna find military-grade hardware just anywhere else if Le Fey ambushes you again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, maybe if that stuck up little Ortho-dyke stopped looking down her nose at me every chance she gets,\u201d Anna sneered, \u201cI mean I've been doing a lot of her dirty work! I couldve just ratted her out to her bosses about her shady business deals a long time ago and got her put in front of a firing squad if I wanted!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou shouldve had ME talk to her,\u201d you tell her, \u201cI couldve resolved this matter without resorting to guns blazing!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cFor the last time, YOU DONT EVEN SPEAK RUSSIAN!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I STILL get along better with her than you do!\u201d sometimes it helps being a people person!<br>\r\n\u201cProbably cuz the little suka wants you to 'annex' her little Crimea..\u201d you heard her mutter under her breath. You pretended you didnt hear that. Youre gonna miss Mikaela, though. She wouldve probably offered you protection in Moscow. You woulda gladly taken it if only you knew Russian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm sorry, Bro,\u201d she apologized, \u201cbut women like her are bad news for you, anyway. She'll just end up getting you killed by HER rival thugs.\u201d Probably. Besides, youre sure Mikaela wont be happy if SHE ever found out what you've recently been doing in this hospital! <br>\r\n...Or maybe she WOULD be happy and wanna join in, you dont know!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd speaking of women who might be bad news for you, heading this way was your good pal and good fuckbuddy, Reisen! You'd be dumbstruck to imagine her not only recovering so quickly after a whole day of mating but even be in such a chipper mood, but youre sure it's cuz moon rabbits have incredibly good stamina!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello, Alex-sama!\u201d Reisen bowed with a huge smile on her face, \u201chi, Anna-chan!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna just stared coldly as you while you smiled back, trying to hide your sweat, \u201cH-Hi Reisen!\u201d Oops. Was your voice a little higher than normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust came to wish your sister a speedy recovery,\u201d Reisen said, \u201cDont worry. Master is the best when it comes to surgery. She'll recover in no time!\u201d<br>\r\nAnna just kept staring coldly.<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, Reisen,\u201d you had the decency to thank her at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlso, I figured you might be a little hungry after everything, so I got you some frozen yogurt!\u201d the awfully generous happy bunny girl handed your sis a ice-cream cone (sorry, FROZEN YOGURT cone). \u201cThis one's vanilla. It should be mild enough on your stomach to eat after your surgery.\u201d<br>\r\nAnna grunted. That was the closest she was gonna get to a 'thank you' from her.<br>\r\n\u201cOh, and I got one for you too!\u201d Reisen smiled and handed you a cone with blue-colored frozen yogurt. \u201cThis one's blue raspberry flavored!\u201d she said with a wink. Your face got a little red.<br>\r\n\u201cM-my favorite!\u201d you smiled as you shivered a little, \u201cth\u2026 thanks a lot, Reisen!\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cNo\u2026 thank YOU,\u201d she whispered in your ear, \u201ccome back and help me again soon. I promise Tewi wont be bothering us the second time!\u201d<br>\r\nShe gave you a kiss on the cheek and trotted off humming merrily as you were still frozen stiff with fluster from earlier!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd to make matters worse, Anna noticed that fluster!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHelp her with what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe said you were helping her,\u201d she questioned with a raised eyebrow, \u201cwhat exactly were you helping her with?\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tsk! Yeah right! Like youre actually gonna tell your sister that you spent the last 24 hours scratching the itch between Reisen's legs with your cock?! Only a lunatic would confess that and not be oblivious to the obvious massacre that would unfold shortly after. Sure, she MIGHT possibly be more dangerous than Mikaela (heavy emphasis on MIGHT!) especially if Maeve's still keeping tabs on her, but you dont believe she deserves to experience one of Anna's many unique methods of 'interrogation'! Besides, obviously you had no problem going at it with that mentally ill bunny girl and her loli friend for a whole darn day otherwise surely you'd have resisted. You didnt even so much as try to pull your dick out of Reisen's mouth!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" you sniffed, pretending that Anna could smell your fear (not that you know she couldnt!), \"I was... spending... most of the day... helping her haul inventory.\" Good one. \"You know, boxes of pills, first aid material, herbal supplements, all that stuff. A lot of it were in crates.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna raised her eyebrow at you as you tried to keep that infamous poker face of yours going.<br>\r\n\"That bunny bimbo made you spend the whole day organizing their stock?\"<br>\r\n\"Well...\" you sniffed, \"to be honest, I think SHE was the one doing most of the work. I mostly,\" you sniffed again, \"assisted when I could. Seriously, she's pretty strong.\"<br>\r\n\"Uh huh.\"<br>\r\n\"Anyways, after all of that,\" you sniffed once more, \"her back was aching pretty bad, so I gave her a massage.\"<br>\r\nShe groaned, \"Ugh. You massaged her? You know she's gonna see that as an invitation. That's like flat out asking her to take advantage of you!\" Too little too late, sis.<br>\r\n\u201cLater, Reisen's partner/distant relative, I think, Tewi snooped in uninvited, and I kinda gave her a massage too.\u201d<br>\r\nAnna sneered, \u201cThat cheeky little brat? Dont turn your back on her. I've heard a lot of bad things about her from the other rabbits here.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDont worry, I'll try to keep my distance from her,\u201d you assured her.. youre not sure if youre gonna make good on that assurance, however the fear of being thrown in prison for being an alleged pedophile boosts the chances!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI dont know what's with you and dangerous women,\u201d your sister nagged, \u201cfirst those sluts at Le Fey, then the Russian slut\u2026 then mom\u2026 now a mentally deranged bunny bimbos and a loli conartist.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cLook, you dont need to worry about me right now, I'm just fine,\u201d you tell her, \u201cright now, you need to focus on feeling better.\u201d<br>\r\nYour sis shrugged, but thankfully caved, \u201cAlright alright, fine. But you owe ME a back massage after this is over!\u201d Sure youre not related by blood, yet something deep down tells you that you need to be disturbed by that remark! But the blush on your cheeks apparently wasnt listening!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou got it sis,\u201d you smiled, \u201cas soon as you recover, I promise to rub down those hard to reach spots 10 times better than I did with Reisen and Tewi!\u201d You gave her a wink.<br>\r\nAnd Eirin gave what looked to be a completely disturbed stare, possibly listening in on the conversation and no doubt taking it the wrong way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhem! I'm er\u2026 sorry to interrupt your incestu-I-I mean close family bonding,\u201d Eirin coughed with a uneasy blush on her face, \u201cbut I'm afraid visiting time is over. I still need to run a few more tests on Anna in private.\u201d<br>\r\nYou nodded and agreed to give the doc and your sis some privacy, also hoping she doesnt blab to Anna what's REALLY been going on! You gave your sis a gentle hug and headed back to your room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou should probably feel bad for lying\u2026 actually, you shouldnt. You knew it was the right thing to do. You knew what could happen if you told the truth. She'd probably end up doing something she'll regret and end up getting you and her kicked out of Eientei just like she screwed over her partnership with Ms. Yurazinski.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis will be your way of making up to her for lying. Cleaning up her mess. You pull out your smartphone and look up Mikaela's number (you never told Anna you had her number, but the less she knew, the better). You hoped she'd answer as you listened to her ringtone that for some unexplainable reason was a recording of Vladimir Putin singing 'Blueberry Hill'.<br>\r\nUnfortunately, after the engrish singing was over, you heard the recording in Russian that you assumed meant to leave a message after the beep.<br>\r\n*Beep*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi, Ms. Yurazinski. It's me, Alex,\u201d you left your message, \u201cI know you probably cant understand me so I hope you'll get your bodyguard Oleg to translate. Look, I'm really sorry about my sister. I know she's kinda really hard to put up with at times, but we really appreciate everything you've done for us so far. I'd hate to ruin our friendship over a silly misunderstanding. If it's alright with you, maybe you and I can work something out\u2026 in private, if you know what I mean. Please call back as soon as you can! Thank you, Ms. Yurazinski. Spokoinoi nochi!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter leaving that lengthy unintelligible message, you hang up and wait, hoping you'll be able to salvage the remaining bits of the partnership Anna just stomped to pieces. You wait with your fingers crossed, not caring if all youre hearing is random gobbledegook you dont understand, just as long as she answers...</span></div></div>",

You pressed the call button and put it on you ears, hoping she'll reconsider the decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hello?\" You spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hey, it's me.\" Voice spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It was from mikaelas bodyguard Oleg. He was a translator who later quit his job to join the yurazindki's gang. He was truly helpful as he can translate from Hebrew, English, Spanish and Russian. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hey Oleg, did Mikaela got my message?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yes, and she told me to tell you since she knows you, she will overlook the decision.\" Oleg said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You sighed in relief as Anna were no longer in hot water. You thanked Oleg and he told you that mikaela will expect the private time, and you agreed and turned off the phone. You walked toward the house until you heard both eirin and Anna talking. You didn't want to, but you quietly eavesdrop the talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n (Inside house)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"..I am glad your getting better. I never seen such fast recovery.\" Eirin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I just have many thing under my sleeve.\" Anna replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Eirin nodded until she saw Anna drop something from her hand. It was a marble that were pure black and had some red line. Eirin wondered what it was until Anna immediatly took it. Eirin felt immense evil and chaos from that and turned to her,<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"Ms.whitestone...what is that?\" Eirin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"It's nothing..nothing to see.\" Anna replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Eirin could tell Anna would not talk, so she immediatly pressed one of her pressure point, making Anna drop the item and eirin grab it and suddenly she saw pure darkness, screaming spirits and Demons rushing through her vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Aahh!!\" Eirin screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She dropped the marble and Anna slowly picked up the item. She put it away as eirin was quivering in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"That thing...what is it?\" Eirin spoke in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"...this is the mantle of Angra Mainyu, center core.\" Anna replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Eirin was shocked to hear that as Angra Mainyu is the chaotic God with dark minds. Eirin was horrified to see it. Anna explained she was assigned to take down an false gang in Iran, and once she did, she saw the leader with the core and took it for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n (Outside)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You were sweating as you just can't believe what you heared.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>What in the ever loving hell?! Before you and the bunny girl you (in)voluntarily gave yourself to stood that white-haired girl from last night! It shocked you pretty much while Reisen seemed awfully calm despite her obvious mental illness, but the intruder looked the most shocked out of all of you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer red eyes widened and her face went red with embarrassment as if realizing last minute what she just did! She quickly jerked her head away and wrapped her hospital gown around trying to cover her naked body. Why it was naked to begin with is a mystery, but you have a darn good guess why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi Mokou!\u201d Reisen seemed happy to see her even though she rudely intruding on you and her going at it like\u2026 well, rabbits!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I-I-I\u2019m so sorry, R-Reisen!\u201d Mokou hid covered her face with her hand, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to uh... I-I-I don\u2019t know what came over me! Oh god, does anybody see me?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s ok, you can come in,\u201d Reisen actually invited her in her room, \u201cand would you mind locking the door?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYeah yeah, sure sure,\u201d the embarrassed white-haired girl locked the door behind her.  Despite being the only three in this room, The white haired fire mancer was still constantly looking back and forth with sweat dripping down her forehead!<br>\r\n\u201cHey,\u201d she nervously greeted you.<br>\r\n\u201cHi,\u201d you nonchalantly greeted her back. And then it got awkwardly quiet for a while. You understood why Mokou was in no mood to talk, what with she suddenly barged in nearly naked for no apparent reason and suddenly now has shame for it. You cant help but wonder why she barged in here in the first place though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, Reisen already figured it out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, youre in heat too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMokou\u2019s eyes widened as she stared at the bunny girl funny, \u201cWh-what are you talking about?!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI already notice the signs,\u201d Reisen said, \u201cyour face is awful red, youre panting, your legs are trembling, and youre staring at Alex-sama all dreamy-eyed.\u201d Come to think of it, she IS staring at you that way, isnt she?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again she realizes her mistake last minute and turns away, sitting down on the floor cross-legged to hide her trembling legs!<br>\r\n\u201cS-Sorry!\u201d Mokou apologized, \u201cEirin\u2019s trying to force me to quit smoking so she\u2019s got me on a stupid medicine regiment that\u2019s supposed to kick those urges. Damn woman didnt tell me it\u2019d have bizarre side-effects!\u201d Yikes. And this is the kind of girl that plays with fire!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI uh\u2026 think my sister Anna might still have some nicotine patches you can use,\u201d you offered, then remembered how much she does not like that very girl you just slept with! Oh man is she gonna be pissed when she finds out.<br>\r\n\u201cActually\u2026\u201d Mokou attempts to avoid eye-contact, \u201c\u2026you wouldn\u2019t happen to have a cigarette, would you? I\u2019d kill for one right now.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWe dont,\u201d Reisen smiled, \u201cbut we do have something to quell that side-effect youre having.\u201d And this where the phrase \u2018Actions speak louder than words\u2019 comes into play. No words could speak louder than the action Ms. Udongein Inaba performed: Hopping off her bed and offering Mokou her side of it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHAT?!\u201d you and Mokou dropped your jaws. This was incredibly surprising how your own partner who clearly wanted you all to herself now seems generous enough to share you with a stranger!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh right, your kind\u2019s used to monogamous relationships,\u201d Reisen snickered and bopped her head, \u201cdont worry. It\u2019s very common for a moon rabbit to share her mate with family members and close friends. Think of it as a matter of trust.\u201d What?<br>\r\n\u201cReisen, you cant-\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAnd honestly, despite your constant feuds with the princess, I do personally see as a close friend I can trust,\u201d Reisen admitted, \u201chonestly, I personally respect you a bit more than most of the other girls here in Eientei. If there was anybody else worthy of being knotted by my Alex-sama, it\u2019s definitely you!\u201d Oh geez, that almost sounded heart-warming. And what\u2019s \u2018knotted\u2019?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, it actually got to Mokou a bit. \u201cAw\u2026 gee, I\u2026 I didn\u2019t realize you thought of me that way. I\u2026 I dont know what to say. B-But I dont think I could just take your uh, Alex-sama right in front of you.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s perfectly fine,\u201d Reisen assured before you could so much as get a word in, \u201cPlus, that special medicine I gave him should keep him well prepped for you.\u201d She was right. Despite just going at it with her, your member was still rather erect and your adrenaline was still pushing for more! \u201c\u2026Heck, I\u2019m willing to bet he\u2019ll have plenty of energy left for Round 2 with me right after!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as soon as you opened your mouth, Reisen locked lips with it, slipping her tongue in it, and you found yourself overblown with bliss yet again. (Nevermind those same lips were on your dick just moments earlier!) You could not for even a millisecond turn your vision away from her sparkling red eyes as soon as they twinkled!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMokou panted faster and trembled harder just watching you two fool around. It didnt look as though she was willing to say no anymore.<br>\r\nYou on the other hand still had a shred of sanity left to contest it. Although you were under the ill bunny girl\u2019s influence, it wasn\u2019t strong enough to blindly accept a second partner. You were raised to be loyal to one lover. It seemed wrong to just take another right in front of the current one youre with!<br>\r\nBesides\u2026 Anna\u2019s already got a big enough beef with ONE girl in your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Mokou was practically suffering thanks to that medicine she\u2019s taking. She was yearning for someone to help her quell that nasty problem of hers. Who were you to turn down a woman in need?</span></div></div>",

Reisen noticed your expression and smirked, realizing what you were trying to think and then turned to mokou.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hey mokou, I think alex sama would like you to accompany us.\" Reisen said with smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Reisen!\" you spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What? I could see what you were trying to say.\" Reisen replied with wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You were surprised that, but it was reisen that was talking and you had the idea that she might have seen through. Mokou came forward and you looked at her red eyes, noticed that she was on the brink of doing the deed with you along with reisen. You sighed and pulled your hand toward mokou, letting her know to have some time with both you and reisen. She thanked you and took off the hospital gown, revealing her beautiful naked body. Her chest were about above average and her belly were perfectly slim, making you think she could bear a child or two. Her arms and legs were normal and her butt was little small but you didn't mind as she came up on to you, reisen started to kiss you. You felt happy as you two were kissing, mokou started to massage your third leg. The euphoria started to kick in your body as mokous hand were slender and soft, within few minutes it grew up. Reisen noticed this and smiled and came next to mokou and both of them started to lick it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"H-hey...\" You spoke with light voice.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"Don't worry alex sama, you'll feel fine soon enough.\" Reisen said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"She's right, nothing to be afraid of.\" Mokou said as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n They both licked your third leg, making your urge more stronger. The two girls stopped licking as they felt an instinct that it was ready, mokou got over. You saw mokou spread her leg and open up her vagina and letting your third leg insert her glory hole. You felt very warm in her vagina as it was tough to at first, it finally went in, splashing your third with hymen that mokou had. You realized that she was a virgin and mokou started to move up and down while reisen kissed you again. The urge was getting out of control and 9 minutes later, mokou started to move faster and faster until you couldn't hold back any further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'm cumming....I'm cumming!!\" You spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'm cumming, I'm Cumming, I'M CUMMING NOOOOW!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n With the shout your third leg shot a hot load into the white haired girls uterus. It flowed very strong as you felt your cum was shooting like an volcano that erupted, mokou was accepting your love juice. After moment of climax, mokou looked at you with smile and sweat on her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"That was...awsome..\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You were great, alex.\" Mokou said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She then started to hump again since her desire was still lingering.

You breathed out as your mind was still not functioned properly yet due to the activity you did with the ill bunny and the pyromancer. After 10 minutes of rest, all three of you got up from the bed and started to put some cloth on until mokou started to feel some pain in her lower abdomen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Wait, I feel...alot of...pain in my lower abdomen.\" Mokou said in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Really? is it that bad?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Reisen started to feel worried about this was about to ask eirin for help until mokou felt more pain and screamed and laid on the ground. You then noticed her lower abdomen move little then started to swell up. You and reisen looked at this with amazement as the lower abdomen grew, it stopped swelling. You and reisen were truly stunned by this as if mokou immediatly became pregnant or something. Mokou breathed heavely as she was looking at the celing, she put her hand on her swelled up belly and petted lightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Haa...haa...I feel something moving inside me.\" mokou said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Wait....what do you mean?\" Reisen asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I don't know, I just feel something hitting inside this swelled belly.\" Mokou replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n With that, she felt something leaking out between her leg and both you and reisen saw a liquid coming out of her. You and reisens mind were in delayed mode for moment and then immediatly realized the obvious: mokou became pregnant and the water broke, getting her ready to give birth. You and reisen were stunned and really shocked to see this as mokou started to feel something big was starting to move through the birth canal. She screamed as she spreaded her leg revealing her delicate zone, it started to bleed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh no, she's going to give birth!\" Reisen said, \"Alex sama! I'll take care of this birthing so you could fetch some warm water!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You immediatly took this order and got out of the room. You couldn't believe what you just saw as mokou got sudden pregnency and giving birth right away. You wondered if eirins drug was that powerful with the side effect and you were about to reach the kitchen and noticed some shadowy figure turn the corner. You vaguely noticed the mid-short grey hair and some sort of navy blue dress, but your head was on the baby. You immediatly got the big silver tray and filled with warm water and once you returned to the room, you came in and put it next to reisen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Thank you. Now please, I'll handle the rest.\" Reisen said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Thanks reisen.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She smiled and you  got out of the room. You were very nervous as if mokou was giving birth to the child that have blood of your and hers. After 45 minutes, you heard a baby cry and you got into the room. You saw reisen washing up and cutting the umbilical cord of the baby and wrapping it around with the towel. You immediatly noticed that it was a twins as mokou already had the other baby on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Congradulations alex sama, you have twin....</span></div></div>",

Reisen washed up the newborn and wrapped it around with the towel and handed over to you. You felt some weight as you saw the toddler moving little, she opened her eyes revealing the blue pupil on left and red pupil on the right staring at you. You couldn't truly believe this as you came next to mokou, she was surprised as well and was happy to have a baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I really don't know how this happened, but I'm very happy to have my own baby.\" Mokou said, \"Thanks alex.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Um...no sweat, I guess?\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You and mokou giggled and you helped mokou get up and get to the bed. Once she was on the bed, you handed over the other girl to her and she thanked her. You told her you're going out for moment to get some fresh air and the two girls bid farewell to you. You got out and once you were outside breathing some fresh air, you noticed someone coming out of the bamboo forest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n It was Anna and Vivian, and you were glad to see her again. She smiled as vivian ran toward you and hugged your leg tightly.

You had Reisen, then Mokou, then Reisen, then Mokou, then both of them at the same time, then they had a go at eachother while you caught your breath. You didnt realize how long you three were going on for until when you finally tired out. You turned to the clock and noticed five hours had passed.<br>\r\nFIVE!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt mustve been your experiences with Le Fey that gave you incredible stamina! It was miraculous you even survived losing your virginity to Maeve during a special 'initiation test'. It was like having sex with Winter itself! An elemental of ice straddling you during an arctic storm on top of fresh snow, slowly consuming your body heat with each press while little frost bits formed on each and every strand of body hair. It was an icy hell that almost scared you away from sex permanently! Not even Mokou's intense heat could match Maeve's deathly chill, and you on the verge of getting sunburned! Suffice to say, it felt GOOD.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lied back in the bed panting and catching your breath while Reisen and Mokou snuggled with one another, sharing a cigarette. The two were practically staring dreamy-eyed at eachother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow Mokou...\" Reisen sighed, \"I have never met a human that could last as long with an ex-lunarian marine as you could. The princess really does pick her rivals well.\"<br>\r\n\"Heh, well, I aint the type to brag,\" the pyro took a drag of her cig as the smug grin shined on her face, \"besides, it was no easy feat keeping up with the great Udongein. Curse that whore Kaguya for keeping hunnies like you caged up.\"<br>\r\nReisen giggled and cuddled up closer to her, \"We do have a little more time to spend, just the two of us, since the princess is probably on her 6th afternoon nap.\"<br>\r\nYou noticed they werent even including you at all in their chat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...\" you finally spoke up, feeling left out, \"you know, there was a third person in there that helped out quite a bit.\"<br>\r\nThe two of them just stared blankly at you. <br>\r\n\"Oh, youre still here?\" Mokou seemed to have lost interest in you super fast.<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah! I was the one doing most of your side-effect quelling!\" you speak up, \"not to mention, I'm still Reisen's prime stud!\"<br>\r\n\"Ummm... about that...\" those words coming out of your ill bunny mate's mouth made your stomach twist in knots, \"...no offense Al, but I wouldnt say youre my PRIME.\"<br>\r\nShe didnt even call you 'Alex-sama'! Just AL!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... you know, last night...\" you brought up, \"how you were freaking out over me... in more ways than one!\" And about how she snuck in your bedroom!<br>\r\n\"Heh! Ya think YOU were the only one she ever tried to surprise-sex?\" Mokou snickered while Reisen gave her the cold stare... but never let go of her!<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Al,\" Reisen smiled apologetically, \"youre very nice, very handsome, and you lit a spark in me that just wouldnt go out. But my heart already belongs to another.\" Translation: youre just a fuck-buddy. Nothing more.<br>\r\n\"B-b-but... I even...\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the fun time, Al,\" Reisen smiled, \"you've been a great friend.\" FRIEND?! JUST FRIEND?! \"Now, if you dont mind... we need to be alone.\"<br>\r\n\"Wha... I...\"<br>\r\n\"You heard her!\" Mokou was waving her hand, \"go on! Get! Shoo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was heart-breaking to hear. That crazy bunny that was practically fawning over you never really saw you as more than a friend she could ka-boink! (DAMN IT, TEWI!) Even after you stood up to your sister for her! You even let her go She-Hulk in your room and sleep there while you took the freaking couch! Perhaps you shoulda known better than to fall for a nutcase.<br>\r\nYou wanted to vent your anger, but because you were a gentleman (and you didnt wanna get burnt and full of bullet holes) you bit your lip and stomped out of the room.<br>\r\n\"See if I rescue you from sis again,\" you muttered under your breath before you slammed the door behind you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven after that, you could hear them talking to eachother.<br>\r\n\"Whelp... I got feeling in my legs again. Ready for the next round?\" \"Oh Mokou-sama!!\"<br>\r\nYou could almost hear Maeve laughing at you... she knew this would happen to you, didnt she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww\u2026 did the brain damaged bimbo break your heart?\u201d as if you couldn\u2019t feel MORE humiliated, Tewi comes straight out of nowhere and butts in. Wonderful. Just what you need. More salt on the wound.<br>\r\nTewi shrugged, \u201cI shouldve known this would happen. Guess despite her frequent cravings of the opposite sex, deep down she\u2019s still a hardcore rug-muncher. That's moon rabbit lesbos for ya! Once theyre seeded, youre no longer needed!\" Despite how disturbing it sounded for this kid (or full grown adult in kid's body!) to speak like that, you just groaned and kept walking, in no mood to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'm sorry about her,\" but Tewi followed, \"if you'd like, I could drill some peep holes into her room later.\"<br>\r\n\"Nah, that's alright,\" you say, \"it's probably for the best she doesnt get close. I'm sure Maeve would probably mess with her more if she did.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and she'd probably end up killing you in your sleep or something equally stupid,\" Tewi attempted to cheer you up, \"besides, there's plenty of kind, gorgeous, sane love bunnies out there! I can think of at least two that'd be right down your alley!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raise your eyebrow and give her a disapproving, \"Er, sorry Tewi. I know youre a lot older than you look, but I'm not really into the whole lolita thing.\"<br>\r\n\"Ha, no! No, not me!\" Tewi laughed, quickly turned her head and sneered, then turned right back to you, \"I'm talking about two good friends of mine. Seiran and Ringo!\" Oh boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seiran and Ringo?\" you got a bad feeling about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twerp nodded, \"Yep. Theyre strong tough high-ranked operatives in the Lunarian military that just came back from the Eastern Crater and are looking for a good male partner to share and ease their stress. I'm sure they'd like a cool ex-mafia badass to fill that role!\" Oh god, not another blind date. Polygamous blind-date.<br>\r\n\"I dont think I'm up for it,\" you say, \"I'm still a bit tired out from the last one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dont worry, Seiran and Ringo will be a breath of fresh air,\" Tewi assured you, \"theyre kinda tired themselves after spending so many months of spying on moon terrorists on the Eastern Crater. Look, I'm doing this for you, Alex. Not because I lost them a lot of money and theyre threatening to stick so much C4 up my ass that my cough would trigger an explosion if I dont pay them back! SSS!!\" She gritted her teeth. \"Oops!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glared. \"Tell me that last part you said was a joke!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to sweat and shiver before quickly cracking, \"Ok! Ok! The truth is I made a deal with them a while ago regarding a juicy stock tip. Turns out the tip was a total bust and I ended up losing them a few.... couple thousand moon dollars.\" Yikes.<br>\r\n\"Ouch.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and theyre very well trained in the art of combat and interrogation through means of torture,\" she swallowed, \"their unit was noteworthy for being the most barbarically cruel. The stories you'd hear about their treatment of POWs would make sleeping between two Nightmare Reisens seem like Heaven!\"<br>\r\nYour jaw dropped, \"...And you want me to DATE them?!\"<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah...\" she smiled nervously, \"I mean surely you, being a big, strong, handsome, possibly well-endowed male, could take their minds off of their murderous feelings they have towards me, right? Obviously your manly physique and romantic charm could convince them to spare my life... just until I find a way to get them their money back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGOOD LORD. This was giving you a migraine! Was this brand new fresh start REALLY better than just letting Le Fey kill you and finally put you to rest? Youre sure this madness will just get worse and worse the longer you stay. You dont even need Maeve to drive you mad at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PUHLEEES, Alex-sama!\" Tewi got on her hands and knees and begged you, giving you the sad puppy-dog eyes, \"I dont want them to hurt me! I promise I'll pay you back somehow! Please please please, pretty please with sugar on top?\"</span></div></div>",

You were tired from all the sex you've done with both reisen and mokou and once you got outside to take few minute break, you saw someone quickly come out from the bamboo forest. It was Anna and she quickly turned and shot few more rounds of her silencer and put it back to her gun holder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Damn, that was TOO close.\" Anna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hey anna!\" You shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She turned to your area and came to you for your attention.

You asked her where she was and she told you that vivian would be doing sleep over with chen at her house. You understood and then she looked at you with little confusion and sniffed at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Huh....I smell sweat...cheap perfume....and agony....what happened to you brother?\" Anna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"well...you see..\" You spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It was hard for you to explain to her but with little courage you told her what happened up until now. After you explained to her what happened, your heart jolted as you saw her dark smile. You knew this smile, as if she showed this smile the enemy they had no chance for survival. Her anger vein were showing and sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I guess that damn bunny wants to be a stew after all.\" Anna spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She then walked toward the building to do her private business with reisen, you stopped her telling her that you will tell eirin about what happend and let her do the punishment instead of her. She was furious and mad, wanting to kill the bunny herself, but she knew killing her right now would not be benefecial right now, so she sighed and relaxed. You relaxed as well as she was not going to kill her, anna took out a cigarette and lit it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Alright, bro. I'll relax.

They let kids smoke here?!) as if she was waiting for too long on that very spot she was sitting. A little disgruntled, isnt she? Yeah, you'd probably feel that way if you ended up losing a few potentially dangerous people a ton of money. Thankfully, you were never in that situation... cant say your sister wasnt, however, but this is neither the time nor the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing your approached, Tewi's bunny ear twitched and she jerked her head toward you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez! Bout time you got here!\" she mashed out her cigarette, \"what took you so damn long?!\"<br>\r\n\"I was too busy talking my sister out of not horribly murdering one of your coworkers,\" you answer truthfully.<br>\r\n\"Whatever!\" she stomped the cigarette out, \"why havent you dressed up yet? Youre supposed to be on a date, ya know!\"<br>\r\n\"Do you want me to go through with this or would you rather I turn around and walk away?\" you were not having any of her bullshit tonight! Youre doing HER a favor, after all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright alright!\" fortunately the brat wasnt interested in picking a fight, \"look, theyre gonna be here any second! Just keep quiet, let me do the talking, and dont speak until youre spoken to. Also, put these on!\" She pulled out a pair of bunny ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raised your eyebrow, \"Er... why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Long story short, they aint too fond of humans!\" oh for the love of- \"if they figure youre a human, things could get bad. Just put on the stupid ears and keep hidden until I call you out, ok?!\" You grunted, put on the damn bunny ears and hid. Yep, they look absolutely ridiculous on you... but perhaps they look no more ridiculous than they do on every other girl in this hospital. You certainly werent minding them when you were fooling around with Reisen the last couple of hours!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remained in hiding patiently, waiting for Tewi's debt collectors to arrive. As you wait, the nagging part of your brain thought this was the appropriate time to remind you how stupid an idea this was. You knew, but this isnt the dumbest thing you ever done and youre quite certain this wont be the last dumb thing you'll ever do. Somehow the nagging part of your brain suddenly gone quiet. Even it knew that to be true, huh?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally after waiting for almost forever (which is a few minutes in normal time), you somehow something flying in the sky. It looked to be a huge white colored bird with black stripes beginning to descend from said sky. Tewi gulped hard and stomped out her fifth cigarette as the huge striped bird took landing. Riding atop the striped bird were two bunny girls. One was a blue haired bunny girl with pig tails wearing a blue skirt wielding what looked to be some sort of a huge mallet like a weapon of choice... you dare not think what the red stuff dripping off that mallet was.<br>\r\nThe other bunny girl had short blonde hair with a brown cap, wearing an orange crop-top which showed off her slightly plump belly, a pair of short pumpkin breeches, and was busy scarfing down what looked to be little white ball-shaped doughy snacks on a stick. Seiran and Ringo, you presume?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTewi quickly stood up and smiled nervously as the two women hopped off their ride and faced her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-H-Hi Seiran! Hi Ringo!\" Tewi greeted them as they walked toward her with feral glows in their red eyes, \"boy it's great to see you two on this fine starlit night! Would you like to come in? I'll make you some tea!\"<br>\r\n\"Ya got our money or ya dont?\" the mallet-wielding bunny girl not only got straight to the point, she was prepping her mallet ready for a swing!<br>\r\n\"Uh uh um, I-I-I-I dont, but-\"<br>\r\n\"Ringo hold her steady, will ya?\"<br>\r\n\"Sure thing!\" the blonde haired bunny girl quickly grabbed Tewi from behind and held her tight while Seiran was carefully aligning her mallet swing to the side of Tewi's head! Holy crap, she was literally about to knock her block off!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-w-w-wait! You didnt let me finish!\" Tewi pleaded as Seiran took a slow practice swing to the side of her head, \"I-I-I was about to say I dont have money, b-but I got something more valuable!\"<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Seiran took another practice swing, \"more valuable than the busted skull of an annoying Chang'e enthusiast? Junko's paying REAL good money for one of those.\"<br>\r\nTewi gasped but continued,\" Y-Y-YES! MUCH MORE VALUABLE! Something you know us moon rabbit sisters would give the world for!!\"<br>\r\n\"And that is...?\" Seiran reached back, about to take a REAL swing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A.... a son!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeiran stopped her swing just millimeters from Tewi's head and Ringo's jaw dropped so hard, her chewed up doughy ball fell out of her mouth! You squinted your eyes, not liking where this is about to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait,\" the mallet-wielding bunny woman finally spoke, \"what did you just say?\"<br>\r\n\"I-I said I got a son!\" Tewi exclaimed, \"a son that grew up into a fine eligible young man ready for courting!\"<br>\r\n\"You lying little brat!\" Seiran was clearly skeptic, \"you dont have a son!

C'mon, Seiran!\" Tewi continued her facade, \"and let my darling strapping baby boy be vulnerable to all those filthy perverted harlots in this hospital?! Especially a certain mentally ill rug-munching pill-popper...\" Ugh.<br>\r\n\"Who's the dad?\" Ringo got curious.<br>\r\n\"Remember that one snot-nosed boy from the human village I babysat years ago that wouldnt stop eating paste?\" Ringo nodded then Tewi smirked, \"turns out all that paste he's been eating gave him plenty of protein later in life!\" Ewww!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyways, my boy's currently staying here with mommy after he had a nasty running with a certain group of mafioso baddies!\" Tewi sighed, \"I told him a thousands times not to be hanging out with those nasty thugs, but you know how boys are, right? Heh?\" Neither Seiran or Ringo responded, so Tewi's smile dropped, \"right. Of course you dont.\"<br>\r\n\"Where is he?\" Seiran questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you asked! Oh Alex, dear!\" Tewi finally called you out, \"dont be shy. Come on out and introduce yourself to mommy's friends!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a deep breath and finally stepped out in the open. Immediately, IMMEDIATELY after you were in their vision, their big red glowing eyes locked on to you! Ringo quickly dropped Tewi and she and Seiran rushed over to you, still staring with wide interest!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hi!\" you greeted them. They began to look you up and down like wild animals cautious of a stranger! \"Y-you must be moms friends, it's-\" You almost jumped when Seiran and Ringo began SNIFFING you out! Geez, it was uncomfortable enough when Reisen was doing it! \"-it's a pleasure to uh... meet you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTewi kept her fingers crossed, hoping they'd buy her scam.

You may have had a little more rage than surprise in your tone. Definitely not something you signed up for!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, little Alex Inaba gets us kids of our own,\u201d Ringo says, \u201cwe'll think about forgetting your whole screwup AND bounty!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAnd if he CANT knock us up,\u201d warned Seiran, \u201cyoure gonna be owing us DOUBLE. Or a nice rabbit-hide to go with the busted skull!\u201d Yikes. You certainly hope they wont want YOUR hide to go with it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-H-H-HE'LL KNOCK YOU UP! SCOUT'S HONOR!!\u201d Tewi desperately swears to her debt collectors while you still glared her way, \u201cA-A-Alex, sweetie!  Do your best! F-For your mom's sake!!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI'll do what I can\u2026 'mom'!\u201d you answer through gritted teeth. Unless in the most unlikely event you somehow light a spark with these two, she owes you BIG for this one!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSuzaku! To us!\u201d Seiran called out to their big striped bird who obediently came to her beckon and she and Ringo hopped on it's back.<br>\r\n\u201cHop on, junior,\u201d the blue haired bunny called. Suzaku squawked in agreement.<br>\r\n\u201cYou heard her, son,\u201d Tewi smiled forcefully, \u201cdont let me down!\u201d You gave her one last cold stare before hopping on Suzaku's back. Before you could even get uncomfortable, Seiran gave the signal for her bird to begin it's soar! It was a very appropriate time to realize you were very afraid of heights!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn no time at all,  you were over a hundred feet off the ground! The big hospital/palace in the middle of a bamboo forest could barely be made out in the distance! The bird had no seatbelts keeping you on it's back. Just the strong grip you have in it's bush of feathers is all that's keeping you from flying off and falling to your doom! And the wind was blowing hard as that bird flew! Like the sky itself wanted to blow you off Suzaku! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cScared of heights, junior?\u201d the blonde bunny turned and noticed your obvious panic.<br>\r\n\u201cI-I-I've never flown before,\u201d you answered, \u201cat least not like THIS.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMama Tewi mustve kept you caged up from anything exciting,\u201d Seiran comments, \u201ccant say I blame her. Male moon rabbits are such an outrageous rarity, poachers would hunt them down and sell them at unbelievably high prices.\u201d Thanks for that little tidbit! You cant wait to rip these stupid ears off now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy the way, there's something I've been wondering,\u201d Ringo speaks, \u201cyou dont already have a girlfriend, do you? And if so, does she know what your mom's having you do?\u201d Good questions. Not ones easily answered, but you did your best.<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I was uh\u2026 kinda close with a certain colorful-haired bunny girl,\u201d you refrain from given a name, \u201c...but it didnt work out. Despite her being very clingy with me, in the end it turned out her heart belonged to another woman.\u201d You aint jealous or anything! That's what you tell yourself. You can fool yourself! You'll be the king of wishful thinking!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww...\u201d Seiran sighs, \u201cthat's too bad. But that's the thing with us moon maidens. In the end, us sisters stick together to the very end. So I hope you dont plan on falling for one of us, soon! Nothing can tear me and Ringo apart! Isnt that right?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou bet it is, Seiran!\u201d Ringo replied and the two gave each other a loving kiss! You groaned as you turned away, but couldnt help but blush.<br>\r\n\u201cHey Ringo,\u201d the blue haired bunny girl asked her yellow haired companion after they parted lips, \u201cyou think after we're done with our playmate, we should introduce him to Reisen?\u201d Your ears twitch at the name (your REAL ears, you mean!)<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?! That mentally deranged traitor?!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo, stupid!\u201d Seiran corrected, \u201cLittle Reisen! You know, Lady Toyohime's pet.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh! The rookie? Heh, like she'd even know what to do with him!\u201d<br>\r\nYou had questions, but you had a feeling it was just girl gossip. Besides, you hoped it wouldnt be your problem by the time you were done with these two. The sooner you can ditch your bunny-boy disguise, the better!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere we are!\u201d Ringo announced as the bird was beginning to land.

There\u2019s actually a nice cooling chill in the middle of this hot summeresque day!<br>\r\nUnfortunately the nice cooling weather change wasnt cuz of A/C. It was all thanks to a certain tall blue-haired Peeping Tammy that just waltzed in nearly naked!<br>\r\nNEARLY naked. Her familiar looking blue dress was on the floor and she was standing before you and your ill partner clad in just a super skimpy baby blue string bikini! VERY super skimpy. Like the super thin string top does nothing to cover her oversized nearly D-cup jiggly jumbly boobs but barely hide her nipples! The string bottom barely fits over her wide jiggling heart pounding hips and are worn super low that they BARELY cover her camel toe\u2026 surprisingly, despite showing too many inches below the belly button, there was virtually no bush in the crotch area!<br>\r\nThis completely disturbed you that this intruder looked way too familiar. Same blue bow in her blue hair, same icicle-like wings, same childish arrogant expression on her face! She reminded you way too much of that little annoying fairy lackie you seen a few times hanging out at Maeve\u2019s private lake freezing frogs. No, that\u2019s just silly! There\u2019s no way that-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow! Dat shrimp\u2019s got charisma! One long pokin\u2019 with the nutcase and he\u2019s STILL hard as a rock!\u201d oh god, that childish tone in her deepened adult gave it away! It IS her!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCIRNO?!\u201d both you and Reisen shouted in unison with disbelief then you both turned to each other.<br>\r\n\u201cWait! You know her?!\u201d you both asked in unison!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh! Who doesn\u2019t know about me?\u201d Big Cirno announced with pride, \u201cthe great Cirno is famous worldwide, ya know!\u201d She put her hands to her thick hips and raised her chin\u2026 somehow causing her boobs to jiggle a little. Bloody hell! Does she recognize you?! Does she know that youre the traitorous target her boss is after?! And\u2026 how did she get so\u2026 big? She was just a squirt last time you seen her. Now she\u2019s practically hulked out like Reisen did!<br>\r\nYou notice the golden bracelets she\u2019s wearing with Le Fey insignias engraved on them. Only the most elite-ranked have the privilege of wearing those\u2026 how SHE of all fairies managed to make such a rank is pure surreal!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing here?!\u201c Reisen said with a raised eyebrow, \u201c\u2026and what the hell happened to you? You used to be so tiny. Now youre-\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cA big sexy fairy goddess?\u201d Cirno smirked, \u201cI dunno. Dat\u2019s why I\u2019m gettin\u2019 looked at by yer doc. And speakin of gettin looked at, ya liking the view, shrimp?\u201d Aw crap! You were staring a bit too hard at the annoying fairy\u2019s new sexy body! Not that it was easy not to, her skimpy bikini leaves little to the imagination!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDont stare at that idiot, Alex-sama!\u201d Reisen scolded, possibly getting a little jealous.<br>\r\n\u201cYer so rude, Reinny,\u201d Cirno stepped up to you with an eyeopening sway to her hips, \u201caincha gonna introduce me to yer bed-buddy, Alasama?\u201d Oh good. She\u2019s still a bit of an airhead despite her \u2018upgrade\u2019! Still, it was proving futile to resist staring TOO hard. Not to mention, it was getting awful colder the closer she got!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018She\u2019s still that annoying little brainless frog-murdering twerp!\u2019 you think to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH\u2026h\u2026hi, Cirno,\u201d you smile nervously, \u201cit\u2019s n\u2026nice to meet you\u2026 for the first time ever!\u201d<br>\r\nOh god, she\u2019s licking her lips! \u201cMmm\u2026 delicious shrimp! My favorite kinda dish!\u201d<br>\r\nYour cheeks reddened while Reisen eyebrows twitched in nearly uncontrollable rage. Cirno bent over and her jumbly boobs were blocking your field of vision!<br>\r\n\u201cWow! That yer peach flavored popsicle hanging out or you just happy to see me?\u201d Whoops! You forgot to roll the covers back over! You leaped out of bed, still shielding yourself with the covers, realizing you left your clothes in a corner at the other end of the room!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that you could reach for \u2018em in time, because you were temporarily distracted by the rather tall scantily clad fairy before you!<br>\r\n\u201c!!\u201d during that distraction, she wrapped her arms around you, squeezing you between her ice cold boobs!<br>\r\n\u201cOoo! So warm!\u201d Cirno said with glee, \u201cI came to the right hospital to get my heatin\u2019 on!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet your frog-freezing ass away from my mate!\u201d Reisen in record breaking speed dashed between you and Cirno.<br>\r\n\u201cHey! Don\u2019t hog the hospital stud!\u201d Cirno put her hands to her shapely hips and whined, \u201cI deserve a turn just like everybody else!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s not a hospital stud, you moron!\u201d the bunny girl raged.<br>\r\n\u201cEh?\u201d Cirno tilted her head dumbfounded, \u201cbut idnt that why he\u2019s here? I mean that other shrimp Tewi keeps yapping about-\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWHO CARES WHAT TEWI SAYS?!\u201d boy was your partner flipping out, \u201che\u2019s not any of that! He\u2019s MY lover and you have no business barging in on our special time together!\u201d<br>\r\nDespite how adamant Reisen was being, Cirno was being\u2026 well, Cirno.<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026\u201d she tilts her head again, \u201cden I guess now would be a bad time to ask if I can shag him too?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cObviously!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAw c\u2019mon! I promise I wont make a mess!\u201d she was not making it easy on Rei, <br>\r\n\u201cArgghh\u2026\u201d Reisen growled, \u201chave you ever even had sex before?\u201d<br>\r\nFor obvious reasons, the Amazonian fairy got a bit bashful, \u201cUh\u2026 y-y-yeah! Course I did! A zillion times!\u201d She sucked tremendously at lying. \u201cI-I-I\u2019ll show ya! Hey, Ala-something, lie on your back!\u201d Your eyes widened hearing that order.<br>\r\n\u201cThat does it, you overgrown snow-whore!\u201c Ms. Udongein Inaba was getting sick of her, \u201cput your stupid dress back on and get the hell outta here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that crafty shrimp fairy turned bimbo fairy crossed her arms and sneered back, \u201cAlrighty long ears. Fine. While I\u2019m at it\u2026 maybe I\u2019ll tell the doc about how ya drugged poor Alalasuma with some illegal pills ya bought from a drugdealer!\u201d Bloody hell, she heard that?!<br>\r\nReisen\u2019s twinkling red eyes widened, \u201cYOU\u2026 YOU WOULDN\u2019T DARE!!!\u201d<br>\r\nCirno\u2019s snooty smirk returned as they both glared daggers at each other. You felt like the odd one out, but there was little you could do to stop these two powerhouses from killing each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe\u2026 MAYBE\u2026\u201d Cirno dragged on the \u2018maybe\u2019, \u201c\u2026maaaaaybe if ya lend me yer Alicksamama, I MIGHT not tell the doc.\u201d<br>\r\nReisen nashed her awfully pearly white teeth. You yourself were a little worried. Even if (and that\u2019s a big IF) she lets you screw Cirno, youre kinda worried what kind of damage this super cold ice fairy could do to you. After Maeve\u2019s arctic hell, the last kind of people you wanna give yourself to are ice elemental lovers! Besides, youre confident your sperm cells would freeze to death long before they reach the ovum!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell? Is yer boytoy gonna give me a good time? Or does Dr. Eirin need to know about your druggy deals?\u201d</span></div></div>",

NOBODY.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-Is somebody there, Alex-sama?\u201d Reisen asked, possibly worried even more than you are of being caught (with good reason. It wasnt just your sister's wrath she feared!)<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I dont see anybody,\u201d you answer, \u201cguess the wind somehow blew the door open, I guess?\u201d<br>\r\nReisen sighed in relief, \u201cSorry, Alex-sama. I forgot to lock the door first! Heh. If I remembered sooner, I'd have probably got away with the FIRST time I glomped you!\u201d She laughed, finding humor in her first rape attempt!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot in the mood to laugh, you just shut the door and exhale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, now that the coast is clear,\u201d Reisen grinned, \u201cwhy dont we continue where we left off?\u201d Although your lifelong friend between your legs was anxious to dive deep inside the bunny girl again, the fear of getting caught and the potentially big repercussions that come with it heavily outweighed temporary sexual pleasure!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2026 probably shouldnt,\u201d you reluctantly turn her down.<br>\r\n\u201cThat's not what your dick is telling me, Alex-sama!\u201d Reisen pointed to your member still fully erect and throbbing! You quickly pull your pants back with your face red like a tomato!<br>\r\n\u201cI-I mean, we kinda lucked out today,\u201d you explained, trying to keep a straight face, \u201cif somebody actually does catch us\u2026 well\u2026\u201d<br>\r\nReisen curls her lips and pouts impatiently, but maybe she's reminded of nearly being shot by your sister, because she doesnt contest it.<br>\r\n\u201cAlright Alex-sama,\u201d she submits, \u201cI think I still have time to make that deal with the trader anyways.\u201d Aww. \u201cPlease dont tell master or the princess about what we did, ok?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI wont even tell Anna,\u201d you promised.<br>\r\n\u201cDont even tell Tewi!\u201d she insisted, \u201cChang'e knows she'll blab to everybody or use it to blackmail me!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou have my word, Reisen,\u201d again you assure her. She smiled, \u201cThanks, Alex-sama! And be sure to come back here later tonight! There wont be a red moon later, so it'll be perfectly safe to mate again!\u201d Red moon? Too bad your lifelong friend didnt care what she meant by that, he just wanted to dive inside her ASAP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we'll see what happe-\u201d you suddenly got lost in her beautiful irresistible glowing eyes again, \u201cI mean I will DEFINITELY be back, Reisen! No matter what! My body is yours and only yours!\u201d You didnt expect that last part to come out of your mouth, but for some reason, you had no problem with it. No problem whatsoever!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hopped out of bed and walked up to smiling sweetly, \u201cI'm glad to hear that. Goodbye kiss!\u201d She puckered her lips ready for her goodbye kiss. You gleefully press your lips against her, completely forgetting they were on your dick earlier, and smooch goodbye.<br>\r\n\u201cWait!\u201d she stopped you before you could leave, \u201cyou forgot to give the OTHER two their goodbye kisses!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOther two?\u201d<br>\r\nThe bunny girl smiled seductively as she unbuttoned her shirt, revealing her lovely exquisite breasts covered in a blue and white striped bra that looked just as irresistible as her glowing eyes! You didnt take more than a second to think about it before you planted a kiss on her left jug and then her right jug! As much as you wanted to french-kiss those babies, it was time to go!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop it,\u201d you sauntered down the hall, whispering to the bulge in your pants that STILL wouldnt go down, \u201cc'mon, cool down already!\u201d It seemed like the more you adjusted your pants, the more that erection displayed in view! What kind of 'vitamin' did Reisen give you?! Viagra?!<br>\r\nCrap! Just thinking about Reisen period is making your lifelong friend even more unruly than ever! It was hard NOT to think about her after you just went at it with her and will go at it with her again later tonight! And of course getting a peek of her striped bra sure didnt help! Seeing something as extravagant like that on a beauty like her was not gonna be leaving your mind ANY time soon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! Anna's brother!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamnit! NOW someone wants your attention?!<br>\r\nYou gritted your teeth, but put yourself behind a fern to hide your erection as you turned over to the princess of the hospital who's suddenly calling for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWh-what is it, Lady Kaguya?\u201d you ask with a straight face as you continue to adjust your pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI've been calling you for almost 10 minutes!\u201d she vents angrily, \u201cwhere have you been?!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI'm sorry, Lady Kaguya,\u201d you quickly think of a good lie, \u201cI was busy\u2026 helping Reisen clean her room.\u201d Not the best excuse, but you were struggling not to flat out say that you were tapping Reisen's ass and are scheduled to continue tapping Reisen's ass later tonight!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, even after the trouble she got us in, you STILL have the nerve to be hanging aroud with her?!\u201d Kaguya understandably disapproves, \u201csigh, nevermind! I need you to do me a favor.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n\u201cHere's the story,\u201d she explained, \u201cI'm short of spending money since Eirin had to spend a huge chunk of Eientei's savings replacing all the medicine here. And daddy couldnt give me my allowance this week cuz a certain bitch decided to increase his 'protection' dues!\u201d Aw dear, is she asking what you think she's asking?!<br>\r\n\u201cAre you asking me to loan you money?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOf course not!\u201d whew, \u201cI know youre a peasant without a dime to his name.\u201d HEY! \u201cMe and a couple of my girlfriends are gonna have a multiplayer gaming session in a little while. And we're not necessarily playing for fun. We're all betting money on today's session and I intend to play to win!\u201d Gambling. First drug dealing, now gambling. Lovely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd where do I come in?\u201d you questioned.<br>\r\n\u201cSimple,\u201d Kaguya smirked, \u201cyoure a strapping young man, theyre single desperate females than had little to no interaction with the opposite sex that isnt plastered on the tv screen! I just need you to\u2026 'distract' them during the game.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201c 'Distract' them?\u201d dang it, your boner's becoming even harder to control!<br>\r\n\u201cYes!\u201d she nodded, \u201ccharm them. Make them focus less on the screen and more on you. Be their 'eye-candy' if you will.\u201d That is a proposal that is way too hard to turn down! A couple of available woman crammed together in one room and your job is to 'entertain' them\u2026 tempting! Super tempting!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut dont even THINK of putting your filthy hands on any of my friends!\u201d Kaguya angrily warned, \u201c...you just sweet talk them and draw their attention away from the screen as I pwn their asses! Nothing more!\u201d Damn. By the way youre feeling, youre not certain you wont do a lot more than just sweet talk them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, hurry! Come with me! Theyre gonna be here soon!\u201d she didnt even wait for you to answer if you could do this for her! But despite her being pushy, it's still your choice to make. It could alleviate some of the tension from that vitamin Reisen made you take, but it could also get you in a lot more trouble if you dont control yourself! Do you dare take the risk?</span></div></div>",

And you are one of those dumb males!<br>\r\nBut in actuality, it's more than sheer stupidity and lust that drives you to staying in that bed with Reisen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of the reason honestly is cuz of Maeve. It was no coincidence that Reisen had a Le Fey outburst and you had a Le Fey nightmare all on the same night. You really REALLY hope Maeve doesnt really plan on doing anything to her, but even if she doesnt, she's still far from through with you. Not only do you need to keep an eye on the poor ill bunny girl closely, you'll need someone to keep an eye on you too. And honestly, you would feel a little safer if you had this beastly beauty watching your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you stopped staring at this Amazonian\u2019s tremendously endowed chest let alone fantasizing about sticking your head in the middle of it and decide the better choice is to stay right where you are. Somehow, you didnt feel so scared anymore.<br>\r\nYou even edged up against her until your hair was interlocking with her long untamed purple hair. You didnt really go any further out of fear she might wake up and think youre invading her personal space (nevermind she already invaded yours!).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of, you suspect she may have noticed your affection what with her shiver and long sigh in her sleep. She\u2019s probably having a good dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Al\u2026.Ex\u2026.Sa\u2026.Ma\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA VERY good dream!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, since she has no problem with you sharing your bed with her, you could safely doze off. Next to her, you\u2019d have no trouble sleeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least until she rolled over. Right on top of you. The sudden compression of weight knocked the wind out of you. And she was pretty heavy. Fortunately she wasnt crushing you, but squeezing out from under her was easier said than done. And waking her up right now might not be good for your health.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut even if you werent worried about what might happen if you wake her up, you still wouldnt wanna squeeze out from under her\u2026 because you were kinda enjoying having her exquisitely large breasts pressed against your face! You\u2019d probably be lost in her cleavage if it weren\u2019t for her blue and white striped bra blocking the way, which by the way looked incredibly amazing on her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCombined that with her irresistible scent filling your nostrils and your hormones were going out of whack. Your erection was poking against her inner thigh as if purposely TRYING to reach that certain spot of hers just a little further up!<br>\r\nYour hands were twitching, struggling against the urge to wrap your arms around Reisen and maybe undo that bra strap of hers and let loose!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstinct (at least the more sensible one!) was warning you not to try anything funny. You know Reisen is pretty mentally ill and youre  not familiar with this side of her! There was probably good reason she wanted to get as far away from you as possible earlier!<br>\r\nYou barely saved yourself last time she snuck into your room while you slept thanks to your sister. Youre confident you wont fare better if she wakes up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, temptation is nipping at your mind. It\u2019d only be fair to take advantage of her while she slept seeing as though she did the same thing last night!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously that\u2019s not a good idea. But are you really interested in a good idea at the moment?!</span></div></div>",

D-Did you sleep well?\"<br>\r\n\"I certainly have,\" you hop out of bed, \"thanks for making it more comfortable for me!\" It was so cute making her blush the way she did!<br>\r\nShe put down her paintbrush and coughed, \"*Ahem* L-Listen, about last night... if I hurt you in any ANY way, I swear it was not intentional and I'm really REALLY sorry.\"<br>\r\n\"You didnt hurt me any,\" you assure her, \"I just wished you couldve introduced me to your big sister first.\"<br>\r\nShe looked away, \"That... wasnt my big sister.... sheswaytoofattolooklikethat-I MEAN, that was... a little phase... I go through... during a red moon and I swear I locked myself in my room before the change! I dont remember leaving it at all last night.\"<br>\r\n\"It's alright,\" you tell her, \"you didnt cause any harm (except for what she did to the rest of your room, anyways). In fact, you were sleeping quite soundly by the time I found you.\" You dont delve any deeper than that... no matter how much you want to! \"Curious though, how did you manage to start turning into that in the first place? Were you bit by a were-rabbit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head, \"Actually, I think it was one of the nasty side-effects from some the old pills I took for my Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. Still, ALL of those side-effects combined are infinitely better than reliving those horrible memories from the Lunar December War.\" Oh dear. Best not push the broken war veteran on such trivial issues. <br>\r\n\"Well you neednt worry about all that anymore,\" you tell her, \"how's about we put our minds at ease and go get some breakfast.\"<br>\r\n\"Cant,\" she frowned, \"the princess and Mokou had another fight in the dining hall and now theyre busy fixing it.\" UGH!<br>\r\n\"That's fine. I'm not hungry anyway,\" you have to come up with a Plan B, \"need help fixing the wall?\"<br>\r\n\"It's alright,\" Reisen tells you, \"I can take care of this.... if the stupid paint would dry faster.\"<br>\r\n\"How uh... how did those tears happen anyway?\"<br>\r\nReisen sighed, \"The Princess and Mokou mustve brought their fight over here when they done with the dining hall... they also tore up the door too.\" You nodded, pretending to believe her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know she's lying, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widened after hearing a familiar cold voice come out of Reisen's lips! You jerk your head back to her and notice her eyes widening unusually! Oh crap!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's obvious who done it,\" Reisen pointed to herself as the other voice spoke, \"the were-bitch had a little temper tantrum when she noticed you werent in this room. She wanted to be awake when you were kissing her tits!\"<br>\r\nYou gritted your teeth, \"Maeve, what the hell do you want now?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh nothing big, traitor,\" 'Reisen' stood up and smiled, \"I was just bored torturing your fellow backstabbers and wanted to drop in to see how you were doing. Certainly not disappointed!\"<br>\r\n\"Maeve, leave Reisen alone! She has nothing to do with you!\"<br>\r\n\"Oh but she's such an incredible woman!\" she remarked, \"for a horny disturbed drug-addicted dishonorably discharged lunatic, she's incredibly powerful. Mind-altering eyes, fingers like gun-barrels, superior strength... she'd make a hell of an addition to our ranks if I wasnt worried she'd tear apart our female colleagues who so much as looked at you funny!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maeve, PLEASE dont hurt her,\" you pleaded, \"your fight is with me and my sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tsked, \"Oh stop shivering, you little shit. I'm not gonna hurt your precious mistress. In fact...\" 'Reisen' smirked, \"..since I'm in a generous mood, I'm gonna fulfill her desire to get at aste of you.\" She then reaches under her skirt and pulls down her striped panties that went extremely well with her bra!<br>\r\n\"Maeve stop! Stop it!\"<br>\r\n\"Why? If anything you should be thanking me,\" she spoke, \"you really arent the first male to penetrate her filthy cunt. Yet, she thinks that's all youre worthy of. ...She doesnt think youre worthy enough for her OTHER hole.\"<br>\r\nYou flinch as Reisen possessed by your former boss bends over the drawer, lifts her skirt, then spreads her asscheeks, revealing the tight puckering hole between them! Good lord, she's actually trying to make you do what you THINK she's trying to make you do!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dont worry, Alex,\" she grins, \"it's untouched. She's never let anyone before you fuck her asshole. Besides, I think it's exceptionally fitting for a little shit like you!\" Damned if you werent tempted! If what Maeve said is true, that you wouldnt be the first boy taking her vaginally, it seemed more honoring to be the first to take Reisen's other special virgin hole that to this day remains untouched (unless you count suppositories!).<br>\r\n\"Go on, Alex,\" she coos, \"stick it right in... you know you want to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat are you thinking?! You cant do this to her! There's an obvious reason she doesnt let anybody penetrate her there! Snap out of it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way! I'm not doing this to her! You cant make m-....\" suddenly, you find yourself unable to look away from the glowing red eyes in the mirror. Whatever pent up resistance you had was gradually slipping away without notice just staring into the reflection of her eyes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex-sama...\" Maeve mocked Reisen's sweet tone, \"please ravage my little rabbit hole like the filthy little dog that you are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Woof...\" you obediently unzipped your pants, pulled down your boxers and pressed up behind her, ready to do exactly as youre told! If it's anal the irresistible bunny-earred mistress wants, it is anal she shall have!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Wha... huh... what just happened,\" unbeknownst to you, Reisen began to regain herself... right on time to see the reflection in the mirror! \"A-A-Alex-sama? What are you doing?\"</span></div></div>",

NO!\" You denied, \"It was Maeve!! She possessed you and tried to tempt me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It was no use as she sobbed, you didn't know what you want to say: you almost raped the bunny girl and that's the fact you had to swallow hard. She continued to sob, then you got on to your knees and put your head on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I beg you! I didn't mean it! I swear!\" You shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Reisen looked at your position, then came to you and lowered her hand. You looked at her with fear that she might hate you, tell eirin and Kaguya about it and both you and Anna would be permanently banned from eientei.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Alex Sama...I don't know what caused you to do it, but I can see your apology sincere.\" Reisen said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"That mean..\" you spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'll let this slide.\" Reisen replied.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n Your tears fell, and got her hands thanking her for it. After few moment, you explained to her what happened and Reisen was shocked to hear it as she don't remember anything. Just then, the door opened, revealing Anna holding a zweihander on her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Alex, we're taking a trip.\" Anna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Trip? Why? And where?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"One of my closest ally is currently residing in the shining needle castle. She wants to meet us.\" Anna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"And who's the person?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Nero Claudius Aelius.\" Anna responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You remember her as she is a pure roman lady who had the blood of famous ancient roman emperor Nero Claudius. Somewhere in the ancestry, elf came in and the current Nero was half-elf. She was also expert swordsman and good with accuracy with sniper gun as she temporarily worked for Maeve herself as a guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Nero would be happy to see you.\" Anna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Alright..but can Reisen come along?\" You asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n She looked at the bunny with cold eyes and answered.</span></div></div>",

Anna didn't say anything for 2 minutes then sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Fine, she can come.\" Anna gave in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Thank you Anna.\" You thanked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You two got up and got out of the room. Reisen told you she'll be going to see Eirin to get permission to go out and left. Once that, both you and anna got out of the building and waited for Reisen. Anna took out a cigarette and started to smoke while you waited, and after few minutes Reisen got out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Let's get going.\" Reisen said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You nodded than Anna took out some sort of paper with some scribble on it. You didn't know what was that until Anna spoke few Celtic language than a light engulfed all three of you and vanished. You blinked your eyes realizing that you were no longer in eientei, but a hallway of some place. You looked out only to see a sky, and when you looked down you saw the land which was very low.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Whoa!! We're in sky!?\" You asked with surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Of course, the shining needle castle resides in the sky.\" Reisen replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You shivered little, then you heared someone saying 'hey!' And turned around. It was a blond female with blue eyes and had casual cloth on. It was Nero herself and she came to you all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hi Alex, hi Anna! Haven't seen you two for quite while!\" Nero said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'm glad to see you again Nero.\" You responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hehe..I bet you missed me. Here, give me a hug!\" Nero spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNero then came to you and hugged you tightly. Her well balanced chest squeezed your chest, making you blush while Anna was getting annoyed and Reisen were getting jealous of her. Nero was the cheeriest person you ever met, even the small trouble would not break it. After moment of hug, she finally got off from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"So Nero, do you have business with us?\" Anna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ah, yes! There is a person you must see.\" Nero said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"And that is?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Scathach.\" Nero answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You didn't know who this person were then you notice Anna's eyes open wide.

Reisen endured it and for some reason you continued to jump her without any hesitation or reason and continued to hump her then after long time, you regained your consciousness and saw Reisen on the floor with her anus full of semen and cum, her eyes were unconsciousness and tears flowed. You realized that you penetrated her silly to the point she fainted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh...god!! What I have done!?\" You spoke in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You dressed yourself and got out of the room only to bump into your sister.

You jolted and quickly ran off. Anna felt uneasy and looked into the room to see what was inside. You went outside to get your head straight.

Even Reisen was right there understandably sobbing her eyes out and Tewi staring uneasily to add more piss to the fire. Then the room, no the entire building got awkwardly quiet... not counting Reisen's sobbing... that YOU caused!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex Whitestone,\" Eirin finally broke the silence with her uncomfortably sharp tone of voice, \"did you anally rape my assistant?\" You lower your head, ashamed of your action regardless of whether you did it voluntarily, and nodded.<br>\r\nAnna sneered with disgust, \"Ugh! Are you kidding me, Alex?! Do you have any idea how dangerous that is?! Did they not teach you why doing something like THAT is bad for you in school? If you wanna die a slow horrible death from contracting AIDs, fucking something in the ass is a great way to do it!\" She even whispered, \"Especially if it's with THIS disgusting tramp! God knows what kinds of bugs you got from her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Whitestone,\" Eirin tried to sound calm even though you knew she was infinitely more furious than she looked, \"you and your sister have been a welcomed guest of Eientei in exchange for no compensation regardless of what the princess claims you owe us. What on earth gave you the mindset to viciously traumatize one of my most loyal pupils who happens to be suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder?\"<br>\r\n\"I... I can explain!\" you explained, \"it was Maeve! She messed with Reisen's head again and somehow manipulated me to do something I swear to God I would never do!\"<br>\r\n\"So I WAS cursed then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReisen spoke up in the middle of her sobs. Again, youre drawn to her tearful glowing red eyes. But not out of hypnotism. Out of intimidation because their was anger in them.<br>\r\n\"*Sniff!* You said I wasnt cursed,\" she sobbed, \"you told me I was gonna be fine! Why did you lie to me?!\"<br>\r\n\"I-I-I'm sorry, Reisen. I never thought it would end up escalating this badly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it did,\" Anna stated, \"we gotta make some calls, send over some backup, and I'll have Marcus look after Vivian and-\"<br>\r\n\"Anna Whitestone,\" Eirin's cold voice stopped Anna in her tracks, \"I think you and your brother need to leave.\" LEAVE?!<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Anna jerked her head to her, \"but we've-\"<br>\r\n\"I think you've attracted enough trouble for us already,\" the strict doctor stated, \"I cant afford putting my patience or my princess in any more danger.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh c'mon!\" Anna made the dumb decision to point to Reisen and nag, \"I put up with HER after SHE tried to rape my brother! Now he practically gives her what she wanted, and all of a sudden it's crossing the line?!\" Reisen stared angrily at her.<br>\r\n\"MS. WHITESTONE,\" Eirin raised her voice and shut your sister up, \"get your things and leave immediately. For your safety and ours, you are no longer welcomed here at Eientei.\" You felt crushed. She was actually kicking you out. As terrible as it was to attempt, it was in their best interest. As long as you and your were there, they were potential targets. You never meant to give them trouble, but trouble follows you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, Alex,\" Anna swayed her head to follow her. As you followed behind, you took once last glance over at Reisen.<br>\r\n\"Hmph!\" she angrily turned her head away. THAT hurt. Your favorite lovable mentally ill yet lovestruck bunny girl... couldnt even look at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didnt even come by one last time to say goodbye as you packed your things from your room. The only one generous to say goodbye was Tewi who said nothing and just gave you a goodbye kiss.<br>\r\nOn the lips.<br>\r\nAnd slipping a little tongue.<br>\r\nNow you not only feel low for raping Reisen, you also feel low for getting a french kiss from a kid!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides that, nobody else bothered to say goodbye. You were not welcome anymore. You and Anna stomped out of there trekking the bamboo forest with all your belongings in bags.<br>\r\n\"Anna,\" after what seemed like too long, you finally broke the silence between you two, \"I'm really sorry I caused all this.\"<br>\r\nShe shrugs, \"Eh, I know it aint your fault. That mentally deranged pill-popper woulda probably ended up raping you anyway. We should probably have you tested and make you ya didnt contract anything, though. God, I knew we shoulda stayed at Mokou's little shack. At least we'd get plenty of cigarettes.\u201d<br>\r\n\"I really shoulda told Reisen that Maeve was targeting her,\" you say with regret, \"we coulda probably done something to prevent this.\"<br>\r\n\"Forget about her, bro,\" she replied, \"we need to think of another place to hide out. I managed to convince Marcus to let Vivian stay at his place... but he couldnt take us cuz he's having a family reunion and the house is gonna be packed enough. How about Arnold's hideout?\"<br>\r\n\"No, they expect me to go the gym with them and lift weights,\" you shoot that down, \"I almost took out my back last time.\"<br>\r\n\"How about you stay with Hassan?\" she offered, \"she said she wouldnt mind looking after you a while.\"<br>\r\n\"She wants me to convert.\"<br>\r\n\"So convert.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm not converting!\" you exclaim, \"I'm perfectly fine with my faith!\"<br>\r\n\"But what's wrong with being a muslim?\" she honestly asked that! Can anybody possibly believe this?!<br>\r\n\"Do you need me to write a list?! This is out of the question! ...I think it might be best to take up Mikaela's offer to live with her in St. Petersburg-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\" she immediately snapped, \"we're not that desperate! We'll NEVER be that desperate!\"<br>\r\nYou exhaled and think to yourself, 'She doesnt trust me with Mikaela yet she thinks HASSAN'S a better caretaker?!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, I'll call up some friends later,\u201d explained Anna, \u201cuntil then, there's a hotel over at the local village we can spend the night at.\u201d<br>\r\n\"Did you already book us a room?\" you asked.<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n\"Do you know if they got any vacant rooms?\"<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n\"Do you even know the name of the hotel?\"<br>\r\n\"No.\" UGH!<br>\r\n\"Anna!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex, just relax! We're gonna be fine. We'll be in a nice cozy hotel room before you know it.\"<br>\r\n\"And what if there isnt a vacant hotel in the village?\" you asked.<br>\r\n\"Then we'll camp out,\" she answered, \"I got a tent.\"<br>\r\n\"Camp out?! HERE?!\" you could actually see many pairs of eyes hidden in bushes staring your way. Waiting. Watching. Not caring that you might have gone sick from sexing the backdoor of your favorite bunny girl that'll probably never speak to you again.<br>\r\n\"Of course, it aint so bad,\" she was oblivious to all the hidden threats YOU were aware of, \"but we'll worry about that only IF we cant get a room! Now hurry and catch up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou follow Anna through the village ironically nicknamed 'Human Village' despite the fact you spotted more youkai people than actual human people. It was a very culturally diverse town. Also potentially dangerous too, cuz of all the pick-pocketers, shop-lifters, thuggish extorters, and brute grizzlies willing to pick a fun out of boredom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"!!!\" you almost jumped a mile after feeling somebody squeeze your ass! You turned around only to see a tall bulkly blonde female oni whistling innocently as she chugs down her booze.<br>\r\n\"!!!\" that left you vulnerable to ANOTHER ass-squeeze! You turn your head again only to see an older woman in buddhist attire with yellow and purplish hair chanting innocently as she recites her scriptures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the feeling of being violated by a lush and a proselytizer died down, the two of you finally reached the hotel. The ONLY hotel in the entire village. And a pretty small hotel too. You got a bit worried. You REALLY dont want to camp out on the streets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs it vacant? Do they still have a room left for you?!</span></div></div>",

She paid in cash, and once got to the room, the surroundings were normal ar the best. Anna told you she had to make a few phone call and left the scene. You sighed and laid on the bed, memory still fresh. You began to feel depressed after what happened and wished you could have avoided the incident. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What a day..\" you murmured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You then closed your eyes to get some rest, after moment of rest, you woke up and saw Anna with her upper body naked, revealing her scars and bruises that she got during her stay at Maeve and a tattoo of many rune magic letters on her back. You never knew she had that tattoo, then she wore the good shirt then turned around, noticing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Your awake.\" Anna said as she buttoned up, she put the tie on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Are you going somewhere?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Do you remember Anastasia Nightingale? She gave us the opening.\" Anna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You remember Anastasia as she is one of the richest girl who became a nurse when she was young. She tells that she is the direct descendant of the sister of Florence Nightingale. She was born in United States and lived there until she was 21 when she moved to Moscow for business reason. She temporarily joined the fey for medical reason then left after the contract were finished. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Really? Where?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"That, she didn't say.\" Anna said, \"she said she'll tell us over dinner.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  You were modestly happy to see her as she did give you some prescription medicines for free and some spending money. She told you to get up and get dressed and you did. After few minutes, you got changed and two of you got out of the hotel and walked to the direction. After few minutes of walking, you saw the long silver haired woman in good dress standing. It was Nightingale and she came to you two with smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"So you two are ok.\" Anastasia spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yes, long time no see Anya.\" You responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She smiled and told you two she reserved a seat in the fancy French restaurant. You two got to the place and went in and took the seat. After moment, the server brought a bottle of expensive Chardenet and poured it in the wine glass and gave it to you all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Your food shall arrive shortly.\" Waiter spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Thank you.\" Anya replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He bowed and left the scene.

I'll pick you two up tomorrow.\" Anastasia replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Both you and Anna thanked her as the dinner continued, you were still thinking about Reisen. You truly hoped that the eientei members would forgive you in the future. Once the dinner was finished, Anastasia paid the bill with her shiny credit card and once you two got out, Anastasia bid farewell and left as you two head back to the hotel and retired for a night. Morning rose, and when you woke up you saw a tray with a pancake in the top. You noticed the sticky paper and you picked it up, and it wrote:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Eat and get dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Anna's handwriting and you ate the pancake. After breakfast you dressed yourself, then noticed your belonging were gone.

There were many unique youkai people from person with horn to one with long tail. After few minutes you three arrived at rather big house that were like a small mansion. You three got in and Anastasia guided you to the guest room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"This will be your room mr.whitestone.\" Anastasia said, then turned ed to Anna \"your room is next one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Thank you Anastasia, I owe you one.\" Anna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"No problem.

He was also carrying some sort of long walking stick with a bell on the end of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 'What the hell?'

Your heart beated as your chest were somehow bigger and wearing a suit on. You then touched your head, only to realize you had a bunny ears on your head. You quickly went inside and went to the rest room to see yourself in the mirror.

At least tell me your name!\" You shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She didn't say anything then spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You can call me Louisa Ferre.\" Female replied, \"we'll meet again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She then walked away with her bare foot and disappeared. You didn't ring bell on who that person were, then resumed to run. You managed to return to the human village, but you didn't know where the direction to the old capital until you remember a small teleportation paper you took from Maeve before you left her in her pocket. You took out and was about to use it until-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Wait for mee!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You saw Tewi pounce on your stomach and transported to the mansion Anastasia rented.

How did you manage to teleport to the old capital?\" Tewi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I..ah..um..\" you mumbled, couldn't answer her question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She continued to look at you until you two saw Anna come out of the house with cigarette in her mouth.

After few hours of sleep you woke up, noticing a chatting noise from the hallway. You got up and went out only to see Anna talking on the cellphone.

She got out and looked around, pointing her gun. There she noticed a young man in deep pain, and the rich nurse quickly realized what was going on and immediately shot the man on his head. He died instantly and suddenly revealed an dark aura around him. It was very strong and the rest of the eientei crew got out to see as they felt the strong evil vibe. Anastasia were breathed out heavily and was about to run back to the underground home until..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWait!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Anastasia stopped as eirin stopped her, the Crimean angel looked at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWhat in the world happened to that young man!?

Maeve looked just like the same as when you first saw her: long pink hair with Celtic cloth on, she was smiling toward you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hmhmm! Little shits in fear all right.\" Maeve said, \"now Anna..with the power of Angra Mainyu, kill the weakling!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Anna lifted her sword and thruster it toward you, as you covered yourself you were transported to different area, only to be in the chamber with a doctor, Anastasia, and a long brown haired woman with a spear on her. You looked closely and remember the doc as she was Peggy from the summer court!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Peggy?\" You mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" Now then, do what you must, lady scathach.\" Peggy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You don't recognize the females name then you saw Anna on the table beating the concealed arms and legs. 'Scathach' person spoke in ancient Celtic language then turned into the rune magic and place her hand on her back. Anna screamed in pain as it started to make a thunderous noise then a black lightning were made, causing both Peggy and Anastasia to cover themselves and after a brief moment, everything was calmed and the ladies moved, then you saw the exact same tattoo that you saw on her back earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I have sealed the power of Angra Mainyu deep into her soul.\" Scathach said,\"but be warned, as the seal is very powerful, it's not permanent as either time or the sealers free will to break it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n They all nodded as you were astonished to hear what you just heard. You wondered why Anna never told you this and wondered if she was doung this while the two of you were away as you do remember seeing the news about a burned city in one of the European country.

You dont want to go to Arnold's place nor Hassan's place.\" Anna quotes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"And I suggested to see Mikaela, but no! You're too stubborn to see it through!\" You said with slight anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't know full detail about that Russian bitch! She is dangerous woman who take advantage of the one who're desperate!\" Anna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Anna argued for while until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...excuse me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Both you and Anna turned to see a grey haired female with green dress and grey t-short under the dress. You then immediatly noticed her carrying a katana as Anna noticed as well and put her hand slowly in her chest pocket holding a hidden derringer in case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What do you need?\" Anna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'm sorry,but i overheard your conversation.\" Girl said, \"you two need a roof over your head?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Anna were silent as she hates people overhear the conversation. You were well aware of someone interrupting her conversation meant a slap in their face. Anna then opened her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yeah, why ask?\" Anna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I can let you two in.\" Girl replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n This was an opportunity of chance as you really didn't want to spend a night out of the place an probably get hurt by the youkai. You wanted Anna to accept the offer then Anna sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Guess beggars can't be a choosers.\" Anna said, \"I'll take it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You were glad to hear that and all of you introduced themselves as her name was konpaku youmu, a half ghost sword woman who is a Gardner in the place called hakugyokurou. She escorted you two toward the place and started to walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It took you..</span></div></div>",

You noticed many row of cherry blossom trees on the side while there was a long stair up...a LONG stair up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Our destination is over the stairs.\" Youmu said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Wait, we're climbing that?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yes.\" Youmu answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You sighed little while Anna comforted you then three of you started to walk up the stairs. It was easy at first until 30 minutes you started to feel tired and your legs were getting tired and you slowed down. Anna noticed it and she came to you and picked you up like a princess and continued to walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"A-Anna! You don't have to-!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"It is my duty as your big sister to help you out.\" Anna replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You were embarrassed by this as youmu saw it and chuckled little. After another 30 minutes, you all reached the building. The building were Japanese style mansion and it was majestic to see. Once you got inside, she took you two to guest room and you two sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Now please wait, as I shall notify lady yuyuko.\" Youmu said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Who's lady Yuyuko?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"She is the head mistress of hakugyokurou. Now sit back and relax.\" You mu said and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You tried to relax, but couldn't because you felt paranoid that Maeve might have followed you and your sister, and god knows if she possess that youmu girl or this yuyuko person. You felt sick in your stomach and turned to Anna, seeing her lighting a cigarette and started smoking. After few minutes, young came back with a pink haired lady with frilly blue stress, blue hat with a triangle thing with Naruto-like picture on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you two must be the one youmu said.\" Lady said, \"I am yuyuko saigyouji, the head of this place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Anna puts the cigarette away then turned to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I am Anna Whitestone, a changeling. He is Alexander Whitestone, my little brother.\" Anna said with a bow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Yuyuko chuckled and came in and sat down. You felt she might be very important Person as she sat down, she looked at you two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I have heared youmus story. Can you tell me full story?\" Yuyuko asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You see, we-\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"We were originally being sheltered at eientei until Imade a huge mistake, making them angry and caused me and Alex to be banned from eientei.\" Anna said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Your eyes opened wide looking at your sister. She took the blame that you caused! You wanted to say something but you just stayed silent as yuyuko thought, she got to her conclusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you two had hard times.\" Yuyuko said, \"alright, I'll accept you two in hakugyokurou.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Thank you!\" You thanked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"No problem. Youmu? Please take them to the guest sleeping quarters.\" Yuyuko said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yes, lady yuyuko.\" Youmu replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She then took you and Anna to grimiest room. Your room were the one near the living room while Anna's place were next to rest room.

You got up and got out to investigate as you followed the weird noise, you reached the backyard. You now noticed the weird noise were a ballet music and you saw a long purple haired girl with blue ribbon on her head. You looked as she was dancing perfectly in unison of music and her hair flows beautifully. You continued to look until the girl noticed you and stopped dancing and turned the music off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You know it's rude to see ones dance without permission.\" Girl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh..huh? Oh!! I'm so sorry, I heard the music and I became curious then...\" you tried to reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The girl came close to you and once stopped, you then notice how strikingly she resembles your sister Anna herself. She might have different hair color and different eye color, but her facial structure looked very similar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well? Aren't you going to say something?\" Girl asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Anna? Is that you?\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You didn't know why you asked that question. The girl was silent for moment then smiled and chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I see, so your the one she took care of..\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You..know me?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She took step back and coughed lightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I am miria, Anna's alter ego.\" She answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You were very surprised to hear that and she continue to speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You see, when Anna was around twelve, maeve ordered Niphilim to use Anna to create the ultimate weapon by forcing her to ingest the core of Angra Mainyu.\" She explained, \"they succeeded, but they don't know that Anna splitted her ego to save herself, and that's where I was born.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"That's..,a lot to swallow.\" You said, \"but I never see her on bad side.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"She might keeping that as secret. Heck, she might kept my existance a secret from you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Why!? Why does she have to keep secret from me!?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Just then, you heared a foot noise. You realize someone was coming toward your place. Miria jumped back, landing on the tree and she smiled at you, showing her pointy ears and her exposed belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Don't worry Alex Whitestone. I am your ally, and I shall help you as much as I can.\" Miria said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She then left the scene, leaving you alone for moment then you turned around and saw yuyuko standing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"My, can't go to sleep?\" Yuyuko asked. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"Yeah..light breeze helped me.\" You said, \"I'm going back to sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You bid farewell and went back to your bed and went to bed. Next morning came, and you got up, dressed yourself and put the futon away. Just then, youmu came, telling you the breakfast is ready and you followed her. Few minutes later, you reached the dining room and you saw yuyuko with a lot of food and Anna on the other side. You nodded and sat next to Anna and youmu handed you breakfast. You still remember what Miria said, and looked at Anna for moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill you ask Anna about Miria?</span></div></div>",

You attempted to hide your fear, but the fatigue from er... um..... eeeehhhh.... hell, I say it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fatigue from brutally screwing Reisen in the ass nonstop kinda took it's toll on you! Whether it was your fault or not, you were too exhausted to think of a lie or even attempt to cover up what you did. Besides, you just cant lie to your sister. And even in the extremely rare times you can, she can easily sniff out that lie in no time flat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMight as well just come clean now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen. About what happened earlier in my room with Reisen-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please! Dont fucking talk about it!\" thankfully, Anna cuts you off with sheer disgust, \"I dont wanna fucking hear it! I get it! Youre lonely! I havent given you much opportunity to find a girl and that pill-popping disease-ridden lunatic is offering herself to you every chance she gets!\"<br>\r\n\"Ms. Whitestone,\" Eirin turned to her, feeling a bit perturbed, \"I'd appreciate it if you'd not talk about one of my most trustworthy assistants like that.\"<br>\r\n\"And I'D appreciate it if your most trustworthy assistant would keep her disgusting claws off my brother!\" Anna snapped back.<br>\r\n\"If you talk back to me ONE more time, I'll throw you out!\" Eirin warned her. Anna gritted her teeth and raised her finger as if she was about to say something right back, but thankfully she bit her lip and sighed hard. Good sis.<br>\r\nHowever, she did manage to squeeze out \"This discussion between us aint over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ANYWAYS,\" Dr. Yagokoro turned her attention away from your sister and back to you, \"since we're on the subject, it's come to my attention that Reisen made quite an incredible mess of your room, is that correct?\" You mean the whole She-Hulk thing where she trashed your bedroom cuz you werent there and she wanted to awake when you were kissing her tits according to Maeve while she was possessed by her?! Yep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glanced over at Anna who was looking bad rather coldly and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So she HAS been neglecting to take her medicine then,\" Eirin sighed embarrassingly as Anna looked back at HER coldly, \"Mr. Whitestone, I am sorry that you had to witness my subordinate in such a state. I have strictly told her time and time again that she needs to take her medicine in a timely manner to avoid these particular incidents. Has she hurt you in any way while she was... changed?\"<br>\r\n\"Cuz if she did...\" your sister points to her gun holster.<br>\r\nBut you shake your head, \"No. She was completely fast asleep by the time I woke up and er... noticed her in my room.\" Despite not being much of a liar, you still had a thing for deliberately leaving out detail... like that she rolled over you in her sleep and you had her bedazzling striped bra clad boobs pressed into your face as you slept! Even now, you STILL had those stripes imprinted in your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you never thought to slip out of that room as soon as possible cuz 'holy shit Crazy Reizy is a freaking werewolf I need to go before she rips me to pieces'?\" Anna made a really good point.<br>\r\nYou got a little nervous and answered, \"N-no... she didnt seem threatening to me. And even if she did... well, if I TRIED to sneak out and I ended up waking her... it'd be safer to just stay put and keep quiet.\" That wasnt a lie, by the way! But you DID leave out the fact that you were incredibly infatuated with Were-Reisen and kinda hope you get to see her like this again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNonetheless, Eirin bows apologetically, \"I'm very sorry this happened to you, I assure you, this occurrence is incredibly rare and only happens during a particular full moon, so it's extremely rare you even witnessed it to begin with!\" EXTREMELY RARE?!! AWWWW!!! \"Nevertheless, I'll see to it she takes her medicine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well thanks to this little incident, I have to find Vivian a better place to hide out,\" your sister explains, \"if I had known this place cant properly lock up their more problematic patients, I wouldve never entrusted it with my little girl!\" She then glared at you, \"I'd worry the same about you, but you know what? I give up! If you wanna chase crazy unstable tricks so badly, fine! You go right ahead! Dont come crying to me when she ends up breaking your heart... and maybe some bones.\" Geez.<br>\r\n\"What's gonna happen to Vivian?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna have to call her 'dad' to come pick her up,\" she answers as she pulls out her phone.<br>\r\n\"Ms. Whitestone, our lady would really appreciate it if you kept our location confidential,\" Eirin tells her.<br>\r\n\"Shoulda thought of that before you decided to let your pet werewolves roam free!\" she punches a few digits on her phone, waits for the ring, and then the answer, \"HI Yumi, it's me. Yeah yeah, I'm doing fine, how about you? ...Oh really, that's cool, congrats. Listen can you do me a big favor? Can you get Goro on the phone? ...Yeah, I know I told him never to call me, but this is kindof an emergency.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou breathed a hard sigh of relief that you dodged a bullet. You really thought you were in trouble, but it turned out to be a false alarm. Well maybe not so much. You may have just lost a little respect from your sister, but part of you believes (and may be right) there's a certain other reason she doesnt want you getting too clingy with other girls...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of, you really hope Reisen will be alright. You really shouldve told her that Maeve's gotten a strong hold of her. Maybe then you couldve avoided that little episode. <br>\r\nAnd you couldnt believe you had actually done what you did. Despite that cute mentally ill bunny girl's cries of begging you to stop, you continued almost emotionlessly until she collapsed from exhaustion! That is not you! What could have happened that caused you to do something so cold?! You needed to talk to her. Maeve or no Maeve, you need to make it up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly head over to your room, but it was already blocked off due to rabbit nurses currently working on repairing it. Boy, they sure got to work fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next option would be to head over to Reisen's room. It wasnt that difficult to spot, thanks to the cute bunny-shaped placard that read 'Udonge' on the door. Not only was the door unlocked, it wasnt even closed. Instead of knocking, you just creep right in uninvited, assuming that the inhabitant doesnt have a tendency to shoot trespassers!<br>\r\nYou glanced around her fancy Vegas Casino-style bedroom, practically filling to the brim with nostalgia about the few times you spent in Las Vegas, but kept focused on the task at hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reisen?\" you called out, \"Reisen, are you here? I need to talk to you. Reisen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you hear the door slam shut behind you! Just before you could turn around, you felt a quick sharp jab in your neck! Oh crap, a needle! And unfortunately you didnt get time to register the shock from the sight of it before your body loses it's balance and you collapse on the floor! For the moment, you have tremendous difficulty moving your arms and legs, let alone attempt to get up off the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd right on cue, above you stood that cute purple haired mentally ill bunny girl staring down at you. Good news was Maeve wasnt controlling her. Bad news was she STILL wasnt happy to see you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex-sama! How could you?!!\" she screamed at you with tears in her eyes! \"*SNIFF!* How could you do that to me?!! That really hurt me!!\"<br>\r\n\"R....Rei...sen...\" you could barely mumble as she continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You knew you werent supposed to put it in THAT part of me!\" she whined, \"A ladies butthole is absolutely 100% forbidden! Dont you know how incredibly sensitive that part is?!

She snapped again! You had the worst feeling Maeve was still watching. And smirking with glee!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReisen wiped the tears away with her tattered sleeve and gave what looked to be a cutesy angered glare, \"*Sniff!* Fine! You wanna play rough, Alex-sama?! We'll play rough!!\" She reached under her tattered blouse, \"I've got something really really REALLY special just for you! Hope youre ready for it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widened as you watched her pull out...</span></div></div>",

Your libido was taking the wheel.<br>\r\nReisen may possible be a scary grizzly destructive beast in this form, but she was the hottest scary grizzly destructive beast you've set your eyes on!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were so infatuated by this beastly form, you wasted no time slipping your hands under her tattered shirt  and doing your best trying to unclip the bra strap that's holding up the fun-pillows that are currently in your face. It was a bit harder then you thought, since you couldnt feel any clip of some sort to unclip. Even with ruthless tugs, the bra strap wouldnt come undone.<br>\r\nYou wouldnt stop yourself from just tearing Reisen's bra apart just to get to those breasts, but there was probably a good reason this is one of the only pieces of clothing that DIDNT tear through her transformation!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut even that doesnt stop you from trying to get what you want! You mercilessly struggled with that forsaken bra, yanking, tugging, digging your nails through it, even using your teeth, hoping maybe the clip was in the front. It wasnt. You were getting impatient. You could almost hear the bra's stripes mocking you! Those poor jugs were crying out for help and you couldnt do a thing to save them from their devious restraint!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cArgghh!\u201d you growled with your mouth full of bra, \u201ccum oft! Cum oft ya thupid\u2026\u201d At this rate, you could sooner tear through Maeve's icy heart before this damn contraption, until finally you could feel a vulnerable loose string from the bra strap.<br>\r\n One long tug of that string made quite a bit of the binding lace come undone. With that out of the way, the strap became much easier to tear into. It took a few messy rips, but you finally severed that horrible striped chest holder!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou yanked it off of her, not giving a damn of the consequences when she wakes up, and greedily bask in the smothering of her large jumbly breasts freed from such a vice, their perky nipples poking your face. Berserk from the lust, you dont even take a moment to think before you start kissing her sensitive tits!<br>\r\nReisen panted heavily, no doubt feeling you during her pleasant dream! Her fingers twitched when you started running your tongue across those nipples!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grave threat of Maeve's influence was not deterring you from sucking on her tits like a starving baby! The fact she was easily tearing your mattress with her nails digging into it awfully close to you didnt deter you either!<br>\r\nAs if you werent being unnecessarily reckless enough, one of your hands slipped between the sleeping transformed bunny girl's legs and this colossal she-beast began to twitch uncontrollably on top of you. The sensation your fingers were giving her nether-region made her pant so hard, her tongue rolled out of her mouth and she began drooling over the space above your head!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sane rational voice in your brain was screaming for you to stop, but you could not. Something about her was triggering you to go feral. For this brief period, the fears of Le Fey were pushed aside to make room for dozens of thoughts of making as many babies as possible with this she-beast! So what if she's gonna crush your windpipe when she wakes up? At least you'll die with a smile on your face\u2026 or at least something that resembles a smile!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYauggh!!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn that meantime, that look on your face is a shocked jawdrop as soon as your sleeping bedmate suddenly wrapped around you and squeezed the life out of you! Good news is that it finally snapped you out of your lust-filled state and realize what incredible danger you just put yourself in! You also get to realize it was now near impossible to escape her grip because it was incredibly tight\u2026 your back's probably gonna be sore in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanna know what the bad news is?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bad news is..</span></div></div>",

You went toward the door and the metal door had sign that wrote: 'Danger! keep out!' You were skeptic on what this note wrote and tried to open the door, but it was locked. You then heard some moaning noise from the inside. You leaned your ears against the door and heard the voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 'Haa..alex sama is so cool and sexy..I wish I could just mount on him!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You shivered little as it was coming from reisen. You didn't want to hear anymore,but this was for the sake of the deranged bunny-girl so you continued to listen to what she have to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n -inside room-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Reisen changed her outfit to pajama and locked her arm up against the wall. She was ready on something and thought about you, then blushed. She shook her head to get rid of such thoughts and was about to leave until she saw something from the door. It was a white haired women in good cloth and had dark brown eyes. Reisen didnt' know who this women were until she disappeared and reappeared infront of her. Reisen were shocked to see her coming in without making noise, then she spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Huh..so this is the one I controlled.\" women said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Wha-what are you talking about?\" Reisen questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The women looked at her and smiled.

The full moon were still up, and reisen screamed out making the women back off. She snickered and turned back to the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yes. Suffer, little child while I hunt the rest of the pathetic rats that hid in this world.\" Women said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She then went into the wall and disappeared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n -outside-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You didn't know what was going on as only thing you heared was reisens scream. You slammed your hand on the d oor, yelling her name until you heard a snapping noise from the inside and making a hole on the door. You backed off and saw the door open up to see the amazonian bunny coming out of the room. It was reisen, and she was in her cursed mode. You fell on your butt and scuffed back little while she was looking at you with heavy breathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"No..Reisen, are you reisen?\" You spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She growled and attacked you until..</span></div></div>",

Sooner or later youre gonna catch insomnia if you dont finally find a suitable home to lay down for good, but as long as youre sticking around your sister, it aint happening.<br>\r\nSince you cant sleep and probably wont sleep for a while, you might as well make the most of your new temporary resting place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMight as well take a walk around and clear your head. If youre gonna be stuck here until one of the occupants becomes the next victim of Maeve, you might as well get accustomed to the surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hallway itself was pretty long and boring save for the corner turns across the mansion. Majority of the rooms were locked tight as if they were expecting loads of guests that aint arrived yet. Plenty of old european framed artwork mounted on the wall of who you assume were previous generations of the Scarlet nobility. Sadly, none of them depicted a certain black haired mustached man in red infamous for his efforts in warding off invaders... specifically via impalements. A TRUE vampire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou passed by the library, which the room itself looked even bigger than the actual library where you used to live. Thousands upon thousands of books stalked neatly on floors upon floors of shelves possibly in some sort of specific order which no doubt may have taken years to perfect. You saw the leading librarian, the purple haired girl in the purple sleeping gown and matching sleeping hat sitting in her chair reading a book that looked to be in a language that probably no longer exists in this day and age. A ways away, you spot a red-haired girl with bat wings sprouting from her back and little bat wings sprouting from her head carefully sorting some books in a shelf.<br>\r\nA succubus. A perfect reason to lock your door and maybe push a dresser against it before you go to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext you pass by the kitchen and see that grey haired maid from earlier Sakuya washing dishes. One of her little lackies comes struggling by with a ton of dirty plates in her hand, stacked twice her height! She's wobbling and shaking from the weight of the stacked plates and you know what's about to happen next.<br>\r\n\"Wh...wha...wha...\" the little lackie trembling desperately trying to keep her balance but it was inevitable, \"uh...uhh... AHHHH!!\"<br>\r\nShe tripped and dropped the plates! You caught a quick glimpse of Sakura jerking her head to the lackie just before she hit the hit the floor and the plates went-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-...carefully stacked neatly on the floor without so much as a chip?! In a microsecond they went from about to spill all over the place to carefully stacked on the floor with no hassle!<br>\r\n\"Whew... thank you, Ms. Izayoi!\" the lackie thanked Sakuya for some reason.<br>\r\n\"Just be careful next time,\" Sakuya said as she picked up a handful of the plates and added them to the sink, \"dont rush and pick up more than you can handle.\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, Ms. Izayoi!\" and the lackie marched off to gather more dirty dishes. As soon as you spotted the fairy wings on her back, your stomach cringed.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou pass by the dining room to see numerous maids preparing several tables that look to be expecting several guests for dinner.<br>\r\nThe maids were all fairies. You could tell just by the looking at the wings. Everyone of them had wings. Every single maid a fairy. Fairies setting dishes, fairies polishing silverware, fairies cleaning windows and vaccuming the carpet. Here a fairy. There a fairy. Everywhere a fucking fairy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConsidering your experience with fairies, it understandably made your blood boil to see so many of them in one room. And Anna thought THIS place was a safer place than that hospital?! ANY of them could be working for Le Fey! ANY of them could have ties with Le Fey! ANY of them could know somebody who knows somebody in Le Fey!<br>\r\n'No!' you think to yourself, 'I know my sister better than this! I gotta trust her. She knows what she's doing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I get you anything, sir?\" said a posh voice from behind. You quickly turned around and had to look downward to see the short, green skinned bald pointy earred impish fellow in a butler outfit. A hobgoblin. ANOTHER kind of fairy.<br>\r\n\"N-no thanks,\" you started to back away as you felt queasy, \"I'm fine. Thank you.\" And you continued your trek down the wall. This place was gonna take some major getting used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Scarlet Mansion Hallway Express came to a complete halt thanks to a boulder blocking your way. A boulder in the shape of a red haired woman in a green chinese dress that you remember seeing help Arnold kick out an intruder when you first got here! Fancy seeing her again, but she was in your way the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScratch that. She wasnt just in your way. She was intentionally blocking your path. Judging by the smile on her face, she wanted to chat. Oh what the heck, you got nothing better to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ni hao!\" she shouted with glee. You stared at her slightly confused.<br>\r\n\"Uh, that means hi,\" she stated. Now you just feel silly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Well, hi,\" you greeted her back in english.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you must be the little brother of the mistress's associate, right?\" the girl was observant.<br>\r\n\"T-that's right,\" you answer her, \"Alex Whitestone.\"<br>\r\n\"Pleasire to meet you, Al! I am the head guard of the gate of Scarlet Mansion, Hong Meiling!\" she proudly introduced herself, \"I make sure no uninvited trespassers get in... and no unpermitted guests or food get out.\" That kinda made you wanna shiver, but seeing as though youre in a mansion full of monsters (especially FAIRIES), you do your best to show no fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you, Ms. Hong,\" you offered a handshake, she happily took your hand... and sniffed it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm,\" you heard a light moan behind that smile of hers, \"you smell good. A nice... man's smell.\" Awkward, but you already had a share of awkward with that crazy bunny girl!<br>\r\n\"Oh, um,\" you took a deep breath, \"I uh, put on a little Old Spice earlier. It doesnt last long though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to thank your sister,\" Meiling suddenly changed the subject, \"thanks to her hired help, I finally got a bit more free time.\" She was referring to Arnold.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Arnold's a real tank,\" you stuck on the subject, \"I'm sure Scarlet Mansion's in no safer hands than his... UH, NO OFFENSE! That is, I'm not saying youre bad at what you do, ER! I mean, I'm sure youre great what you do!\" Meiling leaned in closer, the smile still remaining on her face. \"It's just um... he'll make a great partner!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" Meiling sighed, edging even closer to you, \"you have no idea how long it's been since I had a nice long break.\" She was getting so close, one of her front braids was rubbing against your cheek!<br>\r\n\"That's... great to hear!\" you instinctively stepped back, \"er, what do you typically do on breaks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, mostly naps,\" she kept edging closer, \"sometimes meditate and do some martial arts training. Do you know any martial arts?\"<br>\r\nYou backed into a wall, \"N-No, not really. \"<br>\r\n\"That's too bad,\" she stalked toward you, \"around here, self-defense is a requirement for staying alive. I myself know Kung-Fu, Karate, Tai Kwan Do, a little Jeet Kune Do, that's Bruce Lee's style in case you were wondering... and also Karma Sutra.\" Karma Sutra?!<br>\r\n\"That's... not a martial art.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, I beg to differ! It's an intense stimulating exercise that demands hefty concentration as well as a strong body and plenty of stamina!\" Damn boner! Stay down or she'll notice!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's amazing,\" time to end this discussion ASAP, \"well, I better start heading back to my room. It was nice meeting you, Meili-\" Aw crap, she grabbed your arm! Dear god, here we go!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait,\" Meiling gave you no choice in the matter! \"since you got a bit of free time too, how's about we take a walk in the backyard? We'll have plenty of things to do there!\"<br>\r\n\"Uh... I... well... I dont wanna make anybody worry that I'm not in my room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wont take long!\" she said with a wink, \"qiiiiiiing?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Chinese lady seemed pretty adamant and didnt wanna take no for an answer. As much as you didnt wanna take 'Qing' for a reply, you were feeling a bit lonely since you left Eientei. Since your sis and most of the her friends seem a bit busy and you didnt trust any of the fairy helpers as far as you could blow their brains out... you figure why not? If the freaking head body guard of the mansion wants to get to know you, you'd be a damn fool to turn down companionship... and potential protection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug your shoulders, \"Um, ok. You talked me into it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Xie xie!\" she gleefully said with a grateful bow before she grabbed your arm again and dragged you off with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo seriously, she DRAGGED you off! That wasnt a figure of speech. Your shoes were scrapping the carpet before you could move your feet fast enough to keep up with her!<br>\r\n\"Make sure you stick with me at all times,\" Meiling suggests, despite not giving you a choice in the matter, \"many of the em... 'Caretakers' arent friendly to strangers.\"<br>\r\n\"I'll be careful. Thank you.\" You pay no attention to the fairy maids staring your way as youre dragged down the hall. You also dont pay attention to the Hobgoblin butler shaking his head disapprovingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, Meiling let go of your arm the moment the two of you went through the door leading to the backyard. And what a backyard it was. It may as well have been an entire town behind the mansion what with how enormous and populated it was.<br>\r\n\"Keep close,\" she ordered, \"I, Hong Meiling, Scarlet Mansion's finest beloved Guardian of the Gate shall be your tour guide.\" You do as your told as she showed you around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here is Her Lady's prized flower garden,\" Meiling pointed over to the tremendous field of flower beds of dang near every breed, \"we nearly every single exotic flower species in all the world. Imported directly from almost every single corner of the earth, nurtured and cared for to ensure they feel like their still in their native habitat. Stay away from the sunflowers, though. They um, werent necessarily taken LEGALLY from the Garden of the Sun. And dont touch the Venus flytraps. Contrary to the name, it's not just flies they like to trap.\"<br>\r\nYou can tell what with a few gardeners trying to pry out one of them comrades from the jaws of a giant flytrap!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Over here is the hedgemaze,\" Meiling brings you over to the hedge-PYRAMID, \"it's still unfinished, but it's packed with several twists, turns, and traps, and many MANY surprises for those who wander too long or take one too many wrong turns. I've kinda got a little frustrated navigating through it one day, so I made a shortcut!\" Meiling points over to the big trimmed hole going right through most of the pyramid as the trimming crew look back at her with angry glares... even the minotaur who appeared to be mumbling Greek curses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here is our glorious pool\", Meiling takes you to the largest pool built right under a water theme park complete with slides, tubes, boat rides, etc. \"the perfect place to relax and cool down on a hot frustrating day. On your day off, of course!\" Well, YOU certainly know where youre going on your day off!<br>\r\n\"!!!\" suddenly, something grabbed your leg, causing you to lose your balance and began pulling you toward the pool!<br>\r\n*STOMP!!*<br>\r\n\"EEEKK!\" That is until Meiling stopped the arm grabbing you and let you go! She then shouted angrily in Chinese at the group of sad pouty-faced Mermaids with one rubbing her aching arm before they dived off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, duibuqi...\" Meiling bowed apologetically, \"some of the aquatic life here can be pretty unpredictable.\" Whelp, so much for your day off plan!! ...Unless of course, one of those 'unpredictable aquatic life' members happen to include a certain purple haired mentally ill bunny girl!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyways, after that encounter, the rest of the tour is pretty mild. Sure there was a large farm with plenty of livestock, a private horse ranch with several rare breed mares and stallions, a statue one of the Scarlet sisters' ancestors made entirely in 24 karat gold, a concert with several bands practicing, but you were quickly tuning them all out. Maybe it was cuz your mind was wandering so much. What with so much going on in such short time, it was hard to maintain focus and concentrate cuz your brain was going a mile a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was ONE thing you had no problem keeping your focus on, however. While Meiling was talking, you were following behind her, eyeing her firm toned backside as her hips swayed in such an invigorating motion, encouraging those watching behind her to keep up! And sure enough, you channeled what energy you had in your body to assure you were following the movement of her hips swaying to a tee! She could march right off a cliff and you'd gladly follow her charismatic swaying bottom all the way down to THE bottom!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...And over here is the fine firm glorious ass of Hong Meiling! It's irresistible back and forth rhythm has been known to lead many mesmerized men to their unfortunate ends!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snapped out of your brief trance, the moment you realized Meiling notice you were checking out her ass!<br>\r\nYour face goes red and you turn away, cursing yourself for what you done!<br>\r\n\u201cI-I-I'm so sorry, Ms. Hong!\u201d you quickly apologize with a reddened face, \u201cthat was\u2026 incredibly inappropriate! I wont do that again, I swear!\u201d<br>\r\nFortunately, she laughed at your perverted idiocy. \u201cHahaha! Wu so wei, Alex! I'm glad to see you appreciate my figure!\u201d she winked, \u201cbut please try to keep your primal urges in check during work hours!\u201d It was incredibly ironic to hear a youkai of all things tell you this. But still, you gotta stay professional. You are in no need of a sexual harassment seminar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo with a blush and a scratch of the back of your head, you put yourself back on track.<br>\r\n\u201cHeh\u2026 so, what's next on this tour of the backyard?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cActually\u2026 that's about it,\u201d Meiling admitted, \u201cthere are a few other sites to see, but I'm kinda banned from going to them.\u201d She frowns, \u201cLong story short, sometimes I dont my own strength. I guess I'm too strong for my own good...\u201d Yeah, guess that's what to expect from someone who's an expert in kung fu, karate, Tai Kwan Do, Tai Chi, Chai Tea, and a whole other bunch of martial arts Meiling's got a black belt in. ...Color you interested if Kama Sutra's one of 'em!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that concludes our tour!\u201d the red-headed Chinese woman announces, \u201c*Yawn* That took a lot out of us.\u201d Meiling speaks for you as she feigns being tired. \u201cWhy dont we take a break?\u201d and without even getting your input, she grabs your arm, \u201cI know of a nice secluded place not far from here where we can meditate if your interested.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cUh, I-\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOr if you like, we can get a drink or two! The bar should be open by now! Wanna get pissed?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot like she's giving you any other choice at this point. Besides, you feel like spending some more time with her, so you figure you might as well play along.<br>\r\nAfter a bit of thinking and hard pretending that the overly intrigued stare she was giving you doesnt weird you out, you decide to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You'd think that only organizing the comic book shelf of the mansion's grand library would be an incredibly easy task. And you'd be wrong. Mainly because as youre organizing, you have the librarian yourself breathing down your neck the entire time and being incredibly obsessive compulsive to how the comics are properly organized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while Patchouli was hounding you on what comic to put where, she had you organize certain comics by alphabetical order with each issue by issue date, then OTHER certain comics by author name alphabetically THEN separating them from other comics with specific separators (some she wanted arranged by shape, others she wanted arranged by color)... and then when you got to her MANGA collection... it was a librarian bootcamp.<br>\r\nShe wanted her manga books sorted specifically in her own personal name order that wouldnt make sense to anyone BUT her (in issue order, naturally), then you had to separate CERTAIN manga books a particular distance from other manga books and putting the appropriate paperweights between certain manga books cuz of a long lengthy explanation that you still cant wrap your head around. She also wanted you to wipe the dust and dirt off some of her old manga books (note: SOME, not all. For another nonsensical reason, she thought some of the dirty manga books were lucky and didnt want them clean!) and hell, when you were moving a particular series of manga books, she wanted you to address her as 'Patchouli onee-sama' while you were doing it! (again. Nonsensical). Oh, and she also made you promise not to tell anybody about the collection that depicted beautiful men in er... 'romantic' scenes with eachother (which WAS sensical... until she made you promise while still addressing her as 'Patchouli onee-sama'!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuffice to say, you really wished you were organizing the REST of the entire library with your sister and dealing with Patchouli's calmer less OCD bat-winged assistant.Sure, letting a succubus get that close to you may be dangerous to you, but dangerous to HER as well, cuz she can guess what Anna'll do to hear if she tries something!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an extremely long time of putting up with this and missing the brief time you spent with the Chinese gate guard,  you finished the organizing the stupid comic shelf. And of course, Patchouli carefully inspected and observed every single detail. <br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" she leaned in close to inspect each uneven gap or speck of dust, \"Ok. This is workable. Could be better, but certainly not bad for your first day.\"<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Ms. Kn-\" Patchouli jerked her head to you and raised a finger, \"er... I mean Patchouli onee-sama!\" It made her swell up with glee hearing you call her that.<br>\r\nAfter quickly regaining her serious composure, she turns her attention to her assistant, \"How's the rest looking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just finished organizing everything else,\" Koakuma states.<br>\r\n\"Good,\" Patchouli doesnt even bother inspecting Anna's work, \"since we've finished early, you may take a break, Mr. Whitestone. Ms. Whitestone, may I have a word with you in private?\"<br>\r\nAnna sighed, \"Sure. Alex, try not to wander to far off.\"<br>\r\n\"I wont.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a short amount of time, you wandered off pretty far. To be fair, the mansion was huge and filled with loads and loads of rooms and hallways, so getting lost was inevitable.<br>\r\nIt could be magic that's making the mansion difficult to navigate. That would explain why you've ran walked passed the same imp anxiously shivering with impatience outside the bathroom door several times going down the same non-bending hallway!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately you did pass by a room that you overheard your sister and Patchouli arguing in. Unfortunately, that argument involved you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the last time NO! Not happening!\" you hear your sis state.<br>\r\n\"C'mon, this is a perfect opportunity,\" Patchouli argued, \"it would be the discovery of brand new species if your brother successfully manages to inseminate one of them!\"<br>\r\n\"I'm not letting you use MY brother for a perverted science experiment!\"<br>\r\n\"Like I said, it's nothing dangerous! I've looked them all up and I made sure he wouldnt risk losing<br>\r\n any limbs or being eaten afterwards!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYoure gonna be losing plenty of limbs if you even THINK of trying that little scheme with Alex!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOk! Then what about just Wriggle then?! Wriggle happens to be a very safe, very friendly, and VERY estrogenic female. Your brother has nothing to worry about-\"<br>\r\n\"I wont warn you again. Get off this subject. NOW.\"<br>\r\n\"Urgghhh, fine fine! ....Can I at least bring him to the upcoming Animecon? I've got this really nice suit that's just his size!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me, Mr. Whitestone. Shouldnt you be working?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAGAIN, your heart nearly jumps out of its ribcage cuz the head maid literally appears out of nowhere and surprises the bejeezus outta you!<br>\r\nOops! No time to catch your breath. You just got busted eavesdropping AND slacking off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! S-Sakuya!\u201d you regain your composure, \u201cYes, I already finished organizing books in the library. Patchouli on-ugh\u2026 I mean Ms. Knowledge told me to take a break.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that's very generous of her, but that I'm afraid she's in no position to give anyone breaks,\u201d Sakuya told you, \u201ceveryone has a designated break time on their individual schedule and yours wont be showing up for a while.\u201d Drag. \u201cIn the meantime, you must ALWAYS keep yourself busy while on the clock. ALWAYS.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed and kept your cool. Youre seeking asylum here so you best cope and make yourself useful to remain here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, well\u2026 what else can you have me do?\u201d you ask her, \u201cI'm available.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cScarlet Mansion always has chores available to keep everyone busy,\u201d she remarks, \u201cfor example, we could use a little more help in the kitchen. Some of the maids have a bad habit of overestimating their strength and balance and they could use an extra set of hands to help carry the load and avoid breaking more outrageously expensive fine china!\u201d Youre reminded of that moment a maid nearly spilled a ton of plates on the floor and nearly breaking every single one had Sakuya not intervened and\u2026 whatever she did.<br>\r\nYoure ALSO reminded that maid was a fairy\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnother choir we have available is tending to the garden in the backyard. I'm sure your associate Arnold would appreciate if you helped him water the Mistress's flower garden and feed the pets in the pool.\u201d<br>\r\nYou quickly have a flashback of that huge venus flytrap and those grab-happy mermaids! But at least you'd have Arnold to protect you in case something bad happens!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlso...\u201d you heard Sakuya let out a slightly annoyed grunt, \u201c...since you got along so well with our gate guard earlier, perhaps you could lend her a hand watching the gate? ...Or at the very least keep her from falling asleep on the job again.\u201d Assisting Meiling, huh? Sounds like an opportunity! ...It also reminds you of what happened the LAST time a girl got too clingy with you\u2026 and already you start to miss good ol' Eientei and that wascally wabbit\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking all those thoughts of, you had to keep yourself focused. And with the options Sakuya made available for you, you make your decision:</span></div></div>",

Once you went back to your room, you noticed that the bed sheets and the cover were cleaned up. You smiled lightly and went to the bed and lied down to get some rest. You looked at the ceiling, wondering about the future in this area. Sure, you thought that Anna was doing this for your safety but you wondered if she was doing this with caution as Le Fay gang is fairy type by majority, and this mansion is just riddled with fairies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I hope Anna knows what she's doing.\" You mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You then felt more tired and closed your eyes to get some sleep. You slept until you felt someone shaking your body. You opened your eyes, seeing your own big sister wearing a butler suite on. The suite were almost the same as Walter Dornez from the Hellsing manga except that she was: 1.She was a women and 2.She was younger then Walter. You got up slowly as Anna stood, you also noticed remilias younger sister was standing next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"It's time for dinner brother.\" Anna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Alright.\" You replied, \"What's on the menu?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Salisbury Steak and home made mash potato.\" Anna answered, \"There is pudding for dessert.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You nodded and got up to go with anna for the dinner. You were surprised that you slept through the day and you felt little awkward to see your own big sis wearing an butler suite. She had the towel on her right arm, walking normally then you quickly saw her magnum on her pocket. You sighed that you knew she would carry a weapon, no matter where she was at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Say sis, why are you wearing an butler suite?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Lady Scarlets order.\" Anna answered, \"She was thinking about letting you put on as well, but I told her you suite more in the casual cloth then formal one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Gee, thanks.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You then saw Flandre stopping both you and Anna. You didn't know what she wanted until she rose her both hand at Anna. Both you knew what she wanted and Anna lifted her up and placed her on her shoulders to carry her on top. Flandre liked this and they continued to walk toward the dining room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Say, onee-sama.\" Flandre spoke, \"Would you and your otouto-sama would live here forever?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n You were very shocked to hear that and Anna just giggled.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"Right now, no Imouto-sama.\" Anna replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Aww, but I like you, and Your otouto-sama looks pretty decsent.\" Flandre replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You were sweating as her words on 'descent'. After moment, they got to the dining room and opened the door. You noticed the chairs were almost full as Anna took flandre to her seat, there were only two open seats left: one that was next to sakuya, or the seat next to patchoulie herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You wondered for minute and decided to take seat next to..</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Because it was the seat that looked the closest to where Anna was sitting (even though it was still pretty far in itself), you decided to take the open seat next to the head maid. It was probably the best decision, considering she's the one in charge of all the maids here... FAIRY maids. You'll get no safer than the one the fairies of this mansion answer to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a deep breath and head to that seat showing as little fear on your face as possible. Fairies could smell that, you know. The more feral ones, anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, is this seat taken?\" you remember to politely ask Sakuya before jumping the gun and making yourself look rude.<br>\r\nShe shook her head, \"you may sit down.\" And sit down you did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nihao!!\" and that's when you noticed a wee too late that your seat was on the opposite side of that friendly gate guard from earlier!<br>\r\nYou swallowed, \"Hi Meiling.\"<br>\r\n\"Ah so you two have already met?\" the head maid was clearly observant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I was taking a little walk down the hallway earlier and I bumped into her.\"<br>\r\n\"Down the hallway?\" that arouse suspicion from Sakuya, \"Meiling, werent you supposed to be guarding the gate?\"<br>\r\n\"M-Ms. Whitestone said it was ok to let her bodguard Arnold take over!\" Meiling said, \"I mean I was really hesitant and wanted to tell them no, but... well, theyre our guests! Youre not suppose to say no to guests!\" Something told you this girl was used to getting yelled at. You might wanna keep an eye on her. Not too much of an eye though or she might think youre coming on to her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... he did finally manage to evict that book thief,\" Sakuya commented.<br>\r\n\"He's definitely the guy you can trust with your life,\" you say, \"he wouldnt still be hanging around Anna if he wasnt.\" Ms. Hong resumed smiling at you. \"He aint much of a talker though, so dont expect to get many long-winded conversations out of him-!\" You flinched as soon as you felt Ms. Hong stroke your hand on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, then that narrows down the chores he'll be doing in this mansion,\" the head maid scuffed, \"I certainly hope youre just as hardworking, because you will put to work while youre staying here.\" You understand. Gotta earn your place for refuge and such. No freeloading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, \"Absolutely. I'm very hardworking. You name it and I'll do it to the best of my Ah-\" suddenly you felt something stroke your shin, \"-abilities!\"<br>\r\n\"Good,\" the head maid didnt seem to notice your sudden flinch, \"I was thinking having you be a greeter for when we have guests. Most of our guests that come here are female nobility and I'm certain they'd appreciate receiving proper greetings from a young nice looking male servant rather than the um... lesser physically flattering goblin butlers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can do that,\" you say with no hesitation, \"I've done a bit of butlering back at my old job. Uh... I'm not gonna get a lot of cigarette burns, am I?\"<br>\r\n\"Certainly not!\"<br>\r\n\"Ok, great! Ss!\" you flinched again. Somebody's bare foot was rubbing up against yours!<br>\r\n\"Although I would strongly recommend that you dont reveal yourself to be a human too much,\" Sakuya said while you felt a foot rubbing up and down your leg! Worst time in the world to wear shorts, \"many of the youkai matriarchs are not very fond of humans. Please dont take offense if a few say seemingly racial remarks about your species.\" That foot is getting a bit too close to your knee! Meiling was merely leaning her head in her palm while she smiled your way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-T-that doesnt bother me,\" you pretend to keep your cool while your leg was getting a bit of a rub down, \"I'm uhh... used to dealing with those ahh... types! U-usually a simple sshhhh...shoulder rub cools them down-*GASP!*\" You almost jump out of your seat! That crafty foot rubbed up against your inner thigh! The smiling gate guard's cheeks went a bit bright pink!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I dont recommend physical contact,\" Sakuya says, completely blind to your squirming due to a foot going for your crotch region, \"many take that as offense. Just keep a distance when youre talking to a guest until it's clear she trusts your company enough.\"<br>\r\n\"Okeeeh.... Ok....\" you panted. Great, now she's using BOTH her feet! Both going to work on your inner thighs! Meiling started to pant a little herself, obviously what she wanted was well within her reach! Man, you never met a girl with talented legs like hers!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But first we'll probably have you help some of the maids with the laundry too,\" the head maid suggests, \"and dont worry. None of them have sworn allegiance to anyone but the mistress.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm... soooooo...\" you moaned, savoring how good Meiling's toes felt against your sweet spots, \"....glad to hear that!\" Since she wasnt keen on stopping any time soon, you might as well exact a little revenge on the crafty gate guard. While her feet were at work, she left herself vulnerable. After slipping your shoe and somehow your sock off too (suspension of disbelief, please. Suspension of disbelief), your own foot and wriggly toes took a lunge between Meiling's legs!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAHH!!\" unlike yourself, Ms. Hong let out a loud gasp that everybody around you at the table noticed! They all stared her direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er....s-sorry,\" Meiling scratched the back of her head, pretending to look clumsy, \"...just a toe cramp!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat brief moment of humiliation ended that little footsie play gone wrong. You tried to keep cool, pretending that you just didnt get fondled by feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, dinner seems to be taking a little longer than expected,\u201d Sakuya notes, \u201cI better go check on the kitchen staff.\u201d With that, she gets out of her seat but only gets a couple of steps before she stops and offers, \u201cIf you'd like, I can introduce you to the staff right now and help you get acquainted with some of your new fellow associates\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would be a wise idea to get to know them and get used to them ASAP since you'll probably be spending a lot of time with them while you and Anna are on the run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut just when you were about to take Sakuya up on that offer, you felt a cool pleasant and quite alluring breeze blow gently into your ear. You couldnt help but shiver with delight before you realized it was that darn gate guard again trying to get a bit clingy.<br>\r\nAnd because you clearly didnt learn your lesson when you were in Eientei, that move made you immediately reconsider being introduced to the kitchen crew and instead spending a bit more time, preferably alone, with Meiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly shook yourself out of it before answering...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Within the few seconds of pondering, your mind pondered for hours the decision. You still have a bit of a phobia for fairies and this chinese woman in front of you doesnt look or smell anything Fey (although you did detect a slight reptilic odor about her) and she seems awful friendly emphasis on 'FRIENDLY' (and 'AWFUL'!). Plus, you've been given an opportunity to make a really close friend on just your first day of being here. Might as well not blow it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's alright,\" you say to Sakuya, welcoming Meiling's stare of interest, \"maybe later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" the maid caved, \"dinner wont be long. Meiling, try not to embarrass us in front of our guests again, ok?\"<br>\r\nMeiling tsked and muttered something in Chinese under her breath.<br>\r\n\"What was that?\"<br>\r\n\"I said yes, Sakuya!\" Meiling quicly changed her story, \"absolutely, Sakuya!\" But as soon as the head maid left the scene, she gave a long hard impatient sigh. Guess that took way too long for her to finally have some alone-time with her new boy-toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe awkward silence between the two of you amplified the room. It was getting awful uncomfortable just watching her stare back at you in silence. Well, you got your alone time. Quick! Say something to break the silence! C'mon! Something! Anything!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...Wow, you speak real good english for a Chinese girl! Most of those I worked with spoke in broken sentences and mispronounce syllables!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYOU. FUCKING. IDIOT.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKST!! PHWWAAAHAHAHAHAA!!\u201d super lucky for you, judging by how Meiling hammered on the table and broke into a fit of laughter, she's got a sense of humor, \u201chahaha! Wow, so Ms. Whitestone's little brother has a spontaneous side as well? Youqu, da.\u201d<br>\r\nYour face went red with embarrassment, realizing far too late how stupid you just sounded. \u201cHeh. Sorry. I get a little carried away sometimes. But your english is really good.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell, to be honest, I spent a tremendously long time learning it,\u201d Ms. Hong admitted, \u201cI was a pretty slow learner when it came to learning a new language. Fortunately, dragon youkai live a very VERY long time!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDragon?\u201d your eyes widened a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne of the strongest, fiercest, most powerful and most feared breed of beasts in all of Gensokyo,\u201d she said with pride, \u201cstories and fairy tales about us are the most popular worldwide.\u201d Personally, you prefer the ones about killer robots, but to each his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Scarlet Mansion must be impregnable with a dragon guarding it!\u201d Why the heck did Meiling frown uncomfortably a second there?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*Ahem!* Anyway, it's nice that the mistress finally hired some male help around the mansion,\u201d she commented, \u201cusually the workers we get here are strictly girls. She's probably worried there might be xing'ai or xingbing going on, but I dont believe that's a bad thing. Personally, I think shared genetic traits from the offspring would make for some fine future helpers!\u201d Whoa. And you thought what YOU just previously said was no holds barred. But you do notice nearly every other single person in this place is a girl (most of them FAIRIES!). You might be feeling a bit lonesome, but then again, you dont remember anyone else in Eientei being a boy either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlus, you do notice the hobgoblins are BUTLERS, not MAIDS (unless it's cuz theyre too darn ugly).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, but I thought those goblin butlers were guys,\u201d you interject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTheyre exceptions,\u201d she sighed depressingly, \u201ctheyre all eunuchs.\u201d Your nerves immediately shot up by instinct! For good reasons, you became terrified out of your gourd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA-A-Are they gonna make me a eunuch too?!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOf course not!\u201d Meiling smiled, \u201cAnna threatened to have this mansion nuked if they did.\u201d Whew. God you love sis! \u201cOf course if word gets out that you still have your xingqiguan in tact, things may get awkward.\u201d<br>\r\nPerhaps you were a tad too quick on the relief, \u201cAwkward?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I'm not saying ALL these workers are segui,\u201d she stated although you have no clue what 'segui' is, \u201cmany are very reserved and strong willed against such urges. The librarian's assistant, however, is not one of them.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cLibrarian's assistant?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cKoakuma,\u201d she said, \u201ca succubus.\u201d You had almost forgotten seeing a succubus down at the library arranging books. That could probably lead to a serious situation for you unless she's full-on lesbo. And knowing the nature of a succubus, awkward situations would be the LAST thing you need to worry about!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDont worry,\u201d Meiling assures you, \u201cshe wont hurt you,\u201d she smirked and leaned closer to you, \u201cprovided you've got the scent of someone much stronger on you.\u201d You raised your eyebrow, trying your damndest not to look interested. You knew exactly what she meant by that. Not even Reisen could lay it down any thicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour tea, sir,\u201d and then out of nowhere, one of the very few male hobgoblin eunuchs magically appear and  placed a cup of tea on your side of the table. Fortunately, it's green tea. You like green tea. It relieves stress.<br>\r\n\u201cThank you,\u201d you gratefully accepted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour uh\u2026 'Baiju', ma'am,\u201d but instead of being a proper stereotype and getting green tea as well, Meiling was given a little green bottle in Chinese with a picture of a temple on it.<br>\r\n\u201cXie xie!\u201d she thanked the eunuch butler with a smile. You tilted your head curious of that drink she's got, but as she popped open the bottle, JESUS did that strong stench of ammonia and alcohol pierce through your nostrils like a fowl-smelling bullet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2026 you actually DRINK that?\u201d you said with your eyes watering.<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes,\u201d she answered with zero guilt, \u201cBaiju is the best kind of alcohol you'll find the world over. Sure it's not quite as strong as Oni brew, but it's guaranteed to grow scales on your chest, provided youre dragon enough to handle it. Do you drink, Whitestone?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNot very,\u201d you answered, \u201cat the most just a little rum or Jack Daniels on special occassions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTsk, those kiddie drinks are for weaklings!\u201d Meiling boasted, \u201cyou want a REAL youkai's drink, Baiju is the way to go! Take a sip! It'll get you pissed!\u201d You wish you knew the proper Chinese equivalent to 'ARE YOU SERIOUS?!'<br>\r\nThat crap she was about to drink was still burning your nostrils and she wants you to put that in your stomach?! She's out of her mind if she thinks you'll be dumb enough to swallow that crap!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhhh\u2026 no thanks,\u201d you reject the offer a lot more politely than deserved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh c'mon!\u201d Meiling insisted as she poured some of that Baiju into a little shot glass, \u201cDont be a wimp. One sip will really bring out the dragon in you!\u201d Childish egging doesnt work in this situation.<br>\r\n\u201cNo, that's alright. I'm good,\u201d you assured her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the gatekeeper raised her eyebrow. Not a good sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you take a sip...\u201d she whispered, \u201cI'll protect you from Koakuma.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room went completely silent. Well actually it was still pretty noisy with all the endless chatter, but the tiny space between you and Meiling became dead silent! Reminding you of the succubus reminded you of what succubi are capable of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean dont get me wrong, our lady promised you protection,\u201d Ms Hong continued, \u201cbut things can happen. And I dont even remember the last time Koakuma ever got to feed on a tasty male, so you should probably learn to sleep with one eye open!\u201d You already do. But anyways, danged if she didnt make a little sense. What if that librarian's assistant tried something in your sleep like in those stories Jenny Greenteeth would tell you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, as I said,\u201d the gatekeeper smirked again just before pushing the shot glass full of Baiju toward you, \u201cyou might not have to worry about that\u2026 provided you had the scent of somebody bigger and stronger keeping her away, yeah?\u201d</span></div></div>",

But it wasnt the first time you had a run in with dangerous girls attracted to you and hopefully it wont be the last! (HOPEFULLY?!) Besides, she might be a dragon youkai and youre lacking knowledge of what those types are capable of, youre well aware of what a succubus can do and you'd rather not risk your soul taking such chances! Fairies may be sadistic, but they dont go for your SOUL as well! Ms. Hong was offering your free protection (free, your ass!) in exchange for showing how much of a man you are by taking a sip of her accursed booze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... promise you'll protect me from this Koakuma girl?\" you questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeiling smirked and winked at you, \"Oh yeah! I'm gonna protect you REAL good!\" She even licked her lips after saying that! She was not even TRYING to hide her ulterior motive! She'd probably go as far as to reach down her unbuttoned blouse and pull out a condom, but it's likely she wants to be knocked up. Regardless, the worst case scenario for sexing up a dragon is a few broken bones (hopefully). The worst case scenario for sexing up a succubus is LOSING YOUR SOUL!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" you took the shot glass of Baiju and gulped, \"just one sip.\" You took a deep breath before bringing the glass close to your face so you dont breathe in the insanely strong alcohol and ignoring the millions of voices in your head screaming not to, you took a sip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cringed the nanosecond the nasty burning alcohol touched your tongue! The taste was unimaginable, unlike any kind of beer or vodka you've ever tasted. The flavor was worse than nasty. It was painful to taste. The taste honestly hurt your tastebuds, burned the inside of your mouth, and just by twitching, you felt the taste waft through your nostrils making it hard to breathe without burning!<br>\r\nYou swallowed it fast, hoping you could get rid of that horrific flavor ASAP, but you feared what the putrid alcohol would do to your stomach. You coughed, desperately trying to get the flavor out of your lungs before you suffocate in it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you suffered, Meiling giggled and clapped her hands, impressed by the size of your balls (which sadly were smaller than your brain at the moment!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zu\u00f2de h\u01ceo!\" she gave you a thumbs up, \"feels good, huh? Dont feel truly awoken?!\"<br>\r\n\"Definitely woke me the hell up,\" you gagged as you washed it down with your green tea, \"is this stuff gonna do anything to me?\"<br>\r\nMeiling smiled and nodded, \"It's not merciful to newbies. If vodka makes you tipsy, this stuff will FAWK you up!\" She added heavy accented emphasis on 'fuck'!<br>\r\n\"It's gonna FUuuuuUuuu....\" holy crap, youre starting to feel the side effects! Suddenly you feel dizzy. Incredibly dizzy! The whole mansion was shaking around, yet nobody but you was feeling it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH Gaudd!!\" your eyes were having a hard time focusing, \"wuts goin ahn?!\" You were slurring like crazy. It was already hard to speak.<br>\r\n\"Youre getting fawked up,\" Meiling smiled. It was impossible for your eyes to keep focus on anything but Meiling's smiling face.<br>\r\n\"Jeezzez...  wah dah hell's een dis stuhp?\" man did you slur! You dont ever recall getting yourself THIS drunk before. Sure, there were times when you binged, but never to the point that you were feeling THIS tipsy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiles and miles and miles away from your table, you could barely make out the blurry figure of Ms. Scarlet giving an announcement to everyone in the dining hall. Despite the loud ringing echo in her voice, you couldnt make out a word she was saying. You assumed that other blurred figure beside her was your sister. But you couldnt understand a single syllable of the entire announcement. Even if you could, you wouldnt be listening, cuz you were too busy trying to keep balanced in your seat what with you being so dizzy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, Meiling held your hands so you wouldnt trip and fall over. She also caressed them, but you werent noticing it at the moment. The world was spinning at a tremendous speed and your body couldnt keep up with it. Your eyes were getting heavy. You were getting nauseous, but you didnt have anything in your stomach to throw up. The damn gate guard didnt just get you pissed. She pretty much drugged you with that hellish booze of hers! And this was your first day here at this mansion! YOUR FIRST DAY! Youre not sure you can handle this! You were probably infinitely safer back at that hospital. God help you if Maeve finds a way to possess Meiling too...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the world finally finished shaking you down, your head collapsed on the table and you went out like a light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GASP! Mr. Whitestone! What happened to Mr. Whi... Meiling, did you feed him that stupid drink of yours?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aheheh... yeah. Sorry, Patchouli. Guess I got carried away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damnit Meiling! How many times do I have to tell you stop giving our guests Baiju?! You know no one else can tolerate that stuff!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww... but he was so cute trying!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quiet! Hurry up and move him to his room before his sister or the mistress notices!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can count on me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arrrgghhh...\" you slowly wake with your head pounding. Youre not sure how long you were out or if you were doing anything between now and hitting your head on the table.

Fine with you. That means it'll be a little more quiet... and a little less fairy-involved. Sitting next to Sakuya who's still coercing with the fairy maids means trouble for you should one of them have ties with Le Fey. The long walk was well worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you sat down next to Patchouli, still too deep in her book to notice you there. She had a stack full of books on the table, so it looked like she was gonna be busy for quite a while. <br>\r\nYou nearly jumped out of your skin when a fairy maid appeared out of nowhere and poured tea (or so it seemed) into your teacup.<br>\r\n\"Th...thank you,\" you muttered quietly, a bit too nervous to raise your voice high enough for anyone to hear. You dare not put that cup in your mouth unless you were absolutely sure it was safe to drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wait patiently as the maid pours the tea into Patchouli's cup and quickly moves on to the next person. You watched the purple haired bookworm carefully, waiting for her take her eyes off the book and sip her tea. It took a bit of time (apparently whatever she was reading was a darn good read), before she finally reached for her cup (her eyes still focused on the book) and gave it a sip.<br>\r\nShe seemed perfectly fine. She's not hacking up, her face aint changing color, she didnt so much as blink. Ok, maybe the tea isnt poisoned after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood thing. It wasnt bad tasting. Couldve used a little more honey, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk, now you feel that it's a little rude to not say hi after this long. Although she clearly looks like she's in no mood for a discussion, you felt obligated to at least say hi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello,\" you give a quick greeting.<br>\r\n\"Hi,\" she predictably gives a quick response without even turning her head. Unpredictably, her eyes widened and she did a double-take at you! \"Wait! ...Youre Ms. Whitestone's brother, arent you?\" Oh, interested in you, is she?<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" you answer, \"Alex Whitestone. And you must be Pachouli Knowledge, the-\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah yeah,\" she cut you off, apparently not interested in any introductions, \"listen. Youre a male, right?\" The hell kind of stupid question was that?<br>\r\n\"Uh... yes?\" you pretend not to be a little disturbed by that question. Apparently it was the right answer. Patchouli then for some reason skimmed flipped through her little book looking for a certain page until she finally found it and read it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you dont have a mate-I mean girlfriend, do you?\" awful subtle question.<br>\r\nDespite memories of that mentally ill but still darn lovable bunny girl, you answer, \"No I dont.\"<br>\r\n\"Great! Great!\" Patchouli slammed her book on the table, almost knocking over her teacup, \"listen, I'm wondering if you could do me a little favor tonight?\" She tapped her fingers on her book while she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of favor?\" you asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, I've got a...friend,\" she stalled on that word, \"I've been trying to hook her up with someone. A particular someone. You know... cuz she's been seeming lonely lately and I think it'd be a good idea to find her a decent guy. A lot of the males-er-guys I've seen around here... not her type.\"<br>\r\n\"Uh huh...\" you let her continue, although you sense something odd about this. You notice one of the books on the stack is about the human anatomy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her name is Wriggle. Yeah, I know, silly name,\" Patchouli says before you can even think, \"but Wriggle's a great friend. A really nice girl too. She wouldnt harm a fly, er, ahem. Anyways, she spends a lot of time helping out with her boss's garden and never spares any time for herself. I personally think she deserves a break from all of that, and I think the best kind of break would be a nice relaxing date with an equally eligible bachelor!\" Another book seems to be about mating rituals for fireflies. Odd. <br>\r\n\"And you'd like me to be her date for the night?\" you theorize... although you have a brand new twisted theory when you see another book on the stack gestation periods for insects.<br>\r\nShe nodded, \"And of course, I think you deserve a nice relaxing date too. I heard from your sister that you had a nasty fallout with one of the patients over at Eientei.\" Good lord, Anna told her?! ...And who exactly wrote the book 'Will They Procreate?: 101 Reported Successful/Failed Human-Youkai Crossbreeding'?! \"Well, dont worry. Wriggle's completely sane and incredibly sound mind. She's also very nice and fun to be around. She's incredibly cute, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn one hand, it didnt seem like a bad idea to go on a date, considering you were sorta feeling a little lonely (and youre only gonna get lonelier). On the other hand, those books Patchouli's reading dont seem to strike well with you. I mean, what's up with that book 'World's Most Famous Crossbreeds'?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there a particular catch to this?\" you couldnt help but ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! No no no no no! Of course not!\" you could tell she's lying, \"it's just a friend helping out a friend! Although I most certainly wouldnt mind it if you two were to hit it off... and well...\" her face got a little red, \"...you know...\" You finally noticed the cover of that book she's currently reading. It's the one you spotted in the unfamiliar language... the cover depicts what looks to be some 8th century Byzantine mosaic of what appears to be a human man and a four-armed woman with antennae in what looks to be the Splitting Bamboo position (dont ask how you know the name of it!). This girl was starting to be a little too disturbing for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, if you dont want to do it, I'm not gonna force you,\" Patchouli insists and urges, \"but I'm sure Wriggle would REALLY appreciate! And I'm sure after the uh... experience you had with the last girl, you'll REALLY appreciate Wriggle!\" This wouldnt really seem like such a big thing to ask if not for those disturbing books she's reading! You know she's got some sort of ulterior motive for hooking you up with her friend, but youre not sure you wanna know what that motive is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, do you dare choose to do so?</span></div></div>",

You did have some interest in having some real date since you were in the high school. The high school girls avoided you because they thought you were too geeky or something, and when you were in the mafia the ladies tried to get you but you refused them since they were part fairy. You sighed and turned to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Sure, I'll take it.\" You responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Splended. I will send one of the fairy to notify her on this.\" Patchoulie replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She then ordered one of the fairy to give message to this wriggle girl. The fairy bowed and went out of the mansion to look for her. You wondered who this wriggle girl, and you waited for this to happen. Patchoulie notified remilia and other members about what happened and they agreed to let her in for dinner. After few minutes, a fairy maid came back with a green haired girl with white shirt, black pants and a black cape on her. You were surprised to see this young looking girl as she came to patchoulie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Thanks for inviting me over for dinner, ms.knowlage.\" Girl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"No problem wriggle. You can't go on the date with empty stomach.\" Patchoulie replied, \"Anyway, this young man is the one I have referred.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The green haired girl looked at you as you looked back at her. You could tell she was harmless and little timid, then the young girl came to you with some blush. She was being little shy and then moment later she spoke to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Nice to meet you, sir. I'm Wriggle Nightbug, it's an honor to be your date.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Alright. I'm Alex Whitestone, nice to meet you.\" You greeted back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She blushed more and bowed to you. You nodded and gave her seat next to you. She sat down and moment later, the dinner was served. Everyone was having good time eating as flandre was asking your sister about what she did before she came here while sakuya served some tea and wine to others. You did talk to wriggle about her, and she told you she was a youkai who could control bugs. You didn't really like bugs, but did tolerate some such as firefly or ladybug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"So Wriggle, where should we go after here?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I was thinking of open area where I can summon some fireflies.\" Wriggle replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You were surprised to hear that and it felt like a great idea. You sipped on the tea and wondered if it would be a good one. After 45 minutes, the dinner was done and anna helped sakuya get the dirty plates. You and wriggle was at the door, ready to go out then both remilia and patchoulie was there to bid farewell to the two of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Make sure you come back before midnight, ok?\" Remilia spoke.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"Yes, ma'am.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"And make sure it suites you wriggle.\"Patchoulie replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Wriggle just blushed and they got out of the place.

Koakuma, you got the camera?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right here, Ms. Knowledge. But isnt it awful rude of us to film the bug's private affairs like this?\"<br>\r\n\u201cBut this just might be a historical moment! There is no known record of a human/firefly youkai hybrid and I\u2018M gonna be the one documenting the entire encounter that leads to the first known discovery!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s er\u2026 kind of disturbing youre that interested in Ms. Nightbug\u2019s offspring. And have you possibly thought of potential repercussions for not only using Wriggle as a guinea pig but also putting Ms. Whitestone\u2018s own brother in the middle of this?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDont worry, fireflies don\u2019t eat their mates so John has nothing to worry about. Now start filming and keep quiet! Here they come *Ahem!* Here we follow the female firefly youkai as she returns to her natural habitant with a potential mate, a male human. Due to the human\u2018s limited vision in the dark as well as lack of physical means to defend himself from predators, he is dependant on the firefly youkai to guide him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026\u2026\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEr, where are we going Wriggle? I cant see a thing.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDont worry dont worry. I\u2019ll show you when we get there.\u201d<br>\r\nThe forest seemed endless and pitch black except for the stars in the sky. Navigating through this dark forest no doubt full of dangerous hungry beasts was dangerous for someone like you, but Wriggle seemed to have no trouble leading you through it.  Clearly, she\u2019s used to the routes so you\u2019d rather not question her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, she seemed incredibly enthusiastic to lead you somewhere and it wasn\u2019t long before you found out where it is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n A nice large pond barely lit up by the little fireflies flying around it. The water looked crystal clear and possibly clean, though you don\u2019t consider bathing in it, let alone drinking from it. It was rather nice to see your reflection and notice the way your eyes sorta twinkle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is our little late night hangout,\u201d Wriggle explained, \u201cit\u2019s not spectacular or anything, but it\u2019s awful relaxing after a super hard day\u2019s work of tending my boss\u2019s garden.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell it definitely looks,\u201d you took a breath, \u201cFEELS relaxing.\u201d It was until a firefly zipped too close, almost colliding into your eye before you flinched. Fortunately it swoops around you and lands on your shoulder lighting you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe firefly youkai properly introduces the human to it\u2019s obedient drones,\u201d Patchouli narrated, \u201cthough interested by their glow, the human shows slight caution. It\u2019s understandable, because unlike fireflies from most of the world, those spawned from a youkai are rather hostile and protective of it\u2019s host. Should the female feel threatened, their bioluminescent abdomen also conduct electricity when they swarm prey.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThese fireflies are like the watch dogs of my pond,\u201d Wriggle said, \u201ctheyre trained to guard this place and attack those that threaten it without mercy.\u201d You cringed when another firefly lands on your other shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy natural instincts, the human male seems intimidated due to being outnumbered and possibly fears the slightest move could set the firefly army to strike,\u201d Patchouli narrated, \u201csensing his fear, the youkai offers assurance.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Wriggle assured you, \u201cthey only attack when I tell them to. And I told them youre ok.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cEr\u2026 thanks,\u201d you cooled yourself down, believing her words, \u201chave you ever\u2026 had to have them attack someone?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNot lately, it\u2019s pretty rare,\u201d she answered, \u201cand I dont just have them attack random people just passing by. You\u2019d have to REALLY be a threat to get swarmed.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAnyone around here that is a threat?\u201d you continued to question.<br>\r\n\u201cNah, the bad youkai dont come around here,\u201d Wriggle told you, \u201cwell, except one. But I havent seen her in a while.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJudging by his interest, the human seems to have built a trust with the youkai that she means him no harm,\u201d Patchouli narrates, \u201chowever due to his tragic experience with his last youkai mate, successful breeding may not prove an easy task for the firefly youkai. She may need to offer more appeal to him to truly gain his satisfaction.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd guarding the pond\u2019s not the only thing they do,\u201d she says, \u201cI\u2019ve also trained them to do tricks.\u201d<br>\r\nThat caught your interest pretty fast, \u201cWhat kind of tricks?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didnt tell you. She showed you.<br>\r\nWith a twitch of her antennae, the fireflies suddenly halt their random circular flying and float motionless in the air. Even the ones on your shoulders join them. With another antennae twitch, the fireflies line up together and start circling around in a 360 rotation. Another twitch and the long row of fireflies zip toward Wriggle and spin circles around her.  Then they zipped at you and spun circles around you before returning to the pond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWriggle\u2019s antennae twitched again and the fireflies swarmed up in the sky until they formed what looked to be a cute little cartoony image of Wriggle herself!<br>\r\n\u201cWow, that is neat!\u201d you gave her props, but she wasnt done.<br>\r\nAnother twitch, then they flew down toward the pond\u2026 then they split into little single-filed groups and zipped up toward the sky before suddenly splitting and scattering as soon as they were high enough! They were imitating fireworks!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa ho ho!!\u201d you chuckled in awe, \u201cthat is amazing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe youkai\u2019s effort to appeal to her potential mate as succeeded,\u201d Patchouli narrated with a victorious smirk, \u201cbreeding has been ascertained!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the confident smile on Wriggle\u2019s face turned to suspicion! As if sensing hostility with her twitching antennae, she quickly jerked her head to whatever was out there and placed herself in front of you like a protector.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cShh!\u201d Wriggle hushed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSuddenly, the female youkai senses a potentially hostile presence,\u201d Patchouli narrates, \u201cshe puts herself in front of her mate, ensuring the safety of him and their potential offspring. She gives her drones the signal to attack.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWriggle\u2019s antennae twitch again, giving her fireflies the signal to swarm! They immediately response, zipping toward and eventually surrounding the intruder!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe intruder happened to be...</span></div></div>",

You didn't know who this girl was as wriggle knew who she was and ordered her bug to come back. Once they came back to the bug youkai and calmed down, you seen the girl coughing little and slowly got up, holding her hand on her chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yamame? what are you doing here?\" Wriggle asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well, you see I was doing some good night walk until I seen you and that handsome man at the pond.\" She replied with smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Wriggle blushed and you were little happy for a girl to call you 'handsome; as you were rarely  being called handsome (last time you were called handsome by a women, your big sis shot her head). You looked at the girl as she looked like any other human females you see everyday but you got to remind yourself that you were in the mystical land so she might be something. Yamame continued to smile and came to you and grabbed your hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Nice to meet you handsome! I'm Yamame Kurodani, a tsuchigumo youkai!\" She greeted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Um..hi, I guess?\" you replied, \"I'm Alex Whitestone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She then started to observe you from top to bottom as you wondered why she was observing you. Wriggle were worried about this as she felt something odd as yamame rarely get out of the place she always be at. Patchoulie continue to look at koakuma continued to film what she was looking at. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"The perpetrator of the unknown being is none other then the underground spider Yamame Kasodani herself!\" Patchy narrated. \"What would be the fireflys next move!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n (I have a bad feeling about this...) koakuma thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You were feeling little nervous as yamame were so close to you to the point her chest were touching your skin. She was aware of the action and done further until wriggle intervened her action. You took step back as wriggle was infront of you.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"Yamame, this is private date between me and him alone.\" Wriggle said.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"Oh? but since it's full moon, it would be more fun with company you know?\" Yamame said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You didn't know what she ment until you noticed the sky. The moon were close and it was a super moon and you were astonished to see this. You turned back to wriggle and noticed that she was trembling little and she was blushing red. You even noticed that even yamame was blushing lightly as well and wriggle turned to your attention and pushed you to the ground lightly. You fell to the ground and wriggle sat on top of you as yamame came to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What...are you going to do to me?\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'm sorry Mr.Whitestone, but once a month we youkais have this...urge built within us to release it.\" Wriggle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Urge?\" You asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Just then, you seen both yamame and wriggle start to undress themselves. You begun to feel embaressed to see them start to undress and within moment they were now fully naked. You seen their chest and their womenhood at your eyesight as you now understand what they were going to do: try to have your virginity. You were happy but at same time you were scared that they would rape you or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Don't worry, handsome. We're not raping you, but consider this as a fun time.\" Yamame said with smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Wriggle then undressed your jeans and your underwear and started to fiddle with your manhood as yamame kissed you. You felt the ecstasy as wriggle was stroking your manhood perfectly, yamames breath was warm and then after  few moment of kiss she put her womenhood on top of your face and started to move back and forth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Now this is good news: we will now show the history as not only we will see an human/firefly youkai hybrid but human/tsuchigumo hybrid as well!\" Patchoulie narriated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Koakuma just sighed and continued to film.

Remember to cut this part out in post! *Ahem!* It appears the tsuchigumo is busy recovering from her cunnilingus, so now it's just the human and firefly youkai. The youkai's fireflies have created some sort of a barrier of light to prevent any and all intruders and onlookers from disrupting this important moment... although it may also be because of her inexperience as a virgin.

You were not only nervous about this, you were having a feeling that youre not supposed to be doing this with someone of her species to begin with!<br>\r\n\"I...

Unfortunately, a pesky firefly was buzzing in your face, getting in the way of the irresistible view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shooed the bug away, being careful not to hurt it so you wouldnt offend Wriggle, then it buzzed around her frantically. Her antennae twitched as if trying to communicate with it and then a shocked expression appeared on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat's wrong, Wrig?\u201d the spider asked, finally pausing from fingering herself.<br>\r\n\u201cWe're being watched!\u201d Wriggle quickly got up and pulled her shorts back on, slightly shading the glow of her ass. Snapping yourself out of the trance of that booty, you quickly put your pants back on and catch up with the firefly youkai who was running toward the direction of the one firefly while the rest of the swarm follow. Yamame groans with disappointment and follows a bit far behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSensing even more danger not too far away, the firefly youkai quickly runs in pursuit while her obedient drones and her human mate follow,\u201d Patchouli narrates.<br>\r\n\u201cUh, Patchouli?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNot now, Koakuma!

Unfortunately for them, a stray firefly buzzed around Wriggle and her antennae twitched again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWere you filming me and Alex having sex?!!\u201d she got perturbed, your eyes widened, and Yamame smirked.<br>\r\n\u201cSheesh, if ya wanted to watch, all you had to do was ask!\u201d Yamame giggled.<br>\r\n\u201cShut up, Yamame!\u201d Wriggle snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cL-Look! This isnt what you think this is!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThis isnt you filming me, Wriggle, and Yamame having a threesome?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n\u201cO-o-ok, so it IS,\u201d she corrects herself, \u201cbut there's a perfectly good reason for this! This could be the start of a new undiscovered breed of species!\u201d<br>\r\nWriggle squinted her eyes, \u201cAre you serious?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAbsolutely!!\u201d Patchouli insists, \u201cif this all goes well, this will make history! We'll be the first to bare witness to a brand new hybrid of species! We'll be famous! All over the news and media!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou simply blinked, kinda mind blown. That was seriously the whole reason she set you up on this blind date! To take advantage of your child if you do end up having one with Wriggle. Thinking about it again, it sounds incredibly cruel. But perhaps you shouldve suspected something when she was trying to set you up. Heck, the books were a dead giveaway!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWriggle, on the other hand, was still perturbed, \u201cYou mean to tell me you set up this date just so you could invade my privacy, film me having sex like a stupid nature film and use me and my potential baby as a tool to make you famous?!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHo ho, man!\u201d Yamame snickered, \u201cI am SO glad I stumbled into THIS mess!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWriggle then turned to you, \u201cWere you aware of any of this?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI only noticed she was reading a few odd books when she asked me to go on the blind date! Honest!\u201d you answer truthfully, \"Patchouli, Anna's gonna kill if she finds out what you tried to do with me.\"<br>\r\n\"But why?!\" Patchouli whined, \"this was clearly for a good cause! And it's not like I was gonna completely pocket all the money! I was gonna share it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw who cares about all this, Wriggle? Let 'em film us!\u201d Yamame urges with impatience.<br>\r\n\u201cNo! Absolutely not! I NEVER agreed nor would I agree to be apart of this stupid stunt!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told you this wasnt a good idea, Patchouli,\u201d Koakuma moaned.<br>\r\n\u201cOh c'mon, Wriggle!\u201d the purple-haired narrator of the nature film that wasnt pleaded, \u201cI promise it's for a good cause! I'll even blurr your face if you want your identity kept private!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor the last time, NO!\u201d she was rightfully pissed, \u201cwhatever goes on involving my personal life is not your business and certainly not something to exploit!\u201d With that, Wriggle's antennae twitched yet again, and her swarm of fireflies scattered into the darkness. \u201cI've had enough of this, I'm going home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, dont be like that, Wriggle! We can still have fun!\u201d the spider girl complained, \u201cI know you still got the urge!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHave your fun without me!\u201d the firefly girl turned away from her. Despite the whole episode of violating one's personal affairs and exploiting them, you were wondering if Wriggle was mad at you too. After all, you werent exactly part of the problem, yourself! You seriously did want to be on this blind date regardless of Patchouli's motives... and you kinda sorta wouldnt mind um... quelling Wriggle's urge. Judging by the way her cheeks were flush and ass was still glowing under her shorts, that urge was still there, after all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wondered your verdict as Wriggle walked past you. But before she storms off into the darkness....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You suddenly feel the unquestionable urge not to end this potential relationship abruptly. It didnt matter to you if you and the firefly youkai with the world's shiniest ass werent compatible biologically (and you most likely werent!). It didnt even matter that you hated the majority of bugs with a firey passion (including the ones that werent trained to be spies for Le Fey!). And it wasnt YOUR fault that your match-maker clearly had shady motives to book you on this blind date!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...\" speaking of which, Patchouli sighed hard, \"nevermind her, Alex. If she doesnt wanna be rich and famous, that's her loss! Let's check and see if human/spider youkai hybrids are a thing.... Wait! Alex, where are you going?!\"<br>\r\nYou didnt say anything back to her. You didnt even acknowledge her or so much as give her eye contact as you just blindly walked into the absolute darkness toward the direction Wriggle's glowing butt was heading! Unsafe obviously, but you were totally interested in making this potential relationship work! At least that's what you tell yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Come back! It's dangerous to head out that way alone!\" Patchouli shouted, \"...cant you at least wait for me to recharge the camera battery?!\" By the time Patchouli finished that question, she was already a speck in the distance, what with the fact you had to pick up the speed tremendously cuz Wriggle started running!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, the rest of the forest was pitch black. Couldnt see the trees, shrubs, bushes, or unknown critters hiding among them. You couldnt see the hand in front of your face. You could barely see the glowing eyes hidden amongst the darkness. If you were thinking rationally, you'd realize what a great big stupid move you just made. But instead, you were only focused on chasing the only well lit light in the middle of this darkness! Fortunately, it was a very inviting light and had a very nice shape. It was damn near impossible to take your eyes off it ever since Wriggle first showed it to you when you came so close to mating with her on all fours! It felt way way WAY too early to say goodbye to it after only being introduced to it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe very tiny part of you that wasnt mesmerized by the glow was hoping Wriggle wasnt gonna dim her butt-light any time soon, otherwise you'd be SOL. It was far too late to turn back now even if you wanted to, cuz you didnt know where back was anymore!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter over a mile and half of running trying to catch up with the glowing backside, the light finally dimmed out. Fortunately by then, Wriggle had already stopped at a well lit shack in the middle of a cavern lit up by thousands of tiny fireflies. The cavern itself had a very colorful glow, the stalagmites illuminating all sorts of rainbow colors. A nice little tourist attraction. You'd take photos if you brought your smartphone. Now you cant so much as call for help and the only person who knows where you are just dashed into her shack and slammed the door shut behind her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking off the trance, the fear of being completely stranded in the middle of nowhere washes completely over you! You nervously head toward the shack and knock on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see Wriggle's eyes peek at you through the mail slot on the door, then they quickly narrow and you hear her shout \"GO AWAY!! LEAVE ME ALONE!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Wriggle, please let me in,\" you plead, \"I... think I might be lost.\"<br>\r\n\"THAT'S YOUR PROBLEM!\" she shouts, \"I NEVER SAID YOU COULD FOLLOW ME!\" Geez, what were you thinking?!<br>\r\n...Oh right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, Wriggle, please let me in.\"<br>\r\n\"Why? So you can finish Patchouli's stupid nature porn?!\" she snapped, still angry about it, \"go away now before I summon the hornets!\"<br>\r\nAs much as you didnt wanna risk getting stung to death by a swarm of angry hornets, you keep pleading with the bug girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, I'm really sorry about that stupid stunt she tried to pull,\" you apologize, \"I swear, I had no idea she was gonna film us! That's not what I agreed to when I decided to go on this blind date with you!\"<br>\r\n\"Tsk... yeah right,\" Wriggle tsked from behind the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm serious!\" you insist, \"I really did just want to unwind and take a break from all this insane shit I've been experiencing since being on the run... and have a nice pleasant evening with a really cute girl.\"<br>\r\nShe didnt say anything, but you could sense she was listening.<br>\r\n\"And hey...\" your cheeks go red, preparing yourself to make a bold ballsy (what the fuck?! That's an actual word in the dictionary?!) statement, \"...it's only an added killer bonus if it's this really cute girl's special time of the month. What kind of gentleman would I be to just leave such a cute girl hanging when she's in need of having her urge sated?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhhh.... ummm..... uuuuuuhhhh...\" you could tell she was getting awful nervous behind that door! You could imagine her face getting bashfully red. You were surely gonna get some tonight!!<br>\r\n\"Now come on and let me in, Ms. Nightbug,\" you say, \"let's both quell our primal urges, just the two of us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H... how did I know that bookworm wont still be taping us?!\" she questions.<br>\r\n\"We can cover up all the windows!\" you suggest, \"and if she still somehow finds a way to sneak a camera in here, I'll have my sister strangle the living shit out of her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou waited patiently for Wriggle to decide whether to let you in and allow you to get reacquainted with her blinding bright rump. For the brief moment it was quiet except for the sounds of hissing and growling in the distance, once again reminding you how far away from safe haven you were!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"..Alright... but on one condition!\" Wriggle demands.<br>\r\n\"Name it.\"<br>\r\n\"...Youre gonna let one of my special bugs bite you!\" Bite you?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened the mail slot again and an odd rainbow colored spikey beetle with large pincers flew out! You backed away, surprised as it landed on the door, and you eyed the eerie symbols on it's abdomen with caution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W....what is that?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"It's a Wokandan Rainbow Beetle,\" she answers, \"they are incredibly aggressive and their bites and very venomous!\" All six eyes of the beetle gazed into yours and it made a loud scary hiss.<br>\r\n\"V-V-Venomous?!\"<br>\r\n\"VERY venomous!\" Wriggle corrected, \"one single bite and the poison will work it's way through your body in only minutes!\" You jumped back the minute it snapped it's big pincher-jaws at you! Second thoughts quickly arise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dont worry, the poison wont kill you or anything bad like that,\" Wriggle assured you, \"however it's gonna leave a few strong side-effects that wont go away for several hours!\"<br>\r\n\"W-what kind of side effects?\" you ask as the beetle made you think was an attempt at a grin.<br>\r\n\"That's for ME to know and YOU to find out!\" but she kept you in the dark, \"that's the condition! If you wanna be my mate, you need to brave enough for what's gonna come! Otherwise, you'd better turn around and leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beetle tilted it's head and twitched it's antennae as if growing impatient with you. You gritted your teeth giving careful thought of this whole situation.<br>\r\nYoure kinda REALLY lost and kinda hoping to sate your primal urge with a cute bug girl. However, youre pretty concerned about the side-effects a Wokandan Rainbow Beetle's venom will leave on you. But it's either that or back out in the forest of darkness with you! What's it gonna be?</span></div></div>",

You wondered if this is what Anna felt when she were tortured for mistakes she made and made amends to Maeve herself. With pain rising, you saw wriggle opening the door slowly and looking at you and pulls you into her house.

Patchy, could only stare in disbelief at this creature before her while Anna looked back questionably.<br>\r\n\"...What? What is it?\" the figure questioned the dumbfounded bookworm with a dropped a jaw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er...A...Ms. Whitestone?\" Patchouli questioned, slightly reeling away, \"is... that you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Obviously! What's with that odd quest....?!!!\" it was then, Anna saw her reflection in the mirror. The sparkly eyelids of her enlarged bloodshot optical orbs widened as she spotted the antennae sprouting out of her sparkly green hair, the glowing celtic markings all across her exposed arms, her neatly trimmed nails now long and jaggedly, the pointed fangs in the middle of her dropped jaw, and the colorful butterfly wings sprouting out her back!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Oh... fuck....\" she mumbled silently then her voice grew louder, \"fuck fuck fuck fuck FUCK! Not now! Not now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatchouli raised an eyebrow and finally built the courage to step closer to her, \"M...Ms Whitestone? What's wr-\"<br>\r\n\"My pills! Get my pills! Hurry!\"<br>\r\n\"Your wh-\"<br>\r\n\"MY PILLS!! NOW!!!\" Anna's roar seemed almost feral as she shrieked in Patchouli's face, nearly causing her to jump out of her mortal shell!<br>\r\n\"O-O-Ok!  W-w-where are they?!\"<br>\r\n\"My room!\" Anna shivered, \"Just beside the green safe in the closet! MOVE!!\"<br>\r\n\"S-S-Sure! Koakuma! Go get her pills!\"<br>\r\n\"HELP HER! FAST!!\"<br>\r\nPatchouli ran along after Koakuma, moving as fast as her feet could take her! All the while, Anna kept gazing at herself in the mirror horrified by her own horrified expression!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anna, sweetie...\" the OTHER voice spouted from her lips, \"you look like shit. Is something wrong?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n-----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt like ages have past before the disturbing hallucinations finally subsided and the many voices in your head finally went quiet. You were still very lightheaded and dizzy, not to mention croggy, nauseous, and sorta twitching uncontrollably. The pain where the beetle bit you didnt seem to bother you as much anymore, but it might be because your hand was going numb. Your body has yet to recover from the poison. Still, compared to much earlier, you were feeling better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your vision clears, the first real image that catches your eye is the lovely face of a cute green-haired girl with bug antennae looking back at you with a worried expression. Oh hi, Wriggle.<br>\r\n\"Alex? ...Alex?\" her voice echoed a little as your eyes tried to focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ughhh...\" the first words coming out of your mouth were mere groans. Your throat was sore and the inside of your mouth felt incredibly dry. <br>\r\n\"Easy easy, dont force yourself up,\" Wriggle eased you, \"relax. Take slow breaths.\" You do so. Not like you have any energy to do much, anyway. You shoulda known this was a terrible idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere,\u201d the bug youkai offered you a drink, \u201cdrink this. It'll ease most of the symptoms youre currently experiencing.\u201d Your better judgment was too busy groaning in agony to question drinking such an odd concoction, so you take the drink and slowly sip it, bracing yourself for the nasty taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no nasty taste. There was no taste PERIOD! Both your senses of taste and smell were gone at the moment. However your stomach was still feeling really queasy, so you had doubts you could hold the stuff down as you swallowed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d Wriggle leaned in close and both her and constantly warping twin sisters ask in unison.<br>\r\n\u201cBeen better,\u201d you muttered with what little energy you had in your voice. You can at least make out the look of guilt and shame on the Wriggle clones' faces.<br>\r\n\u201cI'm really sorry to put you through that,\u201d she apologizes, \u201cI had to make sure you were really committed to  this and werent just in it for whatever stupid nature film that conniving book-humper was trying to make!\u201d Unless Patchy intended to blur your face, the last thing you wanted was to have it put up for display all over television while youre supposed to be hiding out!<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d you coughed a little before slurring, \u201cdid I convince you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWriggle smiled and nodded, \u201cMost humans wouldve cowered and ran at the sight of just one of my more harmless bugs. I honestly never thought I'd see one that'd willingly take a bite from one of my more poisonous ones just to prove his love to me! That's so romantic!\u201d Romantic, she says?! That interesting choice of words. \u201cI'll be honest. My original intention for our date was to have you breed with me one time so that I could get pregnant\u2026 that is before a certain spider interrupted us. There wouldnt be a second date if you successfully impregnated me.\u201d Damn, you were just a bootycall? (Funny, considering her booty could literally charge your phone!)<br>\r\nThinking about it, it actually made you feel a little hurt. Especially considering you did wanna eventually stop running and lay down and start a family. \u201cI'm sorry, that's how most insect youkai relationships work. It's specifically to ensure future generations and nothing more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen her eyes beamed up once more, \u201cBut after seeing the way you braved a dark creepy forest of unknown predators and even took a bite from one of my most venomous bugs, all for the chance to be with me\u2026 sigh\u2026 I was a fool to let you go! I'm so sorry I doubted a potential King!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026'King'?\u201d despite your head still spinning, you heard that peculiar word clearly.<br>\r\n\u201cA colony king,\u201d Wriggle stated, \u201ca devoted alpha and leader of the hive who leads alongside the Queen as her prime partner.\u201d She blushed a little, \u201cIt's\u2026 the closest we have to a 'husband'.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk, THAT word sparks you up nice and good. Unfortunately for all the wrong reasons!<br>\r\n\u201cW-w-wait! Husband? Arent you getting a little ahead of yourself?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNot at all!\u201d Wriggle shook her head with determination, \u201conly someone as bold, courageous, handsome, and daring deserves the right to be called 'King' by me!\u201d Wow\u2026 handsome, she says? Maybe it's still the venom affecting your brain, but you didnt really feel the urge to argue why it's still way too early for her to consider you her 'King'. You werent even thinking about your sister and how worried sick she must be. Hell, at this point, you had all but forgotten you had a sister to begin with! All that really mattered to you at the moment was Wriggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTh...thank you, Wriggle,\u201d you were much more flattered than you normally would be, \u201cthat means an awful lot coming from such a cute gorgeous Queen.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMmmm!!\u201d she buzzed with joy and nuzzled her awfully ticklish (itchy) antennae against your head. You were a little confused by this odd gesture and Wriggled quickly realized that. \u201cOh. That's sort of our equivalent to this. *Smooch!*\u201d Ok, THAT you understood\u2026 and blushed accordingly from it. It mustve been the venom going through your system, cuz it was all but enough to convince you to put aside everything else in life and accept your fate as Wriggle's King. Thank you Patchouli for screwing up so monumentally! If not for her, you'd never have had this incredible opportunity and this cute firefly youkai wouldve ended up choosing someone much less worthy to rule her colony!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is wonderful! I'm so excited!\u201d speaking of, Wriggle was beaming with excitement, \u201cI-I-I gotta tell Yuuka! She'll be so psyched that she's gonna have an official kingdom looking after her garden!\u201d You'd ask who this Yuuka person is, but at the moment, you were still too blissed out on Wokanda beetle venom<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI better call her up now and give her the good news!\u201d she reached for her awfully cute ladybug-shaped cellphone, but just as she was about to press a button, she hesitated, \u201cUm\u2026 that is\u2026 if youre feeling up to meeting her right now. We could meet her later if you need more rest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Then Wriggle blushed and gazed at you dreamy-eyed, \u201cOr\u2026 if you'd like\u2026 we could\u2026 start on making our colony's first prince or princess\u2026\" Even her ass lighted up with anticipation! Your toxified brain gave it a little thought before you gave your answer.</span></div></div>",

You told her what your intentions were and she blushed little and nodded, taking her cloth off. She revealed her loli body towards you. Her breasts were not big but not too small, her abdomen were neatly thin and her netherworld had no hair. You swallowed hard as she came close to you, she pushed you back to the bed and once you were laying down she took your zippers downs and looked at your manhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cLet\u2019s work out so we could make our first prince or princess.\u201d Wriggle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cAlright wriggle, give me your best shot.\u201d You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She then fiddled with your penis for 5 minutes until it started to grow up. Wriggle blushes by this but caved in and put your penis into her vagina. You still felt the little sparkling feeling from her but it was not that hurt as she started to hump on top of you with moaning and groaning. You felt her inside and it felt good and within 20 minutes you started to feel the climax. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWriggle, I think I\u2019m gonna cum!\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cMe, too....oh gated..!\u201d Wriggle spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI\u2019m going cum, cumming, CUMMING NOW!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n With the urge, your penis spat an flood of semen into wriggles ovaries. The sperms were swimming into her eggs so one of them could be the child of yours and wriggles. It took another 3 hours for you two to have sex from cowgirl stance to doggy style, you two were exhausted from the sex and lay on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI must show Yuuka about this good news tomorrow.\u201d Wriggle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cBefore that, I have to see my sis first so she\u2019ll not be worried.\u201d You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She was little mad at patchy but agrees to let you see Anna and you two went to sleep. Next day approaches and both you and wriggle ate breakfast and went toward the SDM. Once arrived, you two saw meowing asleep while standing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cOh no, I think she\u2019ll be in trouble.\u201d Wriggle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Before you could say anything a knife hit her forehead hard, causing her to bleed and herself kneeling in pain. You two saw Sakuya coming out of the gate, looking at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cMr.whitestone, where were you? Ms.whitestone were worried sick about you.\u201d Sakuya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI apologize. I had little discussion with ms.nightbug here last night.\u201d You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cIt took overnight for discussion?\u201d Sakuya asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cYes. I truly sorry for this incident. Can I see my sis at this moment now?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n She nodded and took both you and wriggle to inside. It took moment for you two to get to Anna\u2019s room and once you got there she let you two in. You saw flandre looking at Anna as she was laying down on her bed. Flandre noticed you two and came to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cAlex, I think Anna one-sama is sick.\u201d Flandre said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cOh? I\u2019ll talk to her.\u201d You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You came to her, and she was just laying down with her eyes half open. You spoke her name and Anna looked at you for moment and turned back to her other direction. You feel that she didn\u2019t want to speak then suddenly..</span></div></div>",

Your brother's fiancee. It's nice to meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna quickly turned her head over to Wriggle, her facial expression still cold and emotionless. You were kinda impressed your buggy girlfriend didnt look the least bit intimidated by her. She was still standing there looking back at your sis with a perky smile. Considering the way she made dang near every girl that tried to get close to you go stiff, it was refreshing to see a girl either too brave or too naive to be affected by her icy cold stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyways, after a long hard blinkless stare, Anna finally spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....A bug girl?\" she turned her head to you, \"...I thought you hated bugs.\" What an awkward way to start a conversation (even though you DO hate bugs! ...Maybe you can get used to fireflies).<br>\r\n\"Well I happen to be very fond of THIS one,\" you quickly come up with the world's best reply. Even Wriggle approved, judging by her antennae nuzzling against your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, er... Wriggle,\" Anna says, \"I'm sorry we didnt get to meet each other in much more appropriate circumstances.\u201d Odd. Why aint she going on a tangent about how you quickly rushed to marriage with a girl you barely knew for a single day?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEr\u2026 arent you gonna chew me out for rushing into marriage or something?\u201d you push yourself to asking. You dont bother telling her that you already had the 'honeymoon' part!<br>\r\nNevertheless, your sister just turns her head and stares back up at the ceiling.<br>\r\n\u201cMeh. I know you wanna stop running away and finally just lie down and start a family,\u201d she groans with a hint of depression in her voice, \u201cit's probably my fault you rushed. I didnt give you any free time to start a relationship. ...Although to be fair, all the women that came for you were total sluts. ...Not that I'm implying youre one of them, Wriggle!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI assure you, I'm anything but!\u201d Wriggle remarked, \u201cI'm a very sophisticated woman with high morals and very high standards!\u201d You keep your fucking mouth shut if you know what's good for you! \u201cYour brother had to truly prove himself to be worthy of being MY Colony King!\u201d She deliberately leaves out the fact she poisoned you with bug venom! Not that youre eager to mention it\u2026 cuz you dont want Wriggle to die.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat's a c\u2026 nevermind,\u201d Anna turns away, \u201cI dont wanna know. Anyways, I'm happy for you two. Sorry I  cant be in a better mood to hear my brother's engaged.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d you asked. Your sister inhaled and exhaled hard, then stood up, still facing away from you and Wriggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI lost my shit,\u201d was her brief direct answer. Obviously it wasnt specific enough for you.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean you lost your shit?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\nAnna groaned hard, \u201cI think my meds arent working so well anymore. I had an episode earlier and I unleashed my natural form in front of the fat book thumper and her little minion without realizing it\u2026\u201d she shivered before adding, \u201c ...and then SHE started talking to me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho is 'she'?\u201d Wriggle curiously asked. Anna had no idea how to answer that question, so being Wriggle's proper husband-to-be, you answered for her.<br>\r\n\u201cIt's a figment of her imagination,\u201d you explain, \u201cit acts as a separate persona that goes off and takes control as a result of her PTSD she suffered when one of her former employers tortured her so badly.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh...\u201d Wriggle lowered her head a little, \u201cI'm sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour sis shrugged, \u201cShit like this comes with the territory. It usually gets maintained super easy thanks to the pills I've been taking the last couple of years. Now, I guess they arent strong enough anymore cuz the bitch just slipped out of me!\u201d Wonderful. Just wonderful. The time that you need her the most mentally stable, she conveniently loses control of herself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's ok, Anna,\u201d you try to assure her, \u201cwe'll get through this. This isnt the worst we've been through.\u201d<br>\r\nBut she wasnt convinced, \u201cthe last time she cornered you, you couldnt sleep for a week.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI wasnt prepared for her then,\u201d you say, \u201cnow that we know a bit more about her, I think I can handle it.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI'd rather you not,\u201d Anna shoots you down, \u201cI think I should consider going back to Le Fey and beg for my old job back-\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNO!!\u201d you scream off the top of your lungs, inadvertently making Wriggle's antennae twitch in pain, \u201ctheyre gonna torture you to death!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMaeve wont,\u201d Anna states, \u201cI have something she wants. She wont lay a finger on me if I hand it over to her. She swore on her life.\u201d And a proper fairy never lies. Twists the truth, absolutely, but never lie.<br>\r\n\u201cShe's gonna twist that someway. I just know it.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cLet ME worry about that. YOU just focus on your new family.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026 if I may make a suggestion,\u201d Wriggle speaks up, \u201chave you thought about having this one doctor, Eirin Yagokoro take a look at you?\u201d Both you and Anna jerked their heads over to her, both of you wide-eyed! Neither one of you wanted to answer that question. For obvious reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it was incredibly rude to leave your cute green-haired wife-to-be hanging, so against you better judgment, you answer, \u201cWell\u2026 the thing is\u2026 we WERE at Eientei for a little while.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou were?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026 but unfortunately, we had to leave, because\u2026. um...\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cCuz one of their shady mentally ill nurses kept trying to get in bro's pants!\u201d Anna suddenly mustered the courage to finish your sentence. You groaned, but Wriggle looked a bit nervous for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cD...Did she\u2026 uh...\u201d she pointed to your lower region.<br>\r\n\u201cNo she didnt,\u201d you honestly answer. Wriggle breathed a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n\u201cShe tried to,\u201d Anna butted in again, \u201cand I'll bet her midget sidekick, that barren hag, AND their anorexic neet princess would have tried as well sooner or later!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAnna...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, uh, still,\u201d bug girl continued, \u201cDr. Yagokoro is pretty much the wisest person on the planet when it comes to medicine. Surely, she could help treat you for whatever youre suffering from.\u201d<br>\r\nAs much as it pained you to admit, you kinda agreed with her.<br>\r\n\u201cIt wouldnt hurt to talk to her,\u201d you tell your sis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBro, we had to storm out of that place for a reason!\u201d your sister argued, \u201cbesides, how could she possibly help me after I forced her to toss out all her good medicine and replace them with anus-pills and those nasty-ass mystery drinks?\u201d AND getting poor Reisen possessed by your former employer. \u201cI cant exactly blame her if she wants nothing to do with me anymore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you should try,\u201d Wriggle says, \u201cI mean if she wasnt so forgiving, that troublemaker Tewi woulda gotten kicked out of that place a long time ago! Besides, she's not the type of person that would ignore someone in desperate need. In fact, she'd be ecstatic if it turns out youre suffering from a really rare new or undiscovered illness!\u201d Your sis cringed, but Wriggle continued, \u201cC'mon, give it a chance! Do it for your 'sis'!\u201d she winks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna growled a little and turned away, but you could tell the gears in her head were turning....</span></div></div>",

Remember to cut this part out in post! *Ahem!* It appears the tsuchigumo is busy recovering from her cunnilingus, so now it's just the human and firefly youkai. The youkai's fireflies have created some sort of a barrier of light to prevent any and all intruders and onlookers from disrupting this important moment... although it may also be because of her inexperience as a virgin. Note how she's presenting herself on all fours like a four-legged mammal, possibly her attempt to mimic human coitus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er... is... this... how I'm supposed to stand?\" Wriggle nervously shivered as she got down on all fours presenting her hindquarters to you. Her ass was glowing. (LITERALLY her backside lit up like she swallowed a flashlight and all those watts went right to her thighs!). You were not only nervous about this, you were having a feeling that youre not supposed to be doing this with someone of her species to begin with!<br>\r\n\"I... I think so...\" you nervously answered while squinting your eyes at her glowing butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The human, possibly being a virgin himself, is hesitant about mating with the firefly youkai,\" Patchouli narrates, \"however despite his fears and hesitance, he knows that this particular youkai deemed him suitable to sire her offspring over any other male. He knew what a tremendous honor this was and being giving such an honor by someone as gorgeous and attractive as her was not easy for someone like him to come by. He would be a fool to back out after going so far. Biting his lip and swallowing down his pride, he accepts her generous offer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Zz-Pop!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha!!\" you almost felt a slight shock at your penis as soon as you came in just centimeters from Wriggle's vagina! Something you NEVER expected would happen on your first time!<br>\r\n\"I-it's alright,\" Wriggle assures you, \"it only hurts a little at first, but your body will get used to the surging real fast.\" SURGING?! Is this seriously what sex is like?!<br>\r\nStill, you take your word and carefully press into her.<br>\r\n*zzzZZZ-Pop!*<br>\r\n\"Yaah!!\"<br>\r\n\"AAAH!!!\" The slightly painful shocks made you cringe in places you didnt even know you had!l You could feel and hear the tiny crackles emitting inside Wriggle while your man pillar was still in her. Her hindquarters warmed up as her butt glowed brighter. You attempt to pull out, but the sparks intensify much stronger to the point of hurting before you could even get the tip out! The shocks softened a bit when you pushed back in. It's like her body was refusing to let you back out after you've come this far!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P..please... keep going...\" Wriggle gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Due to the irregular course of interspecies breeding, the human male was completely unprepared for the luminous surges the female youkai's body naturally gives off during this time of the year,\" Patchouli narrates, \"despite the slight electrocution, the human male remains strong and continues to thrust his penis into the firefly youkai's aroused vagina. The youkai lets out gasps and moans of delight while her body continues emitting surges toward the human, causing him to shout and roar in a mixture of pain and pleasure! Judging by the expressions on her face (get a close up on that, Koakuma!), we see that she is greatly enthralled by the ravaging this lowly human was giving to her reproductive organ. In all her years, never has she expected a creature like this one to give a high-leveled youkai such as her quite an eccentric yet very stimulating mating ritual. The human male appears to be enjoying himself as well. His inaudible roars haven gotten louder and his thrusting pace has gotten faster and rougher. As if being drawn in by it's luminous glow like a moth to a flame, his hands are rubbing against the youkai's glowing backside, possibly basking in it's warmth in the middle of this cold night or perhaps simply adding more stimulation for her. Whether or not he'll consider stimulating her anally later remains to be seen, although it's likely he'll-\"<br>\r\n\"Um, Patchouli, should really be filming this part?\" Koakuma interrupts her long thorough narration, \"I mean we now know theyre having sex already, so shouldnt we just skip to the end?\"<br>\r\n\"Absolutely not!\" the librarian exclaimed, \"we have to get each and every cock squeeze and ass jiggle on this film to make this proper breeding of a human/firefly youkai breed official! Now quiet, it's just about to get to the good part! *Ahem!* The two appear to have reached their peak. In just moments, the human male will ejaculate his life-giving seed into the youkai female and thus begin the miracle of life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldnt hold out any longer! And not just because your body couldnt take any more shocks! The pressure in your urethra built up and it was ready to blow!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W...Wriggle....\" you panted, \"I'm... gonna... cum!\"<br>\r\nWriggle just moaned louder, too into it to respond. You assumed that meant it was ok to cum inside her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah.... ah... Ahh!! AAHHH!!!!\"<br>\r\n\"Ah! Ah! AH! Ahhh-GYAWWWWDDDD!!!\"<br>\r\nWriggle let out one long hard electrical surge throughout your body as you shot your seed into her! You twitched from head to and drool uncomfortably from the shock! Not even a policeman's taser could match the intensity you just experienced right now! And in the end... it was TOTALLY worth it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter your slight paralysis of ecstasy ended, you fell to the ground with a thud. Man, did that take a lot out of you! And somehow, even though she was on the receiving end and still dripping with your semen, Wriggle recovered much faster than you. She got up, wiped herself off, put her clothes back on and gleefully floated toward you with a smile.<br>\r\nShe nuzzled her antennae against your head... you assume this was her species' equivalent to giving you a kiss. Gosh, even after the ravaging you gave her and she gave you, she's STILL so springy and cute!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just when you prepared yourself for a moment of rest, Wriggle had to utter these four words:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, Yamame! Your turn!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widened, remembering you still had that spider-girl to deal with!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urgh... bout damn time!\" Yamame got up and stretched her... six arms!? \"I was getting tired of doing it by myself!\" You aint so much as a minute to clear your head before she's already sitting on of you, \"have you ever stuck that thing of yours in a girl's spinneret?  You'd be amazed how intense it feels!\" You dont even know what a spinneret is! Not that it matters. The only thing that matters is this: Can you hold out? Even after that hefty (albeit bizarre) workout with Wriggle, do you have enough strength in you to handle Yamame?</span></div></div>",

Youre not even sure where the anus is and you were not keen on finding out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The tsuchigumo temporarily sheds off her human coil, revealing her true physical form which is that of a drider,\" Patchouli narrates, \"possibly to invoke proper accuracy for spinneret penetration.\"<br>\r\n\"What's a spinneret?\" asked her naive assistant.<br>\r\n\"A spinneret is the particular organ of a spider's body that secretes protein from it's body and spins it into strong silk webbing. Why one would use such an orifice for sexual pleasure still remains to be discovered.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gazed, feeling intimidated and kinda scared at the strange hairy sphincter-like muscle orifice at the very end of Yamame's abdomen getting awful close to your exposed member!<br>\r\n\"See this little baby?\" the tsuchigumo pointed at the hairy orifice then pointed at your penis, \"that's where your little buddy's going. It's gonna get nice and tight in there, so get ready.\" It's kinda creepy, but somehow youre still aroused. \"HERE GOES!\" And with one merciless thrust, she squeezed your dick right through that spinneret!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grrggghh!!\"<br>\r\n\"Gyaaaahhh!!\" <br>\r\nBoth of you squealed, underestimating the tenacity! Despite the hairy outside, inside was tight organy tissue with strange prickly barbs which rubbed against your easily ticklish tip as Yamame moved her abdomen back and forth!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Despite clearly not being a organ used for reproduction, the tsuchigumo seems to be gaining absolute pleasure forcing the human male to penetrate it. The spinneret clamps down tightly on the human's penis as if trying it's best to impersonate the vagina, and judging by the way the human is gasping and moaning from the sheer euphoria, it has succeeded. Possibly feeling left out, the female firefly youkai proceeds to grasp the human male, kissing him on the lips despite the fact those lips were touching the crotch of the tsuchigumo earlier as she gently caresses his testicles with her free hand then-\"<br>\r\n\"Patchouli! I really dont think we should be filming this!\" Koakuma interrupts the narration.<br>\r\n\"Trust me, Koakuma. People will tune in to watch this,\" Patchouli assures, \"now hush! We're about to miss the climax!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYamame was shivering as her spinneret was going haywire, spewing up wet premature protein! It wasnt very long before she let out a loud squeal and another hairy orifice that you assumed was the vagina was spraying the ground! Before you could orgasm yourself, she had already pulled herself off you and fell to the ground writhing in ecstasy, leaving you hanging!<br>\r\nBut just before you could groan with disappointment, Wriggle suddenly jumped on top of you and you felt your throbbing nether-beast go inside her, pumping all that seed meant for that spider-chick inside the firefly chick where it rightfully belonged! Ms. Nightbug gasped and unleashed a light burst of electricity your way, but you were fine. Fine and relieved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa! That was incredible! Koakuma, did you get all that?!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, Patchouli. The battery died a minute ago.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAw, you gotta be kidding me!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell why are we even filming this anyway?! The plan was supposed to be to film Wriggle conceiving her half-breed offspring!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThis'll be for the series' Director's Cut when it's on DVD.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I-I'm s-sorry...\u201d Wriggle snapped out of it and got outrageously nervous, \u201cI-I dont know what came over me!\u201d<br>\r\nYou panted and smiled, \u201cDont apologize. To me, it's just a great excuse to see your cute face again!\u201d As you hoped would h, Ms. Nightbug smiled from your sincere flattery and nuzzled her antennae against your head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDespite being separated for only moments, the human's previous mate filled with grief and possibly envy immediately mounts the human and-\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cEr, Patchouli? The battery's dead. Remember?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cArrrghh!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Yamame quickly falls asleep, both you and Wriggle lied together staring at the stars for a short period of time before you starting feeling tired. You basked in what short time you had until your eyes got heavy. This brief moment gave you a bit of peace in what would otherwise be a stressful life on the run. Youre not sure if firefly youkai mate for life, however. For all you know, you were probably just a fling to fertilize her and sire her offspring if what you suspected from Patchouli's clues was correct. You wouldnt be surprised if she were hiding in a bush somewhere recording the whole damn thing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut regardless, your life on the run is heavy on relationships. Anna might have you move to another hideout later and you'll never see Wriggle again. Now you kinda wish you didnt overdo it. Cuz right after thinking that, your body was more than ready to slip into sleep mode right there on the grass.<br>\r\n\u201cGoodnight, Wriggle,\u201d were your last words before you fell asleep.<br>\r\n\u201cGoodnight, Alex,\u201d you managed to hear her whisper back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral hours passed. You managed to sleep soundly, but woke up feeling groggy and kinda sore, but after the fun from last night, it was expected. You get up with an achy groan and find yourself...</span></div></div>",

But right now, you got certain priorities of your own to attend to. You just came to this mansion and you'd REALLY like to break into it as soon as you can. Youre tired of constantly moving from place to place just to evade certain pursuers. This place feels well protected. Hell, the friendly gate guard helped you feel well protected (VERY well protected!). Besides, you just spent last night helping a cute girl in need as well as fed her uninvited acquaintance's odd little fetish. While Patchouli had obvious ulterior motives for having you date her friend, you didnt regret it a bit (despite still slightly surging!). If she intends to put you through more 'blind dates', you'll gladly volunteer for it! You hope you'll get the opportunity to tap Wriggle's glowing ass again soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou explain to your sis about how you'd prefer to stick around the mansion and break yourself first before going off on another one of Anna's little adventures (you leave out the part about Patchouli's experiment, of course!). She sighs, but understands.<br>\r\n\u201cTell Bill I said hi,\u201d you give one last request before she leaves.<br>\r\n\u201cI will,\u201d she says, \u201clater.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then she left again. You felt a little lonely as soon as she was gone, but you knew you had plenty of companionship within this mansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNi Haooooo!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which, it's not long before you hear a loud super energetic accented shout right behind you that almost made your skeleton leap out of it's shell! You turned around and reached for your gun then realizing the mansion staff already confiscated it before seeing that smiling red-headed Chinese gate guardian from before! Sitting in your bed next to you. You never even seen her come in\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen your heart finally stopped racing, you returned the greeting. \u201cOh\u2026 uh\u2026 hi Meiling.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cShu\u00ec de h\u01ceo ma?\u201d she asks you with a beaming smile.<br>\r\n\u201cI'm\u2026 sorry?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDid you sleep well?\u201d she gladly translated.<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, yeah I did,\u201d you answered, \u201cum\u2026 anyway, how did you get in here? Me and Anna never noticed you come in.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOf course you wouldnt!\u201d Meiling had a bit of pride in her voice, \u201ca nimble warrior like myself moves swiftly with the elements and the environment to avoid detection from mortal eyes, human or elf! You have no idea how many beds I've slept in without being detected by their owners!\u201d Certainly, er, astounding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-speaking of which,\u201d you wanted to change the subject, \u201cis Arnold still watching the gate?\u201d<br>\r\nMeiling nodded, \u201cI was supposed to be over there guarding with him, but he brought a new friend of his to cover for me! 'Ali' I think his name was.\u201d Ali? \u2026not a name youre familiar with. Then again you dont know ALL of Anna's old associates. \u201cIt's SOOO good to finally get a day off! I can finally sleep in without getting stabbed in the face by Sakuya again!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStabbed in the\u2026 face?\u201d it was incredibly disturbing hearing her state that so carefree! \u201cEr, anyway, I hope the uh, mistress isnt upset that Arnold's covering for you again.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cShe thought I could use the day off,\u201d Meiling said still smiling, \u201cxi\u00e8xie sh\u00e0ngd\u00ec! It's SOOO boring standing in front of that gate 18 hours a day just waiting for the extremely unlikely event that SOMEONE could show up to give me a decent challenge!\u201d she whines and pouts, \u201ceven the very tiny few that DO make it this far turn tail and run as soon as I crack my knuckles.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to relate to her dilemma, but the issues you have arent very relatable. Although it did kinda make you fantasize she had a pretty ripped body under her dress which did kinda intrigue you... up until you felt a sharp spark from your crotch! Body still hasnt fully recovered from Wriggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh by the way,\u201d Meiling frowned, \u201cPatchouli told me to tell you she wanted to talk with you.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh?! Ow,\u201d another spark, \u201cw-what did she want?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cTo use you as another experiment and call it a 'blind date'.\u201d You were just about to do a spit take, only to realize you didnt have anything in your mouth!<br>\r\n\u201cY...YOU KNEW ABOUT THAT?!!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cKnew it?\u201d Meiling smirked, \u201cKoakuma burned me a copy of their 'documentary'.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the...documentary?!!\u201d you jumped out of your bed, ignoring the dozens of sparks, \u201cs..s...she filmed me and Wriggle having sex, didnt she?!!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOhhh, m\u00e9i cu\u00f2!\u201d Meiling beamed, \u201cand what a grand job you did of her, too! I never wouldve guessed a gao b\u00edzi like you would be well equipped with a dragon's jiba! I'm surprised you didnt break Wriggle's baoyu when you ravaged it!\u201d Meiling's foreign dirty talk was giving you a migraine. Nonetheless, if what she said was true, you need to have a talk with Patchouli\u2026 THEN you might need to have a talk with Anna if she doesnt straighten up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm sorry about Patchouli,\u201d your bed mate sighed, \u201cthis isnt the first bizarre hobby she had and it certainly wont be the last. Maybe next time, she'll try to hook you up with Kisume to see if you can make bucket-babies! Hahahaha!!\u201d You didnt exactly get the joke, but you gotta give her props for trying to cheer you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, let's forget about her for now,\u201d Meiling finally hopped out of her bed, \u201chow about we go get a drink? I know a nice bar not far from here. ...And unlike Wriggle, MY baoyu doesnt conduct electricity!\u201d Come to think of it, you havent had a good drink in a while\u2026 well, that could be because Anna's forbade you because her clients were TRYING to get you drunk! You could probably use the time to unwind, regardless of the gate guardian's shady motives.<br>\r\nThen again that would mean skipping out on what Patchouli wanted to talk to you about (and what you need to talk to HER about!) and you hate to be rude. Besides... you'd be the biggest liar on the planet if you said you didnt enjoy your time with Wriggle and Yamame. What should you do?</span></div></div>",

Anna didn't know for moment until she remembered an artifact that she had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Isn't this the legendary holy grail?\" Anna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Anastasia nodded and explained she took it for greater purposes.

Anna, that's crazy talk!\" Billy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hmph, if what I'm correct, The grail can grant any wish the owner desire.\" Anna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Anastasia gave the grail to Anna than she spoke one word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I wish for the death of Maeve.\" Anna said.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n The grail emitted light and once faded, Anna smile and looked at her colleagues. Billy had some bad feeling about this, but didn't say anything as Anna told them to move to different area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Back in the village, you got to the bar with meiling and you two went in.

It was way way WAY too much alcohol to be consuming this early in the day especially without a designated driver to take you home, but hey, after all the crap you went through, never hurts to spoil yourself once in a while, huh?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeiling, however, as soon as she heard the word 'rum' leave your lips, let out the biggest condescending tsk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rum?\" she said with disgust in her voice, \"rum? Youre just getting rum?\"<br>\r\n\"Er, yeah?\" you said with a raised eyebrow, completely oblivious to the joke.<br>\r\nThe chinese dragoness gatekeeper just rolled her eyes and exhaled, \"Alright. Shameful, but alright.\" SHAMEFUL?<br>\r\n\"Wait, what's that supposed to mean?\" you got suspicious.<br>\r\n\"Of all the strong, incredible, potent, knock you to the floor seeing stars alcohols this magnificent bar has to offer, you go for RUM?\" Meiling questions your tastes in alcohol, \"RUM is incredibly low class weaksauce! It's made for naozhongs with bad stomachs, yang guizis that cant read or write, and female gao bizis that are going through pregnancy!\" You couldnt help but feel offended though you didnt understand the chinese nouns she spouted (and if you did, you'd be MORE offended!).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, rum isnt 'weaksauce'!\" you stated, \"it's alcohol content is incredibly high!\"<br>\r\nMeiling laughed, \"Ha ha ha ha! Oh, no. No no no. Rum is nothing, NOTHING compared to Baiju! Baiju DESTROYS weaklings.\" And you assumed that huge ass bottle in a burlap sack with kanji stamped on it that she ordered was this Baiju she's talking about. And just as soon as she uncorked the bottle, the burning alcoholic stench hit your nose!<br>\r\nYou had to flinch away on instinct cuz the burning smell was too harsh on you! Meiling took a nice whiff of it like it didnt bother, then ignored the glass and took a swig right from the bottle!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAH!!!\" she sighed, \"THIS will bring out the grand dragon of any lower life form! Wanna try?\"<br>\r\n\"N-n-no thanks!\" you shake your head as you casually sip your infinitely less unbearable rum! You had to cover your nose most of the time you were drinking cuz the stench of the baiju lingered. How anyone ANYONE in their right mind could possible tolerate such a strong concentration of alcohol is the million dollar question! Then again, you did know of a few junkies who would literally drink gasoline to get their unquenchable alcohol fix! Then again again, youre awful sure they didnt live very long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot much passed during the time you two were drinking your drinks, but because of how awful the smell from Meiling's Baiju was to you, it may as well have been hours. You had to quickly come up with something to talk about just to get her to stop drinking it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So..\" you took a deep breath, being careful not to breath in the toxic alcohol fumes, and quickly think of a subject to talk about, \"...do you have a boyfriend?\" Out of ALL the things you could talk about, you chose THAT?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finally stopped drinking, recorked her bottle (thankfully sealing in the toxic fumes) and frowned, \"Bu... never really had much free time to look for one anyway, what with guarding a gate for so long. And if I'm caught so much as chatting with somebody for what Sakuya believes is too long, I get one of her fucking knives in my forehead!\" YIKES!<br>\r\n\"Aw, geez, I'm sorry!\" you regretted getting on this subject, but have no choice to continue it, \"getting stabbed just for talking to somebody too long? That's a little excessive!\"<br>\r\nBut she shrugs her shoulders, \"Eh, it doesnt bother me. Sakuya fights like a little shabi, anyways. I only take her stabs cuz I feel sorry for her and I dont wanna get in trouble with the mistress. Otherwise, I'd break her neck with a single round-house kick. ...ERRP!! Please dont tell her I said any of that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wont,\" you say with gritted teeth, \"I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what about you?\" she turned the conversation back to you, \"besides that bug who's baoyu you popped, do you have a nuuyio? Or a naanyio?\"<br>\r\nYou shake your head, \"Having had time for a relationship what with having to constantly be on the run. I was close to a few girls in my life, but my sister had a tendency to scare them off before anything major could happen.\"<br>\r\n\"Aww... was Anna jelly?\" Meiling snickered. You blushed. For particular reasons, you didnt wanna answer that question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, while I was at Eientei, there was this one bunny girl that got a bit clingy,\" you finally build the nerve to bring up Reisen, \"suffice to say, Anna didnt approve of her, then stuff happened, then the next thing we knew, we ended up moving over to your mansion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A wise move,\" Meiling stated, \"lunarian moon rabbits are dirty.\"<br>\r\nYou almost did a spit take from hearing such a statement, but you harshly swallowed down that sip of rum and questioned, \"What do you mean dirty?\"<br>\r\n\"Dirty as in theyre sick,\" she then pointed downwards (toward her crotch) and emphasizing, \"SICK.\"<br>\r\nYou squinted your eyes, \"...Are you saying they got... diseases?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm saying they got every known discovered disease you can fit in a tight little baoyu!\" she laid it on THICK, \"if you actually mated with one, you might as well cut off your jiba as soon as possible!\" Talk about tactless! That's incredibly fowl of her saying such things about Reisen and her fellow girls!<br>\r\n\"N-no, I dont believe that!\"<br>\r\n\"You can believe what you want, gao bizi,\" she states, \"but the truth is there is nothing filthier on the planet than a moon rabbit! Even onis are a million times cleaner than those disgusting filthy mammals! And onis... heh... you'll more often see a full Red moon than you'll ever see an oni actually bathing! You can smell one of those nasty flea-ridden trash heaps coming from a mile away!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TAKE THAT BACK!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUh oh. Someone overheard Meiling's ranting. You quickly jerked your head over to the angry pink-haired woman with chinese-style buns in her hair, a white and green dress with a long brown front panel over it that depicts a long thorny rose motiff! She clenched her fist despite that whole arm was bandaged up and glared your direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TAKE. THAT. BACK!\" she demanded of your partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nihao Kasen!\" Meiling smiled her way, \"I didnt smell you over there. Must be my bad sinuses acting up again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take it back, you slovenly disgusting serpent!\" Kasen ordered, \"I'll have you know, I have MANY oni friends and they happen to some of the cleanest youkai around! Theyre also more competent in their jobs... unlike certain glorified lizards that tend to hibernate on days that ends with 'y'!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBloody hell, Meiling got up from her seat and looked her direction, \"I'm very sorry, Kasen.\" she snuck her finger in her ear and cleaned it out, \"for a moment there, I almost heard you claim that dragons are lazy.\"<br>\r\n\"Nice to see that foul smelling drink of yours didnt impair your hearing like it impairs your brain cells!\" Kasen remarks. OH SHIT, THE BAR GOT AWFUL QUIET!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeiling cracked a smirk. Not a happy smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kasen, let's just go,\" Kasen's oni friend tried to stop the inevitable train wreck, but Kasen didnt wanna stop.<br>\r\n\"Absolutely not, Suika,\" she stands her ground, \"not while this awful serpent insults the honor of us... I mean you onis!\"<br>\r\n\"You should listen to Suika, Kasen,\" Meiling warned, \"HER family didnt completely inbreed the common sense out of them!\"<br>\r\n\"THAT'S SOME TALK COMING FROM YOU!!\" the angry not-oni shouted, \"considering YOUR kind HAS to rely on incest since nobody ELSE wants to fuck them!\" Ouch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeiling cracked her shoulders then her knuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kasen, please!\" Suika begged her friend to stop, \"cant we just drink somewhere else?\"<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Kasen cracked her knuckles and assumed a martial arts stance. Meiling assumed a kung fu stance of her own. Quite a lot of the sober(esque) patrons rushed out of the door!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUm... dont just stand there! DO SOMETHING!</span></div></div>",

I don\u2019t want violence in here!\u201d You spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Both meiling and kasen were silent while you felt the tension, then meiling sighed and turned her attention to kasen with little cocky smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou better thank Alex for this, kasen.\u201d Meiling spoke, \u201cAlex, let\u2019s go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bowed, apologizing to kasen for the ruckus and as meiling paid for the drink, you two got out and saw a mid long black haired female in blue kimono and red coat. You immediately noticed her pointy elven ears as her red/blue heterochromian eyes looked at you, she came to you two and observed you. You wondered why she was looking at you until meiling spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou need something?\u201d Meiling asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe female ignored her and spoke to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cYou...you are the client to my sister.\u201d Female spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWha-who are you?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She backed off and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI am shiki, half-elf and a half-sister to Anna, your sister.\u201d She replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You were surprised to hear that as Anna never told you about her family. You wondered for moment then meiling cut off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cDon\u2019t ignor me, you little punk. I can fly you high with my fist.\u201d Meiling threatened her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u201cOh?

She attacks more and shiki dodged more then sheik took out a knife from her back and swiftly moved her arm. You didn\u2019t see clearly until you noticed meiling breathing heavily. You came next to her and you suddenly realized that there were a very light cut mark on her throat. You realized she was going to kill her by cutthroat technique then she put her knife away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cIs Anna still with you?\u201d Shiki asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cYes, she is.\u201d You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cPlease guide me there.

You two followed meiling as She slowly recuperate, it took at least 30 minutes back to the mansion. As you all reached the destination you two bid farewell and went in. As you two got in and walked through the hallway, you saw the familiar elven sister before you two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cAnna.\u201d You spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shiki walked and came before her sister, and silence stood then..</span></div></div>",

You turned around and noticed that inside were getting more crazy due to meiling fighting kasen. You sweated then you felt the female grabbing your arm and dashed away. You didn\u2019t know why she was doing this as her grip was strong, she continued to pull you to different area then you two stopped at the certain house and she let you go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWho are you?

You were aware that she was elf, but you weren\u2019t aware about her back ground. Just then, shiki came back with tea, giving a cup to you and then went to Jeanne and sat down.

Youre normally not a big drinker...aw, who are you kidding? After the shit you go through on a regular basis, it's amazing you havent become a complete and total boozehound by now! And after getting suckered into sticking your dick into a youkai with a high-voltage vagina as a silly research project, you believe you've earned the right to be plastered!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got any vodka?\" you asked the barman. Meiling immediately turned her head to you with added interest.<br>\r\n\"Only the finest! Ripped straight from the Tsar's private stash!\" he bragged, \"and what about you, Meiling? The usual?\"<br>\r\n\"Mmhmm,\" the incredibly cheerful dragon youkai nodded.<br>\r\n\"Baiju it is!\" the barman went to his collection to get the drinks. As he took his time getting your drinks ready, your drinking partner clapped her hands in salute!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W\u01d2 c\u00e0o!\" she exclaimed with astonishment, \"check out the balls on this gao b\u00edzi! You can really handle a drink like that?\"<br>\r\n\"I've had it a couple of times,\" you tell her, \"usually one of my sister's clients from Russia makes me drink with her when we visit her in St. Petersburg.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" Meiling raised an eyebrow and smirked, \"so I'm not the only girl that tried to get you drunk?\"<br>\r\nYou smirked back (though a little forced), \"Heheh... she did a lot more than try to get me drunk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after, the barman  brought over your drinks. He  got a rather big bottle of authentic imported Tsardom Vodka for you (seriously, it even had the official Empire insignia and seal of approval) and a rather tiny bottle tied in a little burlap sack for Meiling. Baiju, you assume. Meiling bowed in gratitude and handed the barman her credit card to who bowed in gratitude in return and went off to slide her card and give her the receipt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she twisted her little Baiju bottle open, the strong harsh smell of alcohol stung your nostrils and nearly filled the entire room, causing the customers around her to flinch and cringe! Despite clearing parts of your sinuses that you never even knew you had, you pay it no mind and ready the shot glass. You pour a little vodka into the glass as Meiling takes her drink from the tap and both of you take a quick swig and slamming the glass on the table with a hard sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurned like a Chinese firecracker going down. And that's not a sexual euphemism, by the way! But all that alcohol's gonna ease that pain as well as other pains you were experiencing real fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cToo warm,\u201d Meiling groaned in disappointment, \u201cI keep telling them to cool it first. They never listen.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cToo bad,\u201d you slur before taking another shot of your vodka. Yours felt like it came right out of the freezer and it STILL burned going down! Meiling took another long sip of her Baiju and you couldnt imagine what kind of damage it's doing to her throat! Then again, she most likely breathes fire\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you drunk yet?\u201d she casually asks you right after slamming her bottle on the table. You moved your hand in front of your face and try to remember what you did last night. Definitely remember doing a firefly youkai doggy-style while being electrocuted by her vagina!<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I'm still pretty sober,\u201d you answer, \u201cwhat about you? Are you drunk?\u201d<br>\r\nMeiling frowned and curled her lip, \u201cNo. I still only see ONE strapping gao bizi in front of me.\u201d You'd be flattered, but something was telling you that nickname was not flattering.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it's not really a bad thing,\u201d you say, \u201cI dont like feeling sick or throwing up or waking up with a really bad hangover.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDitto on the first two,\u201d Meiling agreed,\u201dbut the hangover is not really that much of a problem for me.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt isnt?\u201d<br>\r\nShe shook her head, \u201cIt must be thanks to the numerous stabs in the forehead I've gotten from Sakuya for sleeping on the job so much.\u201d Yikes!<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026 well, I dont notice any scars,\u201d you state.<br>\r\n\u201cScarlet Devil Mansion has very good medicine,\u201d Meiling says, \u201cnot that a dragon youkai even needs much medicine to heal simple cuts and scrapes, anyways.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat's good news,\u201d you answered, \u201cmy sister has a huge tendency of getting herself hurt. She's gonna NEED that medicine!\u201d Of course, you'd have plenty of medicine had you still stayed in Eientei\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wouldnt worry about her. Snow elves could shrug off getting a limb chopped off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately spit out your vodka!<br>\r\n\u201cH-How'd you know she's a snow elf?!\u201d you question, astonished by her perception.<br>\r\n\u201cI recognize the tribal tattoos on her arms,\u201d she answered, \u201cwe used to have several temporary workers who were snow elves and they all had those similar designs on their body. Not to mention each one was a total biyan to deal with!\u201d No argument there. Just as long as none of those fairies working at the mansion are any of Maeve's snow elves\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, before you could ask her what else she knows about 'snow elves' before you finally get drunk, Meiling immediately jerks her head toward the door as someone enters. She exhales hard as a person, possibly someone she knows personally, walks into the bar.<br>\r\nCuriously, you turn your head as well to see and in walks...</span></div></div>",

A bit less blurry, you start to make out a familiar flesh-colored figure below the fire-red hair.

Not even the green hat above the fire-red hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the blur finally subsides, your vision clear and you see that is indeed Meiling. Just naked. ...NAKED?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn away with embarrassment as you hear her approaching you, whistling. Judging by the wet and steamy atmosphere around her, she mustve just gotten out of the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! You finally woke up!\" you force yourself to look back at her smiling face, daring not to look down at her breasts barely 'censored' by her braids or below her scratched and bruised yet well defined washboard stomach, \"the shower's yours if you wanna wash up. Let me know if you need someone to wash your back.\"<br>\r\nTrying to find a way to diminish the blemish on your face, you turn your attention to the hotel room you found yourself in.

HUSBAND?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWh...wh...when did I tell you this?!\u201d you questioned.<br>\r\n\u201cRight after you lost the drinking challenge with Yuugi,\u201d she answered.<br>\r\n\u201cW-w-wait! I dont remember that!\u201d  you stated honestly, \u201cI was drunk!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, yeah, you'd HAVE to be to challenge Yuugi of all onis!\u201d Meiling laughed, \u201cnow hurry up and get ready! The first thing mama is gonna ask is where my zhangfu is!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBut\u2026 I\u2026 ungg...\u201d this was going to fast for you. You knew you shouldnt gone drinking! You KNEW you were gonna get yourself in trouble and you wouldnt realize it until the hangover kicks in!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC'mon! She'll be here in any minute! Hurry!\u201d Meiling wasnt willing to wait!<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I dont even know where my clothes are!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat's fine! She'll just think she walked in on us trying to make a baby!\u201d yep, she honestly suggested that.<br>\r\n\u201cSeriously, I'm sorry, but I'm not sure this is gonna work. If my sis finds out, she's gonna flip.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, I really REALLY need this!\u201d Meiling tells you, \u201cmama's been getting really impatient with me over the fact that I'm the ONLY one of her 20 daughters that doesnt have a zhangfu! 'Meiling, how come you dont have a zhangfu?' 'Meiling, why are you STILL the only girl that didnt give me grandchildren?' 'Meiling, even your baby sister Fanren found a zhangfu before you!' 'Meiling, you know youre not gonna stay young and beautiful forever.' And so on and so on! Urgghh!! Does she not realize how hard it is to find a mate when youre busy guardian a mansion by your lonesome 24 hours a day?!\u201d<br>\r\nOy\u2026 if you didnt already have a migraine, THIS would be migraine-inducing. You'd like to relate to her mother-child dillemma, but unfortunately YOUR mom died of leukemia. And if she was alive, she certainly wouldnt approve of the particular girls you've been getting close with lately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC'mon, Alex! It's only for one day!\u201d she pleads, \u201cthen the next time, I'll just tell her we broke up. I wont ask you to do this again! Qing!!\u201d This is a ridiculous request. Then again, it's nowhere near as ridiculous as that request in the form of a blind date with Wriggle that led to the best electrifying sex you've ever had.<br>\r\nNevertheless, things wont be better for you if you let everybody walk all over you and keep folding over to all this silly requests all the time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime's a wasting. What should you do?</span></div></div>",

You sighed and agreed to be her pretend husband. Meiling squealed in delight as you found your cloth, you quickly put cloth on until you and meiling heared the door knock. You offered to get the door and went toward it, and opened the door, revealing a tall red head female that were just like meiling...but bustier and had abs on her belly. Her green eyes gazed as you shivered little, your sweat poured down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Um...are you...meilings mother?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Shi, I'm Hong Meifang...and you're...?\" Female responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Just then, meiling jumped behind you and higged you with smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ni hao mom! He's Alex, my zheifang!\" Meiling spoke delightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The dragon mother looked at you with cold eyes. You felt that she'll kill you as you heard that dragons were proud race and will not accept anyone who were below them. You quivered then suddenly you saw the mother smile and hugged you as well! Her breasts were very squishy and soft, making you feel melting while meiling a boobs were on your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"This is great!! My girl is finally gotten herself a great husband!\" Meifang spoke with smile, \"tell me young man, how old are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'm..23\" you responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I see, still a pup. Let's go in and have a chat!\" Meifang said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She came in and shit the door, then something materialize. It was a blond haired  male and had a cowboy suit and hat. It was Billy Tenship, you old pal who sometime acted as a double agent for Anna. He dialed up the phone and it rung for moment and it picked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Anna, it's me.\" Billy whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What's the update?\" Voice spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Your brother now with the guard and her mother..\" Billy spoke, \"they might do something bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n There were silence for moment and then the voice spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I've got little plan..let that little friend interfere.\" Voice spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"As you wish.\" Billy replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n With that they cut the phone and Billy walked off with other call. Back in the room, you were nervous about the two as the two big Chester oriental female were before you. You wondered what the mother would say as she took the tea meiling offered, then the mother spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"So tell me me.whitestone, how long have you been with my daughter?\" Meifang askrd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Few days.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Meifang snickered as the two dragons chatted with you, you wondered what would Anne say and do if she finds out what you just got into. You had the idea that not only she'll torture meiling, she'll massacre all of the scarlet manor for allowing this to happen. You shivered little more then both meiling and Meifang noticed you and smiled. You noticed meiling getting close then suddenly pushed you on the bed lightly. You felt light as you wondered what she's doing then you saw her and her moth undress and came on you with smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Um...meiling? Mrs.Hong?\" You spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Let's create a bigger family together.\" Meiling spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Before you could say anything, you hear the door slam open.

Speaking of which, your eyes lingered on too strongly at her new outfit... or rather new UNIFORM. Heavily padded camo-military uniform, that is! Dog-tags, rank and unknown nation's flag shoulder patches, and black garb with a golden crescent moon imprinted on it covering her mouth. And that was a very realistic looking modified AR-15 she was wielding! She wasnt just dressed to kill, she was dressed to INVADE! And speaking of invade...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ON THE GROUND!! NOW!!\" she immediately bum rushed you and pinned you to the ground, \"HANDS WHERE I CAN SEE THEM!\" pointing her gun at you as you did exactly as you were told. Meiling and Meifang stared absolutely shocked and confused at what was going on!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-W...What is the meaning of this?!\" Meifang questioned the soldier currently patting you down, despite not wearing much to pat down to begin with!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lunarian Revolutionary Guard business, ma'am! Dont get too close!\" Reisen ordered, \"this fugitive is armed and extremely dangerous! You ladies are lucky to be alive after hanging around someone as vicious as this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F-F-fugitive?\" Meiling's mom squinted her eyes at the word, then turned to her daughter who looked completely clueless.<br>\r\n\"Alexei Whitesobromavich,\" Reisen explained as she restrained you and covered your mouth, slurring your protests, \"infamous for preying on young adult women and single mothers in bars and slaughtering them, selling their severed limbs and organs in black markets.\"<br>\r\n'The FUCK?!' you wanted to blurt out but had no ability to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MEILING, you were honestly going to make HIM your zhangfu?!\" Meiling's mother was just as shocked to hear the awful news!<br>\r\n\"W...I....B...But...\" poor Meiling was not prepared for such a realization, \"...but well... he's staying with... I mean but his sister... err...\"<br>\r\n\"I'm very sorry that you two were nearly victims of this disgusting trash!\" Reisen pulled you up and twisted your arms to cuff you so you couldnt move and dragged you toward the door, \"now if you'll excuse us, Mr. Whitsobromavich has a date with the LRG Warden and the electric chair! START MOVING!!\" Somehow Meiling didnt question Reisen's obvious exaggerations that simply didnt add up. Instead, she was too busy being on the receiving end of a roaring fit in Chinese from her mother, completely outraged that her daughter was about to marry Jack the Ripper!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Reisen, why are you-\"<br>\r\n\"SHH!!\" she shushed you as she 'escorted' you all the way out of the hotel as well as a couple of blocks away as local bystanders looked your direction! It was a very appropriate time to realize you left your clothes back in the hotel room! So the bunny girl in military uniform paraded your nearly naked body across the crowded street until the two of you reached a little park void of any onlookers where she finally let you go and uncuffed you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heheh! Wow, Kasen was right!\" Reisen giggled, \"Dragons are STUPID!\" After that little fun ride, you were in no mood to laugh. You rubbed your aching wrists and stared over at Reisen as she removed her garb and smiled at you.<br>\r\n\"Hi Alex-sama!\" she greeted you with such uppity gusto. You certainly missed her despite her uh, issues, but now wasnt a good time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reisen, what are you doing here?\" you got straight to the point, \"you know if my sister finds out what you did, she'll flip!\"<br>\r\n\"What I did?!\" she snapped, \"SHE left you to fend for yourself against a violent kungfu-crazy lush and all her drunken friends... AND her horny cradle-robbing hag of a mother!\" To be fair, Meifang was anything but a hag... that milf's youthful chiseled yet very womanly figure left quite an impression on you. Not hard to see where Meiling got her best features from!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Still!\" you try to cover... yourself, \"she moved us out of Eientei for a reason! You know youre gonna be in huge trouble when anyone finds out.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I know,\u201d Reisen's bunny ears lowered as did her head, \u201cbut after what we all just went through back when you were with us, it's not fair for Anna to just pull you out. There's just so many unanswered questions and\u2026 and surely, the help you were getting was certainly better than the kind youre getting NOW.\u201d As a matter of fact, you dont really feel any safer at Scarlet Mansion. Surrounded by vampires, fairies of questionable origin, a dragon that might have an overactive libido like Reisen only she likes to drink and fight, a librarian that wants to breed you with creatures you probably shouldnt be breeding with\u2026 you cant say THAT'S better than a hospital with a snobby princess, an immortal smoker that fights with her for some reason, the world's best doctor, and a ton of cute bunny girls!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell...H-how were you were able to find me, anyway?\"<br>\r\n\"Your sister's not the only one with 'special connections',\" Reisen said with a clever wink. Damnit, HER too?! You sighed hard. You didnt have time for this. You were supposed to get AWAY from this type of criminal lifestyle! God help you if SHE ended up dragging you into something deep, too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem!\" Reisen cleared her throat for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arent you gonna comment about my uniform?\" she twirled around, showing off her camo suit, \"what do you think? Hard to believe someone as cute as me is a solid fierce combat-hardened leatherneck?\"<br>\r\n\"Wow, it looks very authentic,\" you admire her uniform, \"it's real?\"<br>\r\n\"Yep!\" she stated proudly, \"1st class Revolutionary Guard AND Reconnaissance Sergeant of the Udongein-Inaba branch of the Moon Rabbit Corps. Sigh... havent worn this in uniform in years and it STILL fits me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm really happy for you,\u201d you smiled irritated, \u201cnow if only I had much to cover ME to begin with!\u201d<br>\r\nThe bunny girl in military uniform laughed nervously, \u201cHeh. Sorry, Alex-sama. I had to make your capture look convincing. It doesnt make sense I let a wanted fugitive go just to give him free time to put his clothes back on.\u201d Point taken. \u201cBesides\u2026 you certainly have nothing to be ashamed of.\u201d Aw geez, why are you such a huge sucker for flattery from a cute girl (well, cute female veteran)?! This is how youre easily taken advantage of!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA-A-anyways, we can talk about this later!\u201d you quickly change the discussion \u201cis there a clothing store nearby?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe later,\u201d the bunny girl states, \u201cright now, there are some friends I need you to meet.\u201d<br>\r\nYou cringed at the statement, \u201c...Your 'special connections', right? Sorry Reisen, I think it's better I just go back to my sister and-\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOne of my connections told me to mention that the bite mark from Pacifica's goddamn dog still hasnt gone away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took merely seconds to process what she's referring to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBILLY?!!\u201d you nearly jumped upon realizing it, \u201cBilly Tenship?! You know him?!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell, not really,\u201d she admits, \u201cbut he says he knows you.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI havent seen him in like forever!\u201d you briefly reminisce, \u201cI thought he mighta got himself killed. How's he doing? What's he up to?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell, besides getting dog bites,\u201d Reisen snickered, \u201che's been working with somebody who says he's really close to you as well.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWho?\u201d<br>\r\nShe lowered her head, \u201cI'm sorry, Alex-sama. Billy wouldnt tell me cuz he was told not to tell you.\u201d Nghh. \u201cWell, maybe he can talk to you about it. He's not that far from here, c'mon. Let's go.\u201d As if it's gonna be that simple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReisen, I cant do that,\u201d you stop her, \u201cI'm already with somebody. My sister.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut Alex-sama,\u201d she whines, \u201cshe's just gonna keep getting you into trouble.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAHEM!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOk ok! MAYBE I'm not exactly one to talk,\u201d she puffs her cheeks, \u201cbut if you found out what I found out about her, you wouldnt be so loyal to her, trust me.\u201d That struck a nerve.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat's THAT supposed to mean?!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI mean she hasnt been very honest with you,\u201d Reisen warns, \u201cyou have no idea the game she's playing with you!\u201d<br>\r\nYou squint your eyes, \u201cCare to enlighten me?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBilly will tell you when you see him again!\u201d she grabs your hand, \u201cNow c'mon!

Reisen told you that you\u2019ll soon meet Billy and a a wise man, and you two got in. As you two walked, you noticed some Chinese pottery and fine paintings.

I am the reincarnation of Zhuge Kongming, or Zhuge Liang.\u201dHe said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You hardly know anything about the Chinese history and as you just got out of meiling a grips and then turned to Billy to know about Anna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cTell me Billy.

Once you\u2019ve got it, you saw a disturbing I mange of Anna in her knightly robe...in jet blackish-purple color, weird vein looking line in the armor and had a sword that was pure black with red lines on it. You noticed her skin tone was pale, and her eyes were dead, and you turned to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cThat is the direct result of niphilims action on her, as a host of Angra Mainyu.\u201d Billy spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cAngra..Mainyu?\u201d You spokes<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nods, \u201cAngra Mainyu, the angry spirits thirsts for destruction.

She asked some questions but told you to come in so all the eientei crew could catch up on the details and you all went in. At the scarlet manor, Anna was standing before the vampire herself. Remilia was little bit angry at Anna for not keeping you under control but more angry at meiling for nearly raping you and the moon rabbit for kidnapping you. Anna, who were in the minds, felt very emotional for being relieved from the duty she was so used to doing, narrower her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n (I know what I\u2019ve said and done, but how dare he relieve me.) Anna thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMs.Whitestone, I apologize for what our gatekeeper have done, but you should be ashamed for not looking out for your brother.\u201d Remilia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201c..yes, I truly apologize for the incident.\u201d Anna replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cOneesama! Anna didn\u2019t do on purpose! She\u2019s nice and humble to act against us!\u201d Flandre said, \u201cin fact, that rabbit is the one who kidnapped her precious oniisama!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n They all were silent until one of the Hassan appeared behind Anna. She spoke quietly next to Anna and backed off. Anna sighed and looked at the vampire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy lady, my..brother is now at eientei. I would like to retrieve him back.\u201d Anna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cDespite the rabbits intention to keep him there?\u201d Remilia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI have a plan. Please give three days grace and I can get him back.\u201d Anna responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Remilia noticed the graces and remembered that the red full moon was on the third day. She thought for moment and then gleefully showed her teeth\u2019s. Anna was waiting for the answer and then Remilia called for her maid and she appeared next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSakuya, we will have a meeting with the eientei in full moon. When that comes, gather everyone and we will go there.\u201d Remilia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cYes, mylady.\u201d Sakuya replied, then disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Anna thanked Remilia and bowed, returning to her room. Back in eientei, you and the others talked for at least an whole hour then after that you asked eirin if you could rest. She nodded and gave you the old room and you left the scene until you noticed Reisen was following you. You wondered why she was following you then once you arrived at the room, she lightly grabbed your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cUm...Reisen?\u201d You spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cAlex sama..I...I missed you a lot.\u201d Reisen said, \u201cmissed you so bad I could not bear being alone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI..see.\u201d You replied, \u201cwe can be together now you know?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Reisen smiled and once you got in,Reisen grabbed you and gently pushed you to the ground. You noticed that she wasn\u2019t wearing panty, revealing her vagina before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cDid you know that rabbit dies from loneliness, Alex sama?\u201d Reisen asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cO-oh, really.\u201d You spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She nodded and she was looking at you with her red eyes chantly at you. You felt Reisen unzipping your pants and starting to fiddle with your manhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cPlease Alex sama..let us have a little reunion..\u201d Reisen spoke softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201c...ok..\u201d You spoke softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Reisen then stick your phallus into her vagina and started to have sex, and it lasted...</span></div></div>",

You lost of the number of times you blew your load inside the bunny girl's insatiable snatch. It was mind-perplexing enough trying to count down the number of sex positions the two of you engaged in during that 2 hour fun ride! Suffice to say, Reisen was incredibly energetic!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so were you, surprisingly. Your hips somehow didnt give out after the umpteenth down you were riding Reisen doggy-style, thrusting as fast and fierce as you could, immersing yourself in her long pleasure-filled moans, imagining her ahegao face she was making that you couldnt see in your position!<br>\r\n\"Ohhhh....aahhh..ahha...AAAAHHHH!!!\" she let out a long gasp the moment she felt your tool spill it's life-giving seed inside her yet again, \"...aaahhh-*BZZZZZZTTT!!*HEEEEEEEEEE!!!!\" as well as squeal and twitch from the intense electrical surge your dick gave off yet again cuz it STILL hasnt fully recovered from firefly-youkai sex!<br>\r\nIt was awful difficult explaining that whole event after the first surprise orgasmic jolt! Understandably, she was kinda terrified at first (and mad, cuz some random firefly youkai beat her to you!)... but now she's practically ADDICTED to it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the two of you collapsed on the bed panting and gasping.<br>\r\n\u201cA\u2026.a\u2026.awesome...\u201d Reisen panted, \u201c...I dont think I'll EVER get tired of that tingly surge! We really oughta bring Wriggle in for a threesome some time!\u201d Tempting. Would hurt like hell, but tempting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk! I'm all rested up!\u201d Reisen yet again leaps up out of bed with a second wind, \u201clet's go again!\u201d But the feeling wasnt mutual. That last burst finally took it's toll on you.<br>\r\n\u201cUgh\u2026 sorry, I'm\u2026 out of it...\u201d you groaned.<br>\r\n\u201cC'mon! I'm still not tired yet!\u201d the overly energetic bunny girl whines.<br>\r\n\u201cI dont even think\u2026  I can get up any time soon...\u201d you mutter, failing to muster the courage to lift yourself up!<br>\r\nReisen pouted with disappointment, \u201cOh alright. I guess I shouldnt push you too hard. You did have quite a rough journey after all.\u201d That's right. Rough and bumpy. And a bit hard to swallow. And developing a whole new perspective on who you thought was truly looking out for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter wiping off your mess on her, she quickly put her clothes back on and gave you a nice goodbye.<br>\r\n\u201cIf youre ready to finish where we left off, you know where my room is!\u201d she said with a wink then gave you a sweet kiss on the cheek! \u201cWelcome back, Alex-sama.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then turned around and trotted off happily.<br>\r\n*Bzzt!*<br>\r\n\u201cEEEEeee!!\u201d<br>\r\n...And suddenly felt another jolt out of nowhere! After she finally stops twitching, she sighs, \u201cOh.. so good...\u201d and resumes her leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFast forward a couple of days. Not wanting to be a freeloader, you find yourself working at the pharmacy of Eientei mainly handling stock or manning the front assisting customers. It wasnt a difficult job. It did require washing your hands an awful lot what with handling godknowswhat kind of chemicals and dealing with customers suffering from godknowswhat kind of diseases! But besides that, it's not bad. Eirin tells you to get her something, you get it. Tewi tells you to help her move something, you move it. Reisen tells you she needs to have a private word with you in the broom closet, Eirin gives her the cold stare, Reisen flinches and runs off. Easy peasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least it WAS easy, until one night you were closing up the pharmacy by yourself while your coworkers were off doing their own thing. You had already locked the door, shut off the sign lights, and were getting ready to put several boxes in their designated drawers, when somebody knocked on the front door. At first you ignored it, cuz you hoped they'd figure out that youre closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNope. The person outside only pounded the door even harder. You waited them out a little longer, but the pounding still wouldnt stop. Whoever was outside mustve had a big emergency!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith nobody else around to answer the door and tell them to come back tomorrow, you sighed and head over yourself to do just that.<br>\r\nYou unlocked the door and open it, revealing\u2026.</span></div></div>",

You paled staring down the dark abyss beyond the uvula and wet slimy tongue as your face was pressing way too close to a set of pearly white sharp bone-crushing fangs! You gasped and flinched backwards away from the jaws... and found yourself staring down at Meiling's oni friend from earlier, Yuugi... who is snoring rather loudly with her mouth open. And you are currently lying right on top of her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's also naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so are you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's also white stuff dripping from her crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's also white stuff dripping from YOUR crotch, too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gazed downward silently and speechless. You grit your teeth and curse yourself for the grand taboo you have committed as your blood ran cold! Worst of all, you cant remember a damn thing after that drinking contest but youre now absolutely sure you've done things you really shouldnt have done!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the very least, the adrenaline rush was doing a great job countering the pain of the hangover. Still, that doesnt excuse the fact that you just screwed a complete stranger during your intoxicated episode! Especially a really big bulky muscley no doubt super strong oni stranger! God help you if she ends up being pregnant! God also help you if she wakes up and doesnt remember getting plowed by you\u2026 and becomes furious from it!<br>\r\nBeing very quiet and very careful, you quietly and carefully dismount yourself from her, trying ever so hard not to wake her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZzZZ!!\u201d Yuugi flinches and you almost leap out of your skin! Fortunately, instead of waking up, she merely rolls over in her sleep\u2026 and you notice white stuff dripping from between her toned yet exquisitely plump ass cheeks!<br>\r\n\u201cUgh\u2026 seriously?!\u201d you whisper to yourself and facepalm with embarrassment.  Yeesh, how much did you drink?! You would never in a million years go that route!  Well, that's gonna be a hell of a situation when she wakes up.<br>\r\nAnd you do not wanna be here when she does! You look around for your clothes in the middle of this dark damp humid shack you dont recognize. You spot your clothes in the corner of the room\u2026 or what's left of them. Theyre tattered and ripped now! Guess you shoulda expected that from sleeping with an oni.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving no position to complain, you put on what's left of your clothes which doesnt really cover much and sneak out of the little damp shack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have no idea where you are. You dont recognize this part of town if youre still in the same town to begin with. All the houses and buildings are closed, boarded up, or dilapidated. Majority of this shoddy town looked like it's been abandoned for years. The very few locals still around did not look friendly nor did they look like anything remotely close to your kind! Judging by the horns, the sharp teeth,  and the stench of raw meat and strong alcohol coming from the lot of them, you assumed theyre all oni.<br>\r\n\u201cThis is seriously the last time I let myself get drunk,\u201d you tell yourself, \u201cfor real! From now on, no more alcohol for me!\u201d Youre probably gonna celebrate by getting pissed drunk if you make it out of here alive!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou carefully stroll down the destroyed street nearly naked trying not to give any direct eye contact to any grizzly looking locals. Damned if you know how youre getting home. Meiling was nowhere in sight and Yuugi\u2026 well, you'd rather not stick around to explain why both her holes feel incredibly sticky!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try your hardest to clear your head and remember how you gotten yourself here, but the furthest you remember through your drunken stupor was that odd dream involving that woman who bares a resemblance to your sister. Now you have some questions to ask Anna, but that's provided you can even make it back first!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd follow the street signs, but not only are they in another language, theyre either worn out or graffitied which obscenities or crude drawings.<br>\r\nYou cringe as you spot the very few humans in this slum of a town\u2026 being caged up and dragged off by onis! Not good!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemaining in the shadows and not getting any attention from anyone is a brilliant move on your part. Lord only does what these oni bastards are gonna do their human captives. Judging by the numerous screams for help, it certainly aint gonna be good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! What are you doing here! Youre not supposed to be here!\" said a voice whispering from the shadows. You cautiously turn around and see a pink-haired woman with chinese-style buns in her hair, a white and green dress with a long brown front panel over it that depicts a long thorny rose motiff. Her whole right arm is completely bandaged up, yet seems to have no trouble moving it carefree.<br>\r\nAt first it seemed slightly refreshing to see a fellow human not captured and at the mercy of onis, but the way she stalked toward you left you suspicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-who are-\"<br>\r\n\"SHH!!!\" she shushed you and with a single tug of her bandaged hand, pulled you into the shadows with her before anyone could spot you. The two of you wait silently until the oni gang pass by with their captive in tow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed, still having a slight death-grip on your arm with her bandaged hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you any idea what these savages do to yo-us humans?\" she questioned you, \"why would you venture here all by yourself?\" How did she even know that?<br>\r\n\"H-How did you know I came here myself?\" you asked, \"and who are you anyway?\"<br>\r\n\"Kasen Ibakari, just a simple human hermit of the mountains,\" she answers with a little pride in her voice before her tone quickly changes, \"and duh! If you, a lowly weak human like myself, were captured, you'd STILL be captured!\" she said as if stating fact, \"no one can escape from an oni! ESPECIALLY at this time of year!\" You squinted your eyes at her, but youre not in much of a mood to question.<br>\r\n\"Alright, I dont really know how I got here,\" you answered.<br>\r\n\"What do you mean you dont know?\" she tilted her head.<br>\r\n\"All I remember is getting drunk at the Human Village with a gate guard of Scarlet Mansion, then a big bulky oni friend of hers came in and challenged us to a drinking contest.\"<br>\r\nShe groaned. \"That was an incredibly dumb move on your part. NEVER take an oni up on a drinking contest. That is practically BEGGING to die of liver poisoning! Well, you shouldnt be drinking PERIOD, but it's especially bad when youre drinking cuz youre goaded by an oni!\" You were in no mood to listen to her nagging, so you ignore it and continue.<br>\r\n\"Anyways, I think I passed out and next thing I knew I woke up here. Wherever here is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" 'Wherever here is'...\" Kasen repeats hinting being offended by that remark, \"...is Hellgondo. Major oni territory that we humans have no business being in unless we dont plan on leaving. FOR GOOD.\" You feel red flags raise every time she mentions humans in such an odd way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's not like I wanted to come here,\" you shrugged, \"how far are we from the Human Village?\"<br>\r\n\"That's like on the other side of the island!\" your fellow human remarks, \"youre gonna be preyed upon long before you get there, fellow human!\" 'Fellow human'? Who the heck talks like that?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw crap,\" you cringed, \"so I'm pretty much stuck here?!\"<br>\r\n\"You certainly will be,\" she stated as a matter of fact, \"if us humans dont stick together. Come with me, I've got a nice house on a hill not far from here. We can hide out there until Oni Season ends.\" Oni Season?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you question or raise a single objection, she was already dragging you with her by her bandaged arm. Is that even hurting her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, keep up!\" Kasen ordered you, \"I know we humans are slow, but not THAT slow!\"<br>\r\n\"S-Sorry, but this is getting kind of awkward...\" you finally reveal to her your suspicions, but your 'fellow human' wasnt having any of it!<br>\r\n\"There's no time to question,\" she tells you, \"it's Oni Season! If another girl-I mean if a female oni happens to spot your delightfully chiseled physique clad in those torn revealing tattered rags of yours, she'll lose her mind!\" You couldnt help but hear her sound a bit giddy when she said that. Yep, you may be a fool, but you know an obvious deception when you see it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuestion is, will you play along with it?</span></div></div>",

What an odd fellow.<br>\r\nThough if you didnt know any better, you coulda sworn his note read 'WHITEST-'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho was at the door?\u201d Kasen called to you.<br>\r\n\u201cJust some solicitor,\u201d you called back, \u201che had the wrong house.\u201d ...Didnt he?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile in the kitchen, as Kasen waits for the water to boil, she quickly freshens herself up. She put on lipstick, added a little mascara, carefully adjusted her hair buns to ensure those bits werent showering, looked over a few pages in her book 'I Human Too: 786 Tips to Properly Assimilate in a Human Population', sprayed a little breath spray in her mouth, then sprayed a little perfume on her armpits, then sprayed a little more, then sprayed even more in a desperate attempt to hide the uh\u2026 'oni smell'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter spray herself an awful lot, she sniffed herself but could still detect a little of her 'oni smell' on her body. She sighed and hoped that the human she was trying to mingle with wouldnt notice. Fortunately, he's a foreigner so hopefully that means he isnt familiar with recognizing the natural scent of an oni.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe water boiled, Kasen poured it out into two cups, put them on a try, put in the teabags, and got out the sake for added flavor-\u201dNO!!\u201d she stopped herself before letting her natural urges take effect, \u201cyou are cutting down! You are cutting down!\u201d She managed to halt her insatiable alcohol craving for now, but thoughts of pouring sake into the human's drink sprouted, which she quickly stomped down! Shame on her for even CONSIDERING drugging that poor human in need! Especially after some other sot had drugged him\u2026 and who knows what else she done to him! She briefly meditated and chanted to ease away her bad urges before picking up the tray and heading to the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk! It's ready!\u201d she came in and announced, interrupting your mental reflecting. The smell of the green tea wafted through your nostrils. \u201cGive it a minute or two to cool down. The tea is still pretty hot.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThank you,\u201d you take a cup, \u201cwhat's in it?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cCertainly no alcohol or barbiturates whatsoever!\u201d Kasen suddenly got defensive, \u201cwhich is something most uncivil onis tend to put in an unsuspecting victim's drink either for cruel humor or very underhanded reasons!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI meant what kind of flavorings did you put in the tea?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh. Just some honey, lemon, and a bit of spice,\u201d she answers, \u201cI dont usually put anything spectacular in tea.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat's fine,\u201d you assure her,\u201dI prefer my tea ordinary anyways.\u201d As you are about to take your first sip, Kasen feels the need to add, \u201cBe sure to take slow sips. The best way to savor the natural flavor of green tea is to take slow sips.\u201d Sheesh, you aint a baby. But being a good guest, you do as youre told.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tea wasnt bad. Nothing special. In all honesty, it COULD do with a little alcohol, but you've learned your lesson! Stay away from the booze! Speaking of which, you remind yourself of what Kasen said earlier. Youre a long way from home (at least the current one).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKasen?\u201d you pause from drinking to ask, \u201chow do I get back to the Human Village from here?\u201d<br>\r\nShe takes a little while sipping her cup as if trying to stall out the question but she answers, \u201cWell\u2026 it's hard to say at the moment. The route out of Hellgondo is usually obstructed during Oni Season. We'll probably need to wait at least 1\u2026 3 weeks for the road to be rebuilt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTHREE WEEKS?!\u201d you werent THAT patient, \u201cmy sister's gonna be worried sick! There's no telling what she's end up doing if she assumes I'm in trouble!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI'm sorry,\u201d Kasen apologizes, \u201cbut it's too dangerous for us humans at the moment. It's best to remain here where it's safe until the Season's over. But dont worry, we have plenty of food here until then. Plenty for us and all my pets. I'll show you them in the morning.\u201d In any other non-tense situation, you'd ask what kind of pets she's got. But now, all you cared about was one thing. Making sure Anna knew you were ok!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you have a phone?\u201d you ask. Who knows where you left yours!<br>\r\n\u201cDrako ate it,\u201d Kasen pouted her lips, \u201cdumb dragon. Besides, there's no reception here, anyway. Hellgondo isnt exactly a high-tech kind of village.\u201d Geez!<br>\r\n\u201cWell, is there anyway to send some sort of communication? Telegram? Letter? Carrier Pigeon?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerhaps we could look for a payphone in the morning,\u201d Kasen suggests, \u201cfor now, it's getting awful late. It's best you get cleaned up and out of those dirty tattered revealing clothes. The bathroom is just over to the right. You can shower there. I'll see if I got some spare clothes I can lend you.\u201d As worried sick (and homicidal) your sister must be by now, it is awful late. Besides, you do kinda reek of booze and girly parts! For now the best course of action would be to take Kasen's offer.<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Ms. Ibaraki,\" you offer your thanks.<br>\r\n\"The pleasure's *sniff!* all mine,\" she said with a sweet, yet tense, smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thank her and head to the bathroom, feeling her odd intrigued stare burn a hole through the back of you! Fortunately, the lock on the door works. It didnt take you long to get used to how the shower operates.<br>\r\nWith your clothes off and one of Kasen's herbal soaps lathered all over your naked flesh, you sigh and relax under the gentle warm shower pouring down the shower head. It was a very brief moment of peaceful bliss  out of the unbelievable chaos you've just been caught in the middle of!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor at least this one brief moment, nothing could irk you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Not even the pink haired curly-horned idol at the window that just snapped a photo of you on her phone.</span></div></div>",

You wondered if they\u2019ll be alright and Kasen told you it will be alright and get some rest. You agreed and went toward the respected room and went for bed.

It was a bowl of rice and had some side dishes from fried eggs to sausages. You thanked for the food and started to eat. As you are, you asked Kasen where the pay phones were and she told you she\u2019ll guid you, and you nodded. It took 20 minutes to eat and after cleaning the dishes you two got out and saw both Shiki and Elizabeth standing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cReady for the journey?\u201d Shiki asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cUm, yeah.\u201d You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n All of you went toward the city as both Shiki and Elizabeth helped Kasen defend you, she found the payphone.

Patchouli smiled your way as she brought over a tea tray as Koakuma stared back nervously as she hiding the title cover of the book in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome back, Mr. Whitestone!\" Patchouli said in awfully uncharacteristic springy tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Patchouli,\" you grumbled a little, still half tired from tonight's ventures from discovering a terminatrix to possibly creating a new breed of human/firefly species.<br>\r\nShe set the tea tray on the desk just aside your bed.<br>\r\n\"Heard you went through quite a bit,\" she sets, \"you must be worn out. So I made you some tea!\"<br>\r\n\"Actually, Sakuya made it and Patchouli volunteered to bring it to you.\"<br>\r\n\"Koakuma!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" your throat was feeling a bit dry, so you gladly took a sip, not giving a second thought how hot the cup was. ...Kandy tea?! You havent had this stuff in a long time! The unparalleled taste of the thick sweet cinnamony imported Ceylon tea could not be matched by anything else on this tiny green earth! All other tea seem so bland and uninspiring once you taste a sip of good ol' Kandy! The sip would quickly turn into a chug then you'd gleefully pour yourself another cup full until you ultimately finish the entire pot!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to force yourself to set the dang cup down cuz you reminded yourself of that eventful encounter with the T-X.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S...So,\" you coughed, \"did Arnold or my sister mention anything about what that girl I brought over here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, the cyborg?\" Patchouli asked, \"they took it down to the Ravine to have the technician over there, Ms. Kawashiro, look at it. The poor busted thing was sparking from top to bottom, the mistress was worried it was gonna start a fire!\" She did look like she took quite a beating on the way here. Since when was Anna ever involved in building cyborgs? Granted, you dont know EVERYTHING she's ever been involved in, but youre certain fooling around with robo-people wouldve stuck out too much in your mind!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope she'll be alright,\" you say.<br>\r\n\"I'm sure it'll be fine,\" the librarian assured, \"no one knows freaky futuristic gadgetry quite like little Nitori.\" Well, that sounds like good news to you. Anna's still got a bit to answer to, however. Then again, so would you... she probably wants to know where you've been all night! AND SPEAKING OF WHICH...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how was the date?\" figures Patchouli would bring it up. That's the sole reason she came into your room, wasnt it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was... incredible,\" that was the best word to describe it, \"I would totally look forward to a second date with Wriggle. When can I get a second one?\"<br>\r\n\"Err.... not for a while,\" she breaks out the bad news, \"I'm afraid Wriggle's gonna be very busy most of the season... notcountingthematernityleavespendaturesandthedocumentarysponsorships *COUGH* Anyways, I'm sorry, but she's not gonna be available for some time.\" Bummer.<br>\r\n\"Damn,\" you say with disappointment, \"I honestly thought we clicked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I'm HOPING,\" you hear Patchouli mutter under her breath, \"but anyways, dont feel so down. Besides, I've got another girl in mind who could use a nice handsome single gent to keep her company!\" Koakuma sighs with exhaustion. That tells you something fishy is up yet again, but you humor her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her name is Kisume,\" Patchouli explains while Koakuma bites her lip, \"she's a very... unique youkai girl that tends to hang around near caves and wells... ONE well in particular lately. Dont worry, she's not dangerous or anything.\"<br>\r\n\"Yes she is,\" her bat-winged subordinate mumbles.<br>\r\n\"No, she isnt!\" Patchouli snapped at her then turned back to you, \u201cshe's just a little misunderstood. There's a few awful nasty rumors going on about her doing really horrendous things.\u201d Good lord almighty! \u201cBut the truth is she wouldnt hurt a fly. Sure, she might spook a few unsuspecting people now and then, but nothing worse than that.\u201d Hm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see,\u201d these 'half-truths' if you wanna call them that are leaving you feeling uneasy. But then again, you did just mate with a firefly youkai and had electrical surges jolt through your genitalia, and yet you'd STILL go on a second date with Wriggle!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyways, you've got nothing to worry about!\u201d Patchouli tells you, \u201cshe's a very nice girl and fun to get along with...\u201d She pauses for a moment, which tells you there's a tremendous catch to this blind date proposal, \u201c...but speaking of rumors, I would really REALLY appreciate it if you help us solve a particular one involving Kisume. It's nothing major.\u201d<br>\r\nYou inhale and exhale hard, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoakuma breaks the ice before her boss is, \u201cThe thing is she's a tsurube-otoshi, in literally terms, a 'bucket dropper'. Her tribe of tsurube-otoshi literally contain themselves in buckets. When they feed, they tend to ensnare prey within their buckets and only their bones end up coming out.\u201d Interesting. Possibly horrifying too. \u201cThe whole stigma behind them is that their own bodies themselves never seem to leave their particular bucket.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSome theorize that the buckets themselves are a part of their actual bodies,\u201d Patchouli finishes, \u201csome even say that the bucket itself is the actual tsurube-otoshi and the youkai person within it is more like a puppet to lure prey in. However, there is a more compelling theory I've been researching and I need to verify it: The bucket they contain themselves in is actually a vast independent furnished home for the tsurube-otoshi! Like hammerspace, the bucket contains a large possibly infinite sized dimension inside it with limitless space that is specifically suited for the individual youkai living in it!\u201d Hm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe read about that in this stupid book,\u201d Koakuma, with humiliation in her facade, shows off the book in her hands entitle 'Unsolved Youkai Mysteries'.<br>\r\n\u201cThat 'stupid book',\u201d Patchouli remarks offended, \u201chappens to be a collection of well thought out peer-reviewed theories from very acclaimed professional researchers! Anyways, I repeat that it's a 'theory', because it's still yet to be proven. Mainly because anyone who's ever went into a tsurube-otoshi's bucket never comes out.\u201d Well, that's just swell! \u201cWhich is part of the reason, PART of mind you, I was hoping you'd accept this date with Kisume so you can help me determine if this theory is true or not.\u201d In other words, she wants you to be her guinea pig again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave you ever thought about just asking Kisume what's in her bucket?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\nShe sighs,\u201dI have, but she's incredibly secretive about it. She says her bucket is extremely personal! Which is why I'm hoping you being her boyfriend will win her trust enough to welcome you into her bucket. That way, once youre inside, you can snap a few pictures and jot down a few notes and bring over what you got by the time the date's over!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2026 you didnt say anything. You just stared back at her in absolute silence. While sipping more of that delicious tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told you this wasnt a good idea,\u201d Koakuma whines.<br>\r\n\u201cSilence!\u201d Patchouli shoots her down and turns back to you, \u201ccome on, Alex. This is a both a grand science AND history changing discovery if you pull this off! We'll have our names posted in news worldwide that we were the first humans in the world to actually prove this long pondered mystery of the world! Plus, Kisume's cute. She's got that going for her\u2026. You'd get prestige AND you'd get a babe! That's like, more win for you than it would be for me if you do this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter pondering the absurdity of Patchouli's proposal and nearly blissing out on the taste of the tea, you set your tea cup down and...</span></div></div>",

She looked at him and he shocked his face at her, and she just grunts and turns to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cJust be safe.\u201d Anna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cThanks Anna.\u201d You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You two then left and it took at least 1 and1/2 hours to get to the area and it was a cave that going downwards. You thought to yourself this would be heaven or hell as Koakuma told you kisume hides somewhere in this cave and you thanked her and went in. As you went deeper, it was getting darker, and little dangerous until you heard an water drops falling faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWhat would that be?\u201d You thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You then heard slithering noise and a bumping noise, making a cracking backing pain on your head. You thought this would be the perfect opportunity for bad ending as you saw a bucket with a green haired girl inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cIn-In-Intruder!\u201d She spoke in fearful tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWait,wait! Are you that kisume girl!?\u201d You asked, aching from the blast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cYou..you must be mr.whitestone? Patchouli told me.\u201d Kisume said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cYeah, that\u2019s me.\u201d You replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n She apologized for bumping into you and tried to heal you, but how?</span></div></div>",

It took you by surprise and it got you wondering why she's... then you noticed your bleeding! SWEET JESUS, SHE'S DRINKING YOUR BLOOD!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately jerk yourself away from her, leaving her giving off a cutesy questionable expression while your blood is dripping from your lip!<br>\r\n\"W-W-WHAT DO YOU THINK YOURE DOING?!\"<br>\r\n\"Uh, I'm healing you,\" she seemed to legitimately not know what was wrong with this picture!<br>\r\n\"No youre not, youre drinking my blood!\" you exclaim. Best make a mental note to lock your door tight when you sleep too. You cant trust the headmistress as far as you can swing a Belmont whip at her, either!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH! You mean this?\" Kisume just nonchalantly stuck her tongue out at you, \"dont worry. A tsurube-otoshi's saliva happens to be a well known type of antiseptic that quite a few healers in the human village use when they perform surgery. My spit'll speed up the healing process of that nasty bruise and you'll be all better in a jiffy!\"<br>\r\nYour mind was temporarily blown from that believe it or not educational oddity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R...really?\"<br>\r\n\"Yep!\" Kisume tips her chin and looks up at the sky, giving off a cutesy thinking pose. \"...At least I think that's how some old friends of mine advertised it...\" Against your better judgement, you believed her.<br>\r\n\"Oh. Alright then. Go ahead and keep licking.\"<br>\r\n\"YAY!\" she squealed with excitement and lapped up as much blood from your bleeding head as she could! She took her time slurping your bleeding wound while you tried your best to keep a straight face while her slightly abnormally long wet and slightly grainy tongue kept stroking across your head, lick by lick!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow! Youre O+?!\u201d Kisume suddenly blurts out in the middle of her slurps!<br>\r\n\u201cH-H-How did you know?!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt's been a long time since I got to taste this succulent type!\u201d Kisume beams, \u201cSlightly bitter and salty, yet still jam-packed with flavor! Is it alright if I pour some of it in a jar and save it for later please?! Pretty please?!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI would rather you not,\u201d you stated boldly, already having second thoughts about this blind date! And you just got through with sticking your dick in a girl with a vagina that conducts electricity!<br>\r\n\u201cAww!\u201d she pouted, \u201cfine, but if you cut yourself again, please tell me ASAP, ok?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI'll think about it,\u201d note to self: pour toilet cleaner in that fat librarian's tea!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, there. Good as new,\u201d finally Kisume stopped licking and applied a nice little bandage over the wound.<br>\r\n\u201cThanks,\u201d you thanked her even though you wont forget this disturbing moment for a while. To be fair, the bleeding did seem to slow down considerably. Maybe Kisume was telling the truth. Still, youre not having very high hopes about this blind date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKisuuuuuume\u2026. oh Kisuuuuuuume!\u201d<br>\r\nAnd because you clearly needed MORE proof this blind date was a bad idea, you hear a voice calling out for Kisume in the distance which she in turn changes her emotional state from cheerful to frightened!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no!\u201d Kisume jerks her head toward the direction of the holler, \u201cnot them! Anything but them! Why now?!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWho is i-\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSSHH!!!\u201d Kisume quickly puts a finger to your lips and shushes you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKisuuuume!\u201d the voice keeps calling out, \u201ccome on out! Your 'protection' rent's past due!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYeah!\u201d said another voice, \u201cyoure super late! You didnt think we'd forget, did ya?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKisume shivered with fright \u201cIt's the Douji sisters! Theyre the meanest pair of girls in town!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou got a bully problem?\u201d Oh boy.<br>\r\nShe frowned and lowered her head, \u201cThey've been hassling me and my friends for a while. Shaking us up for money, calling it 'protection'. Cant they just leave me alone and hassle somebody else?!\u201d Lovely. Just what you needed. To be caught in a kid's little bully crisis.<br>\r\n\u201cHave you told anybody they were bothering you?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAre you kidding?! Nobody wants to mess with them!! Theyre super strong!!\u201d  she seemed legitimately frightened by these sisters! So frightened in fact, she was almost on the verge of tears! \u201cI'm sorry, Alex! Had I known they'd be tracking me down, I'da postponed our date to the next billing cycle!\u201d Ugh! Did Patchouli even know about this before she decided to use you as a guinea pig?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, twerp! You dont wanna come out? We'll just have to come in!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you better have your wallet ready!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw shoot! Quick! Hide!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHide? Wh-\u201d too late. She and her bucket zipped way up to the ceiling, hiding up in the shade! As you heard footsteps coming your way, you figured you'd just avoid a confrontation and take Kisume's advice.<br>\r\nYou quickly squeeze yourself in a big dark crack in the wall and disappear in the shadow as the two bullies enter the scene!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two bullies that were scaring Kisume whitless were two young horned girls in colored kimonos that matched the colors of their hair. One was blonde with tons of red tattooed markings all across her body, yellow slanted eyes, and what you assumed was a tattoo of a vertical eye on her forehead just between her horns.<br>\r\nThe other girl had short purple hair, slanted purple eyes, blood-tipped horns, and was shamelessly not wearing her kimono very well, barely bothering to cover her incredibly scantily clad armor that didnt really cover ANYTHING but her breasts and crotch!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreat. These two brats are oni. Young oni. As if they werent a big enough pain in the ass to deal with as ADULTS! Unstable powerhouse lushes are one thing, but unstable powerhouse lush KIDS?!<br>\r\nObviously, talking them out of cutting out their little extortion ring is out of the question, let alone threating to take off your belt and spanking them (they'd probably LIKE that!)! Suffice to say, Kisume had very good reason to be afraid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe know youre here, Kisume,\u201d called the purple-haired sister, \u201cjust come on out, hand over what you owe, plus an added interest and we'll forget this whole nasty episode. Heck, we'll even share a nice cold drink with you to bury the hatchet!\u201d She pulled out a large sake bottle from\u2026 nevermind, you dont wanna know!<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, dont sweet-talk the bucket-wimp, Shuten!\u201d the blonde sister remarked, \u201cbesides, she aint gonna drink that stuff. She's too pure and wholesome.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, and so was her friend Kyouko,\u201d Shuten replied, \u201cyet she was awfully quick to make an exception after you threatened to stick her broom where the sun doesnt shine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYOU HEAR THAT, KISUME?!\u201d shouted the blonde, \u201cIF YOU DONT WANNA PAY US PROPERLY FOR OUR GENEROSITY, MAYBE WE OUGHTA TAKE IT OUT ON YOUR FRIEND AGAIN?! THINK SHE'S GOT ENOUGH CASH STASHED AWAY TO BAIL YOUR ASS OUT?!\u201d You could barely make up the bucket in the ceiling shivering a bit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDont listen to Ibaraki, Kisume,\u201d Shuten said, \u201cwe wont do that. SHE'S a responsible paying client, unlike you. The longer you hide from us, the higher the price gets\u2026 and the less likely whatever we break will heal back properly even with the best treatment.\u201d It seemed so wrong that you were taking these two little twerps' threats so seriously. But not even you wanted to step out of your hiding spot and confront these brats! All you could do at the moment is wait. Wait. And Hope. Hope that you and Kisume will make it out of this in one piece regardless of what happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHurry your ass up, Kisume!\u201d Ibaraki shouted, \u201cyou cant stay hidden forever!!\u201d </span></div></div>",

Grocery shopping, the laundromat, meditating at a nearby shrine, the discount theater when they had a special 24 hour event of nothing but Bruce Lee movies... honestly, he just doesnt get that I'm not interested in him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry to hear that,\" you apologize, even though you felt like asking if HE tried to mount her while she was sleeping, too!<br>\r\nMeiling looked back at you and then smirked. Bad things came from that smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what? I think I know of a way to make Hao Long finally get the message!\"<br>\r\n\"How's th-wait!\" you quickly figured it all out as soon as she pulled out HER phone.<br>\r\n\"Mr. Whitestone, could you please do me a favor and take a few selfies with me?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure that's a good idea!\"<br>\r\n\"But it's really simple!\" she assured, \"you and me take a couple of photos together and I'll post them on my twitter... which I know Hao Long prowls because he made like a dozen fake accounts just to follow me on it! Then he'll think I'm already taken and FINALLY get off my back!\" Or you'll make a triad agent jealous and have MORE haters on your ass!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure that's a good idea!\"<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding? It's a BRILLIANT idea!\" Meiling argues, \"not only that, maybe YOUR crazy ex stalker will have a peek at that and finally leave you alone too! Win win!\" OH RIGHT! REISEN!! WHAT IF SHE SEES THOSE TWITTER POSTS?! ....Er... and even if it works and she DOES stop stalking you instead of trying to murder Meiling, part of you just doesnt wanna say goodbye yet! Not only that, you even thought about Wriggle, the OTHER girl you got incredibly close with in one night. So close, your dick is STILL surging a little from that encounter! Ugh.. Wriggle, Reisen, Meiling.... who knew love triangles would be so complicated?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, Alex!\" Meiling pleads, \"It'll be fun! Qiiiiiing?\"</span></div></div>",

You talked to her and she told you that it would take at least month to fix her due to heavy damage she have given. She told you she\u2019ll be strolling outside for moment and ordered Arnold to go back out to gate guarding.

You were quickly panicking like mad, but you noticed it wasnt lead sticking in her shoulder. It was a tranquilizer bullet!<br>\r\n\"Anna!!\" still, you rushed over to your sister's aide, but she was already knocked out cold! Fortunately, Meiling and Arnold helped drag her out of harm's way like decent people!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dont worry, it was a light sedative,\" Reisen assured you, \"she'll wake up just fine in a while! ...YOU, on the other hand..\" She looked over to Meiling and pulled out a different gun, \"...wont be waking up PERIOD!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BANG!!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn absolutely no time whatsoever, the sound of a gunshot was heard far too close to your ears which caused them to ring for a while and slighty bring up some shaky flashbacks! By the time you registered the gunshot, you realized the gunshot came from Reisen herself! By the time you realized it was Reisen who fired the shot, you realized she was aiming at Meiling! And by the time you realized Meiling was the target, Arnold had already jumped in front of the bullet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, Arnold looked unphased from the shot. His chest was a little scratched, but besides that, he was fine. Who WASNT fine on the other hand were Meiling and Anna! Anna who was not happy seeing Reisen of all people here, and Meiling understandably perturbed that she was nearly shot!<br>\r\nThe guardian had her jaw dropped like she was absolutely insulted that someone like REISEN would actually try to shoot her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Move aside, Hulk Fabio!\" Reisen ordered Arnold.<br>\r\n\"Request denied,\" Arnold coldly stated, \"firearms are prohibited on the premises of Scarlet Mansion.\" All the while, Scarlet Mansion's actual gate guard was still boiling with rage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E....EXCUSE ME, YOU BUNNY-EARRED ZI WEI DU!\" she snapped at Reisen, \"Did YOU... just try to shoot ME?!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I was aiming for the OTHER cold-blooded scaley-cunted home-breaker!\" your former bunny-earred friend snapped back.

Like I'm gonna risk soiling my hands on filthy trash like you! The bullets are more valuable than your worthless carcass!\"<br>\r\n\"Fighting is prohibited on the premises of Scarlet Mansion-\"<br>\r\n\"SHUT UP!\" both Meiling and Reisen snapped at Arnold!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was getting nowhere. If anybody could put a stop to this mess before your sister and everybody else get involved, it had to be you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reisen!\" you stepped in front of Arnold. Upon seeing you, Reisen lowered her weapon.<br>\r\n\"Alex-sama!\"<br>\r\n\"Reisen, you shouldnt be here.\"<br>\r\n\"No!! YOU shouldnt be here!\" she shook her head furiously, \"this is the worst place for a human like you to be trapped in! What was your sister thinking bringing you here?! The owners of this place are VAMPIRES! The librarian's an otaku lunatic with an assistant who is a SUCCUBUS! The head maid could freeze time and molest you 50 times before you so much as register how violated you are! And THIS bitch is a fire-breathing retard!\"<br>\r\n\"Better than a mentally-ill drug-addicted lesbo with anger management issues!\"<br>\r\n\"I'll fucking skin you alive and sell your hide to Coach!\"<br>\r\n\"BRING IT, HUANG JUN!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arnold hold Meiling back!\" you ordered him who immediately did so as you used yourself as a shield from Reisen!<br>\r\n\"Alex-sama, we need to get you out of here! Youre clearly not safe here!\" she tells you.<br>\r\nBut you shake your head, \"No, I have to be here. This is my home now.\"<br>\r\nShe grits her teeth, \"This is NOT your home! Your home is in Eientei... with me! You cant settle for this awful place! You deserve much better than... HER!\" she points over to Meiling who's glares right back, \"Your virginity is far more valuable than to be giving it to something like THAT!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as soon as she brought up your virginity, your face went red and that red-haired dragon youkai snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh! Virginity, you say?!\"<br>\r\nReisen's ears twitched.<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm sorry, bunny! But if youre looking for Alex's virginity, little Wriggle already took that before even I could!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReisen's red eyes widened, \"W-W-W-WRIGGLE?!! AS IN WRIGGLE NIGHTBUG?!!!\" Oh dear, she knows her?! You lowered your head and Meiling's serpent grin widened. \"Y-Y-YOU LOST YOUR VIRGIINITY TO.... *GULP!* HIM??!!!\" ...'Him'?! <br>\r\nReisen not only looked at you with concern... but even a little disgust, \"Alex-sama, it's obvious youre feeling lonely in this horrible place, but you were so lonely that you looked for comfort from another man?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, Wriggle's a gi-\"<br>\r\n\"THAT'S RIGHT, BUNNY-GIRL!!\" Meiling zipped at you and covered your mouth, \"and you shoulda seen the way Alex b\u00e0oed that little bug boy's tight little juhua! Heh! I bet sperm is STILL dripping out of Wriggie's glowing gangmen!\" Sheesh, Meiling! Did you really have to lay it on so thick?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReisen's face went cold, she's probably got such a disgusting image stuck in her brain now, but she exhaled and shook her head, \"Ok, Alex-sama! Dont worry! We'll have you tested for any STDs later!\"  Does brief sparks from your dick count as an STD? \" Now c'mon, let's get outta here!\"<br>\r\n\"I told you already, Reisen. This is my home now.\"<br>\r\n\"But Alex-sa-\"<br>\r\n\"Reisen, I'm sorry,\" you gave it to her straight, \"I cant go back. Youre gonna have to leave.\"<br>\r\nThat poor bunny girl looked like she was mere moments away from crying. It really broke your heart to see her in such an emotional state. But you knew it was something you had to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReisen gazed back at you, breathing heavily and trying to fight back the tears in her eyes. Damn it, the look she was giving you was making it hard for YOU to hold back the tears! Yet, you just didnt have the heart to just turn away from her. But all you could do was just hope she'll get the message and turn around and leave... even though part of you hopes she doesnt...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReisen...</span></div></div>",

There was no point in denying it.<br>\r\n\"Y-yes,\" you responded, \u201cI assure you I did not have anything to do with her coming her. I specifically told her off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBe that as it may,\u201d Remilia didnt seem to care, \u201csuch a dangerous person whom YOURE acquainted it tried to attack underlings of my establishment. And any attack on my subordinates is an attack on my establishment. And any attack on my establishment, I will consider a personal attack on me.\u201d This statement coming from the matriarch of the very manor youre seeking refuge in is quite a hard statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReisen wont be coming back!\u201d you tell her, \u201cI promise! I wont let her back here. Her hurting my sister crossed the line. I'm not gonna let her hurt anybody else here too!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHow exactly can I be sure of that?\u201d she questions you, \u201cthat was a heavily armed deranged lunatic that was awful quick to pull the trigger! Especially on your very sister! Do you seriously think youre capable to stopping someone with such an unhinged mindset?!\u201d Good question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe wont come back,\u201d you tell her, \u201cshe ran off crying when I told her off. She got the message that I cant go back with her.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOr she's motivated to go to even worse extremes!\u201d Remilia quipped, \u201cwhich do you think I should assume?\u201d Now that she says that, what makes you think Reisen wont do something even worse? You wish you had the perfect response to that quip, but sadly you didnt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wholeheartedly agree, Lady Scarlet!\u201d however Meiling suddenly appeared out of nowhere yet again and came with a response of her own, \u201cnot to mention, judging by the military grade arsenal and the way she wield her weapons, she's clearly ex-military trained. Who knows what kinds of special forces tactics she's capable of.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter thoroughly hammering down the threat to her mistress, Meiling picked the opportune time to offer a solution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhich is why I propose we bring in some added security detail to protect Mr. Whitestone from that conniving huang zun!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMeiling, what are you up to?\u201d Remilia asks the same question you were thinking.<br>\r\n\u201cPlease hear me out, my Lady!\u201d Meiling pleads, \u201cI happen to have a few friends who are fellow professional guardians that are currently down on their luck who would be happy to lend a hand with assisting me protecting Alex and his sister until their current personal bodyguard is fully repaired.\u201d<br>\r\nThe head of the mansion looks at her sternly, tapping her neatly trimmed fingernails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow much is this going to cost me?\u201d Remilia got directly to the point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeiling shook her head, \u201cNot much if anything! These friends are pretty desperate for work and some will do it simply for free food and a roof over their head! One will watch the front, another will watch the back, one will patrol the halls, and I myself can keep an eye on Alex personally in his room in case the rabid rabbit tries to sneak in and take advantage of him in his sleep!\u201d AGAIN.<br>\r\nRemilia just groaned hard, \u201cAlright Meiling, I'll think about it. In the meantime, please escort Anna's brother to the library. Patchouli requires his personal assistance.\u201d What? She wants you to impregnate MORE oddities! Contract MORE ungodly STDs the likes of which no one's ever seen?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeiling bows, \u201cBixu-I mean, as you wish, my lady!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWait,\u201d Remilia stops the two of you, \u201cbefore you go. Mr. Whitestone, there's one more thing I need from you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is iAAAUUGGH!!\u201d suddenly, you felt a sharp stab into the side of your neck! By the time you gripped it in pain, it was already bleeding! \u201cFucckking\u2026. Hell...\u201d you groaned.<br>\r\nAs you shouldve expected (and so should Anna!), Remilia was wiping the blood from her lips with her handkerchief.<br>\r\n\u201cOk. You can go now,\u201d she ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour oh so friendly Chinese dragon youkai admirer generously wrapped a bandage around your neck to stop the bleeding as the two of you walked off.<br>\r\n\u201cI'm sorry about her,\u201d Meiling apologized, \u201cyou know how wild young vampire brats get, right? ...No? Um, anyway, dont worry. That'll heal just fine. Vampire bites are no more dangerous than sticking your jiba in a firefly's baoyu!\u201d UGH!! Did she have to remind you?! ...Maybe, considering you need to have a word with Patchouli!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre there any others here that'll bite me too?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\nShe shook her head, \u201cNo. Remilia's sister prefers her food dead.  As for Koakuma, let's just say it's not BLOOD she likes to suck!\u201d Awkward, but not nearly as awkward as when she added, \u201cAs for me, the only time I'd ever bite you would be to mark you as mine! And since we had that tweet together and told off our stalkers and IkindasortatoldmymomthatyouandIweregoingsteady, I think it's high time to show the world that youre Hong Meiling's gao bizi!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe literally was about to sink her teeth into you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! No no no no no!\u201d you immediately refuse, \u201cno marks, thank you very much!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNaozhong...\u201d Meiling sneered at you under her breath. Youre pretty sure that was an insult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before you could do anything about that (as if you could!), you heard yet another ding from your phone. While Meiling gone in a sour mood from your mark rejection, she was now ignoring you. Which meant opportunity to check your newest text.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMake that newest 20 texts! Sheesh, how you miss all them?! And of course, they all come from Ex-moon soldier! Mainly messages of begging, pleading, apologizing, cute sad emoticons, there was probably a nude selfie or two in there somewhere. Can she not take a hint?!<br>\r\nYou seriously need to change your number. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoure gonna have to tell her off, but youre not sure she'll take no for an answer. If anything, it'd probably just encourage her to KEEP trying to come for you. Perhaps you should just block her and be done with it (and hope she doesnt have multiple backup numbers to pester you with!). But then again, what makes you think it wont encourage her to try to get in contact with you in other ways? What makes you think the lack of any and all replies from you wont just make her antsy and push her to try to contact you face-to-face again?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance over at Meiling, who was still ignoring you, and think about your next move...</span></div></div>",

Until then, you can help Koakuma with book shelving!\u201d Patchouli said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You were angry, but there were nothing you can do now and went to see koakuma until you saw Arnold holding blond haired girl with red skirt and shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI see your here.\u201d Arnold said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cYeah, hows your wound?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cJust a scratch, that\u2019s all.\u201d Arnold replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He then put the young girl down and turned to your attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cLook, I need to gate guard.

It's bad enough you found out far too late that the cute girl you humped and nearly electrocuted yourself to death is only a girl on particular times of the year! You dont know what a 'hakutaku' is, but the 'were' part left nasty feelings! And it wasnt a coincidence she wanted to arrange it on a full moon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope,\" you immediately shoot her down, \"not happening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, Alex!\" Patchouli pleaded, \"I swear, Keine is a wonderful woman! Great with kids! A smart teacher! Jaw droppingly gorgeous!\"<br>\r\n\"And a WERE-Hakutaku,\" you interject.<br>\r\n\"So? She still knows how to control her moodswings... provided you never bring up her ex-girlfriend.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm not going on the date and that's final,\" you put your foot down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, it aint gonna be-\"<br>\r\n\"GRRRRR!!!!\" suddenly, your new bodyguard (courtesy of Meiling) growled in Patchouli's face. Ms. Knowledge immediately flinched away from the green-haired funny-earred guardian dog in the incredibly tacky shirt and shorts that look like they were ripped from a Hawaiian tourist shop who looked like she was about ready to bite her fucking face off!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard Mr. W!\" Aun growled at her, \"he said no! And when he says no, he doesnt mean yes or maybe! HE MEANS NO!\"<br>\r\nWith that, the ambitious librarian quickly sang a different tune, \u201cAlright, alright! Fine! Forget I said anything! Just get your little guard dog out of my face, ok?!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAttagirl,\u201d you couldnt help but pat Aun's head. Looking back, that was kind of a silly move on your part. But she giggled and wagged her tail with satisfaction. First day of Meiling's added security and it's going WAY better than expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeriously! You had no confidence in Meiling's bright idea (and suspicions of ulterior motives), yet so far, Aun is proving to be quite a watchdog. She's friendly to you, she's fun to pet, she scares the others, she doesnt make a mess, AND she can stand in the very same spot perfectly still for hours on end! Here's hoping the rest of the new security detail is just as enjoyable!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for having my back, Aun,\u201d you thanked her as the two of you headed for your room.<br>\r\n\u201cIt's no problem at all, Mr. W!\u201d she states with vigor, \u201cthat stupid book thumper shoulda known better! Youre Meiling's gao bizi, not hers!\u201d Aw man, she's using that term, too?!<br>\r\n\u201cUgh\u2026 so you know about that, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cKnow about it?\u201d Aun laughed, \u201cMeiling wouldnt stop flaunting it to all her friends and family! By the way, do you have a twitter account? Her mom and sisters were asking for it.\u201d Aw, dang it! What is she dragging you into?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, for safety and security reasons, I dont have a twitter account,\u201d you answer, \u201cand also, whatever Meiling told you was going on between me and her, it's really exaggerated. I'm not her boyfriend.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI know. Youre her fiance.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFIANCE?!\u201d you'd drop a glass upon hearing that word if you were holding one, \u201cnow hold on, we NEVER got that far!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBut she said you popped the questioned shortly after that twitter post,\u201d Aun adds, \u201clike immediately after she rescued you from being attacked by a rabid were-rabbit.\u201d OH C'MON! \u201cHeck, she even marked you!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cShe did NOT mark me!\u201d you snap.<br>\r\n\u201cThen what's that?\u201d she points to the bandage around your neck.<br>\r\n\u201cOne of the vampire brats bit me,\u201d you answer, still cringing from the pain Remilia left there, \u201cand that was  just to drink my blood.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh,\u201d Aun seemed to finally get the hint\u2026 at least until her eyes widened, \u201cOH! So she put her mark SOMEWHERE ELSE?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNO. SHE. DID. NOT.\u201d you emphasize, but lion-mutt was not hearing it.<br>\r\n\u201cIt's ok, I wont ask where she put it!\u201d Aun said with a wink. Good lord, you give up. It's pointless to argue with her. Besides, you cant entirely blame her\u2026 SOMEBODY'S been putting those ideas in her head!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, if youre having wedding jitters, you dont need to worry,\u201d Aun would not shut up about it, \u201cyou should be honored to be selected as a proper mate by such a fierce but lovely noble dragon! Quite a lot of males from her homeland would kill for the opportunity to be noticed by her! One of them did.\u201d You hope it wasnt that Hao Long fellow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell she is a very lovely\u2026 er\u2026 female dragon,\u201d you admit, \u201cstill, I'm gonna need to have a talk with her later.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou can talk with her right now,\u201d Aun suggests, \u201cshe's currently bathing in Scarlet Mansion's personal hot spring.\u201d This place has a hot spring?! \u201cNormally, nobody else is allowed in the hot spring while it's in use, but she said you were the only exception for obvious reasons!\u201d Did Aun need to wink?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if the list of things giving you massive headaches wasnt massive enough! This is probably not end well for you if you let Meiling gossip wildly about you like this. She's already rubbed a certain obsessive bunny girl the wrong way. And now that cute but mentally ill and incredibly dangerous girl is an enemy! Imagine making more enemies! What if you already made an enemy out of this Hao Long guy?! Or hell, what if you made an enemy out of Wriggle, whom you've had sex with on the first night and can STILL feel the crazy sparks?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt might be for the best to stop this potential powder keg while it's still (hopefully) premature!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...You know, unless part of you actually wants to make it work? Who says you CANT fall for Meiling? Even your guard dog approves!</span></div></div>",

You don\u2019t know if this was a trick to do some dating with this kosuzu person, and it would be a trap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cAlright, but under one condition.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cAnd that is?\u201d Patchy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI\u2019m bringing aun and Arnold with me in case something happened to me.\u201d You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cAlright, alright. Fine, just please get me those books back.\u201d Patchy replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You nodded and got toward the gate. As you got outside, you saw Arnold using his jiu jitsu on one of the guards and he let her go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cArnold, I need you to accompany me.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cTo where?\u201d Arnold asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cTo the human village.\u201d You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cAlright.\u201d Arnold replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI know the way, so please follow me!\u201d Aun said with smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You nodded and started to move out. It took you at least an hour and you three made to the human village. The area were quiet modern as the buildings were quite modern, then as aun searched for the book store, she found it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cThis is it.\u201d Aun said with smile, \u201cI\u2019ll guard you while your inside.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cSame here.\u201d Arnold replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Thanks.\u201d You thanked them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You\u2019ve got in and it was filled with books, and someone came out. It was a girl with light brown hair and pony tailed and had Japanese book store shoppish cloth on and she came to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cHi there! How can I help you?\u201d Girl asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cUm, are you kosuzu?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWhy, yes I am....wait, are you the employee that patchoulie called?\u201d Kosuzu asked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cYes I am. Do you have the books she wants?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cYes I do. Wait for moment.\u201d Kosuzu replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She went back in to get the books. You thought to yourself she\u2019s a nice girl, but kept in mind that this is business only. 6 minutes passed and she came back with tones of books.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cHere\u2019s the books, tell patchouli I\u2019m grateful.\u201d Kosuzu replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cNo problem.\u201d You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As you were about to leave, you heard a thunder roaring and both you and kosuzu came out.

One far more so than the other and the other you probably shouldnt be TOO familiar with out of fear of ending up in prison! Hello again, Reisen and Tewi! You couldve sworn you locked the door (you did, they just had a separate key!).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Reisen! Tewi!\" you nearly jumped up out of the bath as you tried to cover up your certain areas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHiya Alex-kun!\u201d Tewi gleefully greeted you as Reisen just looked back at you rather nervously, \u201chope we werent interrupting something important!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI'm\u2026 taking a bath!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cGreat!\u201d Tewi beamed, \u201cwe arrived just in time!\u201d She gleefully trotted over to you while Reisen reluctantly followed behind.<br>\r\n\u201cEr, whatever this is about, cant it wait until later?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\nTewi shook her head, \u201cNope! Considering youre not even supposed to be hear to begin with,\u201d she leered over at Reisen who lowered her head a little, \u201ctime is of the essence before shit hits the fan.\u201d Oh yeah. Youre pretty sure this is not the end of it. Not by a longshot. Reisen just kidnapped you after all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReisen, you know Anna's not gonna take what you did lying down!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI-I know,\u201d she stutters, \u201ca-and I'm sorry I got a little carried away.\u201d A LITTLE?! \u201cB-but I couldnt just abandon you in that cursed mansion with all those creepy blood-sucking predators! It's bad enough they made you lose your innocence to another guy.\u201d Aw god, THIS again?!<br>\r\n\u201cFor the last time, Wriggle's a girl!\u201d you tell her, \u201ca GIRL!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, yeah, I know. I should know better than to assume somebody's gender identity.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo no no! She's a BIOLOGICAL girl! I was penetrating her VAGINA!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAlex-sama, it's ok. It's in the past now.\u201d This conversation was getting you nowhere. But you DIDNT fuck a boy! You needed to stress hard that you dont swing that way!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cANYWAYS, we're not here to discuss your sexual flexibility,\u201d fucking Tewi, \u201cwe actually need to talk to you about something far more important: Your future with us.\u201d She then looked over to Reisen and jerked her head your way!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReisen gulped as she squeezed her bathrobe.<br>\r\n\u201cI kinda-\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cKINDA?\u201d Tewi interrupted her.<br>\r\nReisen sighed, \u201cAlright, I COMPLETELY lied to master when I brought you here unconscious. I told her that I found you clinging to life after you were attacked by Wriggle and several of his twin brothers.\u201d You gritted your teeth, but you let her continue! \u201cNeither she nor the princess know that I kidnapped you. And once they find out, theyre gonna throw you out of here.\u201d Ugh. But it makes sense. Anna caused a scene and dragged you out of here. Youre pretty much putting this place in jeopardy just being here!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlso, even without the knowledge of pissing off your sister,\u201d Tewi explained, \u201cEientei is strictly private territory restricted to only moon rabbits, staff, and patients. You are no longer staff and you wont be a patient for long. If anything, youre a trespasser.\u201d Of course.<br>\r\nThen the brat grinned confidently, \u201cHowever\u2026 you CAN be a moon rabbit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare blankly.<br>\r\n\u201cA what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA certified bonna fide legally registered rabbit citizen of the moon!\u201d Tewi explained, \u201cthanks to our certain connections not even the princess knows about, we know of a special legal loophole that'd grant you official moon rabbit citizenship\u2026 providedyourescindyourcitizenshipasanearthboundhuman.\u201d What was that last part?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI've already forged paperwork and even had your ID issued,\u201d Reisen explains as she reaches into her cleaves and plucks out an ID with your picture on it. An actual 'Federation of the United Lunar Colonies' national ID\u2026 with all your fake details\u2026 and fake name!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlex Udongein Inaba?\u201d you read off the last name suspiciously as Reisen looked away nervously, \u201clet me guess. I'm your husband?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo, youre OUR husband!\u201d Tewi smirked with pride, \u201cas per youre new identity, youre a very rare male rabbit whom we claimed full marital custody of, preventing any potential efforts of 'studding'. Long story short, youre OUR guy alone, so the other bunny bitches cant put their hands on you when we ever get back to the Capital.\u201d You had no idea what she meant but it all sounded like a lot more trouble than it's worth! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll that's left for you to do is to sign a little paper saying you forfeit your citizenship as a human of earth and you'll be set!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cForfeit my citizenship?!\u201d you didnt like the sound of that, \u201cwas exactly would that entail?!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cEr\u2026 quite a bit,\u201d Tewi admits, \u201cbut dont worry, your options might be limited here on earth, but you'll have tons of opportunities up in Lunar Capital!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI dont think I can go through with this. I mean this is one awfully big commitment! Marriage is one thing, especially to TWO wives, but tossing away my life as a human?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust us! You'll love being a moon rabbit!\" Tewi assures you. Youre obviously not convinced. \"After all, being a moon rabbit comes with MAJOR advantages!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reisen?\" Tewi turns to her purple-haired companion. Reisen swallows hard and stepped a little closer to you. And then she undid her robe leaving her lovely body scantily clad in a matching and equally mesmerizing pair of blue and white striped bra and panties!<br>\r\nYour eyes widened, pretty much unable to look away the exquisite striped ensemble! As if you couldnt already force yourself to look away, your attention draws to the bottle of oil she was squeezing over her blue and white striped bra clad breasts and thoroughly rubbing the liquid all over them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R...Reisen? What are you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you perhaps familiar with a 'Puff-Puff'? Tewi explains as you were too astonished to answer, \"obviously not. A Puff-Puff is a special therapudic rubdown a bunny-girl administers to someone using a specific part of her body to ease their aching muscles.\" You beam with total interest staring as Reisen nervously coats her boobs in that special liquid in preparation for her special massage she's about to deliver! Ignoring all the wasted liquid dripping down the rest of her irresistable body including the little that passed down her equally alluring striped panties, she cups her liquid boated breasts, ready to administer the Puff-Puff!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HOWEVER!\" Tewi interrupts,\"due to strict Lunarian laws, moon rabbits are only allowed to deliver Puff-Puffs to other moon rabbits!\" What? \"Sorry, it's against the law for Reisen to Puff-Puff someone outside her race. Punishable by decades in prison and/or swift execution.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, she cant possibly be serious! This has GOTTA be a trick! Why is Reisen going along with it?! ...And why are you having such a hard time calling her bluff?! C'mon, you know this is an awful idea! No good can come out of literally signing away your 'identity' as a human! As if it you werent already worrying your sister half to death! (as if she needs ANOTHER reason to put Reisen on her To Kill list!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Alex-kun,\" Tewi smirks like the conniving brat she is, \"you ready to sign away your old life and and welcome yourself into your new more fulfilling life as a fellow rabbit?\"<br>\r\n\"!!!\" Reisen jumped in surprise as Tewi squeezed her boobs!<br>\r\n \"...Or is this gorgeous bunny vixen before you gonna have to show off her special world-famous massage technique on some OTHER lucky bunny babe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoure not seriously gonna fall for this silly trick, are you?!</span></div></div>",

Caught you a bit by surprise, but damned if it wasnt what you needed to ease your tension! Granted that fluster only lasted for a few seconds before you snapped out of it. Right in time to see Reisen smiling sweetly at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, hubby!\" she greeted you with new giddiness. You still prefer 'Alex-sama', but you'll get used to that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Reise-\"<br>\r\n*Smooch!*<br>\r\nShe snuck in another kiss on the lips! Again, the fluster. Man, she was even perkier than ever! Perhaps being a newlywed done that to her. Ergg! Turn away or youre gonna get lost in that irresistible twinkle in her red eyes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong, hubby?\" she tilted her head curiously as her ears twitched, \"you seem tense? ...Do you need another Puff-Puff?\"<br>\r\nYour brain literally screamed 'FUCK YES!' but you needed to hold it back cuz you had bigger problems that not even a thorough full body boob-massage was gonna treat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, ahem!\" you turned away trying to hold back your fluster, \"uh, Reisen! I just got off the phone with Anna's bodyguard.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, the steroid-juiced body builder that blocked the bullet meant for that scaley-cunted home wrecker?\" geez, Reisen! Pull it back a bit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" you answered casually, \"he called to tell me that Anna is really upset. I dont think my sister is gonna take what you did lying down.\"<br>\r\nReisen frowned, still a bit ashamed of what she did, \"I know. I know what I did was reckless and very selfish. But I know I did the right thing! Youre not safe at that mansion! I've heard stories of the kinds of crazy things that go on there! If certain grizzly inhabitants dont bleed you dry or rape you to death, you'd probably be used as a guinea pig in Chang'e knows what kinds of weird ungodly experiments!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah... like being put up to mate with a firefly youkai to see if you and her could successfully breed. AND IT WAS A 'HER', GODDAMNIT!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides...\" she blushes, \"us rabbits should stick together!\" You couldnt help but blush back.<br>\r\n\"Well... I do agree that a male rabbit's proper place is alongside his... um, what's a female rabbit referred to as?\"<br>\r\n\"A doe,\" she answered. Like deer?<br>\r\n\"Thanks, my beloved doe.\" She giggled at your attempt to sound suave. \"But anyways, my sis is very protective of me. She might try to hunt you down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReisen doesnt seem to be bothered by that warning.<br>\r\n\"No problem. I happen to have a decent hideaway house on a hill not far from here,\" she insists, \"It's sorta my vacation home for whenever I finally get a week or so off work here. Not even Tewi knows about the place... and I'd appreciate it if you keep it that way, if you know what I mean!\" She winks. \"If you'd like, I can show you it, later tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was very tempting. Of course, she already had you at 'another Puff-Puff'! It'd be awful rude and inconsiderate to turn down such a spectacularly generous offer from your own wife!<br>\r\n...Hang on a sec. Later tonight. Arnold warned you about a full moon. And the calendar said there was gonna be a full moon tonight! Right, back to reality!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait,\" you interject, \"Arnold mentioned something about a full moon.\"<br>\r\nReisen's ears twitched conveniently matching her wide-eyed expression.<br>\r\n\"He said I would regret my decision to be here when the moon is full,\" you explained, \"does something bad happen on a full moon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReisen suddenly got a little nervous.... as if a familiar awful flashback occurred in her mind.<br>\r\n\"Ummmmmmm....\" she dragged her 'um' for almost half a minute, \"...no, I wouldnt say 'bad' per se. It's really nothing a couple of locked doors, a few new sets of clothes, and a large bottle of lube cant take care of.\" What?<br>\r\n\"What happens?\" you get curious.<br>\r\nShe gets really REALLY nervous, \"N-n-nothing major. Although I MIGHT get a bit more cuddly with you if you dont mind. Well of course you dont mind! You are my hubby, after all!\" Curiouser and curiouser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyways, I'd love to chat some more, but I do have a few chores master wants me to do real soon,\" she seemed quick to end this chain of discussion quickly, \"but before I go, though...\" she blushes again, seeming quick to return to ANOTHER chain of discussion, \"d...do you want to go check out my hideaway home later on tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain tempting.

Once you\u2019ve got in, the inside were terrific.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cReisen, how did you manage to afford this place?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cSimple, I used my changes I\u2019ve keep hiding from master and I bought this place.\u201d Reisen replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWow...just wow. Even Maeve wouldn\u2019t allow me and my sis to move in like this.\u201d You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As you got in deeper, you noticed reisen rushing the doors and locking the door. She then tells you she\u2019ll be sleeping alone for tonight but will be together tomorrow. You nodded and she went into her private room. You sat down on the chair and started to relax until you heard an small \u2018bang\u2019 noise from outside. You looked out and noticed a orangish light not too away from your new place. You noticed it was Eienteis route and your fear grew little, but kept it to yourself and relaxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n -Eientei-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n There were fire around the area and both eirin and Kaguya And Tewi  were outside fighting Arnold and Anna themselves! They were fighting through the area then eirin spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWhere is reisen? I thought she was with you?\u201d Eirin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWhat? I never let her in incase there were trouble!?\u201d Tewi replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI\u2019m tired of your rambling, bitch! Where is my brother!?\u201d Anna shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cHe was with us because he was unconscious by wriggle!\u201d Eirin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cLies! Your bitch bunny stole from me!\u201d Anna shouted in anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cReisen....did she lied to me?\u201d Eirin whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cNow now, don\u2019t get too irrational Anna. Lady eirin, where\u2019s Alex?\u201d Arnold asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cShe might have snuck away from us.\u201d Tewi replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n There were horror rushing down from them and Eirin wanted clear answer but then Arnold put out his arms and struck a blue lightning from his fingers toward Kaguya. She shouted in pain as it stuck her deeply, Arnold struck her again and she screamed in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cNo! Don\u2019t!\u201d Eirin pleaded, \u201cI don\u2019t know where they went! Please don\u2019t hurt our lady!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Just then, a long purple haired female with skull mask on her face appeared behind Anna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWe have located your brother, Anna.\u201d Female said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cGood, we will go after them...oh, before I go, here\u2019s a little farewell present.\u201d Anna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She took out some sort of a launcher with a bomb on and she pulled the trigger. The bomb went away and the three dodged the bomb only to be struck toward the facility, exploding with mushroom cloud up on the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI sense...radiation! Quick Tewi! Let the remaining survivors out!\u201d Eirin ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cY-yes master!\u201d Tewi replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n -secret hideout-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You felt unnerving to know what\u2019s going to happen to reisen and the Eientei crew. You wondered if reisen were ok, then suddenly you hear a clicking noise and you turned around only to see a tall man with orange right arm and a skull mask on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWhat the-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u201cYou\u2019ll come with me, mr.whitestone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Without you replying or running away, he got you and got out only to hear a noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cMy hubby....IS MIIINNNE!!!!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n You heard a pounding noise from reisens private room and the skull masked man just rushed you and himself out until the door slammed open and you saw reisen....in different mode. She was more muscular and her eyes were red, and she was looking for someone to cuddle and fight. The skull masked man took out an dagger and sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cIf it\u2019s time to fight, then I shall do it discreetly.\u201d Man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He started to run fast and fought her as you were in shaky situation, you were greeted by...</span></div></div>",

Granted, you wouldnt mind doing it again after a while, but it takes a tremendous toll on your body. As soon as the convulsions end, your vision gets blurry, your eyes get heavy, and you get incredibly tired. You could make out the look of surprise on Wriggle and Yamame's faces before everything goes black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear. Uh, Yamame, I think he fainted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!! No fair!! I aint got a chance to drill him yet!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sadly, the human learns far too late that mating with a firefly youkai can be far more... 'electrifying' than he can handle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n********************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour fantastic dream of being a magnificent Sultan being blissfully ravished in the middle of a glowing Wriggle harem has come to an end as you woke up aching head to toe. As you took your time to allow your muscles to recover, you assess the new surrounding and find yourself lying on a bed of someone's bedroom littered with bookshelves! Despite your brain being a little dizzy, you quickly figure out whose bedroom this belongs to as soon as you catch sight of Patchouli sitting at a desk sipping her tea and reading a book. Sadly, neither Wriggle and the other girl were anywhere to be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, youre finally up!\" Patchouli got up out of her seat and brought over a teacup and teapot, \"wow, you sure slept rather soundly.\"<br>\r\nYou were just about to get out of bed, but you ached way too much to lift yourself up.<br>\r\n\"Hold on, dont rush it,\" she poured tea in a cup, \"drink this first. It'll help you recover.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" you groaned and sipped a little, paying no attention to how hot it was despite nearly burning your tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" not even waiting for you to recover, she leaned in and smiled, \"...how was your date?\" Memories of that night flash back in your head.<br>\r\n\"A hell of a first,\" you answer truthfully, \"I er... didnt really expect so much on a first night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, most feral youkai arent really reserved or interested in taking things slow,\" Patchouli stated, \"once it's that time of the year, it doesnt matter what base you made it to, their eggs need fertilizing!\" Well that'll take some getting used to. Then again, you kinda already had a sample of that with Reisen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, about... that... what happened with us... well... would it be hazardous to my health?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatchouli shook her head, \"You'll be fine. Those pains youre feeling from the shocks, they'll go away really fast. Although you might wanna avoid strenuous activity for at least a few hours.\" Dang. But damned if it wasnt worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So when am I able to date Wriggle again?\" you asked.<br>\r\n\"Never.\"<br>\r\n\"What do you mean never?\" you woulda done a double-take, but it'd hurt too much moving your neck like that.<br>\r\n\"You already gave Wriggle what she needed,\" she answered like it was a matter of fact, \"so she doesnt need you anymore.\"<br>\r\nFor all the right reasons, youre a bit upset. \"What?! Why?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Gee, did I forget to tell you?\" Ms. Knowledge bopped herself on the forehead, \"firefly youkai dont mate for life. Typically, the whole purpose for mating is primarily to secure the bloodline than actual pleasure. And once the tests come out positive, you've already fulfilled that purpose.\u201d<br>\r\nHearing that hurt you a lot more than it shouldve. She was not only saying you were just a fling, but a fling meant simply for impregnating, nothing else!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut\u2026 what about\u2026 I mean\u2026 well, er\u2026. well, what about our kids, I mean I'm still their father so-\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh you dont have to worry about them. Wriggle's boss will find decent jobs for them,\u201d she assured you, possibly not understanding why youre really upset, \u201cI'm really sorry, Alex. Look on the bright side. You made that poor lonely girl a very happy expected mother. You mightve even made her *cough*andme*cough* world famous what with her soon to birth a whole new hybrid species!\u201d THAT'S supposed to make you feel better?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, at least she's happy. It doesnt seem fair, but human and youkai are completely different species with completely different cultures and values. Darn shame. Youre really gonna miss Wriggle. And that whole shock-sex thing. You could totally get used to that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut dont feel bad,\u201d Patchouli smiled, \u201cthere's plenty more girls where that came from. I happen to know of a particular one that just might be in your league.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh?\u201d you said, pretending to care.<br>\r\n\u201cYep,\u201d she nodded enthusiastically, \u201cmy pal Parsee's been giving subtle hints about how she's feeling lonely. Well, 'subtle' aint the word. More like she'll never shut the hell up about it. *Ahem* Anyways, she's a very modest girl. Yep. Modest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou squint your eyes, \u201cUh huh.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, poor Parsee spends way too much time hanging out at a bridge feeling sorry for herself and hanging out with big dumb lushes that are seriously trouble! I, as her sorta best friend, believe she deserves a change!\u201d <br>\r\nYoure getting bad feelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! And dont worry about being a fling! Trust me you wont!\u201d Ms. Knowledge tells you with certainty, \u201cin fact, if she really likes you (in her own way), she might get a bit clingy! Really clingy!\u201d<br>\r\nYou raised your eyebrow and eye the book on her desk.<br>\r\nIt's actually a composition book. So she's currently writing instead of reading, eh? What is she writing, you wonder?<br>\r\nWhatever it was, you spotted the title she wrote on it: 'The Hashihime and Me'. Genre: Romance/Horror?</span></div></div>",

And maybe bugs but mostly grass. Which isnt a bad thing, because it's dark out. No stars in the sky and you couldnt make out the new moon. It was almost pitch black. You really shoulda carried a flashlight. But instead you could only rely on your blind date to guide you and hope she isnt deceiving you or anything like that. Hopefully it'd be an unlikely scenario considering it was Patchoulie's idea to set you up on this blind date. If something bad were to happen to you, she'd be in Anna's mercy. And Anna aint known for mercy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWriggle at least knew where she needed to go and she seemed like a nice girl, so you trust her. Still, you didnt like walking blindly in the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee, it's kinda dark,\" you speak up.<br>\r\n\"It's no problem,\" Wriggle assures you, \"I'm used to this route. I can get to where we need to go with my eyes closed.\"<br>\r\n\"Still, I certainly cant,\" you say, \"did you bring a flashlight or anything?\"<br>\r\n\"No, but if you need light, I've just got the thing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen suddenly, there was a bright light around you that illuminated the field. It was plenty bright now. Sure there still wasnt much to see, but you felt more secure to at least see where youre going. However, it was where the light was coming from that made you do a double-take. She wasnt carrying a light on her person. Her midsection itself was glowing!<br>\r\n\"Better?\"<br>\r\n\"Y...yeah,\" you stare at Wriggle dumbfounded, \"h...how are you doing that?\"<br>\r\nShe just smiled and patted her butt... the brightest part of her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared unblinkingly at a complete loss for words. You should already expect such oddities from youkai and even certain fairies, but dating a girl who's ass can glow is still a new experience. ...You are both confused AND kinda aroused at the same time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you followed Wriggle down the open field now lit up by her butt until you came across a swarm of fireflies. Hundreds if not thousands of them buzzing all around. Wriggle casually walked right through the swarm like it was nothing. It was a little difficult for you, considering when you tried to go through them, they buzzed all over you. Loads of them got in your face, way too close to your eyes and mouth and you began to worry they were gonna fly up places you really didnt want them flying up in!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swat at them trying to get them out of your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, dont hurt them!\u201d the nightbug youkai was stressed by your action, \u201ctheyre just making sure youre not a threat to me.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026!! I'm not\u2026 egh!\u201d you speak as you constantly try avoiding the bugs flying toward your eyes and mouth, \u201ccant you.. grrr\u2026 just tell them I'm not?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI did,\u201d she did, \u201cbut the thing is they act on impulse\u2026 just bare with it for a little while. I promise it'll be over soon.\u201d As much as you hated being swarmed by bugs, you took her word and put up with it for the most uncomfortable minute of your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute of permanent mental traumatizing, the damn bugs finally buzzed away. You shivered in places you didnt know you had but for your blind date's sake, you continued to hold out. Thankfully, your destination was reached. You saw a small little house at the end of the field with a lot of fireflies buzzing around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe're here,\u201d Wriggle said with a bit of glee that warmed your heart as her butt-light dimmed down, \u201cthis is my home. Come on in.\u201d Hm. Being invited into a girl's house on the first night? That's actually a major step in the relationship very early, but remembering Patchoulie's books, that might have been part of the plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little issue. The house wasnt very tidy. Well it kinda was, but it had a bit of a bug problem. It had bugs crawling all over the place. Cockroaches crawling across the floor. Crickets chirping at the windowsill. Roly-polies in the ferns. Ants going after leftover snacks on the living room table. A bees nest right up in the corner of the room.<br>\r\n\u201cThis is my humble abode!\u201d Wriggle says with pride, \u201cbuilt it all by myself! Er\u2026 with the help of all these tenants here, of course!\u201d She was referring to the bugs. Cripes almighty.<br>\r\n\u201cIt's\u2026.\u201d you swallowed, trying to keep a straight face, \u201c\u2026it's really nice. Really nice work you did here. *Gulp* You ALL did here!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMake yourself at home. Dont forget to take your shoes off,\u201d she tells you. You cringed again, but you took off your shoes, praying the centipedes nearby werent gonna make a beeline for them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave a seat. I'll go whip us something up to eat,\u201d Wriggle headed over to the kitchen as you gazed over at the couch occupied by dozens of beetles. There was a small rocking chair that didnt have bugs crawling on it, so you sat your non-glowing butt in it while eyeing the bugs cautiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat there in silence as the sounds of buzzing annoyed you. You told yourself not to pay attention to the big green buzzing beetles flying across the room, but their buzzing was irritating you and you kept having images in your head of them flying right into you and splattering their buggy guts all over your face!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's your first date and already you dont think this relationship is gonna work long-term. It pains you that she wont approve of you calling an exterminator. If anything, that lovable mentally ill bunny girl might have been a more tolerable choice. Boy do you miss her. You hope she's doing ok.<br>\r\nThen again, maybe youre overthinking this way too early. You barely know Wriggle and just havent warmed up to her yet despite Patchouli's obvious plan. Besides, if there's one unique positive about her\u2026 well, her ass comes in real handy during a blackout!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk! It's ready!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeak of the devil (and he shall appear). Wriggle returns from the kitchen with a tray that consists of  a sandwich with grayish sticky jelly substance in it and a glass of thick yellowish/orangeish honey-like liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, I'm kinda neglected to go grocery shopping lately,\u201d Wriggle apologized, \u201cso I was kinda short on ingredients. I just had enough stuff to whip up a lightly seasoned snail sandwich and a nice protein pollen smoothie!\u201d You eyed the snail sandwich and pollen smoothie very very cautiously while trying to keep a straight face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can pick which one you want,\u201d Wriggle offered, \u201cI'll just have the one you dont.\u201d You didnt want either. Eating splattered gooey snail between two slices of bread made you cringe. Then again, Escargot is a delicacy in parts of Europe. Not that it encourages you to start eating snails!<br>\r\nThe pollen smoothies seems slightly more appealing in comparison. But you dont consider drinking pollen very appealing to begin with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut despite the rational part of your brain telling you not to consider eating either, you dont want to seem rude in front of your date. So while secretly praying that it doesnt make you sick, you politely choose...</span></div></div>",

What if this particular pollen is safe to consume for bug(youkai)s, but not humans? Youre awful certain that bug(YOUKAI)s have a particular diet consisting of many types of foods that human beings shouldnt dare touch due to them being particularly toxic and/or harmful to your body. Would you dare share the same meal of a dung beetle?! ...Not that I'm implying that Wriggle eats shit or anything, I'm just saying 'what if'! And it's a BIG 'WHAT IF'!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for snails... well, as bad as it sounds, if it's good enough to be a delicacy for certain parts of Europe, it should be good enough for you. At least youre not getting a side of maggot cheese to go with it! UGGGHH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... I'll pick the...\" you do your best to hide your disgust before answering, \"...snail sandwich.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Ok,\" Wriggle handed you the sandwich, \"alright, I guess I'll manage with the smoothie then.\" She sounded a little disappointed. Maybe she really wanted the sandwich. Too late to change your mind, unfortunately! Sorry!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hesitated to put that sandwich in your mind, but it seemed like the eyes of the world were upon you. Or at least far more eyes than Wriggles. Quite a lot of those bugs littering her house had their dozen or so eyes on you. You hated to look like a bad host, so you took a deep breath and took a deep bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, it was nothing like you expect tail would taste like. Salty, bitter, incredibly gooey, but with the right kind of sauce and seasoning mixed into it, it wasnt that bad. The closest you could describe it would be like gooified tuna. Something that tastes like that with this kind of texture is very very weird. But overall, it certainly wasnt disgusting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow is it?\u201d Wriggle asked as she sipped her pollen drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's\u2026 not bad,\u201d you boldly admit, \u201cnever had snail, so this is a new experience for me. But it's certainly a lot better than I thought it would taste.\u201d The bug youkai wasnt exactly certain whether it was really a compliment, but she chalked it up as her being ignorant to fancy city-boy lingo or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the odd texture to match the tuna-like taste, you manage to scarf down half the sandwich and still show no sign of stopping. So far, the blind date isnt a complete waste of time. The only gripe you have so far is the bug infestation that happens to be your date's tenants. Somehow, the fact that her butt can luminate a whole room makes up for it! Granted, you personally think Reisen has a nicer butt, but you gotta put Eientei behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMr. Whitstone, what do you do for a living?\u201d Wriggle opened up the dialog with a question that didnt have an easy answer.<br>\r\n\u201cWell, at the moment, I'm not doing anything,\u201d you tell her, \u201cI used to be affiliated with a cartel until my sister and I got into major trouble with them. We have to lay low for a while.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDid you do something really bad?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n\u201cMore like I DIDNT do something really bad,\u201d you answer. Thankfully she was polite enough not to pursue the subject, \u201cand how about you? What do you do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, for a short while, I used to run a bug delivery service,\u201d the bug girl answers, \u201cbasically, when customers needed certain bugs to help pollinate their flowers and crops, or keep away other pests, or just wanted particular pets, I'd be in charge of delivering them right to their door. Unfortunately, it didnt do as well as I hoped, so I ended up closing down.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh, that's too bad,\u201d you say, eyeing the swarms of bugs eerily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCurrently, I'm hired by a caretaker at the Garden of the Sun to help watch her sunflower beds,\u201d she continues, \u201cmake sure theyre well taken care of and protect them from wild intruders or pests.\u201d So she's hired to protect a garden? Hm.<br>\r\n\u201cIs it a tough job?\u201d you ask.<br>\r\n\u201cNot really,\u201d she says, \u201cmost of the trespassers are easy to scare off as soon as I sic the bees on them!\u201d You heard a couple of loud buzzes of pride coming from the beehive in the corner.<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I'd imagine that'd scare off a ton of people,\u201d you comment while at the same time holding back a shudder!<br>\r\n\u201cAs it should,\u201d Wriggle added, \u201cunlike other bees, MINE dont just sting you and die. They sting you hundreds of times, then they give off a pheromone to alert the other bees that youre a threat, then they ALL swarm you and sting you hundreds of times!\u201d Geez, luiz! Pray to whatever god or gods you worship, Wriggle doesnt suddenly go yandere on you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut besides that job, lately I've been going to school,\u201d  Wriggle thankfully changed the course of discussion to something more pleasant.<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah?\u201d you got your own two cents in, \u201cI'm thinking of going back to school myself once the heat dies down.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cYou really should,\u201d Wriggle suggests, \u201cMs. Kamishirasawa is the best teacher I ever had. She knows practically everything!\u201d You already forgot what her name is.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat does Ms. Kamashamashariah teach?\u201d you ask, completely skewering her teacher's name.<br>\r\n\u201cOh she teaches a bit of everything,\u201d Wriggle answers and goes down the list, \u201cshe teaches math, history, spelling, geography, the alphabet...\u201d Alphabet?<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026 what college does she teach at?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...College?\u201d Wriggle tilted her head. That shouldnt have gone over her head. You made another guess.<br>\r\n\u201cOh, it's an adult school?\u201d<br>\r\nWriggle shook her head, \u201cNo, I dont see any adults in my class. Just their kids and a few orphans whose parents were eaten by youkai.\u201d Grimm. And now you have TWO reasons to feel uneasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHm,\u201d you kept a straight face as you took another bite of your snail sandwich. After swallowing dow enough, you finally ask, \u201cHow old are you, Wriggle?\u201d<br>\r\nWriggle\u2026 well, she looked upwards, staring in deep thought. Not a good side.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 dont know.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou dont know?\u201d you question that answer.<br>\r\n\u201cTo be honest, I got bored with counting all those days every single just to find out what and when my birthday is,\u201d Wriggle gave you the oddest answer, \u201cI dont even remember how many days is was since I stopped counting. Ugh\u2026 just thinking back at all those days is making my head hurt.\u201d<br>\r\nShe forgot how she old she is\u2026 because she stopped counting the days in each year. Is this really making sense to you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut dont you have a birth certificate or something?\u201d you asked. Wriggle shook her head. \u201cWe didnt have that kind of technology where I came from.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThe hospital didnt have the technology to keep a record of your birth?!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI wasnt born in a hospital,\u201d she explained, \u201cit was more like a\u2026 um\u2026 little hut out in a small rural farm village. I cant even remember where this village was or if it still exists.\u201d Wow. This is certainly interesting. So either she's so old, she was born during an era where such record keeping was hard to come by\u2026 or she's still young but just grew up dirt poor. Determining whether she was legal age was a coin toss! Not only that, it made you feel how much more privileged you were compared to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do know that I'm at least old enough to have kids!\u201d she suddenly blurts out oblivious of how awkward she made herself look, \u201cthat's because my backside glows! When a firefly youkai comes of age, she's able to activate her luminating ability. It's not just to light up dark areas, it's primary use is actually to attract a mate.\u201d to demonstrate, she turns around and bends over and her butt magically lights up with an incredibly bright glow! \u201cSee?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was kinda hard for you NOT to look at her ass while she had it sticking out at you and glowing brightly, definitelt making itself the center of attention! Not even the threat of burning your retinas deterred you!<br>\r\n\u201cYes\u2026 I\u2026 see...\u201d you really really really REALLY hope she's legal age! \u201cIt's\u2026 incredibly bright!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep! It can be seen up to 2 nautical miles away!\u201d Wriggle educates you\u2026 while still showing off her blazing bright behind, \u201cthat's over 12,000 feet away according to what Ms. Kamishirasawa taught me.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat's amazing,\u201d you exclaim, still unable to look away from dat blindingly bright ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the glow of her backside dims down, snapping you out of the trance, but leaving your vision in kind of a fuzz for a while.<br>\r\nEven Wriggle notices your pupils were having a hard time focusing and she blushes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeheh, sorry. Guess I dont know my own strength.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat's alright, Wriggle,\u201d you tell her, \u201cI can see why you use it to attract a mate. It was certainly hard to take my eyes off it.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cTh\u2026 thank you, Alex,\u201d Wriggle blushed with flattery. You really really really REALLY TIMES INFINITY hope she's legal age!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so a bit of time passes by without anything out of the ordinary were to occur, that is until...</span></div></div>",

She asked you if youre sure you didnt want any and you assured her that you were good (trying not to make it obvious you were scared it wasnt safe for human consumption!). Again, she seemed a bit more disappointed than you expected hearing you turn her offer down. She seriously did want you to try that pollen concoction! Guess she took pride in making her smoothies, huh?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNonetheless, you waited patiently for Wriggle to come back as you continued eating your snail sandwich and watching bugs cautiously, hoping none of them will buzz into your food and contaminate it. You kept questioning whether the food was even safe for you to eat, but then you also reminded yourself that youre possibly pushing incompatible boundaries dating a bug youkai, so shut up and eat your stupid sandwich!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere we see the human male attempting to adapt in the female firefly youkai's habitat.\u201d<br>\r\nSuddenly, you overhear a familiar voice narrating.<br>\r\n\u201cHe sits waiting patiently for his potential mate to return while at the same time looking hesitant being around so many creatures outside his species.\u201d<br>\r\nYou hear the narrator's voice just outside the window! It wasnt hard to guess, but lo and behold it was none other than that crafty librarian herself\u2026 filming Wriggle's house with a camera! ...And in some sort of bubble for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glanced over at the bugs who didnt seem at all interested then reached over to the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPossibly filled with nervousness and anxiety from the inevitable human/bug youkai coitus, he decides to open the window and get some fresh air-\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cPATCHOULI?!!\u201d<br>\r\nShe immediately jumps with fright then pauses the recording and shushes you. \u201cSSSHH!! Keep your voice down! I'm trying to work here!\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cWork?!\u201d you whispered with exclamation points, \u201cPeeping on people with a camcorder is work?!<br>\r\n\u201cThis time, it is!\u201d she explains, \u201cperhaps you mightve gotten the subtle hints earlier, but I'm kinda trying to film a nature documentary.\u201d You squinted your eyes as she continued, \u201cInvolving the birth of a brand new human/firefly youkai hybrid species.\u201d Ugh\u2026 you figured as much! So much for a blind date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cD-Does Wriggle even know youre doing this?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201c...Not yet. But I'll tell her\u2026 while we're discussing royalties.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cLook, you better leave!\u201d you warn her, \u201cbefore you get\u2026 you know\u2026 discovered!\u201d You usher over to the wasp nest in the corner of the room.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no need to worry about me,\u201d Patchouli assures, \u201cthanks to this bug repellent bubble I picked up at the Ravine! It's 100% non-detectable by 99.99% of all bug antennae radar!\u201d That silly little bubble's supposed to keep her from being detected by bugs? Well, seeing as though the wasps STILL havent descended on her, stung her a billion times, then gave off pheromones to alert neighboring hives to sting a billion times, guess it's working!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyways, just pretend I'm not here,\u201d she instructs you, \u201cjust keep putting on the charm and make sure to give me a good view when youre tapping her sparking ass!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cEr, and if she thinks it's too early to be doing something like that on the first night?\u201d you raise a good point.<br>\r\n\u201cThat's cool! We'll make a series about your journey from dating to mating!\u201d Patchouli had a plan b! \u201cSpeaking of which, I got some dating advice for you: get along really well with her little bug minions and dont step on any of them! She's very sensitive about her pests. She also looks up to her boss, so pour on some flattery there when you get the chance\u2026 oh! And tickle her antennae when you get the chance! She LOVES that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, I'm back! Sorry to keep you waiting!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeak of the devil! Wriggle's coming back!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd just pretend I'm not here!\u201d Patchouli whispers before shutting the window!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry it took so long,\u201d Wriggle sighed with disappointment as she walked over to you on the couch, \u201cI think my blender's breaking down.\u201d Patchouli was well within her sight just outside the window and she didnt even acknowledge her. Guess that bubble does work.<br>\r\n\u201cIt's alright,\u201d you tell her as you took a quick glance out the window, \u201cI'll ask Patchouli later if you can borrow one from the mansion. I'm sure they got a ton of them hidden away somewhere.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt's alright,\u201d Wriggle exhales, \u201cI should probably cut down on smoothies before I end up getting fat from them.\u201d Well, if all that smoothies end up going straight to her watt-consuming thighs, that's not exactly a bad thing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! My favorite show's about to come on!\u201d Wriggle eyes the clock and turns on the tv, \u201cwanna watch with me?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSure,\u201d you were curious as to what a firefly youkai considers entertainment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Wriggle flips the channel to the proper station, you overhear Patchouli let out a 'PST!' your way. You glance over to her who keeps ushering her head to Wriggle's direction like she's verbally saying 'MAKE A MOVE!!'</span></div></div>",

Nervousness, yet determination twinkled in her sparkling green eyes. She was probably even thinking to herself 'I can do this! I can do this!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W....wow....\" she sputtered, \"...it's... even bigger than the ones in Patchouli's comics!\" You glanced over at Patchouli in the window with a disturbed look on your face!<br>\r\n\"Er, y-you dont have to rush yourself,\" you assure her, \"if you need more time, I can wait.\"<br>\r\n\"I-I-I'm fine!\" Wriggle's eyes twinkled despite her fear... and her backside illuminated with boundless confidence, \"I've studied a lot of books and watched a lot of videos! I believe I'm more than ready for this!\" What exactly did she even... nevermind, just stare unblinkingly at her glowing ass like a good idiot!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A....alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe female firefly youkai is now at peek arousal,\u201d Patchouli continues to narrate as her smile widens with anticipation, \u201cfruitfully inspirited by her human lover's stimulating strokes of her sensitive antennae as well as amazed by the gifted size of his fully erect unsheathed penis, she finally decides to look past the whole species difference between them commit what would have otherwise been a taboo! Beaming with excitement AND determination, the female firefly youkai answers the call of her reproductive cycle and\u2026.\u201d her smile then drops, \u201c...engages in fellatio?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYep, that's exactly what she's doing! And you would never believe just by looking at her how talented she is at it! The feel of her long slimy, and oddly hairy tongue gently stroking across every inch of your sensitive shaft was driving you wild! It weirded you out that her tongue had tiny little hairs instead of tastebuds but you chalked it up as simply her being of a different species. It shouldve also gave off another sign that you probably shouldnt be mating with someone like her, but it didnt. If anything, it felt like a wet but gentle brush stroking your manhood, getting it all nice and groomed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasnt at all what Patchouli had planned to happen. She struggled on her whole narration while her little minion, Koakuma was covering her eyes with both hands\u2026 while peeking through the cracks of her fingers and having a hard time stopping her drooling!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*Slurp\u2026 Slurp* How is this?\u201d Wriggle innocently asks during licks, \u201cdoes it\u2026 *slurp*\u2026 feel good?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spent less time trying to talk and more time stutter and salivating, failing miserably to keep a straight face cuz the odd but intense strokes from Wriggle's brush-like tongue was far more than you expected!<br>\r\nBut despite your unintelligible dribble, your firefly youkai girlfriend's antennae was easily able to detect radio waves of complete satisfaction emitting from you. And upon realizing that it does in fact feel good, your penis quickly disappears into her mouth\u2026 and sparks and fireworks go off from within!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe uh\u2026 female firefly youkai um\u2026 using her er, crafty enhanced jaw muscles, easily manages to\u2026 force her human male companion into a submission of ecstasy. He gasps, he moans, he pants, completely unprepared for such an oral stimulation that females of his species lack. As he rigorous\u2026.ly\u2026 Koakuma, what are you doing?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cN-N-N-Nothing! D-D-Dont mind me! Keep narrating, please!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou caught a brief glimpse of Patchy's succubus subordinate fingering herself at the display, but you didnt pay that much attention cuz you were enraptured with pleasure from Wriggle's sucking! You couldnt believe what a cute innocent girl like her was capable of! Her blowjob wasnt just amazing, it was unbelievable! Seriously, it literally felt like there were at least THREE brush-like tongues wrapping around your manhood! You never had a thorough glance inside her mouth, so you werent exactly sure she had only one tongue!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that it mattered! All that did was her awesome lip sucking and tantalizing tongue caressing was pushing you to the point of climax!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm\u2026. gonna\u2026. cum...\u201d you barely manage to sputter. Wriggle made what seemed like a gleeful smile as she continued blowjobing. You cannot recall the last time you came so much. Her cheeks almost filled to the brim with your life-giving seed! You couldnt believe your balls had THAT much juice stored in them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter such a glorious finish, Wriggle, with a look of hard determination, gave a big gulp and swallowed it all down confidently! Damned if you knew why she did it so confidently, but her accomplished smile afterwards made it all worth it! Even after doing something as unpredictably perverted as sucking you off, you still couldnt help but think to yourself 'MAN she's so dang cute!'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH...how was it?\u201d she asks, still cute and chipper as always, \u201cwas it good?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat was incredible!\u201d you blurted with astonishment, \u201chow did you learn to do that?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI sorta learned from reading some of Patchouli's comics.\u201d You couldnt help but glance over at that librarian again with a befuddled look on your face! Patchouli on the other hand let out a sigh of 'FINALLY'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*Ahem* And now that the blowj-um, oral prelude has finished,\u201d Patchouli narrates, \u201cit is now the human male's opportunity to sire the female firefly youkai's offspring, which will result in the creation of a brand new hybrid species the likes of which we have never bared witness to until now!\u201d</span></div></div>",

You didn\u2019t expect them to see you as they came to see you, Remilia spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cMr.Whitestone, I believe your late at the hour.\u201d Remilia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI\u2019m so sorry lady scarlet! I had errands with wriggle so I lost track of time!\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWriggle? As in wriggle nightbug? Why would you have errands with her?\u201d Remilia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cOoh, I get it! The reason lady knowledge and Koakuma came in before you with camera!\u201d Meiling said with smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You blushed red, and Remilia wanted to know. Meiling told her both you and wriggle had a little adult fun, and even Remilia blushed little until all of you heard a thumping noise. It became closer and closer until it spoke:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u2018Alex-Sama is miiiinnnee!!!!!\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Both Remilia and Meiling got out and saw a hulk rabbit coming closer to the mansion. You got out and noticed the rabbit were familiar to you. Heck, it looked like reisen herself! The hulk rabbit breathed hard and walked closer, and Remilia showed her vampiric teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cIs that...the lunarian bunny?\u201d Remilia spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI think we\u2019ve got company.\u201d Meiling said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n And with that, the lunarian bunny soldiers came as well. Maybe around hundred, you were disturbed to see her in this shape and now reisen came to get you. Remilia took out her bat wings and her vampire eyes showed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cMr.Whitestone, get inside. Me and Meiling will deal with this freak.\u201d Remilia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cBut...\u201d you hesitated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cDo what she says Alex. She knows what she\u2019s doing.\u201d Meiling said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201c...alright.\u201d You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You rushed into the mansion as Remilia and Meiling were about to fight, you ran toward annas room and banged her door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cAnna! It\u2019s me! Reisen came with her macho form!!\u201d You shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n No answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cAnna? Anna!? It\u2019s me! Answer me!\u201d You shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cShe\u2019s not in there.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n You looked to the side and it was Arnold. He came and opened the door only to see that no one was there but the door was open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWhere\u2019s Anna?\u201d You asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cShe turned into her alter form and ran out. She should be here somewhere.\u201d Arnold replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cAlter...form?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cOnce every month, if no one gives her proper medication, she\u2019ll turn herself into her alter form.\u201d Arnold said, \u201cI came with a shot, but I guess she left.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWe should find her!\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cShe\u2019s too dangerous in her alter form. I can deal with her myself.\u201d Arnold said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n With that, Arnold left with syringe on his left hand while you were worried. Outside the fight, nightmare form reisen were in berserk as both Remilia and Meiling fought her off while fighting the military.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cDamn, how many are there?\u201d Remilia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cDon\u2019t worry lady scarlet, I\u2019ll defend you.\u201d Meiling said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n They kept fighting until...</span></div></div>",

Here's hoping you dont regret it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take the pollen smoothie,\" you answer.<br>\r\n\"Ok,\" Wriggle gladly handed you the glass of thick yellowish sap fluid and kept the sandwich of crushed snail paste. Oddly, she seemed a little gleeful with your choice, but it didnt matter to you. All that mattered was trying to make yourself a decent guest in her guest\u2026 and hope that whatever drink that was doesnt end up poisoning you or make you sick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood news was that it didnt smell off. It had a fruity/citrusy scent to it with a hint of honey added. You attempted not to show any signs of nervousness while you carefully inspected the smoothie. As you inspected, Wriggle was taking eager bites into her snail sandwich, obviously savoring the delicious slimy salty pasty goodness! At the very least, she made it look like it was delectable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Here goes nothing,' you think to yourself and finally take a sip. It's thick. It's very thick. Very gooey and sticky too. You tasted quite a lot of honey in the texture. Sadly, it didnt taste as fruity and citrusy as it smelled. In fact, it had a very bitter aftertaste, almost like there was a little alcohol mixed in. All in all, it wasnt that bad. It wasnt something you'd consider drinking often.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow is it?\u201d Wriggle had to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's\u2026 not bad,\u201d you say, taking another sip, urging yourself to finish the entire glass for her, \u201cer, what kind of pollen is in this?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt's mostly sunflower pollen,\u201d Wriggle explained, \u201cextracted from Yuuka Kazami's prized sunflower bed at the Garden of the Sun. I'd watch over her flower garden once in a while and she'd let me extract jars of sunflower pollen as payment. It's really good stuff.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It certainly wasnt awful tasting, it might make for a booze substitute if you wanted to unwind and party, it just wasnt really something youre into. Not like one of those various carrot-related dishes they had over at Eientei. THAT was something you could get used to eating regularly AND feel good about it since carrots are very nutritious. But alas, thinking that way only ended up reminding you of dear ol' Reisen. You miss that adorable little mentally ill attempted rapist!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2026 might have a bit of a strong kick, though,\u201d Wriggle took a little too long to finally add that warning.<br>\r\n\u201cW-what kind of kick?\u201d your suspicions rise.<br>\r\n\u201cWell...\u201d she scratched the back of her head, \u201cI tend to get a little tipsy if I drink too much of it. You know, get light headed, say and do things I normally wouldnt do, blurry memory, and I wake up the next morning with a big headache.\u201d Interesting.<br>\r\n\u201cIs there alcohol in this drink?\u201d you question.<br>\r\nShe shakes her head. \u201cNo, it's mostly pollen, honey, a bit of fruit\u2026 and a few herbal supplements I've got from Eientei.\u201d EIENTEI?!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou seriously wished you waited until now to swallow that stuff! But even if you could spit it out upon hearing the E-word, it was way too thick and sticky to even leave your mouth!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEientei?!\u201d you repeated what you think she answered, and lo and behold, she nodded.<br>\r\n\u201cThey have incredible medicine,\u201d Wriggle explains, \u201clike the strong, rare stuff you cant find at any hospital or pharmacy.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I'm well aware of that place,\u201d you explained to her, \u201cI was staying there for a little while until my sister moved us out.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d you sparked her interest, \u201cdid you get to meet the purple haired rabbit girl? Ms. Udongein Inaba?\u201d Oh come the fuck on! Fate has a sick sense of humor, doesnt it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallowed hard, \u201cEr\u2026 I have\u2026 met Reisen. ...A few times.\u201d You dare not go into detail. It's bad enough you called her by her first name!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh cool! I've gotten most of my herbal supplements from her.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHerbal supplements?\u201d that mentally ill bunny girl sold this mentally sound bug girl drugs?!<br>\r\n\u201cMostly stuff to increase  my stamina, focus, and keep stress down,\u201d Wriggle explains, \u201cI need all I can get to take proper care of all my bugs. There's a saying 'busy as a bee' for a reason.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoure getting a little worried. Understandably so. Messing with hospital drugs (or drugs acquired from shady means) is never a good idea\u2026 and god help poor little Wriggle if any of those drugs were tainted by Maeve!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHm,\u201d you keep a cool face despite the pent up worrying, \u201cbut are you absolutely sure these 'herbal supplements' are safe? I mean I've...\u201d you swallowed hard and chose your words very carefully, \u201cknown people that heavily relied on recreational drugs to improve themselves and they ended up destroying themselves and their families.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course theyre safe,\u201d she assures you, \u201cI've been taking supplements for quite a while and I take them responsibly. I never mess with the really strong stuff unless I'm trying to drug somebody with it. By the way, how's the smoothie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy the hell did she think now was an appropriate time to just up and change the subject?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy do you suddenly feel dizzy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy do you suddenly feel drowsy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince when did Wriggle have a twin?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Triplets?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you feeling the kick yet?\u201d you heard her voice echo and make out her face beaming, \u201care you?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWh-wha...wha...\u201d you were slurring a little in your speech while you were trying to keep your balance, \u201cwhat i...s in thi..s.. stu...ff?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI told you. Pollen, honey fr-\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cTHE HERBAL SHIT!!\u201d you snapped, \u201cWHAT IS IT?!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh! Hm...\u201d Wriggle thought, \u201c...what did Reisen call it? Flu\u2026 na\u2026 tra.. something. Anyways, it should put you to sleep real soon.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cS-Sleep?!\u201d you fight the urge to fall asleep, but the urge got heavier and heavier, \u201cW-why?!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSo you wont run away when it's time to mate,\u201d she flat out says it like it was nothing. She just nonchalantly admitted she wanted to commit date rape! \u201cI'm sorry, but I'm getting desperate. All the other males are either taken or are prejudiced bugophobes that quickly zip away at the very sight of a bug! We still have feelings you know!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get a bit nervous as you hear the bug buzzing get even louder! Swarms of bugs were gathering around you! By then, you couldnt run from them, cuz you didnt even have the strength to stand up! The world was spinning, and your legs were feeling weak! Geez, why oh why did you agree to go on a date with a BUG GIRL?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDont worry Alex!\u201d Wriggle's voice echoed, \u201cyou'll be just fine. In fact, I added a special supplement for male enhancement in the smoothie so when you wake up, you'll be more than ready to sire my larva!\u201d Larva? Eww.<br>\r\n\u201cIiih\u2026..uuhh\u2026.uugghh...\u201d *THUD* You collapse like a sack of rocks on the floor as the bugs crawled all over you. You wish you could at least cover your ears, nose, mouth, and\u2026 other holes so they dont crawl in! Instead, you lose consciousness\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUrrggh\u2026.gawwdd...\u201d man oh man is your head pounding! The insanely bright light in your face only amplified the pain! But on the plus side, you were alive! Sadly that was the only plus side. As soon as your blurred vision finally cleaned, you found yourself...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As much as you wanted to explore the lovely mansion until the cows come home (whatever that means), your eyes were feeling a little heavy. It cant be helped, considering the tremendous amount of fun/torture you just been put through over in Eientei. You feel really sorry for Reisen and hope that your ex-boss wont do anything truly bad to her. Despite your worries for her, it was in your best interest to leave that place according to Anna. And Anna knows best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUgh, just THINKING about it's making you even more tired. You couldnt take it anymore. You had to take a nap. You had to sleep this off. So you hopped in your bed and pulled the covers over you. Sweet. The bed was a hundred times comfier than the one back in the hospital. And you didnt have to worry about crazy patients sneaking into your bed at night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Why did that make you feel unhappy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNevermind nevermind! You just clear your head and shut your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n********************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Mary Mack! Mack! Mack!\" Anna was playing her favorite childhood hand game with Flandre, \"All dressed in black! Black! Black! With silver buttons! Buttons! Buttons! All down her-\"<br>\r\nWhen suddenly her cellphone rang. Well actually, it sang 'Makes Me Wonder' by Maroon5 but same thing. The hand game came to an abrupt stop as she checked the ID on her cell. An old associate of hers, 'Demitri'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Flannie!\" Anna gave the girl a sweet apologetic smile, \"I have to take this call. It'll just be a moment.\"<br>\r\n\"Ok, onee-sama!\" Flandre  nodded. Anna stepped out of the room, looked down the hallway just to make sure she had plenty of privacy and answered the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" she was quick and to the point.<br>\r\n\"Bad news for your brother,\" the light-pitched tone in his accent seemed stressed, \"Govno hit the fan.\"<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" Anna questioned.<br>\r\n\"I'm looking right at bounty contract with brother's name,\" Demitri answered, \"these contracts are mass produced. This is seventh town I've been in that has them.\"<br>\r\n \"S-Seriously?!\" Anna had a hard time controlling the volume of her voice, \"B-but we've only been gone for like a few days!\"<br>\r\n\"One of local Fey must have foreseen you coming,\" Demitri theorized, \" seen Fairy militias gathering to search for brother. Few of them wearing special bracelets of Aos Si.\"<br>\r\n\"B-Bracelets of-.. urgghh,\" Anna groaned as she sweat, \"where the hell did they get those in such short time?!\"<br>\r\n\"Byez ponyatsiya,\" Demitri didnt have a clue, \"perhaps something to do with their local Fairy Queen? Mab, I believe her name.\"<br>\r\n\"...M... Mab?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***********************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Sniff!* ......*sniff!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, who knows how much later, you hear very close sniffing. Just like last time! But unlike last time, you felt a bit of weight already on top of you, so getting up was easier said than done! Fearing the absolute worst, you decide to barely crack one eye open before daring to scream off the top of your lungs!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately and Unfortunately, it wasnt your favorite ill bunny-girl this time. Inches in front of you lied that red-haired girl in the Chinese gi you saw kicking out that blonde girl when you first came to the mansion!  You didnt get her name, Arnold's partner Not that it concerned you at the moment. What concerned you was the icy cold glare she was giving you at the moment.<br>\r\nIt didnt seem angry, but the look in her bright blue slightly slanted eyes made you incredibly uneasy. You tried very hard not to flinch after feeling her squeeze both your wrists! And considering you've seen a brief example of the unsurpassed strength she's capable of, you were a little too afraid to wake her up and cut whatever she's doing short.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, you lie there pretending to sleep, waiting very patiently to finish sniffing you out. Bad feelings emerged as you felt her humidly warm breath hitting your face hard with each heavy pant she was making!<br>\r\nShe whispered something that you assumed was Chinese, but you couldnt understand it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if that wasnt nerve-wrecking enough, she started licking your cheek! Hard not to cringe, but you tried your damnest not to as you felt her warm tongue rubbing across your face, licking up the sweat that was dripping on it!<br>\r\nShe whispered into your ear more stuff you couldnt understand. Just when you tried to muster a guess what she was telling you, she nibbled gently on your earlobe! It didnt hurt, but you did feel sharp fangs with made you even more uneasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meiling, what the heck are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red-head leaped up in frightened shock, obviously caught in the act! She jerked her head over the purple-haired eavesdropper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-Patchouli!\" Meiling stuttered and began speaking english again, \"t-this isnt what it looks like! I was... checking up on our guest!\" She gave the same excuse Reisen did! <br>\r\n\"By climbing on top of him?\"<br>\r\n\"He looked like he was shivering in his sleep, so I... well... warmed him up.\"<br>\r\n\"Uh... huh,\" Patchouli didnt look like she was buying it, \"anyways, just what exactly are you doing here? Shouldnt be guarding the gate like youre HIRED to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I decided to take a short breath,\" Meiling said as she finally climbed off of you, \"besides, I got that Arnold guy filling in for me.\"<br>\r\n\"Need I remind you he's only gonna be here until Ms. Whitestone leaves?\" Patchouli says, \"so I'm sure Lady Scarlet will appreciate it if you dont take advantage of him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah,\" Meiling sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, since you got so much free time,\" Patchouli changed the subject, \"how about helping me clean up the library? That stupid witch-thief made a huge mess of the place! And rearranged all my books out of order!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely, Patchouli!\" Meiling happily agreed, \"I'm always happy to help!\" She gleefully followed Patchouli off... but not before turning around and giving you another long quiet stare. Even from the other side of the room, her stare still creeped you out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MEILING! You coming or not?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeiling jumped again, \"Oh! Y-yeah! Sorry!\" and ran out of the room!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got up out of your bed and groaned hard.<br>\r\n\"HERE too, huh?\" you sighed to yourself. Once again, you may have found yourself an odd admirer. Not that you minded it TOO much, though. You did enjoy the attention that cute bunny girl was giving you. And unlike her, Meiling not a mental patient, otherwise she wouldnt be mentally sound enough to be a gate guard, right? Here's hoping Maeve doesnt find out about her, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyways, nap time is over.<br>\r\nAfter stretching a bit. you decide to head out. Where do you wish to go?</span></div></div>",

He was the mafias favorite as he always cheered the members up, done the mission both hard and unwanyed one, and always the peacekeeping if there was an argument within the gang. You got out of the room, took some turns and got out of the mansion. Once you got to the gate you saw arnold punching in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hey arnold.\" You spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Arnold stopped punching and turnes around. He grinned and came to you and patted your shoulder hard. It was slightly painful, but not that much since your bullet wound were fully healed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Alex! I'm glad to see you again!\" Arnold said in cheerful tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ye-yeah, I'm glad too.\" You replied. \"So what's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Living normal.\" Arnold replied, leaning on the wall \"just captured the witch thief with meiling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I see.' You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He then dug into his pocket and took out an chocolate covered protien bar. He offered you one, but you refused, not feeling hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yeah, it's tough right now.\" Arnold said, munching on protiwn bar, \"Not only we all hiding from the fay,  l feel tired all the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yeah. Meiling sometime challenge me into something. Why, 2 days ago she challenged me into breath holding contest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You giggled by this and arnold sighed. You two talked for half hour and you decided to return in. Arnold told he'll be at the gate until sundown, and yoi nodded and went inside. Once you were in, you noticed one maid with wing carrying an heavy bag. You felt like helping so tou went to her and tapped her shouder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Need hand?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"N-no thank you sir, I can-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You knew she hesitating so you got the bag for her.

You two talked, as she informed you that the name of the head maid is sakuya izayoi, the librarians name were patchoulie knowladge, and gate guard werw hong meiling. You understood and once you two got to the destination, the maid opened the door, revealing an kitchen. You put the bag up to the table, and within moment sakuya came in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ah, so you brought it.\" Sakuya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Actually, he helped me head maid.\" Fairy answeres.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Sakuya looked at you and smiled, lightly bowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Thank you for helping her, mr.whiterock.\" sakuya thanked you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"No problem. And your sakuya right?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yes I am.\" She replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Sakuya then ordered the fairy maid to sweep and mop the bathroom downstairs. She accepted the order and went out. After few seconds sakuya went to the fridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Are you going to cook something?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I will be making strawberry scone for mylady.\" Sakuya said, \"so please excuse yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I can help.\" You offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"It's alright.

You wondered why she was pouting so you decided to ask her the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Lady remilia, why are you pouting?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"..Flan's getting alot of annas attention, and sakuya and others being busy.\" Remilia answerd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You nodded, understanding how she felt. When you were in grade school you had few friends, but when you started high school your friends went to the different high school so you were mostly loner in the school. You thought for moment and then you smiled, putting your head on her head and petted her head. Remilia blushed little as she looked up to you, you grinned lightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Then I'll give you some attention, lady scarlet.\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I..I'm the high lady here! who needs-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"C'mon, remilia. I won't bite, heck I can give you a lift.\" You interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Remilia blushed more and hesitated little, then she lifted both of her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'll...give you my authorasation to give me lift.\" Remilia replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You chuckled and lifted her up to your shoulder. Remilia wrapped your neck with her arm and hold on tight. You started to walk and you could feel her warm arm aroudn your neck and saw her wings flapping with joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Uu~ this is actually nice.\" remilia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"See? everything will be fine.\" you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You walked toward the dining room since sakuya were making some scone, and almost got to the destination until you saw anna standing with flandre on her shoulders.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Just when it was about to be a heartwarming moment with siblings bonding between other siblings, Anna had that look on her face. Youre way too familiar with that look than you should be. This is the look she makes when she's about to step out to talk to... 'friends'. Damnit, just when you thought she'd FINALLY quit with the 'associate' bullcrap which would only get in more trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*Ahem* Please put me down,\u201d Remilia ordered. You put her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Lady Scarlet,\" Anna called to her liege, \"there's a pressing matter I need to attend to. I have to speak with an old associate of mind a few hundred yards south of here.\" Again with the associates. What has she gotten into this time?<br>\r\n\"What about?\" Remilia rightfully questioned.<br>\r\n\"Bad people are putting out contracts for Mr. Alex!\" Flan answered for your sister, \"Onee-sama needs to talk with her special associates about drawing attention away from him!\u201d Wow. The kid sure knows such big words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDont worry,  I\u2019ll leave Arnold here to protect your mansion if anyone comes by,\u201d Anna assures Remilia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Lady Scarlet squinted her eyes, \u201cHow long will you be gone?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019ll be back by tonight!\u201d Flandre answered for your sister again, \u201cshe promises!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHeh. What she said,\u201d Anna laughed.<br>\r\nRemilia stared in deep thought for a moment, then looked up at you.<br>\r\n\u201cShe hasn\u2019t broken a promise yet,\u201d was your second opinion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well,\u201d Ms. Scarlet gave her blessing,  \u201cbut because the safety and security of the Scarlet family is of utmost importance, should you not return by midnight tonight, you will not be welcomed back here.\u201d Aw geez! She\u2019ll banish Anna if she doesn\u2019t return on time?!<br>\r\n\u201cYou have my word, my lady,\u201d Anna bowed, \u201cplease take good care of my brother while I\u2019m gone. And Al, dont worry, I\u2019m gonna be right back.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOk\u2026\u201d you murmured uncertain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as soon as you see Anna walk out, you feel lonely again. You dont trust her associates, but it\u2019s not like you can do much to stop her. At the very least, you had Remilia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you like me to carry you again, Lady Scarlet?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAbsolutely not!\u201d Remilia suddenly got all high and mighty with you, \u201cI think I\u2019ve given a mortal commoner far too much privilege earlier! Need I remind you that you and your sister are not here on vacation? You are refugees given refuge in MY mansion and you owe a debt to me in doing so.\u201d<br>\r\nYou nodded, in no position to argue, no matter how much you didn\u2019t need to be reminded!<br>\r\n\u201cIf youre going to stay here, you need to be useful,\u201d Remilia stated, \u201cthere are plenty of chores you can be spending time doing.\u201d She looked over to the dining room and back at you, \u201cYou need to EARN your scones!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoure pretty certain this had less to do your \u2018job\u2019 and more to do with Remilia wanting to spend time with her sister. No point in arguing, though. You just nodded obediently.<br>\r\n\u201cGood. Now if you\u2019ll excuse us, me and my sister have some catching up to do. C\u2018mon sister, let\u2018s get some scones.\u201d As you suspected. Flandre grabbed her sister by the arm and shouted, \u201cNo, Nee-chan! Let\u2019s play Anna\u2019s favorite game, Five Finger Fillet!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWHOA WHOA WAIT! SLOW DOWN, FLANDRE!!\u201d you heard Remilia scream as her sis dragged her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, you were all by your lonesome. And considering what Remilia told you, you need to be making yourself useful. You just had to find a job to do. Question is, what job? There was probably a vast amount of choirs and tasks that require your attention, but you didnt even know where to look or what you could even do. You could wash dishes if you knew where the kitchen was. You could clean the bathroom if you knew where the bathroom was. You could help fix up the library if you knew where the library was. You could just vacuum the damn hallway if you knew where a vacuum was! Maybe you should go look for that cute fairy you helped earlier. Surely SHE could use some more help. Pray that she has no relation whatsoever to your former employment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMan, you were starting to feel lonely just wandering about this humongous mansion. Part of you kinda misses Eientei\u2026 especially a certain ill bunny girl! Plus, after the hell you\u2019ve just recently escaped, you could\u2019ve at least gotten some free anti-depressants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere, it feels like a rich prison. The hallway seemed vast, endless, and empty. Despite having probably a few hundred servants working in this mansion, you havent gotten to see a single one down your trek! You probably just ended up getting yourself lost just wandering the hallway for too long. You\u2019d call for help, but you really didnt wanna look anymore stupid than you already do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t really that you wanted to do chores as much as you just wanted some companionship. You really need to make some friends and bad. Friends come and go in such short time for you what with big sis always dragging you from one place to another in such short time. And you know she wont be able to watch over you forever. Sooner or later, you\u2019re gonna have to find your own way to deal with things. Your own way to deal with your enemies\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Pant! Pant! Pant!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you heard some excessive panting in one of the rooms. Some very desperate panting! Is somebody in pain or the verge of passing out? Maybe theyre lifting something really REALLY heavy and need some help! Maybe they fallen and they cant get up! Finally, somebody to make yourself useful to!<br>\r\n*Pant pant pant pant PANT PANT!!* As you stalled, the desperate breathing got louder and heavier! Youre wasting time, you fool!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWasting no time (no more than you already wasted), you dash to the direction of the breathing, and rush into the room (thankfully the door was unlocked!)!<br>\r\nThe heavy panting was coming straight from the red-haired girl in the green uniform lying on the bed facing away from you!  Oh wait! That\u2019s the girl from before! The one that snuck into your room, Meiling!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Regardless of what she did earlier, you were concerned with what was wrong with her. You stepped toward her to ask if she was ok. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhhh\u2026 ah\u2026 ah\u2026.\u201c But just when you were about to open your mouth, you caught a better glimpse of what she was doing. She had her arm reaching her under her dress, buckling her legs in rhythmic motions, and gasping and moaning on cue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026O_O\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh. Sweet. Mother. Of. Did you just seriously walk in on the gate guard playing with herself?! Lovely. Just lovely. You havent been this disturbed since the time you walked in on your sister making out with the Genoskwa!<br>\r\nEven worse, you overhear the antsy Meiling muttering the same Chinese you swear you heard her muttering when she was on top of you earlier!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were incredibly lucky she was noticing you were there, cuz it seemed like the door was miles away! You really really REALLY need to get out of that room before she discovers her peeping tom and beats the crap out of you\u2026 unless YOURE the cause of her antsyness, then you\u2019ll probably be wishing she beat the crap out of you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of making a mad dash to the door and risk getting pounced on before you reach it, you decided to take very slow and quiet steps, treading especially carefully on the only floor in the mansion that\u2019s inconveniently hard wood! You slowly and surely went creepy crawly taking gentler than gentle steps on your tippy toes, hoping to get out as quietly as possible\u2026</span></div></div>",

When you were safe enough, you stretched out and started to walk until you noticed the same fairy you saw earlier flying with heavy load of dirty cloth. She was flying unevenly and you noticed she was about to fall from the weight. You quickly rushed toward the fairy and grabbed half of the cloth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Phew, that was close.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You then saw her face blush and sweated little. You could tell she was embarrassed or something and then she spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Th-thank you, sir.\" fairy thanked you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'll help you, ok?\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She nodded with silence and both of you walked toward the washing area. Once you got to the place, it had big washing machine and dryer together. You put half of the dirty cloth and after that the fairy put her half of the cloth, put some washing detergents and put the top down and pressed some button, making the washer start. You two breathed out in relief and then she turned to you and bowed to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Thank you for helping me out today, sir.\" She thanked you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"No problem. By the way, what's your name?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She got up and smiled to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"My name is Natsuki, it's an honor to be your acquaintance.\" She replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Mine's Alex Whitestone. Nice to meet you as well.\" You greeted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She nodded and told you she could do the rest. You were worried about her, but she assured that she could do it herself so you left her alone. Once you got out of the laundry room and walked through the hallway to think about what you should do. You wondered for moment until you heard someone's voice. you looked closely and saw the purple haired women standing at your room saying something. You remember her name as pathcoulie and as you walked, she noticed you and turned her attention to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I wondered where you were, Mr.Guest.\" Patchoulie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What happened here?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You looked inside and saw the red head meiling sitting on the floor wrapped her naked body with bed sheet. You twitched little as if she had good time to herself to the maximum. Patchoulie sighed and spoke to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I found her having some...fun on your  bed.\" Patchoulie said, \"You know meiling, if I tell this to remmy she might just consider Arnold replacing your job.\"  Patchoulie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"No, please! don't say anything to lady scarlet!!\" Meiling replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You saw her face as she was truly agitated and serious about this. You could tell that patchoulie would tell lady scarlet about what was going on in your room and deep inside your chest you would want to talk to patchoulie that maybe she could overlook this. But on the other hand, she made mess on your bed, 1/4th of your bed soaked with some sort of smelly liquid so you should just let patchoulie say something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Decisions, decisions...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Anna always said you were too damn softhearted and one of these days, your softheartedness would get you killed. But you know what could also get you killed? Not having enough friends or close allies. Good friends can help out in a pinch and considering the enemies you currently have, you need all the friends you can get.<br>\r\nNot to mention... you could really go for some more friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked away from the bed that's currently soaked with Meiling's fresh Niao Long and turn to Patchoulie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Patchoulie, dont tell the mistress,\" you tell her, \"I dont want Ms. Hong getting in trouble!\"<br>\r\nThe purple haired librarian looked at you funny, naturally confused why you would defend somebody that was schlicking off in your bed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er... you dont? After what she just did in your bed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally no, but if you were gonna save Meiling's career, you had to take drastic measures. It wasnt something you were gonna like (at the moment), but this was probably the best way to do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groaned over to the naked gatekeeper, \"...God, Meiling, you seriously couldnt wait for me? I told you I'd be back in a minute!\"<br>\r\n\"Ehhhh?\" judging by the questionable tone in her heavily accented syllable, Meiling was confused by your facade. <br>\r\nPatchoulie on the other hand knew what you meant and was incredibly sickened by it, \"Oh. OHH!! OH WHAT?! YOU AND... YOU ARE...? WERE...? Aw no!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm dreadfully sorry, Patchoulie,\" you forced yourself to blush nervously to hide your panicked sweat, \"the thing is... well, I've been feeling awful lonely and depressed lately and... well, she offered to comfort me and... one thing led to another, and... well I was ABOUT to, but I couldnt find any condoms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wont let you use a condom,\" Meiling for some godbedanged reason just had to let that slip!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the plus side which is still on the bad side, Patchoulie believed your lie. And she was mad. At you. She gave you an unamused glare which you rightfully deserve seeing as how special guests of a luxurious noble mansion do not overstay their welcome by sleeping with the employees of the house!<br>\r\nShe sucked in air and prepped for her lecture, \"Ok. First of all, Mr. Whitestone, if youre feeling lonely and depressed, this is NOT how you alleviate your stress! Secondly, this is not how you properly repay my mistress for her kindness and generosity! This is a noble\u2019s mansion, not a brothel!\u201d<br>\r\nYou bowed submissively, \u201cMy sincerest apologies, ma\u2019am. This will not happen again.\u201d Like a boss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs for YOU,\u201c Patchoulie turned her attention to Meiling, \u201cgod help you if your libido winds up hurting Ms. Whitestone\u2019s little brother. You two better have those sheets cleaned before the Lady picks up that stench. Now if you\u2018ll excuse me, I\u2018m in the middle of a good read.\u201d<br>\r\nAnd with that, she walked out, slamming the door shut. Definitely dont look good in her eyes now, but at least you spared Meiling whatever wrath that was about to be upon her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhew!\u201d you sighed, \u201cthat was close one. I didnt really think it was gonna work! Heh-EESHH!!\u201d And as soon as you turned your head to Meiling you were suddenly hammered against a wall by a red-haired typhoon! In a nannosecond you went from \u2018Whew\u2019 to \u2018Why are my arms pinned to the wall? And why is Meiling staring at me with a cold glare with her cheeks flush red?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again the excessive warmth of the gate guard\u2019s body was too close for comfort, only this time soiled bed sheets were the only thing in the way from being in contact with her burning hot genitalia.<br>\r\nMaybe you really need to start learning from history. Helping the strong ill girl with a scary fascination for you will HURT you! You really began to miss Natsuki. If that was her real name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Meiling!\" you struggled in her grip to no avail, \"I-I just saved you!\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks for saving me,\" she said unmoved, \"now take off your pants. I dont like the feel of humping corduroy.\"<br>\r\n\"What?! No!\" you struggled even harder, \"let go of me!!\"<br>\r\n\"But you said you were gonna mate with me,\" Meiling didnt seem to know a ruse when she hears one!<br>\r\n\"That was a ploy to get Patchoulie off your back!\"<br>\r\n\"Well now she EXPECTS us to be mates,\" the gate guard got smart with you, \"wouldnt it arouse suspicion if we WERENT mating?\" Urgh, as expected there was no point in arguing with her! Unlike Reisen, Meiling IS sane and in the right state of mind while she's putting pressure on you! Man, where is Natsuki when you need her?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, her head edging up real close to yours and sniffing you out reminded you of that bunny girl. What DIDNT remind you of her was the way Meiling's face squinted with disbelief.<br>\r\n\"...*Sniff!*... Wait! ...What the...\" the gate guard looked puzzled about what she smelled, \"...*sniff*... why do I smell moon rabbit on you?!\" Oh wow, her sense of smell is keen!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH...well...\" you blushed, \"the thing is... well... before I came here, I was staying at Eientei and this nurse there, Reisen, she got a bit clingly once in a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rgggh!\" Meiling suddenly stepped back with disgust, \"Reisen?! That pill-popping loony got to you first?! I\u2019d expect the pyromaniac or that lonely old hag of a doctor, but REISEN?! Erggh... I can only imagine what kinds of undiscovered diseases that filthy thing gave you!\" While you dont appreciate her trashing talking an old odd friend (who was responsible for making you end up here) at least it helped keep her away!<br>\r\nStill, Scarlet Mansion's gate guard was beaming upset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cao ni zu zong shi ba DAI!!!\" Meiling screamed in Mandarin as she stomped around, \"is there no available male left on this damn piece of rock?!  Urgh... it seemed like years since I've ever seen any contact with fine males outside of thieves and solicitors trying to pass the gate! I finally get to meet one fine male suitable for fertilizing my eggs and he's probably infected...\" Yeesh. It must suck bad being a youkai in heat. Then again, you aint telling her you never did it with Reisen!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er... if youre that desperate,\" you speak up, \"why not go with Arnold? You two seem to get along well enough. Plus he's single. Not to mention, he's built like a brick house, you'll get plenty of good strong babies with him.\" You fail to tell her that he does in fact have Syphilis.<br>\r\nMeiling sneered, \u201cI dont want a big bulky brick house, I already AM a big bulky brickhouse. I want someone much smaller and scrawnier with a cute face that cant break out of my grip to properly balance out my superior genes!\u201d<br>\r\nAw geez! She was actually thinking THIS far ahead about her offspring?!<br>\r\n\u201cWhy did you have to go and b\u00e0o a diseased rabbit\u2018s j\u00fahu\u0101?!\u201d Meiling was pissed, \u201cyour adorably scrawny body was meant for satisfying clean fit healthy women like myself!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell uh\u2026\u201d you blushed awkwardly , \u201csorry to disappoint you. Heh, curse me and my mad thing for crazy bunnies with crazy bugs!\u201d<br>\r\nMeiling sneered at you again, \u201cDamn shame. Youre a REAL catch. I\u2019m sure all the dangerous wild youkai outside the mansion that don\u2019t care about contracting diseases would agree.\u201d Was that supposed to be a threat? Or a fact?! \"Sigh... I better take a shower and wash all this filth off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Meiling headed to the bathroom and turned on the shower, you pondered just how dangerous the outside world is. Granted, ANYWHERE in the world is dangerous when Le Fey has a contract out on you, but what other kind of dangers would you face if you consider leaving the safety of this mansion?<br>\r\nAnd you know what ELSE bugged you? If word got out that you received the package from Reisen! You'd way rather that rumor not spread for obvious guy reasons. Youre awful confident it'd kill whatever chance you had left of getting a girlfriend... let along stomp your attempt at getting to know Natsuki better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Click!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you noticed a faint flash outside your bedroom window. It wasnt an unusual flash, it was a flash you remember way to well. A flash from a polaroid camera! Through the corner of your eye, you could spot the source of the flash. The bush a few yards away.... the bush with black wings and a funny little red hat... and a camera sticking out of it!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstinct kicked in. A certain somebody just took a picture of you without your absolute consent. That could only mean one thing. Your cover's been blown!<br>\r\nCould it possibly be an agent hired by Le Fey to track you down?! Even if it isnt, you really REALLY cant afford photos of you falling into the wrong hands! Not to mention, even if it doesnt end up being found by Le Fey, you certainly hope this stranger didnt hear the part about you getting an STD! Your life socially AND literally are at stake!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut just when you considered jumping out the window and going after that snoop, you remember what Meiling said. Stepping outside the mansion could put you at risk if wild youkai are out. For all you know, the snoop could be a youkai itself astounded by it's new little flashy toy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThink. Think fast. Think hard.</span></div></div>",

You rushed to open the door to catch this person until she just giggled and begun to fly away. You wanted to scream 'damn!' until someone appeared behind this girl. It was arnold and he immediatly grabbed the girl with funny hat as she struggled to get herself free, Arnold kept her on tight grip. You remembered Arnold was a person who constrains the person in interrogation or any traitors who would 'personally' talk to Le Fay when he was in the gang. Both Arnold and the girl landed safely and once you got out, you rushed toward the front and opened the door and saw arnold walking toward you with the young girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ayayaya~! please let me go!!!\" Girl shouted, \"What's wrong with just taking one single picture!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"The problem is you trying to do something stupid.\" You replied, \"Who the hell are you? why did you do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I-I'm The pure and honest Shameimaru Aya, the crow tengu!\" She replied, \"Now let me go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She struggled more, but with no avail. Arnold asked you what he should do with this girl. You thought many way on how she should meet her  fate. Unlike your sis who if anyone takes picture of her privacy, there would be either becoming half dead or tortured to the point they wish to be dead, you had some morals in your action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Lets reveal this to lady scarlet.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"As you wish.\" Arnold replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n They both got in and within 10 minutes they got to the main area where remilia were slightly tired from playing with her younger vampire sister. She noticed you and sighed as she was sitting on the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What do you want? I'm tired.\" Remilia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Lady Scarlet, This person were taking photo of me during my private time at the room.\" You answerd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Remilia sighed and you could tell she was stressed little. She then clapped twice and from the side Sakuya appeared. You were still amazed to see such a maid come to the area within fraction of second!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Sakuya, take that crow to the punishment room.\" Remilia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"As you wish.\" Sakuya spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She walked toward you three and you handed aya toward her. Aya shouted 'Ayaya~' or 'Stooop!' but they both went to this punishment room. You sighed in relieve that this was now under the table, you and arnold parted way and walked. As you walked, you wondered what you should do, then you noticed natsuki speaking with few other fairy maids. You then remembered that patchoulie telling meiling to get the sheets replaced or there would be an consiquence. You thought to yourself that maybe you could tell her about that or you could do it yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n What will you do?</span></div></div>",

Your curiosity struck and started to walk down the area. The surrounding were like the palace in your mind as you saw some light with candle in the middle and some portiots next to it. You got to the end and opened the door, realising that it was library filled with books. There were so many books that you couldn't count how many it had. You walked through the row of books then you noticed something on the shelf. You picked up and realized that it was the DC comic book that had the first appearence of superman! You were truly shocked to see this as it was very rare and it could be sold for millions!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Why's this in this library?\" You thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You looked more side and noticed the isle was filled with american comics and japanese manga.

You didn't know who this girl was until she noticed you and had an expression on who you were.

The incredible loud creek it made was less a creek than it was an emergency siren! It might as well have just screamed \"MELING, HE'S HERE!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd speak of the devil, Meiling gasped just after hearing that creek, and she stopped whatever she was doing (like you didnt do) and quickly turned her attention to you! Her blue slanted eyes locked on you and in one single blink, she had the distance between you and her completely and practically cornered you against a wall Her intense stare made you pale and stiff and your heart pounded like a DragonForce drum solo, which was fitting cuz... you know... dragon! On the plus side, she's NOT beating the living crap out of you! On the minus side, it didnt take a genius to realize she had other plans for you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nihao,\" she spoke as she still stared into your soul intensely.<br>\r\n\"HI!\" you forced yourself to smile widely to hide your intense fears, \"I'm Alex! Alex Whitstone!\"<br>\r\n\"I am Meiling. Hong Meiling, \" she introduced herself... then she pointed downward... to between her legs, \"this is my baoyu. You and it are gonna be WELL acquainted.\" Despite not being bilingual, you had a damn good guess what she meant by 'baoyu'. But you pretended you didnt!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Meiling!\u201d you swallowed hard, \u201cnow I remember! You were the girl at the gate helping Arnold apprehend that one blonde girl.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat one blonde was a thief,\u201d Meiling explained, \u201cshe's got a nasty tendency of sneaking here and snatching some of the Lady's rarest books. Also, Arnold was helping ME. I'm the head gate guard of this mansion. I keep the unwanted laji out. But it's really refreshing to have some help weeding out the laji. I'll be sure to thank your sister by bearing her plenty of zhi.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cW-what is zhi?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThey're what'll come out of my baoyu after it thoroughly ravishes your jiba!\u201d good lord, she's starting to smell really good! The strange odor she's giving off was kinda making you salivate. It comes as no surprise to say your jiba was getting incredibly antsy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, even if you were totally gonna let your inhibitions go, the door was not only unlocked, it was still wide open! Not to mention, you just got to this mansion! You didnt wanna overstay your welcome already by knocking up the gate guard!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe...w\u2026.well...\u201d you try to think of a good excuse, \u201cwell, I should probably\u2026 help out\u2026 polishing\u2026 the  linen closets! It was nice meeting you Meiling!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo! Stop! Please!\u201d Meiling shouted frantically and grabbed your arm, preventing you from leaving. Yikes. She's probably as strong as Reisen! Maybe even stronger, cuz, you know, dragon.<br>\r\nAnd of course, taking advantage of being stronger, she pinned your arms against the wall and you found yourself unable to look away from her lovely blushing, panting face!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''You've saw me doing something incredibly disgraceful!\u201d she said shamefully.<br>\r\n\u201cDont worry, I wont tell anyone you-\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI was fantasizing it was YOUR fingers mercilessly entering me,\u201d yikes, what a way with words, \u201cnot just your fingers, but your wet salivating tongue as well. And your long hard throbbing manhood viciously ravaging me until I scream out in my native tongue!\u201d Oh man, it's too hot in here!<br>\r\n\u201cUr\u2026.ugh...\u201d youre supposed to say no, but it was kinda hard to look away nor ignore her alluring scent, \u201cw-w-we\u2026\u201d you swallowed, \u201cwe really shouldnt do this yet!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cRight!\u201d Meiling nodded determined, \u201cyou need to be completely aroused first, right? You can count on me! If you'd like, I'll gladly suck your dick until youre ready!\u201d Good lord, did she seriously say that out loud?!<br>\r\n'Yes yes yes YES!!' you mentally screamed out anxiously. Yeah you know youre not supposed to be cheering that, but c'mon! How often will you find a woman willing to just flat out offer you oral?! Not even Reisen did that\u2026 well, maybe if you asked her, she mightve-SHUT UP WITH ALL THAT!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTh-that's\u2026 very tempting!\u201d you couldnt believe you just said that, \u201cb-but I dont think-\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOH! So you prefer anal stimulation?!\u201d you cringed at THAT generous offer, \u201cthat's no problem for me! Turn around and I'll fist your gangmen!\u201d Do not want! DO. NOT. WANT!!! GO BACK TO THE DICK SUCKING!!<br>\r\n\u201cNo! Dont touch my gangmen!\u201d you flip and quickly attempt to regain your composure, \u201cer, I mean I-I-I dont think Ms. Scarlet would approve! What if she finds out I ended up impregnating you?!\u201d SOMEHOW. Dragons are practically reptiles, right? Reptiles lay eggs. How can a male of a live-birth species impregnate a female egg-layer?<br>\r\n\u201cShe would be thrilled,\u201d Meiling answered, \u201cit would mean even more strong beautiful future guards to protect the mansion.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201c..S...Seriously?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOnly if my baoyu truly deems you worthy.\u201d You were quickly losing the will to resist thanks to her clever way of words combined with that enticing pheromone she was giving off! At this point, it didnt matter to you if the door was left open! Hell, there could be loads of surveillance cameras all over the room and you'd feel like throwing Meiling to the bed and knotting her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you slowly lose yourself staring into the slanted pupils her lovely twinkling eyes, you try desperately coming up with an excuse not to give in to the urges and sadly 'But my sister will kick your ass' was not coming to mind!<br>\r\n''Why are you hesitating, Alex?\u201d Meiling whispered as she finally let go of your arms, \u201cthis beautiful dragoness is in need of a fine strapping young rider to mount her!\u201d Her words were making you go crazy, \u201cPlease take your clothes off, join me on that bed and ride me through the night sky until we see stars!\u201d You have never heard flirting like that, but youre totally gonna steal that one!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk!!\u201d you shove Meiling onto the bed with sudden superhman strength and pounce on top of her, not willing to wait any longer! She squealed with glee while you quickly unbutton your shirt and unzip your pants!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Crash!* Both your eyes and Meiling's widened after hearing something break from right the door you forgot to shut! The two of you jerk your heads to the direction of the door...</span></div></div>",

That loud rage-induced glass shattering shriek didnt come from a witch. It came from a different kind of white haired woman who kicked down Kaguya's slide-in door and is burning with firey hot fury from head to toe! You could literally feel the heat of rage emitting from this white haired woman with too many bows in her hair sporting some red suspenders with little little odd tags sewn all over it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearing the worst as well as feeling so much heat from her that you might burn yourself, you immediately backed away, Smoker be damned, while Kaguya just casually turned her head to the rude intruder slightly annoyed if anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mokou? Have you ever heard of knocking?\" Kaguya casually asks, \"and I sure hope you saved up enough yen pennies to pay for that door.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kaguya!\" this Mokou girl glared at your playmate, \"what in the holy hell is THIS SHIT?!!\" She whips out a magazine and crams it in Kaguya's face. Being the curious nimrod that you are, you turn your attention away from the game, leaving Coach to die at the jaws of the horde, and look over at the magazine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough it was in a language you werent familiar with, it had a rather provocative cover. By that I mean a woman who bared a striking resemblance to Mokou posing completely nude except for mere text covering the tits of her breasts and the crotch region and giving a wink your direction!  Bare in mind I said 'bared a striking resemblance'... as in she had different colored eyes (hers was blue while Mokou's was red) and her 'white hair' looked incredibly bleached and showed remains of what looked to be blue...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm... 'Fujiwara-Chan: Undying and Uncensored',\" Kaguya read the title, \"well, that's uh... certainly one way to make a name for yourself and get popular. Congratulations, Mokou!\"<br>\r\n\"Oh shut the hell up, you manipulative neet!\" Mokou glared, \"you know that's not me!\"<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" Kaguya squinted her eyes, \"...well, what do you know? Is that Shion? Now what's that hobo doing posing as you?\" Aw crap.<br>\r\n\"Cut the bullshit!\" the p.o'ed fire-mancer snaps, \"I know you put her up to this!!

It felt like any second, that they were gonna start tearing the entire place apart! It was the perfect cue to start leaving before you get caught in their little bloodthirsty cat fight!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before you could even consider g-ing tfo, Mokou turned her stare your direction.<br>\r\n\"Oh!

My sister and I-??!!!!!\" Next thing you knew, you had a piping hot tongue forced in your mouth as Mokou's incredibly warm lips locked with yours! Before you could even realize what was going on, she had grabbed the back of your neck and forced you against her, keeping her hot passionate kiss going as long as possible!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*CRACK!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaguya smashed her controller into pieces as she glared with rage at this white haired intruder forcing herself on you! All this time, Mokou was looking back at Kaguya making sure she saw what she was doing to her 'boyfriend'! At the moment, you were kinda sorta in a daze from this intense burning hot kiss while trying not to moan what with Mokou's tongue squirming in your mouth!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EXCUSE ME!\" Kaguya shouted, \"who gave you permission to put your dirty disgusting lips on Eientei's breeding stallion?!\"<br>\r\n\"B-B-BREEDING STALLION?!\" you slurred in a drooling state as soon as you snapped out of it hearing those words and yanked yourself away from Mokou!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The only ones justified to engage in promiscuous activities with Alex are the rabbits of this hospital I personally approve of!\" Kaguya states, then mumbles with a blush, \"...and myself if I fail to find a proper consort soon.\" While the idea of siring a crowned prince is tempting, being this place's designated breeder wasnt something you agreed to!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wait a sec, Ka... your majesty! W-we never talked about this!\"<br>\r\n\"Because we never NEEDED to to,\" she answered, \"as long as youre staying under my roof, what I say goes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, can you believe this pampered little prima donna?\" Mokou asks you, \"whoring an innocent human out to her monster subordinates without any care about how he feels? This is why us humans should stick together. If you were MY boyfriend, I'd have the decency to listen to your needs.\" You couldnt fight back the blush. You just couldnt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you were his boyfriend, he'd already be dying of an infection!\" Kaguya quips.<br>\r\n\"That reminds me, Kaggy. How's your bug problem doing?\"<br>\r\n\"WHY YOU FILTHY SMART-MOUTHED HICK!!\" AW CRAP!!

It was a game show that were similar to the price is right, but was more qwerky as they had a lot of stunts to the challenger. You looked at the show until you saw the host that were in the show. You felt familiar with this person as it was a muscular man with light brown hair and hazelnut eyes. You then remembered that the person were the one who used to work for the le fay gang! everyone called him Arnold as he did have some familiar structure as the terminator himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"No..friggen...way.\" You mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You then put the remote down to watch the gameshow. As the show progressed, you felt thirsty so you took the sip of the green tea that reisen gave you earlier, dispite what happened earlier, but you really didn't care as you were thirsty. 30 minutes later, the game show were at the end and Arnold spoke up to the camera with smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Thank you for watching todays show. I hope I'll see more contestants in the future!\" Arnold spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The credit rolled and you turned off the tv to rest. You wondered if Arnold retired from the le fay gang, but you remembered that once you're part of the gang, always will be one of them. You shuddered little by the thoughts and once you breathed out, you heard an gunshot from outside. You immediately thought that maybe a gang came here or Anna shooting someone out of kicks. You got out of the bed to search for the noise despite pain and once you got out and heard the gunshot again, you went toward the area and saw Anna with a long black haired women with kimono next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Anna?\" you spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Anna turned around and you saw the black haird girl turn around holding a gun. You wondered why she was carrying the gun and you approached the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Anna, who's she? and why she's carrying your gun?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"She's Houraisan Kaguya, head of this place.\" Anna replied, \"And she asked me to use it once, so I did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You must be Annas little bro.\" Kaguya said, \"I heard from eirin that reisen almost...raped you or something.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n You were surprised to hear this and became silent for moment. Anna noticed this and then turned to the princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yes. And I will tell you and eirin if that damn bunny do something stupid again, the bullet will go through her brain.\" Anna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"anna..\" You spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'm saying this for your own protection.\" Anna replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You sighed as she was very overprotective about you. She have been this way since you joined the gang, she always been with you when you had a mission, and she did most of the killing so you would not have hard time. You thanked her for protecting you but It was getting little hassle to your life. As Kaguya was about to resume her shooting to the target, her name was called by...</span></div></div>",

You and anna didn't know who she was then kaguya gave the gun back to anna and stepped forward. She was snickering as she covered her mouth area as she looked at the white haired girl with taunting facial look at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh? what do you want today, moko-tan?\" Kaguya asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Stop calling me moko-tan you sleazy NEET! I'm going to finish the fight from other day!!\" Mokou replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You didn't know who she was until Anna pulled you aside and walked back into the wall. You didn't know why she was doing this and then you suddenly saw the two flew high in the air and started to fight with bullets. You felt magneficient as the colorful bullets were flying with the fire like a dance, and kaguya were fighting normally with this 'mokou' person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Sis? Who is that white haired women?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"She's Mokou, an immortal pyromancer who helped me get you here.\" Anna replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You were surprised to hear that as you don't remember her at all. Fighting continued for 30 minutes and both kaguya and mokou fell from the sky and crashed lightly. You and anna came to them to see if they were ok. You went to see kaguya,and noticed that her kimono were half burned off by mokous flames. You blushed by this, but kept your feeling and helped kaguya get up as she was slightly wounded. Anna helped mokou whos cloth were half ripped off by kaguyas bullets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"This might be a draw, but don't think I'll stop you neet.\" Mokou said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Try if you want.\" Kaguya replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Just then, everyone heard an chuckling noise from the forest area. You clearly saw an silhouette of the man, and once he got closer, you and anna realised who he was . It was arnold himself! He was smiling and he was truly like the terminator himself. Kaguya and mokou could feel the evil vibe from this man and then the macho man looked at you two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"So the traitorous brother and sister is here.\" Arnold said, \"I am going to have fun killing you two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Arnold! how did you find us!?\" Anna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"A stray bunny told me.\" Arnold replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He took out something from the backpack and threw it toward you all, revealing a rabbit youkai carcass, showing bones from top to bottom. You got sick from this as both princess and mokou felt the same thing. Anna took out the gun and pointed at him. Arnold noticed her and tilted his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Arnold! You know that I was you're superior! I order you to back off!\" Anna spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Arnold didn't say anything and then laughed loudly. You remember that arnold was annas employee as Anna was the head of one of the infiltration squad in the gang. After the laughter, Arnold looked at her with grin, making her shiver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You were, but since you're no longer with us, I am here to kill you and your little brother.\" Arnold replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Not if I can help it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You saw kaguya and mokou jump toward him dispite the injury, and used their spellcards. The fire hit him first and the bullets shot him multiple time, making like he would be overkill. You wondered if they killed him until two arms smacked both mokou and kaguya face, making them decapitate and fly off sideway. You and anna saw arnold smiling at the two with blood on his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Now that they are gone, I will kill you two.\" Arnold said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He then ran toward you two. Anna shot many times but it had no effect, then he came infront of you two and slammed you two with the fist. At first you thought you would die, then when you closed your eyes and opened again, you were in the patients room. You got up from the bed, looking around as you were at the room. You looked at your arms, wondering what just happened, then you saw eirin and reisen coming in.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"Eirin...Reisen...\" You spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n They both came to you and then the doctor observed you. Reisen did check your pulse and everything else, making you wonder what just happened. After check up, reisen nodded at eirin and she spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Mr.Whitestone, do you know why you're here?\" Eirin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"No, why?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I got report from princess and mokou that you and ms.whitestone were nearly killed.\" Eirin replied, \"I did one thing to make you two return to normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You didn't get what she ment, and you spoke to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Wh..what do you mean?\" You spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'm sorry mr.whitestone...I have made both you and Ms.Whitestone immortal.\" Eirin answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You then...</span></div></div>",

Eirin were shocked to see this and immediatly took out the weapon and shot many arrows. Arnold just dodged the attack and he swiped his arm, deflecting the remaining arrow. Eirin realized he was more stronger and stopped attacking him. Arnold just smiled and turned back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Now I have killed the whore bitch and her virgin shit brother, I will report to my boss.\" Arnold spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Your boss.... are you talking about the one this young man used to work?\" Eirin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Who else?\" Arnold replied, \"now excuse me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He then jumped forward and disappeared into the forest. Eirin was about to ask reisen to follow the man but both you and anna were the top priority. She was debating to herself about something for moment and then decided one thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I know I shouldn't do it, but I must as a doctor.\" Eirin said.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nJust then, Both kaguya and mokou came back to get even with the man but realised he was gone. Eirin told mokou to help her get the two body up and follow her to the medical room. Mokou wondered why  but did what she told and helped her out. Once she put you and anna on the surgery table, she took out two shots filled with some sort of liquid inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"The most dangerous and illegal medicen that I have made....the hourai elixer....I will infuse them to the two mortals.\" Eirin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She put the first shot to you, and within minute all the injury were gone and you breathed back to life.

Eirin knew she would regret the decision later, but it was for the better for you two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n -presence-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"So that's the story.\" Eirin spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"So you saved me and anna....thank you very much.\" You thanked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Eirin smiled and took the compliment.

You know that stare as if she sees the person with that glare, the person know he or she'll be either be half dead or fully dead. Anna thanked eirin for this opportunity and continued to eat the breakfast. After the breakfast, you, anna and reisen got to the entrance.

You were astonished by this and stretched little.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"This is very beautiful.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Isn't it?

Granted, it may have been rude to question how your caretakers handle dealing with personal affairs, but you were kinda caught in the middle of one.

And believe me, a few of my sister's associates tried to!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEirin sighs, \u201cTo tell you the truth, I never was much of a fan for organized religions. Never had time for them, mostly focused on my medicinal studies. And ever since I began my career, the worst patients I've ever had to deal with were uptight religious zealots. Far too many of them were too stubborn to take their properly prescribed medicine and preferred to rely on their own special methods of healing themselves from 'spritual' healing to much dangerous methods like consuming actual BLEACH! The horror stories I can tell you could fill a novel\u2026 Hmm. I think I mightve written one at least ONCE in my life, but I cant remember very well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI cant say I blame you,\u201d you tell her, \u201cI had my fair share of zealots too. Still, I did manage to find common ground with some and made good friends with them.\u201d You also wanted to add that they made great drinking buddies, but you felt it was inappropriate.<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I guess...\u201d Eirin grumbled, \u201cstill, even if, and that's a huge IF, I was interested in that creepy child snatching Hijiri's escapades, all it would do is make me a target for the TAOIST nutzos that her goons are quarreling against! The last thing we need is to bring their religious feud HERE!\u201d<br>\r\nOh boy. That is way too much information that you wanted to register this morning! Youre still lingering on the words \u201cCreepy\u2026 child snatching?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEr, I think I said too much,\u201d Eirin finally groans with exhaustion, \u201cbut you'll have to excuse me for having doubts about yet another one of her majesty's unusual phases. And please dont tell her we talked about this!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDont worry, I wont,\u201d you promised. Youre sure things are about to get way more uncomfortable, it still beats Le Fey. Though that might not be saying much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI um, better return to my desk,\u201d the doctor states, feeling she needs to stop talking about it, \u201cplease bear with the lady's little phase.

Youre not interested in saving your soul until you can properly save your life!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, youre still feeling a little exhausted since you havent gotten enough sleep thanks to that particular bunny-earred intruder. Combine that with the fact that you were in no mood for uncomfortable introductions or deep religious lectures, and taking a brief nap wins hands down!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, your brief nap is even more brief than you hoped it to be, what with the sound of someone's heavy breathing just over your head! Peeking with one eye barely open and it thankfully it wasnt Reisen this time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, the first thing you spot peering over you is...</span></div></div>",

But instead of waking up and confronting Reisen about her odd behavior, you just remained motionless... with an eye barely open to see what this odd bunny girl is up to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you feigned being asleep, you could hear Reisen's sniffing become faster as she continued sniffing you up and down. You noticed an odd twinkle in her big red eyes, as if she's not acting like herself. Or maybe she's acting like her TRUE self and that calm nurse-y etiquette side of her from earlier was just a facade from the drugs she was taking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe must feel incredibly hot right now. You noticed sweat dripping from her forehead and her bunny ears seem fidgetier which matched her heavier breathing. It was so hot, she unbuttoned the collar of her shirt and constantly adjusted it a bit to compensate.<br>\r\nWhat in the, is she drooling?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had a bad feeling about this. Nonetheless, you still remained emotionless and pretending to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"!!\" you almost ALMOST flinched when she started licking your chest! For a split second, your eyes were wide opened, but they immediately snapped shut before she could notice (provided she CARED if you were up at this point!). Her wet salivating tongue was incredibly ticklish and she licked you up like an excited dog!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Delicious,\" you heard her whisper in the middle of her licks. You couldnt resist breathing heavier as her tongue worked her way up your body. Your nails inadvertenly dug into the bed by the time she licked your neck and then your cheek.<br>\r\n\"Delicious,\" she whispered again. You had the world's best sleeping poker face despite the fact her hands felt so good rubbing your chest like that. As much as you really REALLY hated to admit it, her tickling your nipples felt pretty good too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Mr. Whitestone..\" Reisen whispered, \"you have a lot of nerve tempting this poor little moon rabbit. Tricking this innocent young woman into doing naughty things. Have you no shame?\u201d The hell?! It\u2019s YOUR fault she cant control herself?! \u201cYou wont be forgiven, you crafty devil. When you tempt a high-leveled moon rabbit like me, you better hope that you can back up what you flaunt!\u201d Back up WHAT?! What are you flaunting?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being a LITTLE worried, you kept pretending to sleep, curious to see how far this rabbit hole goes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c?!!\u201d your eyes opened and widened for a split second when Reisen locked lips with yours! Man the willpower you had not to cringe in ecstasy from her tongue tickling yours! Right then and there, she had just stolen your first kiss (well, technically it\u2018s your second, but you refuse to consider the one Maeve gave you as your real first kiss!). Unlike the other one, you actually felt loving passion from it instead of cruel cold dominance. Sure it was really more LUST than LOVE, but for the moment, you had all but forgotten the horror that was Le Fey and just filled your mind with bliss from this odd sick bunny girl\u2019s kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, it didnt last long enough for you. You really missed her lips by the time they parted from yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw\u2026 Princess Charming\u2019s kiss couldnt wake Sleeping Beauty from his spell,\u201d she whispered smiling down at you. She had gotten so bold, she climbed up in your bed and straddled you, despite your injuries! You\u2019d think she\u2019d have been caught by one of the other nurses by now! You really REALLY shouldve woken up and ended this charade, but nope. You still faked it, putting yourself in even more harm\u2019s way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow, she\u2019s warm. Nearly burning hot, even. Does she have a fever or something?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my,\u201d Reisen panted and sweated, \u201cI think I\u2019m burning up. It\u2019s\u2026 way too hot\u2026 I cant\u2026 handle it!\u201d She was so hot,  she quickly unbuttoned her blue suit and white shirt underneath it. Even in your \u2018sleep\u2019 state, it was tough keeping a straight face seeing Reisen\u2019s exquisite chest clad in a blue and white striped bikini top! You werent sure why she was wearing something like that to begin with nor did you give a fuck. There was no way to hide your blushing in your sleep!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen being on a streak, she took your hands and placed them on her chest, allowing you the honor of copping a feel of her incredibly warm boobs! Geez, they were like over 100 degrees! She could burn somebody with those babies! You fought back the urge to caress them and give them a firm squeeze, then maybe bury your head between them and motorboat those puppies!!<br>\r\n\u201cAahhh\u2026 so cool\u2026\u201d Reisen sighed from the feel of your stone-cold hands! She looked all directions one more time, JUST to be safe\u2026 then placed one of your hands down her skirt, fidgetting even more than ever!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAaahh!! A-A-Alex, sir!\u201d she had a hard time keeping control of her volume, \u201cy-y-your hands\u2026 they\u2019re so cold, b-b-but\u2026 so good\u2026\u201d Holy crap, she is WAY too into it! Why are you still letting her do this?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause you were getting into it yourself. Part of you wanted to lose your virginity to her. You would not have the luxury of finding true love when Le Fey catches you. The least you could do is experience this kind of pleasure before you die a horribly slow agonizing death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, youre simply thinking with your crotch instead of your friggin brain! You know better than to do this! Reisen\u2019s employer/master and crew literally saved your life and THIS is how you repay them?!<br>\r\nYou know what you need to do. You need to wake up and stop this mentally ill bunny girl before she does something she\u2019ll regret!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026Then again, since  Le Fey\u2019s gonna find you anyway (they always do), what\u2019s the point?</span></div></div>",

'Overprotective' doesnt even begin to describe the relationship with your sister! You'd rather avoid a potential bloodbath in Eientei after they were generous enough to treat your wounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pondered just snapping awake and go all 'WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?!' on her, but you know better than to shake up an ill girl on questionable meds... even if said ill girl is in heat. So you play dumb. As dumb as dumb can be. No, not 'A DUR!!1 LUK AT ME! IZ A FAIRREEE!' dumb, more like 'Gee, Ms. Rennels. How is dressing up in this super tight speedo in your private office at 2am going to get me to ace my final exam?' dumb. Here goes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pleasantly woke up like you were having the most wonderful dream and the first thing that catches your eye was that cute purple-haired bunny girl from earlier!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReisen's eyes widened and her pervy smirk immediately dropped.<br>\r\n\"Hi Ms. Udongein Inaba!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Gasp!!* With a loud gasp, she literally tumbled right off your bed like a cheesy slapstick comedy segment! Geez, even THAT was a bit too much for her?!<br>\r\n\u201cOh geez! Are you ok?\u201d you offered to help her up, but she backed away, perhaps too embarrassed over what she was doing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA-A-Alex-er, M-Mr. Whitestone!\u201d Reisen\u2019s face went red as she pushed her skirt down and rebuttoned her top, \u201cI\u2026 see youre\u2026 awake. A-And in good condition!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cUm, were you just on top of me a moment ago?\u201d you asked a naive \u2018No shit, Sherlock\u2019 question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUuuhhhhh\u2026\u201d Reisen rolled her eyes back and forth as if obviously brewing a good convincing excuse, \u201cY-yes. You see, I notice you were shivering really bad in your sleep a-a-and you were ice cold. A-And since the heater\u2019s broke\u2026 and we\u2019re out of electric blankets, I\u2026 I had to um\u2026 improvise.. with my body!\u201d Any sane person with the IQ above a peanut that heard that would be facepalming. However, you are an actor!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee, was I really shivering that bad?\" you kept your naive facade going, \"I dont feel like I was that cold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you were!\" Reisen kept lying, \"you were paler than my old friend, Miyako, and she's a hopping corpse!\" Ew. That's pretty revolting to think about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, I must be coming down with something bad,\" you state, \"maybe I should tell the doctor about this-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\" the bunny girl blurted out, \"Um, I mean there's no need. Fortunately, you were warmed back to normal temperature thanks to the invigorating heat emanating from my lustrous bosom and well-renown thighs of steel.\" Heh! A bit egotistical, aint she? You sure as heck wanted to play along some more!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, just your lustrous bosom and well-renown thighs of steel were enough to get rid of my cold?\"<br>\r\nReisen nodded, \"Yep. Heck, my luxrious baby-blue and pure-white striped bra and panties I typically wear have to be custom-made to trap in excessive warmth... otherwise, I could have risked giving you heatstroke.\" Oh mercy. She was making it tough not to crack up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow,\u201d you feigned acknowledgment for her, \u201cyou did that for me? Resorting to using your own body to keep me warm while I sleep? That\u2018s incredibly selfless of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is?\u201d she tilted her head before twitching her bunny ears, \u201cI-I MEAN, yes it is! There was no way I could just let you catching your death of cold like that. A-a nurse always keeps her patient\u2019s wellbeing top priority!\u201d Ugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Nurse Udongein Inaba,\u201d you cupped your hands together as if verbally saying \u2018MY HERO\u2019, \u201chow can I ever thank you?\u201d The distant stare in those glowing red eyes was really creeping you out! You kinda shivered a bit, making you wanna rethink \u2018thanking her\u2019 in her preferred way.<br>\r\nHer hands were twitching anxiously, craving to be \u2018thanked\u2019 properly! You were hoping you were just seeing things and only imagined seeing drool drip down her lips! Where in the hell is the emergency call button when you need it?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Reisen slapped herself! Part of her still harbored restraint that giving herself one good hard slap in the face snaps her out of it! Knocking herself back to sanity she turned away and shook her head, probably having a mental discussion with herself.<br>\r\nAfter that, she pulled her little bottle of pills out of her pocket and popped a pill in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed in relief and cleared her throat, \u201c*Ahem!* Well, um, if you\u2019d like to thank me, I could really use a hand tomorrow. It\u2019s my turn to volunteer looking after the little girls at Eientei\u2019s daycare center and if youre feeling healthy enough, I\u2019d really appreciate your help.\u201d You\u2019d question how SHE of all people is mentally sound enough to look after children, but now wasnt the time or place. She asked you if youre willing to help her out with taking care of some kids at the hospital\u2019s daycare center. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, that is\u2026 if it\u2019s alright with you,\u201d Reisen heavily emphasized, \u201cyou know, y-you dont have to if you dont want to\u2026\u201d it was hard not to feel warm and fuzzy inside when she gave you such pleading eyes, \u201c\u2026but this lonely, heartfelt, incredibly gorgeous with a dynamite body nurse would love it if a nice strapping young man offers to help her out.\u201d</span></div></div>",

It was kinda nerve-wrecking for you to handle, but you agreed to volunteer and help Reisen and youre a man of your word.<br>\r\nThe kids consist of different kinds of youkai if that's what you wanna call them. Cat youkai, dog youkai, bird youkai, snake youkai, rabbit youkai, the works... You felt like the odd one out. You didnt just feel lonely, you also felt a little scared. It was a natural animal instinct, but maybe you really didnt have anything to worry about. It's probably a silly stereotype and old wives\u2019 tale to think that youkai eat humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, you should probably wear these before anybody see you,\" Reisen whispered, handing you a pair of elven ears.<br>\r\nYou raised an eyebrow, \"Uh... why?\"<br>\r\n\"Some youkai have the tendency to eat humans.\" You crammed the elf ears on immediately! Political correctness, be damned! But you didnt like wearing them, mainly for the reason that it reminded you of all those OTHER pointy-earred associates you used to work with.<br>\r\n\"They look cute on you!\" Reisen commented, \u201coh, hang on. This\u2019ll make you look more official!\u201d She sprinkled glitter on your cheeks and even a little in your hair! \u201cNOW you look like a true bona fide sparkly elf!\u201d You cringed at the glittery reflection in the mirror. <br>\r\n\u201cAw man, I look ridiculous!\u201d you muttered.<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2018mon, just bear with it for a while,\u201d Reisen assured you, \u201cdo a good job and later tonight I might just reacquaint you with my lustrous bosom and well-renown thighs of steel!\u201d She unbuttoned her shirt enough to give you a glimpse of her blue and white striped bra again! Bye bye any and all complaints!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the plus side, there were a lot of bunny nurses assisting in the daycare with you and Ms. Stripes. You didn\u2019t really have to interact with much of the kids other than pick up their leftover toys, prepare sandwiches, or answer their many questions like children often do (such as \u2018Who are you?\u2019 \u2018Are you the Moon Rabbits\u2019 stud?\u2019 \u2018What\u2019s a stud?\u2019<br>\r\nYou were ordered by the other nurses not to answer any questions and let them answer for you\u2026 except for Tewi who got a thump on the head when she answered you were Eientei\u2019s special love slave. You left it all up Ms. Udongein Inaba to lead the pack while you remained a silent unimportant helper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is until story time. With puppets. The kids gathered around as you personally helped Reisen tell the story of western warrior from the great Scottish lands, Sir Zane of Rosewood and his struggle to free the moon people from the clutches of the Kagutsuchi and his nefarious scheme to seize the moon itself and create a worldwide empire of Eternal Daytime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow\u2026 the stars are so beautiful,\u201d Reisen voiced Kaguya-Hime, her pink-haired bunny-girl queen of the moon people in a black kimono, \u201cI thought we\u2019d never get the luxury to see another starlit night ever again.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt is a gorgeous sight, Lady Kaguya-Hime,\u201d you voiced Zane, the red haired human in the white hood with a little sword sewed to his hand, \u201cI think I can actually see earth from here!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHow could the Kagutsuchi hate night so much that he\u2019d want to take all of this away from us?\u201d asked \u2018Kaguya-Hime\u2018, \u201cwe of the Moon Kingdom cannot thank you enough for putting a stop to such a demon!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was just doing my job, Lady Kaguya-Hime,\u201d \u2018Zane\u2019 answered as he \u2018walked off\u2018, \u201cnow it\u2019s time for me to return home. It was a great pleasure to meet you, your majes-\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWAIT!\u201d suddenly Reisen grabbed your arm, preventing Zane from walking off and Kaguya-Hime zipped right in front of him, \u201cI-I cant simply let you leave without thanking you properly!

So I created the dreaded Kagutsuchi in hopes that I would attract a great hero brave and strong enough to slay it\u2026 and earn his place as my King!\u201d Way way WAY off the script.

You failed to notice just how bright her red eyes were glowing! This was getting awful uncomfortable to deal with. Sure you knew something was off about her from the get-go,  but maybe letting her get away with it isnt a very good idea. And worst of all, she\u2019s doing in front of the children!! Still, for the sake of the children, you had to keep cool. You wouldnt wanna freak out any of these little ankle-biters.<br>\r\nThan again, it's a little hard when Reisen's freaking YOU out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease do not deny me after all we\u2019ve been through,\u201d Reisen\u2019s Kaguya-Hime puppet was hugging your Zane puppet\u2026 so hard that your hand was getting a cramp, \u201c\u2026don\u2019t you know that rabbits die from loneliness?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Your top priority is the sake of the children youre looking after. And unless youre gonna end up teaching them sex-ed (which if you had to bet money... *ahem*), you needed to not only resist temptation, but also keep your wits about you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a hard breath and with your second wind, you yanked your Zane puppet away from Reisen's Kaguya-Hime puppet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So the rumors WERE true, then?!\" 'Zane' snapped in an angry suspicious tone.<br>\r\n\"R...Rumors?\" Reisen tilted her head, obviously THIS wasnt in the script either.<br>\r\n\"You truly are no kind and loving goddess!!\" Zane pointed, \"youre a manipulative witch who manipulates mortals for her own amusement!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W...what are you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All those innocent lives lost... sacrificed... all because of your own selfish desire to find a partner?!\" you continued, \"Have you no shame?!\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah! You tell her!\" one of the kids remarked.<br>\r\nReisen's eyes twitch, but continued her roleplay, \"W-Wait, Sir Zane! I can explain!\"<br>\r\n\"This was all a game to you, isnt it?!\" Sir Zane backed away from the manipulative goddess, \"I expected better from a graceful deity worthy of worship. How could I possibly love someone who toys with morals' lives like that?!\"<br>\r\n\"S...Sir Zane...\"<br>\r\n\"I've had enough to this game. Find someone else to toy with. I'm leaving!\" And with that, you turned the Zane puppet around. Your bunny girl friend glanced over at you, then as fast as a bullet coming out of gun, she ensnared your hand/Zane Puppet in a little cage!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"REIS-ER, KAGUYA-HIME, what are you doing?!\"<br>\r\n\"Alright, Sir Zane...\" Reisen's cold sounded both calm AND threatening, \"if I cannot have you, then no one shall!\"<br>\r\n\"H-HEY! L-LET GO OF ME!!\" that was you talking, not Zane!<br>\r\n\"Perhaps a little time in the palace dungeon should teach you some respect,\" Kaguya-Hime ordered, \"then we'll either prepare for the wedding... or the execution!\"<br>\r\n\"E-E-Execution?!\" You got incredibly nervous having a hard time figuring out if it's just part of the puppet show or is Reisen really going yandere on you?! And you cant brush away the thought of the latter. Considering she's a veteran, who knows what kinds of uh... 'interrogation' methods she may have learned to back up her threats?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...To be continued!\" Reisen suddenly turns her head to the young audience and announces sweetly right before letting go of your hand! It was like her eerie threatening mood was never there! Guess she's just a very talented actor?<br>\r\nAnyways, the kids 'awww'ed in disappointment and not much later, it was time for the kids' recess. You were so relieved to have avoided a very awkward incident in front of the kids youre supposed to be watching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd judging by the way your purple-haired bunny friend sighed in relief, so was she.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a close one,\" Reisen sighed, \"thank you for helping out, Alex-sama. I uh... didnt make you feel TOO uncomfortable, did I?\"<br>\r\nYou did, but you shook your head. \"No, it was kinda fun! I'll think I get really used to this job!\" You probably wont.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" she shrugged a little and turned away. Hm, her cheeks were red. She was still shivering and panting like she was during the puppet show. Oh bother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W....well....\" Reisen's eyes loomed on all directions as she tried to keep a straight face, \"I'm... just going through a little withdrawal from one of the meds master is making me take. I'm sure it'll clear up soon.\"<br>\r\n\"What kind of withdrawal?\" you had to ask despite possibly knowing the answer.<br>\r\n\"Err..... um... to m-make the long story short... my urge to bear baby bunnies just quadrupled!\" Oh geez! You didnt expect her to lay it on so thick!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd neither did her apparently, judging by the way she quickly turned away, red with embarrassment, but ears and body twitching with anticipation for something!<br>\r\n\"Well...\" you blushed yourself, \"if you need to, you can go to the restroom and uh... er... rub that one off,\" you felt pretty embarassed using THAT choice of words, mainly cuz you didnt know the female equivalent for it, \"Ahem! I wont tell anybody! I promise!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A...actually,\" Reisen slowly turned back to you, cheeks still flushed, shiny red eyes avoiding contact with yours, \"...I... personally think it might be more effective *gulp* quelling that urge... if I had a nice strapping male helping with that.\" OK, THERE IT GOES!<br>\r\n\"R-Reisen-\"<br>\r\n\"W-wait! Please hear me out!\" Reisen pleaded, \"I'm not really asking much. All you'd really need to do is... *gulp* just use your hand and... *sniff* you know, play with it a little... just until I say stop! It wont take long! I promise!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want me to jerk you off?\" you flat out ask, again unaware of the female equivalent of the term, \"is that what youre asking?\"<br>\r\nShe groaned, \"If that's what you wanna call it, fine, whatever! Look, I promise it'll be quick and I'll clean up the mess if there is one! And I'll definitely pay you back later!\" You SO believe that! And in all honesty, it's incredibly tempting! Still...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I er.... I dont know,\" you start blushing as well as thoughts of her 'paying you back' flash in your head!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that big a deal!\" she states, \"all I'm asking is to just use your fingers! That's all!\" Then she turns away again and once more her cheeks went red, \"O...of course... if you'd rather... feel like putting something else in there and... quell an urge of your own....\"  She shivered even more as she played with her tie, \"I wont object....\" she then reaches into her blazer and pulls out a square shaped wrapped, \"however I'll have to ask that you put this on first. I cant afford to go on maternal leave just yet.\" UGGGHH!! OF COURSE, SHE'S GIVING YOU THAT OPPORTUNITY!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn opportunity youre having a hard time saying no to! Hell, despite her embarrassed demeanor, you can almost hear the loud voice in her head screaming 'Please take the condom! Please take the condom! PLEASE TAKE THE CONDOM!!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, this would cause quite a scene (and a possible MURDER scene) if you get caught! You needed to be on your best behavior while youre being a guest at Eientei. Still, a hawt bunny girl was giving you such a tremendous opportunity, who are you to turn it down and possibly jeopardize the chances of getting another... or being given a particular opportunity you might NOT enjoy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's your choice?</span></div></div>",

Her?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, you didnt notice her ears?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cShe always had them under her hair,\u201d Reisen said.<br>\r\n\u201cWell yeah, she's a pure-blooded fairy,\u201d you explained, \u201cbut I dont care. I still think of her as my sister and nothing less. She's been with me since I was very little. We grew up together. LITERALLY. She was a kid when Ms. Le Fey put her to work with my dad as his daughter! She is seriously a born killer! Around the age I was learning how to spell my name, she had already learned how to properly juggle a Kalashnikov!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. I could tell your sis is really something,\u201d the ill bunny girl admitted, \u201cI'm g-glad you got a r-really great sister l\u2026 looking after you\u2026 er, even if she isnt related by blood.\u201d She gives you a light smile, however she looked a little hesitant while she was saying that. Guess she must be a bit shaken up from earlier.<br>\r\nCome to think of it, it probably isnt a good idea to talk any more about your sis tonight. The poor mentally ill bunny girl probably got herself more mentally scarred after seeing what she did to that red cap. If she had known that jerk got the EASY way out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe can talk some more about her tomorrow,\u201d you tell her, \u201cit's getting pretty late.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d Reisen looked around, probably for a clock or watch, \u201ch-how long was I out?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cA couple hours,\u201d you said, \u201cwe had to send all the kids back cuz we were too busy cleaning up the blood. I'm sorry I ruined the whole day care thing. That red cap only came here because he was after me.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 I'm glad the children are safe,\u201d at least she looks on the bright side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallowed, \u201cEirin told me to keep an eye on you while she's writing up apology letters to the parents.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cW-well, I'm feeling better. You can head back to your room now.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThis is my room.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cO...oh. I'll be going then-\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo it's alright, you can sleep there,\u201d you stop her just before she got up, \u201cyou deserved it after how I made such a mess of today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite how much you owed her, it showed she still cared for your well being too when she asked \u201cThen where are you gonna sleep? Certainly not the floor, it gets too cold at night.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cEh, the chair's fine,\u201d you assure her.<br>\r\n\u201cThat's bad for your back,\u201d Reisen still cared.<br>\r\nBut you assure her again, \u201cDont worry, I think I made a comfort groove in it so it shouldnt be too bad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo no! I dont want you to do that!\u201d Reisen, being so caring as she was, made you an offer that part of you totally didnt want to refuse, \u201ccome on. Get in.\u201d She lifted the covers for you. And then quickly remembering last night, you turn away with your face red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-N-N-No! T-t-t-that's fine!\u201d you waved your hand and hid your blush, \u201cI'm\u2026 well\u2026 I'm good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could feel her glowing red eyes burn a hole through your facade!<br>\r\n\u201cC'mon, Alex-sama\u2026 it's nice and cozy in here. And there's just enough room for another bedmate.\u201d<br>\r\nThoughts of last night quickly filled your head. Thoughts of what could have happened last night if you didnt stop her flood in there too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-S-seriously,\u201d you almost lose the pitch of your voice, \u201cy-you dont need to worry about me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's sooooo warm in here too,\u201d she sighed, \u201cthen again, it could just be because of this luxurious striped ensemble under my clothes.\u201d<br>\r\nDrip. Drip. That was the blood from your nose staining the floor! Nothing's gonna get that out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyways, Reisen isnt exactly wrong. The bed would be an infinitely better place to sleep than your ratty chair. Not to mention it is still YOUR bed, although you wouldnt dream of kicking your new friend out of it after the crap you just put her through thanks to your bad past.<br>\r\nHowever, part of you is still thinking with your libido and you dont wanna end up doing things you'll regret. Youre still a guest in Eientei and the last thing you wanna do is overstay your welcome by knocking up a respected inhabitant. Not to mention Anna gets pretty jealous. And when she gets pretty jealous, she gets pretty violent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it's getting pretty cold and the current thing youre gonna be sleeping in is no good for your back. Pride before comfort?</span></div></div>",

Just like reisen said, it was warm and comfy, yet your heart beat little faster as the mentally ill bunny girl was laying next to you. You told reisen good night and she did the same and both of you closed your eyes and went to sleep. Hours went by and during your sleep, you had an dream about the past. You dreamt about you going to middle school while Anna escorted you. You fully understood that she was not your biological sister, but the changeling is when she told you about it while she was escorting you. You were shocked at first but didn't complain as she always protected you when bully tries to come closer to you. You clearly remember her smile that was sweet and innocent, covered with full light. You opened your eyes, seeing the pitch black room and got up to get some water. As you were walking through the hallway you saw Anna leaning on the wall, closing her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hey sis, you're not going to sleep?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I was. Had to go to the restroom.\" Anna replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh, I see...well, Good night.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You passes through her to get some drink until you felt anna wrap her arm around you. You felt her warmth and when you looked at her you noticed that her eyes were somewhat blank. You didn't know why then you felt her squeezing you little tighter. You had some sort of idea that anna might be either sad or afraid, then anna spoke to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Little brother...does it bothers you about me not being a biological sister?\" Anna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What are you talking about? of course not.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I known you since you were a baby and when I was only 7 years old. You growned up so quickly that I didn't even notice..\" Anna spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You looked at her ears, showing a pointy side on top and then you looked at her, realizing that her tears were coming down. You didn't know why she was crying then she spoke up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'm so sorry, that I couldn't be your true sister..\" Anna apologized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You have thought to comfort her and when she released you, you..</span></div></div>",

If there's one thing that giets a hardass chick like her all mopey, it's this. How many times do you have to tell her you didnt care?!<br>\r\nOn the plus side, at least responding to this mopey attitude of hers makes you feel about 7 years older. It you have to do it a million more times before she finally gets it, you'll gladly do it a million more times before she finally gets it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe almost gasped when you suddenly pulled her in close and hugged her right back! You squeezed her tight while she practically stunned at your sudden boldness, as she always is. Heck, youre so bold, you tickle her behind her elven ear. Normally, she REALLY hates being tickled behind the ear... but not when YOU do it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Alex?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you already,\" you whisper to her, \"it doesnt matter to me.\"<br>\r\n\"B-But-\"<br>\r\n\"It doesnt matter,\" you repeated, \"youre still my sis. I dont care what anybody else says. I say you are and will always be my sis.\" If you had a dollar for every time you said that and it caused Anna to shut up, your dad wouldnt be needed to pay off the national deficit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd add another dollar. Judging by the feeling of her resistance dwindling down to nothing, youre certain she's feeling better. But you dont let go. Something tells you she wants you to keep hugging her, so that's what you do.<br>\r\nAnd sure enough, you notice her cheeks get a little red before she hugs you right back. Wow, she's so warm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlex, sir...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVery warm. And boy does she have a tight grip. Not that it feels bad, youre completely fine with-your eyes widened as you felt her hand firmly squeezing your butt!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up in a single blink of an eye before you could become scarred for life (even though she's not your biological sister, so it's not THAT awkward!). You sighed, pondering that dream but only for a few seconds, when you realize your arms were wrapped around a certain bedmate of yours!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, Reisen's still sleeping pretty soundly despite keeping a firm grip with her hug. Not to mention, you STILL felt a hand on your butt!<br>\r\nUnfortunately for you, pushing her off was far easier said than done. Youre not sure how, but she's quite a bit stronger than she looks. She's not squeezing enough to crush bone, but it's not a grip you can just squeeze out of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPst! Reisen!\u201d you whispered, \u201cReisen wake up!\u201d She moaned a little, but instead of waking up, she just squeezed you a bit tighter! \u201cReisen! C'mon wake up!\u201d Nope, she just snuggled even closer. \u201cR-Reisen, c'mon!\u201d you resort to squirming in impenetrable grasp with little to no resort, \u201cI said wake up! Wa-\u201d Her grip finally loosens and you break free\u2026 but you learn last minute you were too close to the edge of the bed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Thump!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHm?!\u201d hearing you hit the cold floor snapped Reisen out of bed, \u201cAlex? ...OH!\u201d You got to see her big glowing red eyes gaze down at you in surprise before she kindly helps you, \u201cAre you ok? Did you fall off? You didnt hurt yourself, did you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm fine I'm fine,\u201d you pretend you didnt just twist your ankle, \u201cI'm glad to see you managed to sleep pretty soundly.\u201d<br>\r\nThe ill but rather strong bunny girl chuckled nervously, \u201cW-well your\u2026 bed is much comfier than mine, so\u2026 er, anyways, thanks for letting me sleep here.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt was no problem,\u201d you assured her, \u201cyou needed it more than I did. Now let's go. Anna's gonna make us breakfast,\u201d Reisen's ears twitched a bit hearing you mention your sis again, but you didnt notice, you were just about to rush out the door, \u201cyou havent lived until you tried her steak. You will not find a steak house that can make their meat as tangy and zesty as she can!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-wait.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, hearing Reisen's voice sound so timid just stopped you in your tracks. Still concerned for her, you turn back to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face went red and she had a hard time keeping her head straight, \u201cI was just\u2026 wondering something. It's about your sister.\u201d<br>\r\nYou give her your undivided attention.<br>\r\n\u201cWere you two um\u2026 close?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I-I mean, well, considering youre not really related by blood, and you two were really close for so many years,\u201d she's laying it on pretty thick, \u201cI'm just wondering if youre CLOSE-close.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou squinted your eyes a bit. Youre a little thick-headed, but you might know what she's asking. Still, you need to be sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell she is attractive\u2026 if youre into the whole tough girl with funny ears sorta schtick,\u201d ironic SHE of all people mentioning funny ears, \u201cso, what I'm asking is\u2026 do you have feelings for her? Not 'sibling' feelings, but 'significant other' feelings.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOOOOOOOOHHHHH! THAT'S what she's asking, eh?

You had some affection toward her as she always protected you and took care of you when you were growing up. When you done some easy missions with her the feeling became more stronger as she was becoming a women with strong attitude. Anna told you that she felt little sympathy for your father when he died, and both you and anna became very close since then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"..You see reisen, I love my sister as who she is.

She told it was alright and not tell her right away then went to the dining room to get the breakfast. Once you arrived in the dining room everyone else was there with food on the table. Anna was sitting next to tewi and reisen sat next to her master. You sat down and looked at the food as it was steak and egg with hash browns and english muffin and some tea. You all thanked for the food and when it started to eat breakfast, reisen pointed out something that was obvious to the eientei crew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"say, where's the princess?\" Reisen asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I bet she went all-nighters playing Online game.

She looked very tired as she greeted everyone and sat next to you to have some breakfast. She thanked for the food and started to cut the steak and eat some. You could tell she was very tired as her eyes were narrowly open and she was chewing the steak very slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Princess, did you really play the game all-nighter?\" Reisen asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I was fighting this superboss that was super tough with my online friend.\" Kaguya replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You sweated little as she was talking to others while eating, you looked at anna and she was just quiet and continued to eat some breakfast.

But lo and behold, they twitched when you spoke into them.<br>\r\nShe turned her head to you as if waiting for you to explain what you meant. You didnt say anything for a moment until you had enough of a space of privacy between the two of you. After seeing Eirin was in a bit of a long discussion with your sister while Kaguya was pretending to listen while taking glances down at her 3DS, it was as private as you could get at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean... after what happened yesterday,\" you clarified.<br>\r\nShe exhaled, \"I'm doing better. I take vitamins for my stress problems, so I'm already relaxed.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm really sorry about what happened,\" you apologized, \"I promise what just happened last night... I'll make sure it wont happen again.\"<br>\r\nShe inhaled then exhaled again, but smiled. \u201cDont worry, Alex-sama,\u201d what is with that nickname? \u201cthis wasnt the worst I've ever experienced. As a veteran myself, I've er\u2026 seen things.\u201d A veteran, eh? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou were a veteran?\u201dthis intrigues you. That would explain why she seems a bit stronger than she looks.<br>\r\nUnfortunately she frowned and got a bit nervous, \u201cI\u2026 was\u2026 I'm sorry, I'd rather not talk about it right now. S-Sorry.\u201d<br>\r\nIf she's reluctant, it might be something traumatizing. Best not ask her about it just yet. For all you know, the reason she's so mentally ill could be due to PTSD.<br>\r\nYou nodded, \u201cOk. I understand. I wont talk about it.\u201d So you immediately change the subject, \u201cAnd once again, I'm sorry I ruined day care for everybody. I dont know how you guys are gonna save face after that blood bath.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cTsk!\u201d the bunny girl for some godforsaken reason snickered, \u201cyou think that the worst day care day gone wrong? I've had clients who ended up EATING other clients' kids and they STILL come back a week later to drop their remaining ones off!\u201d Your eyes nearly bugged out of their sockets hearing something so disturbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-S-seriously?\u201d<br>\r\nShe nodded, \u201cThere's a real good reason I made you wear those cute little elf ears, Alex-sama. Not just cuz they look absolutely adorable on you!\u201d She remarked with a giggle.<br>\r\nBeing such a sucker for flattery coming from such a cute (yet ill) bunny girl, you were obligated to repay her in kind.<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if it means I get to see more of you in that luxurious striped ensemble, I'll gladly put on the green cap and tunic to match!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEheheheh\u2026\u201d Reisen gave you a nervous smirk and fidgeted almost uncontrollably from your flattery. In all honesty, the reaction kinda scared you a little. Maybe flirting with a rather strong mentally ill woman who may possibly have military training aint such a good idea.<br>\r\nBut then again, you've already pissed off the most fearsome mafia in existence, so youre pretty much a dead man walking already. You might as well just stick your head between Reisen's boobs and yank her striped bra off with your teeth while youre at it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour friend almost hopped out of her seat with surprise hearing your sister suddenly call her out just inches behind her! As usual, Anna's so sneaky, not even you saw her coming!<br>\r\nReisen was still trembling as she was forced to turn her head to her, possibly hoping she didnt hear the slightly perverted conversation she had with her brother (considering the kind of power house Anna was, she had every reason to be afraid!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-Y-Yes, Anna?\u201d Reisen continued trembling, \u201c...sama?\u201d<br>\r\nThankfully, Anna wasnt angry. Her face didnt show off any particular mood. Just cold and nearly lacking emotion.<br>\r\n\u201cUh, Ms. Udongein Inaba, right?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cY-yes,\u201d the bunny girl answered, \u201chow can I help you?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI heard from the others you can speak a bit of farsi, is that true?\u201d your sister questioned.<br>\r\nRei nodded, \u201cY-yes it is. I studied overseas when I was younger. Persia had one of the highest ranked universities in the world back then.\u201d Persia? Doesnt she mean Iran?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood. I could really use your help,\u201d Anna insisted, \u201cI've got to deal with an international trade proposal and I need a translator.\u201d OH SONOVA-<br>\r\nYou spit out a chunk of steak and glared at her! \u201cAnna, youre not seriously asking her to-\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDont worry Alex,\u201d she interrupted you, \u201cshe's not gonna be in harms way. All I need you to do, Ms. Udongein Inaba, is to simply transcribe the little conversation I'm gonna be having with a couple of smart mouthed Peri bitches from the Summer Court.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThe Summer Court?!\u201d you couldnt take this lying down, \u201cwhy are you getting involved with them? They HATE you!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI know,\u201d she admitted, \u201cbut I have something that a certain few fairies on that side want bad.\u201d You gritted your teeth. It's bad enough she's still making shady deals with shady people even while on the run, but now she wants to drag an employee/patient of the very hospital that's allowing you refuge along with her?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have my word that nothing will happen to you,\u201d your sister promised Reisen, \u201cit's just gonna be a quick a transaction. We'll get in, you talk between us, we make the transaction, and we'll get out. I promise you a nice share if you do it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReisen took a bit of time deciding whether or not to go with her. You dont think it's a good idea, but if your sister assures her she'll be fine\u2026 well, you do trust her word\u2026 considering you looked up to her for so long. She'd be in safe hands with your sis watching her.<br>\r\nHowever, you seriously wish she'd stop putting other people in the middle of her shady affairs as well as quit these shady affairs to begin with!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot to mention, maybe YOU'D like to have a little more alone time with the bunny girl!

You sighed, wondering what you had to do and turned only to see the princess standing from afar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hello princess houraisan.\" You greeted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Mm..\" Kaguya replied, still sleepy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She got her shoes and walked pass you and got out. You wondered what you wanted to do until you saw someone come out of the bamboo forest. It was Momoi, the pyromancer who were a arch rival to Kaguya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hey Kaguya!! I'm here to fight you!\" Mokou showed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Stop shouting, I'm not in mood in fighting.\" Kaguya replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well, I'll make you feel it!\"  Mokou shouted back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She shot few fire bullets and hit her chest. It made Kaguya wake up and the wound healed and started to smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Fine, you bitch. I'll make you regret it!\" Kaguya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n They then started to fight while you observed the fight to ease boredom. Meanwhile, both Anna and Reisen arrived in the human village. Anna explained that the people she knows are very powerful fairy, and they are not to be messed with. Once in the village, they got to the destination as it was an abandoned house. They got in and saw a tall lady with long black hair and white dress while other wore green skirt, short green hair and had a fairy wings. There were a tention and Reisen could feel it to the point she could tast it. Anna went in and sat as Reisen did the same, the tall fairy spoke in Farsi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Um...she says that if you brought what they want.\" Reisen said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Tell then I have it.\" Anna replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She translated and saw anna summon a gold coin and a crown. Reisen wondered what it was while she noticed the tall fairy bring out a huge case. Reisen looked and the tall fairy opened the case, revealing a full cash before her. She then spoke and Reisen responded to Anna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"She says this is the cash in full.\" Reisen said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Anna just looked at it and took one stash of bill. She counted the money and looked at the sky to see if it's not fake. She nods and put it back and handed over the crown and the gold coin and took the case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Tell her the deal is done.\" Anna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She translated it, and anna told her that they are leaving and got up. Before they could leave, Reisen heard a clicking noise and once she looked back, she saw the green haired fairy holding a sword, pointed at Anna and spoke in Farsi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You bitch...I'll never forget what you did with our ambassador..?\" Reisen spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Anna didn't say anything and started to walk. The green hair was about to chase after her until someone put a blade on her neck while the tall one had the same situation. It was a purple haired woman's with skull mask on their face on their back. Anna then turned around and spoke up.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"Reisen, tell them that if they dare come close to me, my brother, the surroundings...I will personally erase their fire.\" Anna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Reisen then noticed a vein looking things appear on her neck and her both cheeks. Reisen could tell she was using \"something\" and it was evil. She translated it out of fear and after that, they got out and the skull masked lady got off and vanished in darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Back in eientei, the fight between Kaguya and Mokou lasted.</span></div></div>",

THREE WHOLE HOURS! 3 hours of listening to those two over-aged immortal brats scream their heads off at eachother, tear the place apart trying to get at eachother, and desperately dodging their destructive blows and projectiles as they hadnt a single care in the world of all the innocent bystanders in the way of them! This was a hospital and there were quite a few sick people in beds clinging to life, and these two didnt care the slightest. Their bloodthirsty hatred for each other outweighed the concern for their safety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot to mention, when it wasnt dangerously violent, it was loud and annoying. Their screamed at each other for the stupidest things. One loses at a video game, they shriek. One gets a bigger slice of pizza than the other, they shriek. One gets one or two less bruises than the other during their fighting, they shriek. One reminds the other of the time the other's dad tried to propose to the one and she turned him down flat cuz he was unworthy, they ROAR and shriek! Honestly, you get some people just plain dont like eachother, but good lord, this was getting insane!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo for three hours, you put with Kaguya and Mokou trying to kill eachother. Well actually, you ferment for three hours, slowly bringing your blood to a boil, trying to ignore that which cant be ignored. It's quite an amazing feat that all the servants of Eientei can put up with their unbearable brat of a princess and her equally hotheaded rival's ragefest for such a long time (maybe cuz theyre used to it), cuz you cant. You cant take it anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BANG!! BANG!! BANG!!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMokou and Kaguya stopped pulling eachother's hair as the sound of loud gunshots in the air put the whole of Eientei to silence! The eyes of the arch-rivals narrowed toward the direction of the young mortal human panting heavily with the smoking gun in his hand raised in the air! A glance of the sheer absolute rage on his face stopped the two cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"SHUT UP!!\"</b> you screamed as loud as your aching vocal cords would allow, <b>\"SHUT! UP! SHUT THE FUCK UP!!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey stared, frozen with shock and possibly fear as you paced toward them, giving your throat a short moment to relax before screaming again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CANT YOU GODDAMN HOWLER MONKEYS SOLVE YOUR LITTLE DISPUTE WITHOUT TEARING THE PLACE APART?!\" you take another breath and lower your smoking gun, \"THIS IS A FUCKING HOSPITAL! THERE ARE BEDRIDDEN PATIENTS BARELY CLINGING TO LIFE THAT ARE TRYING TO REST! YOU TWO GOT A PROBLEM, SETTLE IT OUTSIDE AWAY FROM HERE AND STOP BUGGING EVERYBODY!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou panted like an exhausted dog after finally letting that out. It seemed like the entire ESTATE itself went quiet for a brief moment as Mokou and Kaguya stared back at you silently and unblinkingly. Finally after a long silent couple of seconds, the two quickly darted out of there as fast as they could run! Problem solved?<br>\r\nWith that 3 hour nightmare finally put to an end, you collapsed on the floor and put your gun away, still catching your breath. Lord knows your throat's gonna be sore tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, son!\" little Tewi popped up out of nowhere, ruining the moment of silence, \"check out the cajones on THIS gringo! Them little putas didnt know what hit 'em!\" Despite still boiling a little inside, you appreciated the humor, but you were too out of energy to laugh.<br>\r\n\"In all serious, though,\" the little rabbit girl said with a serious tone, \"I hope you know the Princess aint gonna forget that little outburst of yours any time soon.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know,\" you finally sighed.<br>\r\n\"Still,\" she smirked, \"it's about time SOMEBODY finally put her in her place!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou inhaled and exhaled and finally felt your heart rate go down to modest levels. \"Are those two ALWAYS like that when theyre together?\"<br>\r\n\"Nah,\" Tewi answers, \"just every other day. Then once in blue moon, for some reason, they get along incredibly well and do things together like really really close friends... then the next day, it's back to the fighting again.\"<br>\r\nYou groaned. \"I'm sorry you have to put up with all that. I'd hate to imagine how long you guys have had this!\"<br>\r\n\"Well, you get used to it,\" she explains, \"sooner or later you find something to pass the time to take your attention away from it. Eirin fiddles with her drugs, I pull a few pranks on total morons, Reisen volunteers to be one of those total morons, we all cope in our own way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, no offense, but the whole purpose me and my sister came here was to get AWAY from such murderous mayhem,\" you had to get your opinion across, \"if I knew THIS was what I had to look forward to, I'd probably still be on the run.\"<br>\r\nLittle Tewi sighs and shakes her head, \"Oh c'mon. Dont throw in the towel just yet. You just need to break yourself in a little. If we can handle your demons that see to be hunting you down, you can handle ours.\" Oh right. THOSE demons. Like the ones that ambushed the daycare center! And there you were complaining that the brat pair was way too much for you to handle!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d you sigh in defeat, \u201cthinking about it, if the worst I gotta put up with is your princess's temper tantrums, maybe I shouldnt be complaining.\u201d<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Tewi inhaled through her teeth, signaling that it might not be the worst! \u201cActually er\u2026 there is um\u2026 well, one particular woman that shows up around here once in a long while that\u2026 well, to be quite honest, we're all scared shitless of..\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWho might that be?\u201d you get curious.<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I better not tell you too much, cuz she said she'd skin me alive and feed me to the sharks if I opened my mouth too much,\u201d she stated with fear, \u201cbut she's kinda the reason we're all HERE instead of up on the moon with the rest of the Kingdom!\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cIs she a fearsome mob-boss too?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n\u201cYes and no,\u201d Tewi says, \u201cshe's also not completely of sound mind. Every once in a while, she shows up at the daycare center, scaring ALL of our customers away, and makes us look after her darling son.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat's the big deal about that?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHer son's been dead for years!!\u201d GEEZ! These guys actually have to look after crazy mob-boss's son's corpse?! Nightmare fuel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little brat began looking all directions as if checking to see if she's being watched, \u201cLook, you'll know if she ever shows up. Trust me. And when she does, you just smile and keep your big fucking mouth shut. And dont ever EVER ask her about her son!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, dont worry, I'll mind my manners. I promise,\u201d you assure her, \u201canyways, that little explosion took a lot out of me. I'm gonna head back to my room and lie down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNeed a little bedmate to keep you company?\u201d you try your best not to look disturbed by that brat's offer.<br>\r\n\u201cIt's ok. I'm fine!\u201d you answer with a forced smile and dart off. No sooner that you shake off that weird moment, does the regret of screaming your head off at the leader of this establishment that's allowing you refuge come crashing over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tell yourself that it was for the best, especially considering not just your tolerance for pointless violence and unbearable whining, but also for safety of the workers and patients of this hospital. Still, you were practically biting the hand that's sheltering you.<br>\r\nWell, youre gonna have to cross that burning bridge when you get to it. 'Til then, you hopped in your warm cozy bed and took a nice long nap. At the very least, getting some shuteye was a breeze after biting a few bickering's brats head off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least for a few hours, anyway. Few hours later, youre quickly jolted back awake cuz your body was feeling very funny. Your lower half had a bit of weight pressing over it and under the covers you felt a draft YET it was surprisingly warm down there at the same time! And your crotch\u2026 well, it was acting all kinds of crazy to say the least. You couldnt really say it was a BAD feeling you were feeling\u2026 cuz it sure wasnt feeling bad! In fact, you'd lying if you said you didnt wanna let this feeling keep feeling!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you took no chances and gazed downward toward the source of this incredible feeling.. which was happening under the covers. You could make out a silhouette bobbing up and down right where youre feeling that feeling! You were getting suspicious. You were also twitching with ecstasy from the incredible sensation down there!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut youre suspicious nonetheless, so you look under the covers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh thank god! Reisen's back and unhaARRRRRRMMMMMED?! Suffice to say your little bunny girl friend was very happy to see you\u2026 what with her vigorously sucking your dick and all. Youre thrilled that your sister didnt get her killed while your friend downstairs was completely overjoyed she was having her lips and tongue slurping up on all the right spots!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to be shocked, but you were desperately holding back the urge to moan! Her mouth was working your nether-muscle hard! Your conscience was nagging you to make her stop and focus on asking her where she and Anna went and if they ran into trouble. But the vast majority of your body (at least the part that mattered) was willing to wait until later! MUCH later!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe longer you pondered whether or not to stop Reisen, the longer she continued sucking on your manhood passionately, savoring that particular 'flavor' she was longing for since that other night she snuck in your room!<br>\r\nWell, you managed to stop her last time. Will you be doing that again\u2026 or did she happen to change your mind with her special 'oral persuasion technique'?</span></div></div>",

She became more faster while the ecstasy became more bigger then within 4 minutes, you went on climax and shot your seed into her mouth. She shivered little and strongly gulped your seed down her throat. She then looked at you with blush and smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Good afternoon Alex-Sama!\" Reisen greeted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Good morning, reisen.\" You replied with smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She then came out of the blanket and laied next to you. You asked her about what happened with Anna, and she explained the situation. You were glad she weren't skinned alive since anna is known for torture anyone who pisses her off. After few moment, both of you got out of the bed to get some lunch. After dressing up, you two got out and walked toward the kitchen then suddenly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n SLAM!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and reisen saw Anna slammed out of the room, hitting on the wall with steam coming out of her body. You shouted her name and ran toward her as reisen came to her out of worried feeling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Anna! Are you alright!?\" You asked in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Alex...I'll be fine..\" Anna spoke with pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She grabbed her chest in pain as reisen came to her. You gave her way and let the bunny nurse looked as Anna panting in pain. Reisen looked at her eyes, checked her vitals, and such. Reisen then turned to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Alex-Sama, please call master eirin now!\" Reisen said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Alright!\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You got up and ran fast. You got to doctors room and saw eirin finishing up patients paper. You told her what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Eirin! My sisters in pain!\" You told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Really? Then we must-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 'Aaaahhh!!!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You and eirin heared faint screaming noise. You and eirin nodded and rushed toward the area. Once you two arrived, you saw reisen looking at the wall, then noticed you two. Both you and eirin then noticed Anna...but in different form. She had short white hair, darker skin tone as if she tanned and were revealing her pointy ears in bright light. You also noticed she was shorter then her usual height, and You didn't know what was going on as eirin came next to her, she checked your sisters vitals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vitals are normal..she seems fine..\" eirin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"But she was in pain.\" Reisen said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Just then, Anna opened her eyes, revealing her eye color changed into violet. She looked around then noticed you and smiled. You didn't get what was going on as she got up and came to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look fine, dear little brother.\" Anna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Dear? Anna, what's going? What happened to you?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What do you mean? I'm just being myself, you know?\" Anna replied, tilting her head, \"I am Anna whitestone, dark elf ready to protect you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You then remember when you were around 7 years old, she was like this. You then had a theory..one theory then turned to eirin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Dr.Yagokoro..I think my sister somehow..reversed her age.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What? Is that possible?\" Eirin spoke in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You then felt Anna grabbing your shirt. You noticed her eye with worries inside it and came close to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Brother..is everything alright?

You and reisen got in and noticed a phile and a cup that was on the sideways with some sort of bluish liquid in the table. You didn't know what it was until you saw reisen cringe little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Master yagokoro..that's..\" reisen spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Indeed, this is the elixir of youth that I hidden away.\" Eirin replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You were surprised to hear that and asked why it was here. Eirin explained she created the elixir as experiment and once she succeeded into creating it she hid it so no one could ever steal it.  Just then, Anna came in with smile and you looked at her. You couldn't believe that your big sis suddenly became a child form of herself. Eirin brainstorm on how this even until she got one thing into her mind and gave off an evil smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Reisen, I'm going to find that prank loving rabbit now. Please watch over Mr.Whitestone and his sister.\" Eirin spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Y-yes master yagokoro!\" Reisen responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n With that she left the scene.

I know how to shoot desert eagle with blind folds and quick draw!\" Anna said with cheer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You laughed lightly as reisen sweated until princess houraisan came in, asking reisen to do some errands until she noticed Anna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Who's this little brat?\" Kaguya asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You were annoyed and was about to tell until the big little sister came forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Don't think you can mock me, miss! I am Anna Whitestone, dark elf in service of Le Fay to protect little brother Alex!\" Anna replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Kaguya looked at her in disbelief then turned to you two. Reisen explained to her about what's going on and once she understood, she saw anna trotting toward the princess and pouncing the princess but with little effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Take this!! And that!!\" Anna spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You quickly got her off and apologized to the princess while your sis struggles. Kaguya had no reason to get mad and turned to reisen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Look reisen, I need you to go to kourindou to pick up these things.\"  Kaguya said, handing over the paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yes, princess.\" Reisen replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You offered her to be with her and the rabbit quickly took your offer.

You knew she hated being tickled by the ears but this time, she actually enjoying it with little giggle! reisen was surprised to see this as well, smiled and tickled her other ears as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"Hehe, it tickles little.\" anna spoke with cute voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You could hardly believe that this young girl is the same  big, tough, bold sis that you once knew. Probably something in that medicine that she took made her mind alter to her child self as well. As you tickled your sisters ears, you remembered something and turned to reisen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"sey reisen, want to rub her belly?\" you asked.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\"can..can I?\" reisen asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n annas ears were ticklish but it was her belly that was the true weak spot as you once rubbed her belly, she became like a jelly after a few rub down. You asked Anna if reisen can rub her belly, she hesitated for moment and then gave you the doll and turned to the bunny girl, lifting her cloth revealing her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"If...its for big brother, I dont mind.\" anna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n this made reisen blush and gently rubbed her belly. Anna twitched as reisen rubbed her belly, she started to stroke it more, causing anna to laugh little. You saw the bunny girl enjoying the belly rubbing as anna laughing. After few minutes of rubbing you saw anna breathing heavy while reisen was in heaven mode. You then picked anna up and carried her on her back to go back home with reisen and it took...</span></div></div>",

As she slept, you looked around and opened the doors to see if there\u2019s something interesting then you saw a photo album. You took it out neatly and quietly and you put it on the table. You opened up the book and saw a photo of your late mother on the hospital bed carrying baby you and Anna around seven years old. You felt nostalgic as you looked and turned pages of you growing up and Anna being with you all the time. You wondered how this album for here in the first place but you shoved the feeling to the side and was about to close the album until one photo fell from back. You curiously picked up the photo, revealing teen Anna with dyed hair, vain looking line around her neck, black dress and a black sword with red lines on it. You didn\u2019t know why or how she became like this as you looked at the current sos, she looks too normal for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n (Should I tell other about this?) you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You then saw the door open, revealing to be Reisen. You hid the picture behind your back pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cAlex-sama? What\u2019s that book?\u201d Reisen Asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cIt\u2019s my family album. Want to see it?\u201d You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWould I!?\u201d Reisen said with squeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She came next to you and opened the album. She smiled and squealed in delight seeing the baby photo, but you told her to calm down since Anna was sleeping. She understood and continued to looked at it. You wondered if you should tell Reisen about the picture you saw earlier...with Anna and her black sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Will you tell her?</span></div></div>",

It tickles!\" Anna spoke while giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n All three of your heart throbbed by the cute appearance and her voice. You never seen her like this other then when you were VERY little! Eirin wondered why Anna became like this until she had a thought and went into the room where Anna got out, seeing a cup with some spilled green liquid on the table. You got in and saw eirin taking a sniff of the liquid in the cup and had anger vein on her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This smell...somebody put an age regression medicine in it.\" Eirin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Age regression!?\" You spoke, \"why did you make that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"It was a failed drug that I was supposed to get rid of it, but somehow it disappeared.\" Eirin said, \"I think I know who's the culprit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Eirin then came to the other door and slammed the side door open, revealing tewi hiding. Tewi  looked at you three, sweating little and started to run away but Eirin immediately caught her and lifted her to her eye sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Teeewiii?? Was it you who gave mr.whitestones sister the age regression drug?\" Eirin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"L-look, I was just trying to have little prank, that's all!\" Tewi tried to make excuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Your prank isn't funny tewi.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Tewi had some idea that her prank won't go smoothly but then she saw eirin looking her with evil looking smile that even you and reisen could feel her evil vibe from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Tewi, you know I told you if I catch you pranking again, I'm sending you to the happy chair.\" Eirin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Please!! Any where but that!!\" Tewi begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Eirin turned to you, telling that she'll take care of the bratty kid and went away while Tewi screamed 'nooo!' And they went away. You sighed in relief as you sat down, you saw Anna walking in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Umm..did something happen to that little ms.rabbit?\" Anna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well..she've done something bad and doctor here is going to punish her.\" You explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ah, I see.\" Anna replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Both you and reisen made an 'daww!' Face and reisen petted her head while you tickled her ears. Anna cutely telling you two to stop but both you and reisen continued to do it for 4 minutes and Anna laied down with her belly open panting from the petting and tickling. Reisen looked at her belly with little blush and you smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Say reisen, do you want to rub her belly?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Would I?\" Reisen spoke with smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What?

The princess and that pyromaniac she was spending 3 whole unbearable hours fighting with. And sure enough, they were staring your direction. Just yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough you were slightly terrified that they held a grudge, you kept a straight face going for your big now little sister.<br>\r\n\"Hi Mokou,\" Reisen greeted the white haired suspender wearing pyromancer, but quickly twitched realizing how her rudeness. \"G-Good afternoon, Lady Kaguya!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Whitestone,\" Kaguya still looked your way, her facade completely unreadable, \"would you come with us for a moment? There's something we need to show you.\" You felt nothing but bad vibes. Were they still upset? Tewi said Kaguya wouldnt forget. Then again, you dont think anybody in the hospital is gonna forget the sound of random gunfire and the roars of the only male around telling their princess to shut the fuck up. Youre probably gonna have to bend over backwards to say the least to forgive you for such an unacceptable transgression!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle Anna looked worried, which made you even more worried. If something was up, she might not be in a position to bail you out. Even Reisen's ears were twitching with caution.<br>\r\nIt cant be helped. You cant keep relying on your sister to bail you out forever. Sooner or later, you gotta face the music by your lonesome. Besides, maybe worse case, you'll probably just get chewed out for a couple hours and expected to do a bunch more chores. How horrible can it be?<br>\r\n\"It's alright,\" you whispered to your sis, \"I'll be ok.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get up and nod to Kaguya, \"Ok. I'll go.\" And with that, you leave with the two. It was a long and quiet walk down the hallway. Not a sound was made except for the occasional drag from Mokou as she violated the obvious No Smoking rule. You dont say anything and youre surprised Kaguya doesnt either. You'd think that resort to at least ONE pointless fight!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which, that reminds you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026 er...\u201d you attempt to break the silence, \u201cl-look, if this has anything to do with uh, what I did yesterday, well...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOH! That?\u201d Kaguya smiled and laughed, \u201cno no, dont worry about it. If anything, we should thank you for that.\u201d Thank you?<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah!\u201d Mokou nodded, \u201cyou were right. We were SO out of line yesterday. Hell, I even forgot what we were fighting about!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cS...so youre not at me or anything?\u201d you asked with your hopes starting to rise.<br>\r\n\u201cAbsolutely not!\u201d said the princess, \u201cin fact, right after we ran due to tremendous fear of being shot, Mokou and I sat down and had a talk. You wouldnt believe how much of a weight off our shoulders it truly was.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYep,\u201d Mokou agreed just before flicking her used cigarette, \u201cwe really do need to quit all these pointless feuds. I mean so what if I'm clearly the better fighter in every way shape or form?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAnd so what if every male member of her family still has the hots for me?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThe point is there is SO much more we can accomplish together if we actually put our petty differences aside!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that's great news! Maybe things will be looking up after all. It sounds like you just accomplished a next-to-impossible feat Eientei wise! Getting the two biggest, bitterest rivals to finally get along permanently!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpeaking of which,\u201d Kaguya smiled and the three of you stopped at a door, \u201cwe've combined our powers and brainstorm an idea that would keep a horrible disastrous beast out of our and my family's hair for a while.\u201d She opens the door and the three of you walk in. You give quick notice of the rather large coffin-like box with red velvet padding inside. The box itself stood on a big stand in front of a large heart shaped sign with flowers and the letters 'Happy Birthday Junko' written on it.<br>\r\n\u201cIt involves you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you felt a quick jab in your neck! You spotted the syringe in Mokou's hand, but it was already too late! Whatever was in that stuff was hella strong. The drug spread throughout your body at mach speed and in just seconds, you were out cold! You didnt even have the strength to so much as struggle the tiniest as they dragged your immobile body. You barely heard, \u201cHurry! Theyre gonna be here any minute!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get no pleasant rest. It was more like a sleep paralysis you were feeling. You couldnt move or open your eyes, but you could listen. You heard a bit of whispering. Then voices you havent heard before. Most of it was unintelligable but there was a brief moment you clearly overhear.<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa! You got her THIS for her birthday? You gonna get ME something similar for mine soon?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHe's a former member of Le Fey. He knows things. Things your employer be interested in knowing.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHm. And you think he's worth your pop's freedom, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it's ultimately up to HER but-\u201d you hear a loud slam and the voices are unintellible again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passes. Who knows how much. At the very least, you start to come to. Youre aching, uncomfortable, and you feel quite a draft. And sadly, you dont wake to the joy of having your dick sucked by a cute bunny girl.<br>\r\nYou come to and find yourself sealed up in a cramped velvet padded prison. The box! Worse even, your clothes were gone! Youre naked! And it's the padding is freaking cold!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only that, youre tied and gagged!  Red velvet ropes bind your hands and feet together! You muffle and struggle in your constraints but to no avail. Even worse, there's a collar around your neck. At the end of the collar is a big tag that reads 'TO JUNKO. HAPPY BIRTHDAY! -Luv Kaguya' and there's a cute little cartoon Kaguya drawn on it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOH. FUCKING. HELL. That bitch and her fellow bitch just sold you! No wonder they were getting along so well! They put aside their differences for revenge!<br>\r\nDamn it. You can hear and feel the shuffling outside. Where are you being taken? And who is this 'Junko' person youre currently being a birthday present to?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt suddenly feels warmer all of a sudden. Much warmer. Something tells you youre not in Eientei anymore.<br>\r\nIt isnt long before the box finally stops moving. You hear quite a bit of rustling followed by unintellible voices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen no voices. Then absolute silence. Dreadfilled suspensful silence. Then you feel an incredibly strong presence descend on you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHMM? WHAT IS THIS?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear the voice clear as day from the outside. An awfully powerful aura fills the box. Your instincts warn you something very bad is just outside the box youre trapped in!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOH\u2026 SHE REMEMBERED MY BIRTHDAY? HOW SWEET OF HER!\u201d her voice sounded cheerful and joyous.. but the eerie echos in it chilled you to the bone. \u201cCHANGYE, DO YOU SEE THIS?! NOT EVEN YOUR PRECIOUS PRINCESS HAS THE DECENCY TO REMEMBER <b>YOUR</b> BIRTHDAY!\u201d<br>\r\nThe other voice spoke, but it was quickly cut off.<br>\r\n\"NO NO NO NO! DONT TELL ME WHAT IT IS!\" she sounded so eager and excited, \"I WANT TO BE SURPRISED!! QUICK! BREAK THE LOCK! BREAK IT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shivered as you listened to the loud CLANK followed by the long creeking of the box slowly opening!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGazing down at you with bulging red eyes piercing into your soul was the birthday girl with a crescent moon oriental crown and black dress with a red and yellow Chinese-style tabard to match the oriental theme! As she gazed down at you while fanning herself, you tried your best not to stare too hard at the multiple purple flames dancing just behind her like a bunch of flaming fox tails!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConveniently, you have a flashback of Tewi warning you about a particular woman that everybody at Eientei is deftly afraid of. 'You'll know if she ever shows up, trust me' she said!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, you do now. And it's her birthday!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could overhear a group of people nearby singing Happy Birthday to Junko while she just continues to stare down her new present. Each little second seemed like hours! You shriveled up and if you werent tied up and gagged, you'd probably curl into a ball. With no option and no Anna to save you (even if she could at her current state), you could do nothing but lie there and await your fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally after the Happy Birthday song was over... Junko's attentive stare of intrigue changed to...</span></div></div>",

You clearly knew she was going to kill you and was about to close your eyes until you saw a short black haired boy with bandana on and a weird cloth on put his hand on her shoulder.

Sadly, not even the doc could help you. After turning your head to Eirin, she just shrugged her arms and shook her head!<br>\r\n\u201cTold you we shoulda put him out to stud,\u201d Tewi muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hopeless. You couldn\u2019t quell BOTH girls\u2019 rage! Your only hope at the moment was to quell at least one of theirs. On one hand, you werent in any hurry to have a polygamous relationship with a girl you just met and slept with on your first day, let alone share yourself with her family!<br>\r\nOn the other hand, it could be a new beginning for you. Maybe being Mr. Udongein Inaba-Whitestone could give you a fresh start, away from the jaws of the Fey and finally get that second chance you hoped for.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> You were curious about what anna was talking about. You also felt this uneasiness about leaving this area since the whole eientei members have saved you and your sisters life, you couldn't just get up and just walk away. As you were going to talk to Anna, you noticed that she was very annoyed and her hand had twitchy movement. You thought maybe she'll do something like shooting again and you came to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"S-say Anna, where is this place you're talking about?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'll tell you by tomorrow.\" anna replied, \"Now go to sleep. We're leaving early tomorrow.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You're not really going, arn't you?\" Reisen asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Shut up, you lunatic whore.\" Anna replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n With that, Anna left the scene. You could complain a million things about her being too over protective on you. You still remember when you were younger she always kicked the bullies ass when they teased you, or when some of the men in the mafia tries to hand over the demeaning job to you, she'll finds out and beat them to the pulp just so they would do it instead of you. You sighed and turned to your bed as eirin and others were worried about you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'm sorry for your leaving, mr.whitestone.\" Eirin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Don't worry. I might come back for visit.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You noticed Reisen smile lightly and she came to you and hugged you. You blushed little as she got off, the whole group left the scene. You then retired for tonight and when the dawn was about to break, Anna got you and once you gotten ready, you two waited outside. You didn't know why you were waiting and turned to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"hey anna, why're we waiting for?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You'll see.\" Anna replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n With in moment, you heard some sort of noise and saw the sky. You saw a chopper fly pass you two and gotten back, flying toward you two. You were surprised to see this as the ladder came down, you bid farewell to the eientei group and went up toward the chopper. Once you got in, Anna got in after and closed the door and flew away from the bamboo forest. You clearly saw the operator of the chopper driving the vehicle and Anna put the transmittor on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Good job picking us up harry.\" Anna spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"My pleasure captain.\" operator replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You didn't know why this person calling Anna captain but kept to yourself as your interest were swifted to the scenery of the gensokyo. It was magnificant as it was vast with green ground, mountains and such. You were amazed and with in 20 minutes the chopper started to descend. Once landing safely you all got out of the chopper and you noticed a cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"That's were we going?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You bet.\" Anna replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You three walked toward the place and noticed two mens standing with assault rifle on them. You vaguely remember them as they were part of the enemy mafia members, and you thought they would kill you but the two saluted to anna!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"good to see you again Captain!\" Man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yes, will you escort us?\" Anna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"With pleasure!\" Man replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The two then started to escort you all. You felt some eerie vibe in this area and within several minuts you saw a vast city with in the place! you were amazed to see this and then anna turned to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"This is former capital, and I have the secret house that is within that area.\" Anna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"This is...not bad.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She smiled and they continued to walk until they were stopped by..</span></div></div>",

You noticed her green eyes looking at you and you thought she was mumbling under her breath. Everyone stopped at her presence as there was a bridge behind this girl and The two men approached the young girl<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"So she brought a new person to make refuge, huh? that makes me jealous.\" Girl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Whatever. You know who we are, right? Mizuhashi Parsee?\" Man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yes. Rebel alliance delta squad member Jack Frost.\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You remember who this man were as he named himself Jack Frost since he always loved to freeze any enemy that he killed. You were also surprised that even he had the blood of fairy but was working for the rebellion? You didn't understand that part until parsee gave way to all of you and you all went through the bridge. You were amazed to see such a city existed in this underground area. As you all walked through the crowd, You and others stopped at the house that were like a mini mansion! it was big as it had three stories high and in front of the entrance had two men guarding. You know them as they were also once the member of the Le Fay gang. They noticed you all and got to their stand position and saluted to you all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"welcome back captain whitestone! Good to see you again, Brother whitestone!\" One said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Um, yeah.\" You replied with light voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You then saw Anna talking to the escort to return to the surface to hide the chopper so no one would steal it. They understood and saluted to her and left the scene. Anna sighed and then turned to you and smiled.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"You're safer in this city now little bro. I guarantee it.\" Anna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Anna, why are there former men here? And why are they calling you captain?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She had the idea that you would ask that question. She asked you to go in with her to the house. You nodded and once you got into the house, she escorted you to the dining room. The area was wide and livable as you sat down on the chair, she sat next to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You see little bro, after I left the Le Fay gang, there were some men who chose to follow me due to respect. Le Fay saw this as treachery and tried to hunt them down, but fortunately we came to this area before she could find us. Afterward, I formed the rebellion army against the Le Fay gang and I became the captain of the army.\" Anna explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You now understood why they called your sister 'captain' and you knew the guys. She now started to rebel against the strong gang and you know she had upper hand since she had good weapon and intelligence against her and such. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"But sis, you know they have upper hand.\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"For now, yes. But I'm currently recruiting an non-human to support my cause.\" Anna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You know what she meant as she was talking about youkais and others. You had the urge to help your big sis since you were always been protected by your own sister. You always wanted to pay back for all the good deed she have done and you thought that it was time for you to return the favore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Say Anna, why don't I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"If you're asking for recruitement, I'm afraid I have to reject you.\" Anna interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You didn't know why she rejected you rightaway and asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Why? I want to help you.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I know you want to, but I refuse to risk putting you on the front line.\" Anna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Before she could say any further, she got a phone call. She got the phone and once she talked for moment she put it away and turned to you. She told you she have an urgent meeting and stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Don't worry, alex. You will be safe here.\" Anna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She then left the scene. You wanted to follow her but she was very fast to leave the area. You looked around and thought of doing something, then you heard the two guards talking. You then peeked outside and you saw.... </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For a split second, you were almost blinded by the shiny red eyes of one of those so-called 'soldiers' chatting to eachother outside. The two were dressed in similar mujahideen militant uniforms carrying kalashnikovs, however one wasnt that difficult to identify. Despite keeping hidden under uniform and hijab, you could spot the same purple hair, facial structure and glowing red eyes!<br>\r\n\"R-Reisen?!\" you whispered in shock, \"S-she followed me?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nR-Reisen! S-She followed you! Nice job hiding the bunny ears under the hijab, but the eyes clearly dont lie! How she managed to find you, you got subtle hints. After a bit of talking you couldnt hear, you spotted Reisen reaching into her pocket and pulling out a couple of dollar bills and handing it to the other soldier! A freaking bribe! Anna may have leadership qualities, but she does not pick her allies well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe paid off soldier nods then Reisen nods before he turns around and walks off... but not before Reisen pokes his shoulder. You lean in carefully to watch the Mujahibunny slip him a few more dollars... and the other soldier reaches into his pocket and hands her what looks to be a bag of pills!<br>\r\nCrap. She's apparently keen on the whole cartel thing, too! Next thing youre gonna find is she probably knows arabic and memorized a few Quran verses... just to blend in with the 'locals'! (well, she DOES have a crescent moon pin!)<br>\r\nStill you do kinda miss her. She was the one you willingly gave your first time to (WILLINGLY. Maeve will never in a billion and a half years be considering your first!).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See somebody you know?\" you were temporarily started after hearing that condescending tone from earlier. You get your head away from the window and turn to see happy cheerful little elf brat who gleefully waltzed into your safe house uninvited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... yeah,\" you tell her, avoiding her snooty Little Miss Sunshine glare, \"just an old friend.\"<br>\r\n\"Must be nice,\" she remarked sarcastically. God you feel so lonely being around her!<br>\r\n\"So uh... what are you doing here?\" you try to remain civil, \"uh, Parsee was it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe clapped her hands and put on a super forced smile, \"Oh wow! You actually remembered my name! I feel so special now! Tsk.\" She snagged a bottle of wine off the dining table and poured it into a glass, \"My damn bridge keeper shift is over. It's not like I wanna be here, but it's the only place around here I can get a little buzz without having to hang out with those lushes.\" Oh goodie. The anti-social scale is through the roof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the atmosphere around her being incredibly depression, she's currently the only companionship you got at the moment, so you figure you might make the most of it.<br>\r\nYou sit in a seat next to her, \"Mind if I have a drink with you?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" she glared as she sipped her drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring her 'charming' personality, you grab the wine bottle and pour yourself a glass.<br>\r\n\"I can see you got a bit of emotional baggage, too,\" you comment while she snuffed, \"would you like to talk about it?\"<br>\r\n\"Nah,\" Parsee shook her head, \"if I wanted to cry out all my personal problems, I'd be getting drunk with those oni lushes that never leave me alone.\"<br>\r\n\"Friends of yours?\" you asked as you sipped.<br>\r\n\"I dont have friends,\" she sneered, \"I dont NEED friends.\" Boy this wine tastes incredibly bitchy today.<br>\r\n\"Honestly, I could use some,\" you still attempt to converse with her, \"ever since we left Le Fey, my sister and I are always moving around place to place. I never got enough time to settle down and actually make a real friend.\"<br>\r\n\"Tsk. Like that mentally deranged rabbit you screwed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did a tremendous spit-take hearing those words come out the elven bitch's mouth, and you TOTALLY didnt mean to do it in her face! You slammed the glass on the table and shout, \"Y-Y-YOU KNEW ABOUT THAT?!\"<br>\r\n\"Big Sis told Mr. Frost,\" she smiled condescendingly, \"and Jack Ass has a big mouth. He was thinking of throwing you a little 'Congrats on Becoming a Man' party!\" Your face was getting red, both with anger and embarrassment. <br>\r\n\"I wouldnt be celebrating if I were you,\" Parsee sipped some wine, \"she's very unstable and prone to violent outbursts like onis are to smelling like shit. If youre that desperate to die a horrible death, I suggest pissing in Hakurei Shrine's donation box.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlright. That's it. You tried being nice with this pointy-eared Iranian bitch but she's clearly not willing to give you a chance. You'd rather be alone now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whelp, I'd say a good screw would cheer you up too, but it's most likely full of razor blades,\" you get up out of your seat, \"I'm gonna go take a nap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucky you... you actually get a bedroom,\" you heard her mutter, \"ya know... instead of the dirty floor... like the rest of us unworthy peasants.\" You ignore her and just head upstairs.  It takes you a little while to find out which door your key unlocks but as soon as you find it, you slam the door behind you and groan, \"GOD! WHAT THE HELL IS THAT GIRL'S PROBLEM?!\" It was almost like she wanted you to feel miserable like she does!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately at the moment you were feeling a little tired. You wanted to go to sleep as soon as possible before that elf's emo rubs off on you! It was incredibly hot in this underground base and there was no air condition so you didnt even bother to pull the covers over you. You just lied on of the bed and shut your eyes, wishing a certain lovable bunny girl would come climb on top of you in your sleep and do naughty things...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, you shoulda been more careful with what you wished for! As soon as you opened your eyes again, your almost blinded by the glow of the big beautiful red eyes beaming down at you! But unlike last time, you quickly jerked yourself up! You caught a quick glimpse of her eyes widen with shock before you leaped out from under her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rei-!\"<br>\r\n\"No no no! Sh! Sh! Please!\" she put a finger to her mouth then quickly got down on her knees and begged in whispers, \"please dont!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Knock knock!*<br>\r\n\"Mr Whitestone? I thought I heard shouting. Is everything ok?\" you heard Mr. Frost call out from the other side of the door. You pondered what to say as your mentally ill bunny girl stalker was still on her knees begging, shaking her head, giving you the sad puppy dog eye look! The angel and devil on your shoulders had a hard time deciding what the good or bad choices were. You felt a little sorry for Reisen and part of you was kinda happy to see her again, but you cant help but remember Parsee said about her (despite the mean tone!). If you rat her out, Anna's goons might hurt her. If you keep her a secret from them, she could end up hurting you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give your intruder one last look in her shiny red eyes before shouting back-</span></div></div>",

And you really didnt like the scenario. Plus, you got a gun in the drawer next to your bed just in case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" Jack called back, \"but keep it down. There are plenty of guys here that are trying to sleep.\" And fortunately for your uninvited guest, that was it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bunny-girl intruder sighed in relief and rushed to hug you, \"Oh, thank you, Alex-sa-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay back!\" she stopped as soon as you pulled the gun out of the drawer. Strange, you dont really notice much fear on her face as you do disappointment. \"Reisen, you know youre not supposed to be here. How did you even managed to find me?\"<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Reisen spoke up, \"it's like Tewi said. The Udongein Inaba family has major connections. The only reason the Lunarian Kingdom still exists is thanks to the special forces and secret surveillance funded and operated by the Udongein Inaba family.\" Ugh. That does answer a few questions. But now wasnt the time to learn about her bloodline!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nevermind that!\" you changed the subject, \"you shouldnt be here! If Anna or the others find out-\"<br>\r\n\"I know,\" she frowned, \"but I just couldnt let you skip out of my life for good after just the first day of meeting you! Not after you've taken my virginity and possibly sired my first little girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHOA! Slow down there!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, Reisen?\u201d you remind her, \u201cYOU forced yourself on ME while I was sleeping.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBut\u2026 you told your sister that you were pretending to sleep, so\u2026 if you didnt like it, you couldve told me to stop at any time.\u201d aw dang it! She's got a darn good memory! No use denying it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike a defeated man, your just blushed and said nothing. Surrender with grace!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHah! See? I knew you liked me!\u201d she said with a smile. As mad as you wanted to be at her, seeing such a warming smile on a cutie like her melted your heart a little. You sighed and put your gun on the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou wont be able to stay here,\u201d you warned her, \u201ca few particular members of Anna posse already know about you and theyre going to rat you out if they find you.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt's alright. I promise I'll keep myself scarce,\u201d she assured, \u201cand if there's any trouble, I know some people to call up.\u201d You give her a stern stare and she sighed, \u201cIf I cause too much trouble, I promise I'll leave on my own. But I wont! You have my word!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew you had to tell her no and to get out before she gets caught, but something deep down told you not to. If you had to make a guess, maybe it's that part about her telling you that you might have impregnated her that's causing you to be so hesitant. Damn it, you just gotta make it work somehow! For the baby!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, fine,\u201d you groaned with gritted teeth.<br>\r\n\u201cYAY!!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSHH!!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh right. Heh, sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh...\u201d you lied back on your bed, remembering your gun on the desk just in case, \u201cI got the hugest headache.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got something for that!\u201d your involuntary roommate reached under her uniform and pulled out a bottle of pills, \u201ctake one!\u201d<br>\r\nYou raised your eyebrow, \u201cAre they aspirin?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo, but they guaranteed to make you feel REALLY good!\u201d red flag.<br>\r\n\u201cNo thanks,\u201d you quickly turn her down, \u201cI'm not taking any drugs. I am out of that business.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThese are not drugs,\u201d she corrected you, \u201cthese are herbal supplements. Great for the body and the mind. Helps you relax and unwind after after moods of stress and frustration.\u201d<br>\r\nYou squint your eyes at the bottle, knowing better.<br>\r\n\u201cNo, those are black market drugs possibly stolen from a pharmacy,\u201d you correct HER, \u201cI can still see the prescription label in arabic stuck to the bottle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReisen gave you an unamused sorta pouty look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's FARSI,\u201d she corrected as if it really mattered, \u201cand it wasnt stolen. It was just resold off the market for a major discounted price cuz the patient failed to properly pay his insurance premium.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDoes Eirin even know your buying drugs like that?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d she lowers her head, \u201cbut the medicines she usually give me are far too weak, taste absolutely fowl,\u201d she cringes, \u201c...or have to be\u2026 inserted.\u201d<br>\r\nYou exhale and shake your head.<br>\r\n\u201cThat's why I usually call up some people who know some people who trade with some people who supply arms with some people. The stuff they supply are a hundred times better for my certain mood swings,\u201d she then smiled and pulled out two pills, \u201cand if theyre good enough to keep ME chipper, I'm sure you'll get a real kick out of them!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd be lying if you said you werent feeling all sorts of pent up stress and frustration that you'd REALLY like to ease. You could really use something to help you unwind. But black market prescription pills?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDont worry, these are safe,\u201d she promises, \u201cI'll prove it. Here, I'll go first.\u201d She opened her mouth wide and dropped a pill on her tongue, then closed her mouth and swallowed hard.<br>\r\n\u201cSee?\u201d she opened her mouth wide again showing no sign of the pill, \u201call gone!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, being a prude was beginning to seem less popular to you. You needed a cooldown. And your sister's ambitions certainly werent helping. In fact, they were probably more hazardous to your health than the remaining unknown pill that cute bunny-drug dealer was offering you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked over at the pill and thought for a brief moment...</span></div></div>",

As your morality says no, you took the offer and reisen was pleased. You took the pill and popped it into your mouth as it tasted like green apple, you swallowed it and moment later, your migraine and your stress were wiped off!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Holy..my headache's gone.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"See Alex-Sama, it's a good pill right?\" Reisen asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, thanks reisen. I owe you one.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She giggled then suddenly both you and reisen heard the door knock. You told reisen to hide and she immediately hid in the closet and shut the door. You shouted 'come in!' And the door opened, revealing to be Mr.Frost and two guards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Mr.Frost, something wrong?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I thought I heard you speaking to somebody..\" Jack said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Your heart jumped as they came in,he noticed you sweating little and you shivered little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I-I think your just imagining things.\" You answers<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Jack didn't say anything for moment then ordered his men's to search the room. You begged him not to but he and the men searched the room until jack got to the closet. Your heart raced as jack grabbed the knob, he opened the door and quickly pointed his gun. You looked, realizing that reisen weren't there! Jack huffed and lowers his weapon and turned to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Your right, it's just my misunderstanding.\" Jack said, \"after all, captain whitetaker is preparing her plan to get green light.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Whitetaker? Who're you talking about? And what do you mean by plan?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you know?

As for the plan..it's classified plan.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  You were both surprised and expected as Anna was from the fey since she was a newborn but didn't know she took your family name for some reason. You thought for moment and then the three mens reached for the door and jack turned to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"If you need anything, please notify me.\" Jack said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Alright, thanks.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As the door closed, you turned to the closet and saw the wall move and reisen was revealed!

You remember him as Billy Tenship, one of your pal from the mafia. You were glad to see him as he got in, he was smiling while reisen became defensive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hold on reisen, I know him.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh?\" Reisen spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You nodded and came to him and you two gave a high five. Reisen relaxed little and both you and Billy talked for few minutes. Billy was considered to be the quickest gunslinger as he never misses a target with super speed, and he was a descent person to hang out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"So Billy, why're here?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Anna secretly hired me to watch for a specific being for her ultimate plan.\" Billy responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ultimate plan? What is that?\" Reisen asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Sorry ms, but that's highly classified detail and I cannot say.\" Billy answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You really wanted to know what Anna was doing. Anna never tells you anything when something comes up, and she always disappears for at least 3 months every year. You wanted to know and you wanted an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Billy please, tell us. I swear I won't tell.\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Like I said, it's classified documents.\" Billy shot you down, \"besides...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He looked at the window and unknowingly to you and reisen, a secret sniper was hidden in the roof far from the house pointing at Billy's head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"..it's not my place to say the details.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"But...I have to know! Anna always kept secrets from me, and I have right to know!\" You responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Billy looked at your eyes and knew you wouldn't back down. He sighed and snapped his fingers. From the window a tall female with military cloth on came with a sheet of paper. He took the paper and handed toward you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"This is part of the diary that your sister kept. It have a crucial detail so you better hide it carefully.\" Billy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Thank you Billy, I owe you one.\" You replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Billy smiled and bid farewell and both him and the female left. Both you and reisen looked at the paper, and it wrote:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n September 11th, 20XX<br>\r\n<br>\r\n I have now completed the final cast of the ancient book, and I have now have the ten rings of Solomon. With this, I can now summon the 72 demons that the ancient king have summoned and destroy the fey and the humans who have wronged me and my tribes. I shall name this power:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Ars almadel salomonis, the time of birth have come, he is the one who masters everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You dropped the paper in fear as you were very familiar with the the story of king solomon, the ancient Israeli king who summoned the 72 demons to complete the temple. Reisen were surprised to see this and told you she'll go back to eientei to tell eirin about it and quickly left being invisible. You breathed in and out, took the paper and hid it in your pocket and got out of the door. Jack noticed you and got up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Your heading out?\" Jack asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yeah, I need fresh air.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'll accompany you. I need cigarettes.\" Jack replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You nodded and both of you got out. You leaned on the wall as jack got the box of malboro and took one stick out.

Reisen looked back as you snapped out of yourself, you saw a big sized oni with stab wounds on his chest. You and Reisen looked at the window and saw Anna with black sword and a woman with white robe on her and a purple haired female with unique black cloth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"A-Anna?\" You spoke softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You then heard a door slam open and saw frost and hid guard seeing Reisen and pointed their gun at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Raise your arms!

She could feel the strong evil vibes from her and suddenly she came forward and grabbed her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you shall die today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She threw her out of the house.

Hell, it always proved to be one of the hardest things to do outside of successfully quit Le Fey (and survive). Not just because you were a little intimidated by her, but because you owe her a tremendous debt. But you know how she gets when she's very angry. She tends to do things she really shouldnt. Bad things. VERY bad things. To say she's prone to violent outbursts is being too optimistic. If Parsee thinks Reisen is unstable, she's never met your sis!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlus, Reisen may or may not have your child forming inside of her. Call it paternal instincts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anna, stop this!\" you demand in a more serious tone, \"stop it now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up bro,\" Anna remarked as she began twisting Reisen's bunny ear. The poor bunny girl let out a high pitched shriek of pain!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anna, I said stop it!\" you demand again. She pays you no attention and continues  twisting Reisen's ear, no doubt relishing her screams of pain. Sheesh, you didnt think bunny ears were THAT sensitive!<br>\r\n\"Anna, that's enough!\" you rushed over to her to stop her only to end up getting smacked hard in the face by her! The quick moment you hit the ground, the realization of it hit harder and faster! Anna actually slapped you! Her own little brother! This was unbelievable! How could she do that to you?! You were just looking out for her! Something ticked inside of you after that happened. It kinda tipped you over the edge. You expected Maeve to harshly backhand you like that for no legitimate reason, but not sis!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt hurt you to do this, but you saw no other way around it. Before you fled, you stole something from Le Fey that the rest of the fairies kept locked up and sealed away because it was painful to them. VERY painful. A lump of what they called 'Holy Iron'. Youre not sure what type of type of iron material it is nor where it came from, but all you knew is these fairy fuckers cringed when theyre near it. Bad move on their part for assigning you to guard it for a while!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reached into your pocket and dug in your wallet, then pulled out that little iron cross and shoved it against your sister's pointy ear!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GyyAAAHHH!!!!\" boy, did she let out a shriek of agony! You quickly regretted it! You didnt expect it to hurt her THAT bad! You gasped when she fell to the ground gripping her aching... SMOKING ear! The other soldiers watched, absolutely shocked at the display, but despite being armed, even they flinched when you pointed your cross at them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stand back!\" you warned them, \"dont come any closer! I swear, the rumors about this thing ARE true!\"<br>\r\n\u201cH-How did you get that?!\u201d Frost questioned you.<br>\r\n\u201cDont worry about how I got this. Worry about how bad it'll hurt if you come any closer!\u201d<br>\r\nJack Frost swayed his arm downward, signaling his crew to lower their weapons! Even Parsee hissed at you like an angry wildcat when you pointed the cross at HER!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Anna,\" you whispered as you took her colt magnum. Time to floor it.<br>\r\n\"C'mon,\" you helped your bunny stalker up, \"can you still walk with that wound?\" You referred to the one in her thigh when your sis shot her.<br>\r\nShe coughed a little, wiped blood off her lip and stuttered, \"I've had worse. Let's go!\" And just out of nowhere, she grabbed your hand and dragged you off with her, despite the beating Anna gave her! Talk about a second wind!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his crew helped up Anna, Jack finally shook off his state of shock and ordered, \"G-Get him! Dont shoot him, dont hurt him! Just bring him back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Frost's troops finally came after you, Reisen had already zipped into the cavernous alleyways still dragging you along the way! Frost's men were on your tail, but your partner had an unbelievable amount of speed and stamina to outrun them! It was incredible how quickly she was moving despite her wounds. You knew she was a youkai, but you were still worried about her health and all.<br>\r\n\"Reisen, you shouldnt be overexerting yourself like this,\" you tell her.<br>\r\n\"I'm fine,\" she said as she scanned around looking for places of cover.<br>\r\n\"But youre hurt pretty bad,\" you say, \"I mean, you been shot and-\"<br>\r\n\"I told you, I've been through worse,\" she said, \"...but thank you for your concern, Alex-sama.\u201d She gave you a smile that made you a little warm and tingly inside.<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 I...\u201d you blushed despite being dragged like a ragdoll by the girl you just saved, \u201cI just couldnt-\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDuck!!\u201d you didnt even get to see her ears twitch before she yanked you down with her, immediately out of the way of incoming gun fire!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIDIOT!

THEYRE STILL RUBBER BULLETS!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW HIS GUARDIAN GETS WHEN YOU HURT HER FOSTER BROTHER?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFoster brother?\u201d Reisen raised her eyebrow after hearing that bit of detail that was supposed to kept secret,  goddamn it Anna, why cant you pick better allies?!<br>\r\n\u201cWell, the uh, thing about that-\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cTalk later!\u201d she quickly cut you off as she dragged you out of a dark tunnelway and into the middle of a huge crowd of people! You could finally see the sky again, so it looks like youre out of that underground city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the looks of things, you seemed to have ended up in some sort of older Japanese style town. The place looked like something out of the 17-18th century, but somehow it was incredibly populated like modern day Tokyo. Not to mention, you noticed stores and signs in Japanese lit up with big flashy lights\u2026 kind of out of place for a 17-18th century setting!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust act casual,\u201d Reisen whispers, \u201ctry to blend in and they wont spot us.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cH...how are you still able to keep moving with those wounds?\u201d you couldnt help but nag, \u201cyou really need to see a doctor!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI will!\u201d she told you, \u201cI'll let master take a look at me when we get back to Eientei.\u201d And there we go!<br>\r\n\u201cE..Eientei?\u201d you got a bit tense remembering when your sister took you OUT of there! \u201cb-but...\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat's wrong?\u201d your pal looked a bit worried, \u201cy-you dont wanna go back with me?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell, no, it's not that, I just-\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh! Whew, I'm glad!\u201d she sighed in relief. Although youre relieved you didnt hurt her, part of you regrets giving her that answer. \u201cIn the meantime, we just need to find a place to lay low. ...AH! Here's one!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYIKE!\u201d She yanked your arm so hard your arm almost dislocated as you were dragged toward...</span></div></div>",

You two went inside the kataoke bar and then a waitress came to you two. She was around reisens height and had long black hair and thick eye browse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Welcome...woah, is she alright?\" waitress spoke, seeing reisens wound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'm fine.\" Reisen replied, \"please give us a seat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well..sure, but I'm going to call on the doctor right away.\" waitress replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Before you could say anything, she took you two to the spacy seat and immediatly dashed off. You sighed and leaned back, seeing reisens wound. You felt sorry for reisen as she saw your big sis's seriouse side. Anna had history of violent outbursts as you clearly remember she once massacred the whole rival mafia for making fun of her. You sighed again then you immediatly saw reisen taking out an knife and immediatly shoving it to the wound, making you shocked with horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Reisen, stop!\" you spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Don't worry, I'm fine.\" Reisen replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She shoved and twisted for moment and with a popping noise a bullet came out. You were both amazed and horrified to see her doing that as blood were coming out, you were worried about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"By the way...about that man talked earlier...what did he meant by it?\" reisen asked, you know what she meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You see...\" You stated, swallowing air, \"...Anna's not my real biological sister. She's a changeling who were handpicked by fey herself to become a foster sister since I was an only child.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Reisen were surprised to hear that as the waitress came back so did the underfround doctor. He asked to check it up as reisen told him the update, the doctor decided to stitch the wound up so he gotten ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Did you...did you object to that?\" reisen asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Actually no. She is considered to be the strongest of the fairy, close to maeve.\" You replied, \"In fact, when I started to understand letters, she was already advanced on sniping.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The doctor started to stitch up the wound as reisen didn't say anything. The waitress gave you and reisen a glass of water and after few minutes the stitching were iver. You and reisen thanked the doctor and once he got out, he muttered something under the coat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well, we should hang out here for moment.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yes. You know what alex-sama? lets sing a song!\" reisen replied with smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You wern't that good with singing, but took the offer. Reisen went to the stand picked the number and she started to the song. You relaxed and sipped on water then concentraited on reisens singing while from entrance came...</span></div></div>",

After the time you thought it was moment of time, you woke up only to see the same bed room you were earlier. You got up only to have sharp pain on your stomach and your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"So your awake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You looked to the side to see your big sis...with her pointy ears revealing. She was looking at you with her eyes looked evil as she was leaning on the wall smoking some cigarette. For some reason you felt hostile toward her and she flicked her cigarette away and crossed her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You got some nerves,  bro. Using that metal against me.\" Anna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I had no  choice.\" you replied, \"Where's reisen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Suddenly you hear reisens scream. It sounded very painful as it was bloodcurdling noise that hinged many normal human. You remember that anna saying about torturing the bunny before killing her. You told her to stop it, and she just took out another cigarette from the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I can stop it...under one condition.\" Anna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"And that is?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She blew a smoke and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You to join the rebel army.\" anna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You were little confused by what she meant as she didn't want you in. She explained that few min were assasinated by Feys men and she became short handed with few. You told her you don't trust her that well and she continued to smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'll let you take that lunatic bunny-bitch as your comrade.\" Anna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You sure?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Did I ever lied to you?\" Anna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You knew she never did lie before.

But you knew the stakes involved joining her little rebellion. Building a rebel army means she's planning to start a mafia war. WIth Le Fey?! First she wanted to hide you from those fairy sadists, now she wants you to take up arms against them!? Was she out of her damn mind?!<br>\r\nAnd you were seriously not liking her sudden change of attitude she's been giving lately. These are a bad mix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anna,\" you look her straight in the eye, \"I'm not joining your army. I want out of this. Completely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You cant get out of this!\" Anna was quick to snap, \"you've been a part of this for a long time now! You are one of us whether you like it or not!\"<br>\r\n\"No!\" you tell her, \"I'm not Le Fey! I'm not a Fairy! You got me out of there, so technically I'm free!\"<br>\r\n\"No,\" she corrected you, \"technically youre MINE. After everything I did to protect you, youre gonna assume that I didnt want anything in return?! Youre not 'free' of any obligation. You just owe ME an obligation!\"<br>\r\nYou went silent for a moment, trying to soak up what she just said, \"W...what are you saying?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna sighed hard, \"Alex, dont tell me you honestly havent learned anything under us. Did you seriously forget the rule of a fairy's obligation?\"<br>\r\n\"A fairy never offers or accepts a favor without expecting one in return.  ....!!!\" your eyes then widened. You didnt want to believe it, but...<br>\r\nYou dont get enough time to ponder it before you see Reisen dart into the room and-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Bang!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cArrrggh!!\u201d put a bullet in Anna's leg! Your sis after screaming in pain lost her balance and fell to the floor. You dont get even a short moment to drop your jaw, seeing Reisen free and wearing her ovaries on the outside again! And your sister doesnt get a short moment to get up before Reisen plucks a moon shaped hairpin from her hair and points in just in front of Anna's eyeball! Your sis was flinching uncontrollably just from it being near her! Is that Holy Iron, too?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou make ONE move,\u201d Reisen warned, \u201cyou get a burning eye-socket to match that ear.\u201d Anna gritted her teeth, but instead of fighting back, she didnt move at all. The hairpin must be Holy Iron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPretty soon, the room flooded with moon rabbits in militia garb similar to Reisen's. A couple of them untied you while a few others tied up Anna with your special friend still threatening her with the hairpin.<br>\r\n\u201cR-Reisen?! H\u2026 how did you escape? I mean just you heard you screaming-\u201d<br>\r\nReisen let out that exact same piercing shriek you heard earlier! So she can act, too. Wow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told you I'd be alright, Alex-sama!\u201d Reisen's voice suddenly changed a lot more uppity when it was directed at you, \u201cI have a lot of friends in high places.\u201d Well, maybe what Tewi said about her family means something. \u201cNow let's get going. This place is gonna turn into a war zone in a few minutes.\u201d Although you worry for your sister, you took Reisen's hand and hoped she knew what she was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! Wait!\u201d Speak of the devil, she looked down at your sister, \u201cHey, Anna-chan?\u201d<br>\r\nAnna got a good hard look at her brother getting liplocked by that same damn purple haired demoness that raped him in his sleep! You on the other hand were briefly blissing out accepting Reisen's outrageously passionate oral embrace for the second time. Reisen's red eyes were on Anna's the whole time, making sure she was watching just who she was kissing! Cold. Stone cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter practically signing her own warrant to Anna, Reisen pulled her salivating tongue out of your mouth and dragged you off with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd sure enough, there was a huge gunfight going on outside the base! Bullets flew in the air between Anna's comrades and Reisen's fellow rabbit crew. Fortunately, your bunny-captor/protector was there to hold your hand and carefully guide you out of the line of fire. She kept both your head and hers hunkered down under covered (despite risking her bunny ears being shot off) and navigated through the terrain of debris and bullet-resistant makeshift cover. It's almost as if she's done this kind of thing before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDont be scared, Alex-sama,\u201d she cutely coaxes you in the middle of a war zone, \u201cwe'll be out of here real soon.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cEr...h..how\u2026 how did you\u2026 how are you\u2026 I mean-\u201d halfway through your haphazard question, you think about it and practically answer it yourself, \u201c...wait. Was Tewi actually right about the Udongein Inaba clan?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cShe certainly is!\u201d she was so badass, she gave a prideful smile while bullets were raining down on her, \u201cThe Udongein Inaba family are the highest in the military chain! The highest in Lunar Central Intelligence with connections all across the moon and parts of the earth!\u201d That does explain a bit. She can get not only a doctor (after plucking out a bullet from her own wound) but an army on such short notice cuz of her rank!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only that, she got a ride to escape too! She hopped into the conveniently placed armored jeep with you along and said something to the driver in some sort of arabic language which the driver gave a nod and floored it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the ride not being so smoothly (and wishing it came with seatbelts) Reisen was still cool and calm while giving directions and orders in that second language to her driver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReisen, where'd you learn to speak arabic?\u201d you got curious.<br>\r\n\u201cIt's Farsi, actually,\u201d she corrected you (as if you knew the difference), \u201cour clan has great ties with the Persian youkai from trading to arms dealing.\u201d And DRUG dealing! \u201cYep, the Houraisan royal family would probably be under enslavement if not for us! Heck, if things were different, WE wouldve been royalty!\u201d Princess Reisen?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmoke blowing aside, sounds like your mentally ill friend is one hell of an ally. You just might need one now that youre beginning to question who you thought was supposed to be your sister. Sure, you knew she was just ASSIGNED that role, but you still thought it was official! But instead, she sees you as just someone who owes a favor like all those OTHER fairies? What exactly is she up to?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetter question, what is REISEN up to?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we go-\" before you could ask, just as the jeep was leaving the village, you noticed Anna's troops raised the bridge! Shoulda figured your sis wasnt gonna make it that easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The bridge is out!\" you shouted. Just as you were nearing the edge of the cliff, Reisen, still showing absolutely no change in her combat-hardened marine facade, shouted a single command in Farsi to the driver. With a nod, the driver pulls a level and...</span></div></div>",

Back in the HQ, jack were treating annas wound as she was thinking deep. She looked at her old wounds, thinking about her past careers then the image of reisen kissing you sprung up, and made her irritated. After few moment jack finished treating the wound and saluted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Commander, the treatment is done.\" Jack said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Anna just nodded and didn't say anything. Jack knew anna as he was with her when she first started the mafia. He respected her dearly as he was an half-elf and she accepted him for who he was. When she broke off from the fey and created the rebellion he was the first one to join. The silence lingered until anna spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"lieutenant Frost.\" Anna spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Y-yes, captain whitestone?\" Jack responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'm going to initiate order 40.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Jack jolted as he knows the order as it was the order to completely destroy the specific target and loot anything that is valuable. He remember being part of it when they were in the mafia as they looted and killed anyone who try to stop them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Captain, you know you swore not to do it.\" Jack said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Does it matter?\" Anna asked as she picked up the transmittor, \"This is captain whiterock to stealth rebel core..I am issuing order 40, the prime target is eientei. Kill anyone who oppose us and take anything ne essesary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 'Yes,captain whiterock.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She turned off the transmittor and smiled.

You then picked up a silver cross that your father gave you in case and stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cLadies, I\u2019m going to stop my sister from any more harms.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  They jumped little, and Reisen pleaded You not to go. But you made a decision to stop her no matter what and you told Reisen to get a car and drive back to the underground city. She felt uneasy but did what you were told and got a car. As you two got on, Reisen pressed the accelerator and drove off, going toward the city. It took another hour but you made it to the underground city. Once you two got to the destination, the results were bad as there were dead bodies of Anna\u2019s comrades and bunny soldiers. As they got into the house, you saw a paper laying on the ground. As you picked it up, it unfolded itself, revealing a hologram of Anna herself in her military uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cTo Alex, if your seeing this, then I\u2019m no longer in the city but fighting against Maeve herself.\u201d Anna spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cAnna...\u201d You spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cThanks to your bunny whore, we lost quarter of My mens. I would have killed her if she haven\u2019t had that silver...but you know once I finish this mission, you\u2019ll be dealing with me as you\u2019re eternally indebted to me.\u201d Anna said, \u201cwith that, I will see you in the future.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n With that the paper bursted in flames, flinched by this you backed off and the paper withered away. You felt destroyed by her word until both you and Reisen heard someone come in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It was..</span></div></div>",

He cooked for Maeve and her men\u2019s until she told him to leave for medical reasons and thought he would be useless beyond cooking. You were happy to see him until you noticed two fairy soldiers came and pointed their guns at you and Reisen. Reisen gotten ready to fight as well and Marcus noticed the men\u2019s aiming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cHold your fire dogs, he\u2019s my allies.\u201d Marcus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cBut mr.benedict. You know the order from captain Anna to retrieve anything value here, and we find this traitor of a man.\u201d One soldier spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cIf I say hold it, I mean it fool. Now lower your goddamn guns.\u201d Marcus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The two fairy soldiers looked at each other and lowered their weapons. Marcus came to you and rose his hand, and you rose yours and shook hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cHaven\u2019t seen for while man. I hear you almost kicked Anna\u2019s ass.\u201d Marcus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cThat\u2019s actually Reisen who did it.\u201d You replied, \u201canyway, Marcus, where\u2019s my sister?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cIf your looking for her, your too late. She\u2019s already at Maeve\u2019s hideout waging war.\u201d Marcus said, \u201cI was ordered to clean the shit around here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n This was unsettling and you had to stop Anna from doing any more harm. You thought hard on what you should do until you figured out one thing in mind and turned to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cSay Marcus, your still being friend with mikaela?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI order some of her good rims for my rum cakes, sure, but why ask?\u201d Marcus spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cGood...and do you have any transportation device to take me to Anna?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n This made the two soldiers annoyed and pointed their guns again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cYou ask too much, You traitorous mortal!\u201d Soldier said angerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cDont Make me say it again fool! Put the damn gun down!\u201d Marcus shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n All of you jumped by his shout and they put the gun down. Marcus thought for moment and then dig his hands in his pockets and took out an off shaped knife and handed to you. Both you and Reisen didn\u2019t know what it was then Marcus explained to you two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u201cThat knife can cut through borders that seals between our world and this world with ease. If your planning on stopping Anna, then do what you must do.\u201d Marcus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cMarcus...\u201d You spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI known Anna since I was 6 years old. She visited me sometime with fay a lot to talk with my dad. She was cool until she started to lust for power, and something made her mind broke beyond repair.\u201d Marcus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI think it was that incident..\u201d Reisen said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cMr.Benedict!

I should just shoo-!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Before he could finish the Sentance, Marcus came to him and jammed a silver cross on his chest. It burned the elf, and he screamed as he got on knees, the other elven soldier were in fear as Marcus looked at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI\u2019m doing this for everyone\u2019s sake, so you better get your mouth washed and help me get the dead bodies away.\u201d Marcus said, then turned to yo, \u201cdog, go.

You couldn\u2019t believe that this could be done in instant when you two were gone for while. Reisen were ready to defend you in need as you two went deeper into the battlefield. As you two did, you two saw some Anna\u2019s resistant army fighting feys men\u2019s as they were in slaughter house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cThis is madness.\u201d Reisen said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI know. I have to find Anna quickly as possible.\u201d You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You two then saw a big mansion not too far from where you two are. You remember it as that is where Le Fay stays most of her time. You got your courage and went toward the place as Reisen followed, you two were immediately stopped by none other than billy himself! Billy had some blood stains on his coat and his cheeks, wondering why you were here then Reisen pointed her gun at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cHow did you found us here, Alex? Anna told nobody the exact locations on the assault.\u201d Billy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cMarcus told me.\u201d You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n There was a silence for moment until you notice billy smile. You noticed a dark aura surrounding him and a black reddish vains on his left arm and he put the hand on his hip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cSo he told you, eh? What a let down. Anna trusted him a lot, really.\u201d Billy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He immediately got his gun and shot you, but Reisen deflected it with her own gun. You were amazed to see this as Reisen were looking at him with fully red eyes, billy was looking at her with his guns ready to fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI guess I can\u2019t deal with you personally.\u201d Billy said, \u201cgo, Anna is inside the mansion.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cBilly..\u201d You spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cAlex sama, I\u2019ll take care of him so go!\u201d Reisen said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cReisen..thanks!\u201d You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You dashed through the two as they started to have a gun fight. As you got in, it was quiet as you didn\u2019t let your guard down, you ran up and down, door to door for at least 25 minutes until you finally saw the main door toward the room where le fay stays. You walked until the door opened, revealing Arnold, revealing an black reddish vains on his chest area. His eyes were were almost like if they were dead and he looked at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cMr.Whitestone.\u201d Arnold said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cArnold! Is my sister there!?\u201d You demanded to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cYes, but I was told not to let anyone in as she fights the queen herself.\u201d Arnold said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n This made you mad and took out a knife Marcus gave you earlier. Arnold looked at and just grinned, showing his teeth at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cYou are in no way of fighting me, boy. I have been gifted by Anna by the power of Angra Mainyu.\u201d Arnold said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cYou won\u2019t..scare me!\u201d You replied.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You dashed toward him but he quickly snatched you and slammed you to the ground, making you cough blood. You slowly got up and tried to attack but he punched your stomach so hard you feel you have been punctured. You knelt, not knowing what to do until you heared a gunshot. You looked back and saw both mikaela and Oleg with their weapons!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cMikaela..Oleg!\u201d You spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI heard from Marcus. We\u2019ll deal with him, so go in.\u201d Oleg said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You nodded and slowly went. Arnold tried to stop you but mikaela stopped him with more gunshots and his gunshot wounds were healed. He went toward them as you went toward the room, You went in, only to see the distorted area filled with blood stains on the wall. You walked slowly and once deep, you saw something that was deeply horrific.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Le fay, on the wall, murdered by sword on her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cAnna..Anna!!\u201d You shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You walked little faster and saw someone sitting on the fine chair, and it was none other than Anna herself. She was looking in the air for moment, not looking at anything nor listening to anything. You wondered what she was up to then you spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cAnna??\u201d You said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n She then..</span></div></div>",

You saw her muscular arms and you had the moment of thought that you shouldn't mess with this women. She thanked the waitress and once she left the horned women turned her attention to you and observed you throughly. Your tension were little high vas she was obvserving you, she smiled and sat across from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"So you're the one that the human girl told about!\" Oni said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You...know my sister?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yup, your sister Anna's came here year and half ago and started to make an rebel army against some sort of gang.\" She replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You were surprised to hear that as she never told you that before, and you thought that the fey group caught her and tortured her for months. You felt that she have been carrying weight for too long, and decided to ask her to become part of the rebellion. You then noticed that the women ordered some beer and the waitress came back with the jug of beer. She thanked her and started to drink some.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Haa, beer's always good.\" Women said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Um, excuse me..I want to ask you something.\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She noticed you and put the jug down, burping lightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yeah, what's up?\" Women asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Do you know where my sister is right now?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She took few more sips of the beer and ate some of the food you ordered earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yeah, I know where she is. Do you want to go see her?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You were surprised to hear that she immediatly asked that question as you thought she would ask more question about it. You nodded, saying that you wanted to see her badly. She smiled and agreed to take you to the place and once she drank the beer both you and the women got up and left the restaurant. She introduced herself as hoshiguma yuugi and you introduced yourself to her, and after 15 minutes of walking you two got to the big house that were slightly off from the village. You also noticed that there were barrack on the side of the house and once you two got to the entrance, the two guards guareded the door with rifle<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"State your name and your occupation, oni.\" One guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'm hoshiguma yuugi, and my occupation is transporter.\" She replied, \"I have your leaders only brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The two guards looked at you and you nodded to them. One guard told you two to wait and got into the house, and within 5 minutes he came out from the door and spoke to the other guard with whisper and turned to you two.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"Alright, you two can come in.\" Guard said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The guard opened the door and you two went in. Once you got in and the door closed, you observed the house as it was double deckered interier filled with many military insignia and pictures of revolutionary figures like Che Guevara and Joseph Stalin. You saw the table as it was filled with many paper that had plans and legal papers and once you two got deeper into the room, you saw a door that wrote \"planning station\" and when you got in, you saw  Four people on the respective seat and your big sister sitting on the far side of the table, smoking some cigarette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Anna!\" You spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I heard the guards speaking about your arrival.\" Anna said, \"And I guess Yuugi have escorted you here huh? I thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"No problem.\" Yuugi replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Anna then asked yuugi to politely leave. She nodded and left the room, and once she was gone you looked at the four other people as there were three men and one women sitting. You had some vague memory, but you remember that they were once the members of the fey family that were pure fairy. You didn't know why they were here then anna spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Alex...Why did you come here? I told you to stay at that restaurant and go back to that house.\" Anna replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'm sorry Anna, but I just can't let you bear the weight yourself.\" You said, \"I have heard the detail from yuugi. Please, let me join the rebel army!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Anna thought for moment and got up from the chair. The four others were quietly talked to each other as your big sister came closer to you, you quickly felt some sort of power coming from her, and once she stopped before you, you could feel the power to the point that you could even feel it as both malace and wrath was talking to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Alex. If you join the mafia, you know that there will be pain, suffering, and even death. You know that as you were part of my mission when we were part of that damn group.\" Anna said, \"Even though I risked everything to protect you, are you going to throw it away your comfort to fight for rebellion.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n You swallowed your saliva and told her, \"Yes, I will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You trembled as one of the male spoke to her \"such bravery\" while the other male spoke to your sister \"He's one rare breed.\" Anna was thinking about the decision for moment and then got the final words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"fine. You shall be admitted to our cause.\" Anna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You were happy to hear that and thanked her. She just looked at you for moment and then turned aroudn and went to the seat. Once she did, she told you to sit at the chair next to you and once you did, your big sister spoke up to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Now then, I have two shift that is open for you alex. One, is to become my second hand, an inquisitor that elminate the double agents and help me with planning on the next move.

I'm sorry, but I like reisen. Don't harm her, or I'll cut ties with you!\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n This shocked everyone. Excpecially your sister who were speechless by this. She was mute for moment and then looked at you with sad eyes. She was sad, TRUELY sad as she worked hard to protect you from the LeFay gang, and now she felt that you  betrayed her. You didn't regret what you have said, but felt bad for saying such thing to your own biological sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Anna...I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Is this the only path you shall choose, alexander?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n You were surprised as she never called you by your full name.

You shivered little but got back to your couragious mode again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yes. I like reisen alot. If you kill her, who's going to fill in my empty void of dispair?\" you spoke, \"Leave her alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The silence lingered more and then she bursted in laughter. Everyone were looking at your sis, and after moment of laughter she looked at you with a grin. You could tell she was about to cry, but she was holding the tears. She smiled and then turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"If you...truly like her...then I shall not stop..you.\" Anna said, \"I'm leaving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"But..where are you leaving?\" Eirin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"...Scarlet manor.

You squeezed her as hard as you could, which in your condition wasnt very strong. And even if you had the strength to muster a bear-hug, she'd probably be too super-human for it to inflict any major damage. Unlike sis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright, Reisen?!\" you questioned for her safety as you continued holding her tightly, \"I'm really REALLY sorry about my sister. Sometimes she's just too damn overzealous for her own good. Are you ok? How's your neck? Would you like a massage?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReisen suddenly got kinda jittery in your loving and affectionate embrace! \"Er, n-no... that's quite alri-OOOOOooo!!\" As soon as you began massaging her neck, she fell into absolute bliss. She was reduced to putty as you got to work on the sensitive parts that no doubt had the worst amounts of pain. She, much like all the others, could not resist those magical fingers of yours. Heck, if theyre good enough for the Erlking\u2019s daughters, theyre good enough for your wife! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026the MASSAGES, I mean!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFeel better?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMuuuuuch\u2026\u201d she mumbled in ecstasy with her eyes rolled back and her lips drooling. Sadly for her, your loving embrace and divine massage of the Heavens came to an end. She snapped out of her trance the second you let her go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnce again, I\u2019m REALLY sorry about what my sister did,\u201d you apologized, \u201cI shouldnt have played dead like that and fooled her into thinking I was in trouble.\u201d<br>\r\nFortunately for you, Reisen gave you an assuring smile, \u201cDont worry about it, Alex-sama. I\u2019ve been through far worse pain than that. I\u2019d pretty much have to be a patient in a hospital like this one. A lot of the girls here are either incredibly strong or shoot incredibly strong projectiles!\u201d It was relieving to see her still up and at \u2018em even after getting in a face-to-face confrontation with Big Sis and surviving!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMore importantly, what about YOU?\u201d Reisen asked, \u201cI remember you telling Anna-san about your fear of Le Fey. Surely, you didn\u2019t do anything THAT bad to make you completely think youre fated to be killed by them!\u201d Oh dear. She had to say such a thing. Not that you had any right to be offended by her sheer curiosity. Your future wife (or one of them) had a right to know.<br>\r\n\u201cI disobeyed an order,\u201d was the simplest answer you could give her.<br>\r\n\u201cAn order?\u201d Reisen tilted her head, \u201cONE order? Just one?\u201d You nodded. \u201cUm, what was the order?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKill my sister.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReisen sucked in air deeply and her bunny ears twitched as if realizing she hit a major nerve. It didnt bother you any.<br>\r\n\u201cMy boss\u2019s clients caught wind that my sister was taking jobs for one of our rival gangs in order to pay for a safe and secluded nestegg to seek refuge from Le Fey. Maeve had my sis tied up and gagged and demanded I shoot her and take her place or I\u2018d suffer a worse fate than she would.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s horrible! What did you do?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt was kind of blur, but I ended up shooting Maeve in the chest then I was running for my life and the next thing I knew I wound up somewhere around where my sis and your doctor saved me and patched me up.\u201d<br>\r\nYour biggest regret is that you didn\u2019t kill the great Elven Queenpin. No man can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHm,\u201d Reisen had a hard time finding the right words to say. Not much she could say to soften the mood at the moment. Except maybe this, \u201cWell, your sister is right. Youre safe here. We\u2019re all practically living in hiding.\u201d Her bunny ears lowered, \u201cSome of us for bigger reasons than others. Still, you have nothing to worry about here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded in agreement, your mind already changed a while ago, \u201cI know. And now I have an incentive to KEEP fighting on. Cant let all my wives down, can I?\u201d<br>\r\nShe smiled nervously, \u201cActually, I kinda lied. There is no Moon Rabbit breeding law.\u201d She scratched the back of her head, \u201cI sorta made the whole thing up. Heh, cant believe EIRIN of all people believed me!\u201d Wait. So youre NOT gonna be shared with her mother and sisters?! Why the hell does this disappoint you? If anything, you should be suspicious!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHell of a bluff,\u201d you had to admit.<br>\r\n\u201cBut seriously, I didnt mean ill will to your sister!\u201d the bunny girl got on the defensive again, \u201cyou have my word, I wouldnt have gone any further with you than I already did if she didnt barge in.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou wouldnt?\u201d that response kinda disappointed you, \u201cthat\u2019s a shame. I savored every moment you had with me.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cER, d-did I say I wouldn\u2019t have gone further? I\u2026 I meant to say I WOULDVE gone further! MUCH further! Yeah, awake or not, I\u2019da had you crying out in pleasure, squealing out in raw delight until I squeezed you dry and filled my belly enough to make octuplets!\u201d Hah! She then crossed her arms and lifted her chin as she reeked with pride, \"Yep, it's dangerous to mate with a rabbit youkai. We're far harder to keep up with than any bland human female!\" Gotta love a girl with guts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, in that case,\u201d you stood up and scooted up closer to the bunny girl giving her what you thought was a pervy smirk, \u201cyou up for Round 2, Ms. Udongein Inaba?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut instead of seeing her go all bashful like you expected (or frigging jump you right then and there!), she frowned. \u201cSorry, Alex-sama. I think I mighta pulled something earlier.\u201d She cringed in pain as she rubbed her aching backside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you\u2019d like, I could massage that too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I-I\u2026. I better get to bed, it\u2019s getting late! Good night, Alex-sama!\u201d she wanted to end the discussion awfully quick. And even then you took the initiative. As soon as she raised her head from her bow, you snuck a quick kiss on the lips, causing her to go all bashful again!<br>\r\n\u201cGoodnight, Reisen-chan,\u201d you winked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hid away her blush then bowed again with a smile before trotting off with an eye-catching sway to her hips\u2026<br>\r\n\u201cOw. Ow. Ow. Ow.\u201d too bad it was hurting her money-maker trying to make her money. Yet despite the intense pain she was having, she still seemed adamant to swoon you with her sexy hip sway! You could stop yourself from snickering when she wasnt looking!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDang. Quite the change you\u2019ve had this very night. Thanks to your new friend, youre practically seeing the better side of living dangerously. Granted, she\u2019s probably too mentally unsound for you and lord knows she\u2019ll end up hurting you LITERALLY, but that\u2019s part of the joy in living dangerously. So what if she's a little crazy? You love crazy! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of living dangerously, the pain you were feeling seemed to subside. It still hurt a little to stretch, but the pain was manageable by this point. However, you couldnt sleep. It was getting late and you werent in the least bit tired. You werent up for watching any tv nor did you want to read a book. Against your better judgement, you thought the best course of action would take a little walk outside. You probably werent allowed to leave your room, but as stated earlier, youre living dangerously!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you hopped up out of your bed, zipped your pants back up, and waltzed out of your room without a care in the world! The hallway was a little dark but it didnt bother you... what with you living dangerously and all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately it was so dark, you inadvertently bumped into a wall. Well, actually a bean bag. Two bean bags to be exact. Considering your luck, your heart race assuming awful quickly what these 'bean bags' really were and jumped back asap! You tried keeping a very straight face as you raised your head to face eye-to-eye the very tall blue haired woman standing before you who thankfully seemed unconcerned that your head was in her cleavage! Then again, that in itself might not necessarily be a good thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave your undivided attention to this tall woman in a blue dress with a blue bow in her hair and what looked like six blue icicles floating behind her back like wings of some sort. Her blue eyes locked onto yours as she stared with what seemed to be slightly pouty expression. It reeked of immaturity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ey, twerp!\" her matured deepened didnt match the childish tone in it, \"ya wouldnta happened to see another little twerp by the name of... of...\" She pulled out a piece of paper and read it out, \"Al... ex...and...er... W...whi...t.....white... yeah, White. Ss....s....sto....ne... dis guy?\" It was a bounty letter with your name written in bold! You then took a quick glance over at the fancy golden bracelets on her wrists. They bare the little fairy insignias you recognize as a calling card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLE FEY'S calling card!</span></div></div>",

She may have been dumb as a brick, but she was built like a brick house (urge to motorboat was rising!) and she could be but one of many hired mercenaries now hunting you down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys, there's something important I need to talk about,\" you were more than ready to tell them about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same here!\" but Tewi thought HER important matter was more important than yours, \"do you mind if we talk about your future?\"<br>\r\n\"Tewi!\" the purple-haired rabbit woman seemed rather fed up.<br>\r\n\"I'm asking HIM!\" replied the short rabbit-runt, \"listen Al, may I call you Al?\"<br>\r\n\"No you cant!\" Reisen replied but was ignored.<br>\r\n\"Look Al. Did you know that moon rabbits are over 99.9% female? Male moon rabbits are so rare that a majority of us live our whole lives without seeing one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow that's... horrible,\" you werent prepared to hear such trivializing facts about endangered species.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is!\" Tewi nodded, \"and all of us living here in Eientei are all women. We cant breed and keep our bloodlines going without men, so... well, YOURE a man, so-\"<br>\r\n\"NO! Mr. Whitestone is NOT sleeping with the other girls here!\" youwhoknow stated.<br>\r\n\"But Rei, this is our big chance to keep the moon rabbit race going!\" Tewi insisted like it was an understandable opportunity... at least until she added, \"...plus, I think a good hump will fix Eirin's sour attitude. Lord knows she could use one!\"<br>\r\n\"M-MASTER?! YOU-\" uh oh. Apparently bringing Reisen's boss into this tipped her over the edge, \"...I'm gonna bury you alive in one of your pot holes!!\"<br>\r\nDespite being a little croggy, you were in tip top shape to hold back that mentally ill bunny girl from horribly slaughtering her coworker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTewi?\u201d you say nicely while restraining Reisen, \u201cI\u2019m afraid that\u2019s not going to happen. I am more of a one woman kind of guy.\u201d Your mate seemed to relax her struggle quickly after hearing that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut Al!\u201d Tewi whined, \u201cwe\u2019re desperate for mates to keep our bloodline going! Besides, it\u2019s not like youre gonna get babies from HER!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, everything went quiet. Little Tewi put both hands to her mouth, realizing she might have hit far below the belt. Whatever she meant by that, it was enough to make Reisen surge furiously.  With a quick swift superhuman swing of her arm, she easily swung you off her and turned her bloodthirsty rage to the shrimp!<br>\r\n\u201cO\u2026.oops\u2026\u201d the poor little twerp froze up and shivered, realizing she may have something WAY too much! It was a good thing you couldn\u2019t see the look Reisen was giving her\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEaaaa-UGH!\u201d<br>\r\nThank the heavens for a convenient distraction coming from outside! All three of you turned your attention to the noise.<br>\r\n\u201cMOKOI!!\u201d Reisen and Tewi shouted in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three of you made a dash to the door to see what\u2019s going on. When all three of you stepped outside, all turned of you turned to see a poor white haired girl with white bows in her hair and red suspenders and parachute pants writhing on the ground in pain thanks to her opponent she was apparently losing against.<br>\r\nThat big buxom blue haired fairy from last night!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonovabitch! What\u2019s SHE still doing here?! You expected the bunny girls to leap in and help who you assume is their friend in need, but instead they seem to be busy staring flabbergasted at the fairy.<br>\r\n\u201cNow ya gonna tell me where yer little bro is?!\u201d the fairy put her hands to her hips and gave her an immature smug smile.<br>\r\nThe white haired girl gradually picked herself back up, \u201cUrgh\u2026 what on earth are you talking about?! I don\u2019t have a brother!\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cTsk! Ya think ya can fool me, fire lady?!\u201d the fairy pointed to herself, or rather pointed to her incredibly large easily jiggly bosom, \u201cI already knows about you and yer bro\u2019s antics! Hand the squirt over and I wont turn ya into an ice cube and drop ya in my tea!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAw crap, she\u2019s confused this girl with your sister!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy saw Reisen\u2019s finger projectiles long before you did as she didn\u2019t so much as turn her head  before raising a huge ice wall to block the bullets!<br>\r\n\u201cDo yous bunnies mind?\u201d the big fairy turned with a snooty sneer totally unfitting for someone her age! \u201cI\u2019m in the middle o\u2019 business here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC-Cirno?! I-Is that you?!\u201d oh goody. Tewi knows her too! \u201cg-geez what happened to you?! ...And did you actually kick Mokoi's ass?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cCIRNO?!\u201d Reisen couldn\u2019t believe her bunny ears, \u201cTHAT brick house is Cirno?!\u201d<br>\r\nThe ice fairy turned her attention to the kid and her partner, \u201cHeh. Jealous, little bunnies?  Not only am eye the strongest, I\u2019m the biggest, fittest, muscliest, and smexyest! Aint that right, James?\u201d AW DANG IT!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bunny girls looked confused as you pretended to ignore Cirno. Too bad Cirno was not the type to be ignored.<br>\r\n\"Yo James!\" Cirno got a little perturbed... and you felt her outrageously ice cold aura intensify, \"I done asked ya a question! Ya gonna answer it?!\" You dare not underestimate a fairy wearing bracelets of high Le Fey rank like those. You seen the kind of damage a few of Maeve's private goons wearing those bracelets could do.<br>\r\n\"James?\" Both Tewi and Reisen turned their heads at you with squinted eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... yep! Of course! Definitely!\" you constantly winked your eye, \"She's a total one-woman wrecking ball!\"<br>\r\n\"Uh, yer eye got a bad itch or something?\" a NINE-ball apparently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou keep winking your eye, hoping the two will not blow your cover. Only bad things'll happen if this idiot finally figures out youre the Alex she's looking for! Surely, theyre not as dumb as this fairy, right?</span></div></div>",

Cirno tilted her head until she quickly noticed what the little bunny was saying. You shushed tewi, telling her not to reveal the identity until cirno grabbed mokou and quickly threw her to the side. Mokou crashed through the bamboo forest and you were sweating heavy as the ice fairy was walking toward you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Shit! we got to defend him!\" Reisen spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She summoned more bullets and shot cirno but the ice fairy quickly made more ice wall, stopping the bullets. Reisen told you to run and you nodded and ran into the building while the bunnies fought the muscular cirno. As you got in, you dashed through the hall and saw eirin guarding the room where your sister was resting. She noticed you and smiled and came to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What's going out there?\" eirin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Cirno attacked mokou and now trying to take my big sis!\" You told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She was stunned to hear this and when you explained to her, she understood where you were coming from. She then summoned her bow and arrow and equipped with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Mr.Whitestone. I will go out to aid reisen. I want you to look out for your sister while I'm gone.\" Eirin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Alright.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She nodded and went to aid reisen. You looked at the door and grabbed the knob, twisting it and opened the door. You got into the room and saw your big sister sleeping soundly on her bed. You knew anna alot as she never been disturbed by any noise while she was asleep. You sat down on the chair next to the bed, seeing her sleeping. You wondered what she was dreaming about, then you spoke to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You know anna. I was always been protected by you since we were kids.\" You spoke, \"I'm so grateful for your protection, but the Le Fay is reaching to the point it crawling near you and I.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Anna was still asleep and you continued to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I wish I had the power to protect you, big sis.\" You said, \"I want to gain power to protect the people I truly care.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 'Then do you want it?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You noticed the soft voice and looked at anna and you saw her eyes open slowly. She woke up slowly and looked at you with her half-asleep eyes. You quickly noticed her iris changed from green to yellow and it looked dead, like the shadow counterparts in the persona series. You trembled little as she looked at you, she opened her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I could see that you want power, my little bro.\" Anna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You heard her voice changed as it had other evil-ish tone as well. You quickly trembled as she got up, an dark aura became visible and you jumped out of the chair, you backed off slowly as she walked forward toward you. She tilted lightly as she wondered why you were backing off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Big...sis?\" You spoke lightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Why run? I'm still your big sis.\" Anna spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You're not the same....what happened to you?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She giggled lightly and she rose her arms. You suddenly felt an chill down the spine as the dark aura was getting denser, she smiled at you as she killed other people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'm still the same Little brother. I'm still your beloved big sister, and I have protected you for many years.\" Anna said, \"And now, your wish will be granted through me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She then rushed toward you and grabbed your face. You felt some pain and struggled to get her off of you but with no avail. The purplish aura then suddenly came through the arm and engulfed your. You felt the evil, resentful power from this aura and anna smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Now, engulf yourself with the power that I wield to kill the vermins...the power of your own shadow.\" Anna spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Anna...!!\" You spoke in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Moment later, you felt the dark energy rush through and you screamed in pain...</span></div></div>",

They couldn't understand on how cirno, one of the most weakest fairy, would become super strong. Reisen and Tewi used their spell card and shot many danmaku bullets on the huge cirno. She smiled and started to deflect the bullets as eirin charged up her power onto the arrow, she shot the arrow toward the ice fairy but when she noticed the arrow, she immediately stopped and grabbed the arrow and stopped it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What!? Even my attack stops her?\" Eirin spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What's going on with cirno!?\" Tewi asked with some fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I don't know, but something's up.\" Reisen responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Just as they were about to fight more, everyone felt the eerie feeling from back. The eientei group and even cirno didn't know what this feeling were until a shadow that everyone had started to gather around cirno and it quickly engulfed the whole area. Eirin and others was confused by this as the sun was still around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What's going on!? Is rumia here now?\" Tewi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I don't know! if that's true, is she here to aid cirno?\" Reisen replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Just then, they heard cirno scream in pain. Eirin and others got to their position to fight as they heard some punching and kicking noise, even the deflecting noise were as well. Moment later, the darkness faded away revealing cirno on the ground with puddle of blood on her body. Eirin and others were shocked to see this and was more stunned to see: both you and Anna, standing at cirno. Yours and Annas  eyes were yellow and you kicked cirnos face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What's wrong, weakling? don't you wanna play with big bad wolf!?\" You spoke with evil tone mixed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Let's just stop her heart.\" Anna replied.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n You nodded and grabbed her head and threw her high in the sky. Anna quickly took out her magnum and shot the ice fairy six time, making an loud noise and cirno broke into many pieces and turned into mist. Eirin and others were truly stunned by what they saw as you looked at others, you and anna smiled and suddenly fell down to the ground, sleeping. The eientei group and mokou who came back from the crash nodded and helped take you and anna back into the eientei.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Hours later, you slowly woke up and saw....</span></div></div>",

Plain cereal, nothing special and luxurious like the food they used to serve back in Le Fey\u2026 but you\u2019d sooner eat tasteless hospital food than anything decent that reminds you of them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI certainly hope you\u2019ve slept well,\u201d Eirin\u2019s smiling face seemed a bit worried, \u201cdespite um\u2026 her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI slept fine, thanks,\u201d you assured her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, good,\u201d the doctor got close to you, wanting to discuss something very important, \u201cso\u2026 about last night\u2026 with Ms. Udongein Inaba\u2026 is there something we need to discuss in private?\u201d<br>\r\nYou shook your head, \u201cNo, nothing you dont already know.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou sure?\u201d she raised her eyebrow, \u201cI mean\u2026 when she\u2026 you know\u2026 it was purely consensual? You weren\u2019t drugged or anything?\u201d Oy, THIS is what it\u2019s about?!<br>\r\n\u201cNo I was perfectly clean,\u201d you answer with a shred of discomfort, \u201cI\u2019m sorry I helped cause a scene\u2026 especially with Anna. I didnt mean any trouble by it. I just\u2026 I got a little too curious for my own good, you know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026 you alright with my patient?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI wouldnt have called her my wife to my sister if I wasnt.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 that\u2019s good to hear,\u201d she said with a bit of relief, but uneasiness still dwindled, \u201cI\u2019m glad that you managed to get along very well with Reisen\u2026 however, I dont think it\u2019s an idea to refer to her as your wife at the moment. I mean no offense, but she\u2018s still not exactly in the correct state of mind for um\u2026 THAT kind of occupation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to sugar-coat it,\u201d you say to her, \u201cI know what youre saying. But it\u2019s my decision. I will cope with it.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThen\u2026\u201d Eirin swallowed, \u201c\u2026you better make sure she takes her meds. Otherwise, she may be prone to violent outbursts. And especially try not to tease her too much!\u201d Ugh. Such is \u2018living dangerously\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of \u2018living dangerously\u2019 and \u2018last night\u2019\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpeaking of last night,\u201d that reminds you, \u201cI saw somebody sneak into Eientei late last night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had the doc\u2018s undivided attention. \u201dWho?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think a hired mercenary of Le Fey,\u201d you told her, \u201cshe had a bounty contract on her with my name on it!\u201d<br>\r\nHer eyes widened and she went for a pencil and notepad, \u201cCan you describe her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery tall, possibly built, long blue hair, blue dress with white triangle  designs near the folds,\u201d Eirin squinted her eyes while you continued, \u201cblue bow in her hair and these big white ice crystals sticking out of her back like some abstract wings.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEirin cringed with disbelief. It seems like she\u2019s having doubts about her drawing. \u201cIs\u2026 THIS her?\u201d She drew a picture of a cute little chibi-version of your assassin. Same bratty face, but short and in child form!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s pretty close,\u201d you answer, \u201cbut the merc from last night was much older, taller, built like an amazonian!\u201d You wanted to refrain from commenting on her chest. Although she had quite a lot of it!<br>\r\n\u201cWe cant be talking about the same girl,\u201d she denied, \u201cCirno\u2019s tiny, bratty, dumb, annoying and harmless to anyone except frogs!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell, this assassin seemed bratty and dumb,\u201d you said, \u201cbut she didnt seem harmless. Looked like she could bench press me with one of those icicles\u2026\u201d Dang it, why did you have to say that out loud?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is weird,\u201d she commented, \u201cmaybe Cirno\u2019s got some distant relatives nearby\u2026\u201d Or maybe there\u2019s something to do with those stupid bracelets of hers! \u201cAnyways, I\u2019ll pass the message to the Princess and let the other patients know to keep an eye out for intruders.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cLet my sis know, especially!\u201d you insist, \u201cLe Fey\u2019s still after her too!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid she\u2019s already left Eientei,\u201d Eirin delivered the bad news.<br>\r\n\u201cOh right. How far is Scarlet Manor from here?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s not there,\u201d Eirin delivered more bad news, \u201cshe said she had to make a last minute change of plans and she went to meet an associate of hers.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhere is she going?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cShe made me promise not to tell you,\u201d Eirin delivered even more bad news! \u201csaid it was an emergency and didnt want you involved.\u201d Not again, you thought. She wants YOU to stay safe while SHE\u2019S out putting her ass on the line for nothing?! Dang it, wasn\u2019t that damn burn bad enough for her?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pulled out your cellphone and called her up, but sonovabitch, she blocked your number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Alex,\u201d Eirin apologized, \u201cI tried to talk her out of it, but\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s too damn stubborn,\u201d you answered for her. Stupid Anna. What was she thinking?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mr. Whitestone, I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Eirin tries to comfort you, \u201cI\u2019m going to need to go spread word to the Princess about the intruder. By all means hit the buzzer if you need anything. And once again, dont overdo it.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, doctor,\u201d you say your thanks. As soon as she walked out, you try to call up your sister again, but you were still blocked. You call up one of her \u2018alternate\u2019 numbers, but even they were blocked. Even sending a simple text was to no avail. Man, why the sudden last minute secrecy to her own brother? Something big was up, you just know it. Maybe she got wind of the local bounty and wanted to\u2026 do something about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou damn sure better not get yourself killed,\u201d you muttered. No soon after that mutter did you notice last minute that you had another name under your Contact list besides Anna.<br>\r\n\u201cReisen?!\u201d her name was in your contact list, \u201cwhen did she get a hold of my phone?!\u201d<br>\r\nEh, you probably didnt wanna know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, it presented some opportunity to pass the time.

You wondered who until you saw few people carrying an injured people. One person were long white haired girl with white shirt and red pants and she was carrying a young girl who were injured<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Is Eirin available!?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yeah, what happened?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"The village were under attack!\" She answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You were horrified by this and then you lead the few into the eientei and the girl lead the rest to see eirin. You were getting worried about Anna and  getting scared. You wondered if she was ok and wanted to be by her side, but she was too stubborn to let you be near her as she worked to keep you safe and alive. You walked toward the area where both eirin and reisen were starting to give treatment on the patients the girl brought, eirin turned to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Mokou, how did this happen?\" Eirin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"There were 3 fairies who had this...mutation or something.\" Mokou replied, \"They were bigger, muscular and stronger. Both me and keine tried to stop the three but we couldn't even give them scratch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You came in, had the remembrance of what happened last night with that fairy.

You thought for moment and had the theory that she had something to do with this rebel army or something. You walked up to them and they noticed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"M-Mr.Whitestone!\" Reisen spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Um.. what is this rebel army you speak of?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You were wondering about this rebel army and mokou spoke to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I don't know. Me or keine don't even know who these people are.\" mokou answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n You sighed in depression. Eirin had the clue that maybe you were depressed because of anna, and she could feel how your depression affecting your body. She assured that nothing will happen to you, and the members of eientei will protect you with full might. You understood that they were protecting you, but you didn't want to be left aside like an helpless damsel in distress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Mr.Whitestone. I understand you want to help, but this is for your own benefit.\" Eirin said, \"Just relax and let us take care of the situation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"But...\" You spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Now I have to take care of the patients so can you please give us minute?\" Eirin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You nodded and went out of the room. Mokou followed you and once you two were out, she told you she'll be meeting with kaguya so she parted with you. You thought on what you should do now since you had nothing to do. You walked through the hallway until you saw..</span></div></div>",

You didn't know why she was observing you, then she asked you to follow her. You nodded and walked with her to outside. You wondered what she wanted then she spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I can see that you have siblings...tell me, what is your sibilings name?\" elder women asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Um.. her name is anna.\" You replied, surprised by her intention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She smiled and then looked into the sky. The sky were blue as ever and the surrounding were  calm as there were no one was ever to come to the area to kill you or others. She sighed and then closed her eyes, muttering something under her breath. You didn't hear anything from her and then she opened her eyes and turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You know.. you remind me of my granddaughter who were lively.\" Elderly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Really? where do she lives now?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"She lives in the human village right now..I do hope peace would last forever.\" elderly replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She then excused herself and went back in. You decided to stay out for moment since you needed some fresh air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n -myoren temple-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n In the myoren temple, one person were sitting in the guest room writing something on the paper. It was Anna and she was writing something down on the paper. Moment later, she put the pen down and got the malboro and took out one. She then took out the cigarette holder and put the cigarette on the end and lit it. As she puffed some smoke, she noticed someone opening the door and revealed an women with yellow/brown hair and tiger striped clothes. Her name was Shou Toramaru, one of the myoren members who are also an tiger youkai. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Lady Whitestone, breakfast is ready.\" Shou said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Thank you, Ms.Toramaru.\" anna replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shou observed her back and observed her. Anna told the whole myoren temple about her plans and they decided to help her out by letting her stay in the temple for moment. Shou observed her hardly then anna got up and turned around. Shou jumped little by this as anna have noticed her observation, then smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Something wrong, ms.toramaru?\" Anna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"N-no! now please, everyone is waiting!\" Shou said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She nodded and puffed the cigarette and both of them got out of the room and saw three mens and one women standing. They had some sort of travelers cloth with some armors on, and they were equipped with weapons. Anna tilted her head and came to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Is everything alright, friends?\" Anna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"There were three fairies attacking the village. We have stopped them.\" Man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Anna nodded and congradulated them. Their names were Jason, guy, maria, and leon. They were one of the people who joined anna to fight off the le fay gangs and they were strong. Anna thought for moment and then spoke to the four.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ladies and Gentlemen. I am grateful that you four are fighting for our cause. My secret will come to fight off and eradicate the le fay gangs once and for all.\" Anna said. \"Now then...let's have some breakfast.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n They agreed and followed anna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n -eientei-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You just went back in, then you heard someone arguing.

What's all that noi-\" suddenly, a black haired woman wearing what appeared to be a pink silk buttoned shirt over a red kimono walked into the room and the first thing that caught her eye was your darling sister putting that poor bunny girl in a sleeper hold while pointing a gun to her head! Without any care or concern of her own being, she actually lunged at Anna, attempting to pry her arms off Reisen's neck!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop it!\" she demanded as she attempted to wrestle the gun out of Anna's hand, \"Stop it this instant!!\"<br>\r\n\"Let go of me, Kaguya!\" your sister roared, \"I'm giving this bitch what she deserves!\"<br>\r\n\"I give you... rggh... and your brother sanctuary...\" Kaguya struggled, \"...and you repay me by trying to kill one of my subordinates?!\"<br>\r\n\"L-Lady Kaguya....\" you could hear Reisen groan with a little admiration in her voice, \"..you came here... to save me....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou really shouldve shouted again and told Anna to stop, but instead you just kept your mouth shut and lied back down in your bed, pretending to still be asleep! Not sure why. Maybe because you just wanted to see where this dispute would go... even at the expense of that poor ill bunny girl who was only guilty of simply pleasuring herself... with you. Your member was still squirting a little semen from the intense ride it still hasnt recovered from!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, despite that short temper of hers, Anna finally cooled down. She growled a bit, but she finally slammed her gun on the desk and dropped Reisen, leaving her to cough and wheeze on the floor!<br>\r\n\"Now, tell me what's going on!\" Kaguya demanded from your sister, \"or I will have you permanently removed from my mansion!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your goddamn subordinate,\" she pointed your way, \"just got through raping my brother in his sleep!\" Kaguya gasped at your pantsless body and twitching shaft finishing squirting out the last drops of post-sex cum! She quickly jerked her head away and her face went red. Then so did yours!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this true, Reisen?\" she questioned Reisen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally finished catching her breath, she lowered her head and nodded, \"Y-Yes, my lady.\"<br>\r\n*Smack!*<br>\r\nYou almost flinched yourself see that epic smack across Reisen's face! Yikes! Kaguya certainly doesnt take insubordination well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HOW DARE YOU!!\" she shouted at the bunny girl, \"you disgusting perverted swine! Just when I seriously think your disturbing antics couldnt get any worse, you actually do THIS?!\" Kaguya mercilessly scolded Reisen as she kept her head low in shame. \"Unbelievable AND unacceptable! ...You KNEW it wasnt even your turn!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Wasnt even her turn'? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jerked your head to her for a split second then resumed pretending to sleep after you heard her utter that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" Anna suspected something fishy about that statement to, \"wasnt even her turn?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm dreadfully sorry, Ms. Whitestone,\" Kaguya apologized, \"she clearly knew that her breeding time with your brother wasnt even until late next week! It was clearly posted on the calendar, wasnt it?\"<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes, Lady Kaguya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna was speechless! For good reason! Reason that would result in the horrible massacre of the person or people responsible!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-A-Am I hearing this right?!\" Anna gave Kaguya the Sneer that caused Reisen to flinch, \"did you honestly just imply that your little bunny bimbo was SCHEDULED to screw my brother?!\"<br>\r\n\"Um, yes?\" surprisingly, Kaguya was unaffected by the Sneer, \"he's scheduled to breed with every fertile lunarian in Eientei.\" Your eyes widened and quickly closed.<br>\r\n\"Like hell he is!\" your sis snapped, \"that was not part of the deal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, yes it was,\" Kaguya corrected her, \"that was the whole purpose of the deal! I offer your brother sanctuary, and he offers heirs to the fertile females of this place. That was our agreement!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You lying rat!\" Anna sneered some more, \"I NEVER agreed to that!\"<br>\r\n\"LYING RAT?! You have some nerve!\" Kaguya sneered back, \"you most certainly DID agree!\"<br>\r\n\"I most certainly did not!\"<br>\r\n\"Yes. You. Did. I told you specifically. SPECIFICALLY what Eientei needed. I went through hefty detail discussing why we need a young fruitful and endowed male here.\"<br>\r\n\"Wha-\"<br>\r\n I told you the very tale of why moon rabbits produce so incredibly few males in their species!\"<br>\r\n\"I-\"<br>\r\n\"I even had Tewi and her friends perform the lunarian play about the Moon Goddess and the curse she placed on the rabbits of the moon!\"<br>\r\n\"..B...\"<br>\r\n\"And when I did ALL that, you said and I quote 'Sure, Kaggie! Little Ally here gonna make you lotta babies! LOOOOTTA babies'!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Little Ally', she said? Was she drunk when she made that deal?! The only time she EVER calls you 'Little Ally' is when she's pissed drunk and making REALLY bad decisions! How can you possibly forget '*Hic!* Why sure, Big Erl! Little Ally's got them magic hands'll make them little girls o' yours feel REALLY good!\" She was honestly surprised the Erlking's daughters were coming by dang near every night for free massages?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna was... once again, speechless. This time not in anger. Mainly embarrassment. She hammered her forehead with her fists a couple of times, realizing what a dumb dumb DUUUUUUUUUMB thing she done!<br>\r\n\"L-Look, I dont care what I said when I was filling up on sake!\" Anna said, \"I cant let my brother do that!\"<br>\r\n\"Well then perhaps you shouldnt have signed the paper!\" Kaguya was not willing to budge.<br>\r\n\"M-maybe we can work out another deal!\" your sis attempted to barter, \"I know a couple of high paying people with big pockets and a lot of rare fancy jewels!\"<br>\r\n\"I already HAVE all the money in the world,\" Kaguya crossed her arms and said with pride, \"what I dont have are strapping men that could help my servants and soldiers produce offspring!\"<br>\r\n\"W...what about-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... I\u2026 I think it's my turn now,\" and as if the night couldnt get any worse, yet another person barges into your room uninvited! \u2026.Eirin! Flashing what looked to be a raffle ticket with the name 'Alex-sama' on it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...YOU?!\u201d Anna was furious, \u201cYOURE IN ON THIS, TOO?!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doc's eyes widened, \u201cW-w-wait, Ms. Whitestone! This isnt what it looks like!\u201d She hid her raffle ticket\u2026 and her bottle of hormonal enhancing pills behind her back, \u201cI-I-I was merely scheduling a doctor's appointment for him! Oops.\u201d Were those fuzzy cuffs that dropped out of her shirt collar?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna quickly grabbed the nearest conveniently placed ice pick and chased after the doctor who quickly ran off screaming off the top of her lungs!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMs. Whitestone!\u201d Kaguya ran after them, \u201cif you dare impale Eientei's only medical expert\u2026.!!\u201d And with that, it was just you and Reisen again. On the plus side, there was finally peace and quiet. On the minus side, it was just you and Reisen again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her neck still in pain from the choking received from your sister, her glowing red eyes still gazed your way. Or rather, she was gazing at that pecker of yours. Why were you STILL pretending to be asleep?!<br>\r\nThankfully, instead of going for Round 2 and risking Anna's ice pick, she pulled out a handkerchief from her shirt pocket and wiped off the uh\u2026 'runoff'. How uh, courteous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGoodnight Alex sir,\u201d Reisen whispered, \u201cand thank you for giving me your life-giving seed,\u201d she smiled brightly, \u201cas well as the fun. It felt really good *Smooch!*\u201d She gave you a goodnight kiss. Even though you pretended to sleep, you couldnt pretend enough not to blush.<br>\r\nAnd after that kiss lingered on your cheek, Reisen finally left your room.<br>\r\n\u201cSNIIIIIIFFF\u2026 ahhhh\u2026.\u201d right after taking a large disturbing sniff of that handkerchief!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhelp, Eientei certainly will take some getting used to. Provided Anna didnt screw this up by murdering the doctor who just saved your life. Youre quite a bit worried about what tomorrow will bring. But at least all this drama has finally made you tired for real this time. You close your eyes for real and drift off, finishing up that rest you need for tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProvided nobody else rudely barges in of course!</span></div></div>",

You dont recall the dream you had throughout the sleep. Something about an old wrecked supermarket haunted by a bloodthirsty ghost that hunts you down after you call out the name 'Beth'. Anyways, morning came before you knew it. You were up with the chickens before the alarm clock even went off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour back however was a little sore, thanks to a certain bunny-girl that got in touch with her inner-cowgirl! Despite your pelvis being a little achy, you got dressed and headed out, trying not to limp too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long walk down a long quiet hall, you come across a room that you overhear arguing\u2026 with two familiar voices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHIC! SuRe KaggIE! Li'l Ally here gon' make  you a LOTTA babies! *Hic!* LOOOOTTA babies!\u201d the face you made was priceless after you heard your own sister make such a drunken slur!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee?! That was YOU slurring those words!\u201d then you overheard Kaguya's rather furious tone come from that room. Curious you peeked into the room and see Kaguya replaying what looks to be a surveillance video to your incredibly nervous sister!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2026 that's not me!\u201d Anna denied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes it most certainly is you!\u201d Kaguya corrected, \u201csame hair, same dress, same pointy ears you still seem to be trying to hide for some reason! YOU MADE THE DEAL!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-you cant prove that's me,\u201d your sister was incredibly stubborn, \u201chow do I know that wasnt just an impersonator you hired to try to scam me out of selling out my brother?!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDear Chang'e almighty, is your head so far up your ass that youre getting high off the suppository Eirin stuffed up you?!\u201d<br>\r\nThat was clearly gonna take a while. You'd best not disturb those two and cause an even bigger scene. Your sister's in enough trouble as it is. No reason to waltz in there and 'confront' her for what you already know\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, speaking of confrontations, just a short distance away, you spot that particular bunny girl from last night that ended up being your third sexual experience (the second was Maeve as part of your 'initiation'. The first\u2026 it was Anna. Years ago. She was drunk and she thought you were too young and naive to understand what she was doing to you. She was wrong.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice Reisen had carried a rather large backpack on her back. It was thick and huge, almost her size (not counting the length of her bunny ears)! As much as your sister was most likely holding a grudge against her, you approached Reisen from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Reisen!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"!!!\" the bunny girl almost jumped up and hit the ceiling regardless of the huge backpack weighing her down. After her bunny ears unstiffed, she turned around and smiled nervously.<br>\r\n\u201cOh! H-Hi Alex, sir!\u201d you could see her sweat a little, \u201cd-did you manage to sleep well?\u201d<br>\r\nYou smiled, \u201cOh yes! I dont think I've slept this well in ages! ...Although I coulda sworn I heard somebody call out 'Alex-sama' in the middle of the night, though.\u201d Heh. You couldnt resist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReisen's face went completely red. She quickly turned away, hoping you didnt see the blush (you so freaking did!)<br>\r\n\u201cW-Well! I-I'm glad to hear that! ...I certainly hope you'll get to sleep well tonight too,\u201d was that an invitation? \u201cN-Now if you'll excuse me.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d you asked because you were filled to the brim with curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have to deliver a huge supply of medicine to a new client of my master over at the Human Village,\u201d she answered.<br>\r\n\u201cYikes! And ALL that is drugs you gotta carry?!\u201d you pointed to the huge backpack.<br>\r\nShe nodded, \u201cNormally, it's much much smaller. However, this particular new client is a huge buyer. They tend to purchase our products in huge loads!\u201d Geez, that cant be good for her back!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou look like you could use a hand. All that weight's gotta be killing you!\u201d youre a gentleman. Of course youre gonna be worried.<br>\r\n\u201cThat's alright. I've done a lot of heavy lifting back at my old job,\u201d she assured you \u201cI HAD to. But thank you for being concerned about me!\u201d Now youre curious about her old job, but she didnt look like she had time to talk about it (not that she'd wanna talk about it, anyways!).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou noticed her cringe slightly painfully\u2026 well, actually, she merely twitched in discomfort, yet somehow you could easily detect that was a cringe of pain.<br>\r\n\u201cAre you alright? You look a little sore,\u201d you observed.<br>\r\nShe got incredibly nervous, \u201cOh\u2026 th-that? No, I\u2026 mustve slept awkwardly in my sleep. N-Nothing big.\u201d Translation: I got a charlie horse from riding you like one last night!<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I know for a fact, when you got one of those kinda aches, the last thing you wanna do is add too much stress to it,\u201d you pull that out of your ass, \u201cso let me lend you a hand carrying those things to the Village.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI, er, appreciate your generosity,\u201d Reisen was looking several directions as she was saying this, possibly checking for witnesses, \u201cbut it's incredibly dangerous to bring you along. T-too many wild youkai out there\u2026 outside and inside the village.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDont worry, I cant take care of myself,\u201d you assure her, \u201cplus I've got some experience making great deals with clients. There was this female one from Russia who my sister absolutely hates for some reason, yet when sis offends her in some way or screws up a job really bad, I get just a few minutes alone with her, and that client magically forgets whatever headache my sis gave her! And I dont even know a single word of Russian, yet I can STILL manage to-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlex sir? I really need to be going now,\u201d aw, your story was about to get to the best part!<br>\r\n\u201cCan I come along, please?\u201d you keep nagging, \u201cI promise I wont be in the way. Plus, if I'm gonna be staying here, I really should get used to what goes on over here. And...\u201d you blush a little, \u201cI think it'd helpful to get along with some of the employees. And I'm sure WE\u201dRE gonna be working together an awful lot, so...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReisen's ears immediately stood on end again. She quickly jerked her head behind her, but not to look at you. She looked past you. You had a guess what she was looking out for. \u201cUm\u2026 I would love to let you\u2026 but I dont think I'm allowed to.\u201d She was right. She'd be getting herself in trouble. Most likely not just with your sis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPleeeease?\u201d still, you begged to come along, \u201cI promise I wont get in the way. I'll do what you tell me. I wont be a burden! You have my word!\u201d<br>\r\nReisen, kinda sweating from slight terror from possible repercussions, while at the same time nervous from vulnerability to peer pressure thought for a moment, then finally answered...</span></div></div>",

B-But I'm sure it's incredibly important to all of us!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I'll be sure to do my best then!\u201d you answered, making Reisen jerk her head away and blush even more, \u201cer, whatever that task is.\u201d Too bad that was the end of the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly later, the two of you reached the village. Despite being called the Human Village, the place was heavily populated with a wide variety of unique people. There were people were animal ears, animal tails, animal faces, extra limbs, extra tails, wings, horns\u2026 you'd wage a guess and say that least 60% of the Human Village population were non-human. Made you feel like the odd one out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately you didnt have to worry about that for long. The two of you reached your destination. A cramped shoddy flat in the middle of an alleyway barely lit up by a half-dead lightbulb hanging right over the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReisen set her backpack down and you carefully set your huge nitro tank on the ground as she gave what you assumed to be a secret knock on the door. It took a little while before someone answered the door.<br>\r\nA woman. A tall slender woman, maybe a little over 6 feet tall, about your age in spectacles. It took only seconds to quickly recognize her and as soon as her eyes turned to you, she recognized you even quicker!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlex?! ALEX!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing you knew, you were smothered against soft cushiony pillows that were the elegant breasts of Yumi Majima as she wrapped her arms around you and squeezed you tight!<br>\r\n\u201cAlex, youre alright!!!\u201d Big Yumi beam with excitement, still embracing you, still smothering you in boobage, \u201cI'm so glad youre alright! I was worried Le Fey had gotten you!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cN-N-nice to\u2026 nice see you too, Yumi!\u201d you hugged back, but struggled in her grasp a little just to be able to speak. Reisen just stood there speechless. You could only imagine what she'd be feeling right that moment!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYumi?! What are you doing?! I told you to let the others answer the door!\u201d<br>\r\nJust then, a one-eyed greasy-haired gentleman in a sleazy shirtless snake-skin jacket and leather pants wearing way too much cologne rushed over and scolded Yumi. And sure enough, as soon as you pulled your head out from her cleavage, you were quick to recognize this sleazy gentleman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...Alex? Alex-chan is that you?!\u201d he rushed over to you when his little (using the term loosely) sister finally let go of you.<br>\r\n\u201cGoro?\u201d you were just as surprised to see him. Yet another one of your sister's old acquaintances youre very familiar with. Goro Majima. Former 7th Hand Yakuza affiliate now an owner of some porno movie industry. Damned if you know how he and Anna ever got along, but to be fair he's an awful lot nicer than many of her 'friends' ever been. Got along really well with all his sisters, too. Especially Big Yumi. You can only imagine the flash flood of tears rolling down her eyes if she finds out what Eientei's gonna be having you doing :( .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA...Anna told me you were dead!\u201d Goro stated. Obviously she wanted to keep you hidden from pursuers, \u201cw-what are you doing here?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMr. Whitestone and his sister are currently staying with us, Mr. Majima,\u201d Reisen answers, \u201che is currently under care and servitude of the Princess until further notice.\u201d Servitude?! Wait a sec!<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, how bout that?\u201d Goro chuckled, \u201cit's as if fate itself doesnt want to keep us apart! Of course, if you and your sister were on the run, why didnt you just come to me. I woulda got you a nice safe house! Provided you dont mind sharing a room with Yumi over here.\u201d Goro swayed his head to his big little sis who was currently blushing like mad. Reisen breathed heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause Anna's worried you might push me to be in one of your films,\u201d you answer truthfully. Reisen slowly turned her head to you with a cold blank expression.<br>\r\nGoro just shrugged his arms, \u201cSo?! Aint no shame in it! It's still an honest and fulfilling career that one can make a good living from. It's no different than being a Hollywood actor\u2026 except there aint no stunt doubles to do the hard work for you! You know what I'm saying, Yumi?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cGoro!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEr, excuse me, Majima-san,\u201d your bunny girl partner interrupted the siblings' discussion, \u201cI dont mean to intrude, but we have supplies we need to drop off.\u201d Ah yes, the delivery.<br>\r\n\u201cOh! Right right! Sorry Reisen! Totally forgot. HEY TOHRU! GET OVER HERE AND HELP ME CHECK THE INVENTORY!\u201d So Goro and a couple of his goons inspected the boxes of questionable medicines that you and Reisen delivered. You questioned what Goro needs with a shit ton of odd medicine when he openly stated that he left the drug-dealing industry (to join the porn industry) but you know better than to ask too many questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey took quite an awful long time carefully inspecting the nitro tank. You hoped that it's for safety reasons, cuz you did not feel safe being around people constantly tapping it, shaking it around, pounding it against the ground and so forth! Thankfully the 'inspection' ended without an explosion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk. Everything's accounted for,\u201d Goro finished the inventory check, scratching off the last item on his list and signing off for the purchase. Following that, Goro wrote up the check and handed it to Reisen. \u201cHere ya go! That should cover everything. \u2026.And a little something for you!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201c*GASP!*\u201d the bunny girl flinched when that pervy sleazy ex-mob general stuffed a couple of bills down her blouse!<br>\r\n\u201cBrother! What's wrong with you?!\u201d Yumi scolded him.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? I still paid her good!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReisen, despite clearly being offended judging by the enraged glare in her eyes, controlled her temper and kept civil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright. We're finished here. Let's go, Alex-sa-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! Dont leave already!\u201d but Goro interjects, \u201cit's been a while, Alex-chan! We got some catching up to do! Did you know Big Yumi just became an official Hollywood movie star?\u201d That peeked your interest!<br>\r\n\u201cReally Yumi?\u201d And it's not one of GORO'S movies, too?!<br>\r\nYumi smiled and blushed, \u201cWell, it's not really THAT big a roll. I'm just in a few scenes with a few lines in an upcoming movie \u201c Still impressive enough if it's an actual Hollywood movie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome inside, we'll tell you all about it!\u201d Goro offered.<br>\r\n\u201cCongratulations, Ms. Majima,\u201d Reisen stated, \u201cbut we may need to hear about it another time. Alex-sama and I are on a tight schedule\u2026 and I'd rather not get in trouble with his sister (again)!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo worries, I'll talk to Anna!\u201d he insists, \u201cnow c'mon! Dont keep a Hollywood star waiting!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlex...sama...\u201d Reisen looked at you pleading with a worried expression, \u201cwe really should be heading back.\u201d You know why she's worried. You cant blame her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, you'd like to catch up a bit with an old friend regardless of how much of an eyesore her big bro can be. Then again, you'd hate to get your brand new associate and possible mother of your future children in any more trouble than she already is (nevermind Anna got YOU in trouble making an incredibly outrageous deal while under the influence!)...</span></div></div>",

I'll see you later, Alex!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, bye Reisen,\" you mutter in defeat. Yeah, it's probably for the best. You got her in enough trouble already (although to be fair, it was HER choice to sneak into your room and mount you!). Besides, you probably shouldnt devote TOO much of your attention on her considering youre meant to mingle with all the other girls in Eientei thanks to Kaguya and your lush of a sister!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd best start introducing yourself to them like a proper Alpha. And as the fates deemed it, your blind trekking led you to the doctor's office. Dr. Eirin Yagokoro's office to be exact. Hopefully, Anna didnt manage to hurt her that much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a nervous sigh, you knock on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome in,\u201d you hear her call. You walk in as she's in the middle of writing up notes. Without further ado, you holler, \u201cGood morning, Dr. Yagokoro!\u201d<br>\r\nEirin froze for a few seconds. Not in surprise, but sortof in dread. She stopped writing and slowly turned her head before smiling back at you almost forcefully. Good, no ice pick stab wounds as far as you can see\u2026 which is VERY good, cuz Anna usually goes for the neck!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning Alex sa-...I mean, Mr. Whitestone!\u201d she smiled as her eyes quickly darted around you, \u201cdid you need something?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI was wondering if you werent busy,\u201d you say, \u201cand if you are, I thought I could lend you a hand.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI already have plenty of aides for that,\u201d Eirin says to you, \u201cbut since youre here\u2026 um...\u201d She gets up out of her seat, walks toward you while checking behind you for something, \u201c...I suppose I should give you your checkup for today. Um, your sister isnt around, is she?\u201d So THAT'S what she's so stressed about!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, she's currently arguing with Kaguya about something,\u201d you answer.<br>\r\nEirin exhaled hard, \u201cI see.\u201d She shuts the door behind you and locks it, \u201cPlease have a seat over there.\u201d You took your seat and waited paitently for Eirin to examine you. She took your temperature, checked the inside of your mouth, checked your ears, checked your heartbeat, checked your bloodpressure.<br>\r\n\u201cI'm uh\u2026 gonna have to ask you to tilt your head and cough.\u201d<br>\r\nI dont think I need to tell you what she checked THERE!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe're um\u2026 *gulp*\u2026 almost done,\u201d the doctor got even more nervous as she headed to a drawer and pulled out a bottle of pills, \u201cI er, dont know if anybody told you about the\u2026 particular task that the princess requires you to fulfill to be allowed safehaven in Eientei.\u201d It was probably gonna be nerve-wrecking to make her explain it to you, so you spared her the agony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI did overhear it when sis was talking to Kaguya,\u201d you answer, \u201cI'm supposed to breed with the inhabitants of this place cuz youre running short of fertile males?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we dont have males PERIOD,\u201d she corrects you, \u201cbut yes, that's hitting the nail on the head. I'm sorry that her majesty put you in such an awkward position. But the truth is we are that desperate. Most of the inhabitants here have never even seen a male in their lives, let alone mated with one. And we cant rely on magical experimentation to breed forever.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand, I understand,\u201d you state, \u201cto be honest, I'm kinda stuck between a rock and a hard place. If I leave this place, I'll be hunted down. If the cost of staying safe and sound is I'm banging a couple of bunny girls, so be it.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHmph,\u201d Eirin plucked out a pill from the bottle in her hand, \u201chere. It's recommended you take one of these a day. It's a supplement to strengthen your immune system that prevents contracting any\u2026 diseases.\u201d Didnt take more than a second to get her meaning!<br>\r\n\u201cVenereal diseases?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cD-Dont get me wrong! I'm not saying any of our girls are unclean. 99.9% are completely clean, I assure you! However\u2026 well, after engaging in sexual intercourse an awful lot of times, statistically you'll eventually be vulnerable.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEh, what the hell?<br>\r\n\u201cOk, sure thing,\u201d you popped the pill in your mouth. Unfortunately, the nanosecond it hit your tastebuds, you nearly gagged at the foul, nasty, unbelievably horrendous taste coating it's shell! You cringed, your eyes watered, and you were desperately trying to relax the gag reflex! Of course medicine tastes awful, but WOW! You'd dip it in a dog turd if it could cover up some of that outrageously nasty taste!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWATER! PLEASE! WATER!!\u201d you gasped. Eirin quickly handed you a glass which you immediately chugged to force the pill down, then you gargled and spit out what was left, trying to get the remains of the taste out of your mouth. \u201cAUGGGHH! I am so glad I didnt have breakfast yet!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEirin sighed, \u201cI'm sorry. A lot of our medicine have very special preservatives to ensure extremely long shelf life. I'm well aware that they may affect the flavor of them.\u201d No shitting, Dr. Strange! As much as you wanted to say that out loud, you politely kept your mouth shut. Besides, even if you opened it, all that'd come out are more groans of tastebud agony!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026 *cough*\u2026 guess we're done with the checkup then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA-almost,\u201d Eirin got even more nervous, \u201cum, it's not just the moon rabbit inhabitants youre meant to breed with.\u201d AW HERE IT COMES! \u201cThe princess also suggests that you er\u2026 breed with Eientei's leading doctor because she believes it would lead to the birth of more potential doctors with her mental capacity for medical knowledge. And she certainly isnt too old to still bare children!\u201d Does she still have her raffle ticket ready?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you wanna do it now, Dr. Yagokoro?\u201d you surprise her by how quick and to the point you were! Speaking of surprise, suprisingly, an older more mature and more experienced woman like Eirin seemed to be a bit shy and rather bashful.<br>\r\n\u201cW...well, the thing is, u-um...\u201d she stutters a little, \u201ci-it's not like it's my first time, it's\u2026 it's just that\u2026 well, it's been awful long time since I've ever\u2026 done\u2026 that\u2026 so perhaps I'm in need of a little refresher course.\u201d<br>\r\nYou try to comfort her, \u201cDont worry about it. It's not like I can claim MY first time was very\u2026 glamorous, anyways.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Eirin's face just gets even redder, \u201cH-her majesty suggests that we engage in roleplay to help set the mood and spice things up.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cRoleplay?\u201d your eyes beamed with interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face remained red, \u201cShe\u2026 even gave me appropriate wear for this roleplay.\u201d <br>\r\n'FUCK YEAH' screamed the voice in your head off the top of it's lungs! You attempt to make the best poker-face your face could give, but you were breathing HEAVILY!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell! Let's not waste any time!\u201d you say with a hint of excitement in your voice, \u201cAnna's not gonna arguing with your princess for long!\u201d<br>\r\nThe nervous and embarassed doctor lowers her head and sighs, \u201cWait here.\u201d And she walked into the backroom. You sat there waiting a little impatiently for her to come back out, trying hard to contain your excitement. Like they say, 'Sex can be fun if you have fun with sex'! Damned if you know WHO said it, but hey!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart was beating fast. But not as fast as the doc's! You can hear it coming all the way from the backroom. You could overhear her groaning and mumbling. Mostly curses. 'This is fucking stupid.' 'I cant fucking believe I'm actually doing this.' 'I cant believe this fucking thing actually fits.' and such.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-o-ok\u2026 I-I-I'm ready!\u201d you heard her squeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared wide-eyed with absolutely no blinking whatsoever as she nervously stepped out the backroom, looking down at the floor, biting her lip. You could not and would not look away from Eirin as she came now wearing\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Both you and Eirin quickly corner the odd greasy-haired eye-patch wearing gentleman in a sleazy shirtless snakeskin jacket and a tacky pair of leather pants holding a camcorder. He was awful quick to raise his hands in surrender when you pointed your gun at him and Eirin aimed her bow between his eyes (or eye and eye-socket).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHOA WHOA WHOA! HOLD YOUR FIRE!!!\" the sleazeball pleaded, \"I AINT ARMED! I COME IN PEACE AND SHIT!\"<br>\r\nLucky for him, you recognize this fucker real quick. You squint your eyes with disbelief wondering how the hell someone like HIM managed to be here!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G....Goro?! Is that you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah! That's me!\" the sleazy japanese thug said casually, \"it's been a while, Alex-chan! Great to see ya again! Sis says hi!\" Eirin pulled her bowstring back just as he lowered his hands, causing him to raise them right back up!<br>\r\n\"Eirin, it's ok,\" you tell her, \"he's just one of Anna's friends.\"<br>\r\nIt didnt matter to her. \"What may I ask were you doing taking pictures of me and Mr. Whitestone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh,\" Goro scratched his head, \"I wasnt taking pictures. I was trying to film you two fucking, but my finger slipped. Why'd they put the stupid 'snapshot' button so close to pause?\"<br>\r\nEirin clenched her fist and a vein appeared across her forehead.<br>\r\n\"Now wait, wait a minute, doc!\" Goro pleaded to her, \"you have my word, I wasnt plan on making money off this one, I swear. I only filmed you as a favor for little sis!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou squinted your eyes and cringed. \"Yumi? YUMI asked you to do this? Big Yumi? This is the same Yumi we're talking about?\" That innocent incredibly shy tall girl with spectacles that always seem to get so bashful whenever youre around? The polar opposite of her sleazy porn-filming brother?! Someone as awfully innocent as Big Yumi requested to see you in a porno?!<br>\r\n\"Yep,\" he didnt even blink as he gave you that straight answer.<br>\r\nYour mind was blown. You'd never in a million years believe sweet darling Big Yumi would be interested in that kind of thing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I cant honestly believe this,\" you had no luck making sense of this anomaly, \"your sister, YOUR SISTER OF ALL PEOPLE actually wants to get off seeing me fuck an older woman dressed as a schoolgirl?\" Eirin blushed with embarrassment.<br>\r\n\"Well actually she wanted to see you get gang-raped by half a dozen women,\" Goro answered truthfully, \"but this was the best I could get for her.\" YOU'D NEVER IN A BILLION YEARS BELIEVE-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You foul disgusting perverted shit-stain!\" the doc got mad, \"Trespassing on our property is a major offense in itself, but doing so while committing such a vile action you've done is morally outrageous! I should honestly kill you right here!\"<br>\r\n\"Easy, easy,\" you held her back, \"Goro, give me the tape.\"<br>\r\nGoro sighed and plucked the tape from the camera, handing it to you. You handed it to Eirin who glared back at the cameraman as she stuffed it down her sailor shirt. Youre sure he's got plenty of backups. And he'll probably be psyched as hell to use 'em when he finds out what's in store for you at Eientei! ...And so will Big Yumi, apparently. Geez, SERIOUSLY her?! She was too timid to do anything to you when you had to share a pay-shower stall with her that one day!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come inside,\" you order him, trying to best to hide the fact that your mind was still blown.<br>\r\n\"This is not wise,\" Eirin rightfully disagrees, \"after what he's just done here, how could you honestly allow him here?\"<br>\r\n\"He's a good friend and ally of my sister,\" you explain, \"he's trustworthy enough for her. Move it!\"<br>\r\n\"Youre the boss, Alex-chan,\" he replies obediently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so the three of you returned back inside the confines of Dr. Yagokoro's office. Eirin glared at him with absolute distrust the whole time, but she seemed disinterested in destroying that tape she confiscated for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how'd you find us?\" you asked.<br>\r\n\"And how many others are there?\" Eirin questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got a van outside, 'senpai',\" Goro answers which made Eirin grit her teeth, \"Anna told me where you guys were. She told me to come meet her involving a special deal.\"<br>\r\n\"Without even getting our permission?\" the doc continued to question, \"this is a private restricted property. You cant just come and go as you please! And how did you even get through the security? We have traps all over the forest!\"<br>\r\n\"Bribed one of your bunny eared twerps,\" Goro had no problem answering that one, \"word to the wise, doc: Whatever youre paying your 'security' aint nearly enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doc in the schoolgirl outfit growled and stomped around mumbling to herself while you sighed, trying to be the calm yin to Yagokoro-Kohai's yang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what exactly is this deal?\u201d you ask him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could answer, you overhear arguing up the hallway heading right toward the doctor's office. The arguing consists of two particular women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, how about I set you up with a decent drug supplier? I know of a great place that'll hook you up with  all the finest medicine you can find on the planet!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cFor the last time NO! Eientei has PLENTY of medicine! What it DOESNT have is the means to produce heirs!'\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOk, what if I find a couple of guys to screw all your staff?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYour brother is all we need! That's what we agreed to!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBUT-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just then, Kaguya and Anna burst through the door and stop their conversation short and turned your attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEirin, who is this?!\u201d the princess questioned the eye-patched gentleman.<br>\r\n\u201cG-Goro? What are you doing here?\u201d Anna was surprised to see him, \u201cand why the hell is the old hag dressed like an anime schoolgirl?!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOld hag?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI AM TALKING HERE!\u201d Kaguya blurted out, \u201cnow will someone explain to me who he is and what's he doing here?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHe was an old acquaintance of mine,\u201d Anna briefly states.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGoro Majima,\u201d he introduces himself, \u201cRetired 7th Hand Yakuza Captain, now Founder/Chairman/CEO of Sweetest Dreamz Productions. An award-winning film studio that specializes in top quality hollywood-styles movies of the most erotic persuasion!\u201d He has a fancy way of saying he runs a porn studio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMs. Whitestone, why exactly did you invite a porn director to our hospital?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?! I dont know what he's doing here! I never invited him!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, yes you did,\u201d Goro corrected him, \u201cwe made a deal over the phone last night, remember?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cW-wait, I...\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cC'mon, you said clear as day we could shoot a film here if we dropped off crate of um\u2026 'acquired' \u201c he even did the quotations with his fingers, \u201cSummer Court arms. We got 'em in the van.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoo boy...\u201d you muttered silently.<br>\r\n\u201cARE YOU SERIOUS?!\u201d raged Kagura, \u201cyou told a complete stranger he could shoot a porno on MY property without my consent?!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAbsolutely not! He's lying!\u201d Anna denied. Unfortunately\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnna, were you drunk?\u201d you had to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe sounded pissed out of her mind to me,\u201d One-Eye quipped. That was all you needed to know. Honestly, you need to consider installing a breathalyzer for each DOORWAY she's about to step out of!<br>\r\n\u201cI'm sorry, Mr. Majima,\u201d Eirin states, \u201cbut due to safety and security reasons, I'm afraid Eientei does not allow filming of any sort at this time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoro shrugs his arms, \"Hey I understand. It's a tough unforgiving world out there. You gotta keep yourself on your toes and strapped at all times cuz ya never know when youre gonna suddenly need to fight for dear life. ...Ya know, I still got that crate of arms in the van. It'd be an awful waste to send back all that advanced military grade hardware when it could come in good use here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are not interested in any-\" the princess raised her hand, cutting the doctor off.<br>\r\n\"What kind of arms?\" Kaguya asks with sparked curiosity.<br>\r\n\"I'm talking high-tech state of the art 22nd century Israeli-designed special ops weaponry!\" Goro bragged, \"not some cheap, old, rundown, poorly made Chinese crap! If you ever planned on war, nobody would dare touch you when they see you strapped with THESE babies!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your highness!\" the doctor was not liking this, \"please dont consider this! This is not a brothel! And what if... CERTAIN people discover our location from whatever his ilk is filming?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have my word. Sweetest Dreamz keeps all of it's clients strictly confidential!\" Goro assures, \"not to mention, you and your community will be well compensated.\"<br>\r\nKaguya's eyes almost beamed hearing the 'compensated' part.<br>\r\n\"We're got a huge paying fanbase internationally,\" Goro insists, \"I'm talking big profits. Plenty of big bucks in my business... if you get my meaning.\" Judging by the brief flash of dollar signs in Kaguya's eyes, she certainly did, \"So... do we have a deal, your highness?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pondered the generous offer before...</span></div></div>",

Goro might be sleazy sometime but never lied to anyone. It took at least whole hour for everything to get set up and you saw few more of the associates that Goro hired as a helper with video camera, lights, and such. Kaguya sorted out by calling udonge and other Loli bunnies to come into the set. After few moments, Goro bowed to you all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cNow before we do this we must sign a contract, so we shall not be have trouble later.\u201d Goro said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright.\u201d Kaguya replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Goro handed over the paper, Kaguya looked it over and signed the contract.

Goro got the contract and gave it to his associate and put it in the file and put in the case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cNow then, I have three options for you to pick. You all can either gang rape Alex-chan, Alex-chan can bukkake the selected few, or Alex-chan lays as one naked one sits on his face while other fucks wildly.\u201d Goro said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You were very embarrassed bu this and you almost heard Anna muttering \u2018this is nightmare\u2019.

Obviously the first option would be bad for your health. If you pretty much worn yourself out fucking Reisen alone, how well do you think you'll fare with Reisen and everyone else?! The second option... well, it'll be pleasurable for the girls youre going down on, but not so pleasurable for you. The third one sounded much safer AND much more pleasurable!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your face reddened with embarrassment as the eyes of the world were upon you, you coughed, \"...The third one.\" Sure enough, you heard a few 'Awwww's, Anna cursing in another language, and Goro smirking.<br>\r\n\"See, what'd I tell you? Goro knows best!\" he turns about and shrugs his shoulders, \"alright, alls I need is two volunteers to be Alex-chan's partners. Who wants to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ME ME ME ME ME ME!!!\" a certain purple haired bunny girl was more ecstatic to volunteer! She was literally hopping up and down like the wascally wabbit she was! <br>\r\nEirin facepalm with humiliation and Anna shook her head ferociously but it was too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright!\" Goro was simply pleased, \"that's what I love to see! Real authentic enthusiasm!\"<br>\r\n\"Goro I do NOT want that bitch fucking my brother!\" Anna scowled.<br>\r\n\"That's not your decision to make!\" Kaguya snaps at her.<br>\r\n\"B-But your majesty...\" Eirin stutters, \"s-she's already had er... her desired time spent with him. W-wouldnt it be more... fair to have another girl take her place?\"<br>\r\n\"As long as she's seeing to it that her belly is popping out more loyal soldiers, I see no problem with it,\" the princess exclaims, \"and Mr. Majima, there WILL be absolute anonymity, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Goro answers, \"you have my word. Their eyes will be blacked out in post, NOBODY will be able to identify them! Now we just need one more volunteer.\"<br>\r\n\"I have a former colleague who'll be happy to join in,\" Reisen offers, \"I'll go bring her over.\"<br>\r\n\"Awesome,\" Sleazy Mashima approves, \"here's your script youre gonna be using. And here's one more for her. Study it carefully, add-lib if you feel you need to, but make sure you dont go off-script too much.\"<br>\r\n\"Yes sir, Mashima-sama!\" Reisen politely bowed while her voice still beamed with excitement, \"you have my word we will not let you down!\"<br>\r\n\"God I wish I had such devoted hard workers like you!\" Eyepatch commented, \"dont forget your script too, Alex-chan.\" You exhaled hard as you took your script, feeling the heat emitting from Anna's cold glare of death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look forward to working with you, Alex-sama!\" Reisen smiled your way just before giving you a kiss on the cheek. Anna's cold glare only amplified as the happy naive bunny girl hopped off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...............<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaaand ACTION!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe movie was basically similar to reality. Youre an ex-mafioso trying to run from the mob who's currently hunting you down! Quite a bit of glaring differences, though. No sister or associates to bail you out. You were on your own. After several hours of running (cut to about a minute or two to save movie time), you think you lost their trail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gasped heavily, nearly out of breath, ready to collapse at any moment. You dare not, cuz you know Hokou will stop at nothing to hunt you down. He'll hunt you down long after he dies. He'll have your head mounted on his GRANDKIDS' wall if need be! You'll never sleep again. His men will be waiting for you in your dreams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerrified and paranoid, you keep looking over your shoulder. No men in sight. As you caught your breath, you observe the new surrounding. This wasnt the woods anymore. Youre in the middle of a bamboo forest! A completely different setting from just moments ago! How far did you keep running?<br>\r\n\"W...where am I?\" you panted looking around every direction. You walk a little bit and come so close to touching trip wire!<br>\r\n\"?!\" you gasped looking down at the wire so close to your foot and slowly and carefully back away.<br>\r\n\"Aw jeez!\" one footstep too many collapse the grass below you revealing a pot hole! You come EVER so close to falling in it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou back away from the hole and take a few more steps...<br>\r\n...and you jump out of the way of a swinging log trap (well, swinging bamboo trap), narrowly avoiding it's carefully carved jagged edge!<br>\r\n\"Whoa,\" you muttered, almost seeing your life flash before your eyes. It was then you noticed the warnings painted on several of the bamboo trees. Most of it was written in kanji and you couldnt read them, but the painted red Xs and skulls with bunny ears gave away that you were in restricted territory!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get the feeling whoever's here doesnt like visitors,\" you say the memorized scripted quip. Nonetheless, there didnt seem to be turning back at this point. And even if there was, there's probably a shit ton more traps along the way!<br>\r\nAs you walked, you felt like you were being watched. You saw movement in the shadows, you heard distant breathing, and you think you spotted pairs of red eyes that glowed in the darkness! Nevertheless, you trekked and trekked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YIPE!\"<br>\r\nUntil an incredibly strong force yanked you out of nowhere! Perhaps a bit too hard, cuz you almost suffered whiplash! Next your arm was twisted behind your back and a kabar was pointed at your adam's apple!<br>\r\nYou froze up as your captor, a purple-haired bunny-eared woman in military camo with a garb covering her mouth pressed up against you aggressively! Good news is she didnt seem to be one of Hokuo's hired assassins. Bad news is she isnt any less threatening!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" your bunny-eared captor questioned, \"identify yourself!\"<br>\r\n\"A-a-Alex!\" you obediently answer, \"Alex Whitestone!\"<br>\r\n\"Your name's not recognized,\" she speaks, \"state your business here.\"<br>\r\n\"N-n-none!\" you say, \"I-I-I was just passing by-EEP!\" She pressed the kabar even closer to your throat! Youre getting the feeling that knife might not be fake!<br>\r\n\"State your business here!\" she repeats.<br>\r\n\"None!\" you repeat, \"I had no intention of coming here! I was trying to get away!\"<br>\r\n\"FROM WHO?\" Reisen asks.<br>\r\n\"A couple of mobsters. I didnt mean to come here! I'll kindly get as far away from here as possible!\"<br>\r\n\"It's not possible now,\" she warns, \"youre smack dab in the middle of our territory and there's kilometers of traps as far as the eye can see.\" She then squints her eyes, \"Awfully convenient you just ran through all of them like they were nothing...\"<br>\r\n\"P-please dont hurt me! I mean no harm! I never meant to trespass, I just-...uh, Reisen is that knife real?\"<br>\r\n\"How many others are with you?\" Reisen ignored your question and asked her own.<br>\r\n\"None,\" you swallow and answer, \"I came here alone.\"<br>\r\n\"...Alone, huh?\" Reisen's voice had a hint of intrigue in it, \"...that's too bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ui! We got ourselves a trespasser over here all by his lonesome!\" she called over another figured that popped out of the bushes. A pink-haired bunny eared bucktooth woman in similar military camo with similar red eyes. She stalked toward you pointing a 1911 that for all you knew had real live ammo in it!<br>\r\n\"Pat him down,\" Reisen orders Ui.<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am,\" Ui pats down your chest, then works her way down your legs, then searches your pockets, then sticks her hands down your pants and you bite your lip from the caressing you were getting there...<br>\r\n\"He's unarmed,\" Ui confirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OWW!\" Reisen then knocked you flat on the ground with a tremendous kick. Youre pretty sure that wasnt scripted, cuz that fucking hurt! You were just about to pick yourself up, then you felt the 1911 pressing the back of your head!<br>\r\n\"Turn around,\" you heard Reisen ordered, \"turn around!\"<br>\r\nYou rolled over, facing the two armed bunny girls gazing down at you hostilely.  You dare not move as then leaned down at you, red glowing eyes gazing into your soul and Ui's 1911 still aimed at your brain.<br>\r\n\"Wh-\" you coughed, \"what do you want from m-\"<br>\r\n\"Shut up!\" Ui ordered, tapping your head with her gun! Reisen merely stared quietly with interest. Her eyes lingered downward toward your lower section.. and breathed a bit heavier than usual. No doubt she was getting anxious for THAT part to happen!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNonetheless, she kept her cool and did as scripted. Paced around you in silence, whipped out a cigarette, took a quick drag, blew it the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What should we do, ma'am?\" Ui breaks the silence, \"do you want me to call up the others?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReisen stared almost longingly at you before plucking the cigarette out of her mouth and saying...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Both Kaguya and Eirin seemed to be in a big deep discussion with one another to even acknowledge you while you placed two plates full of chicken, dumplings and egg rolls on their sides of the table. They dont say thank or even look your way when you give them their food, but you brush it off as whatever theyre talking about was important. You'd soon find out that it IS important, cuz you eavesdropped on their conversation!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Princess! Think about what youre doing! These girls arent prostitutes! We cant sully Eientei's grace honor by letting a pornogrphic film industry make their perverted movies here!\"<br>\r\n\"Do you think I dont feel any shame whatsoever?! Do you not think I'm just as disgusted as you are if not moreso?! However, if this gives actually gives us a greater fighting chance to liberate my family and my people from Junko's grasp, I will gladly swallow my pride!\"<br>\r\n\"Do you know the kind of damage and destruction that'll happen if Junko even THINKS youre trying to wage war with her?!\"<br>\r\n\"All I know is just kneeling to her and kissing her feet is only getting more and more expensive for my father. Pretty soon the 'protection' money will become so unaffordable that we'll have to make particular 'sacrifices'. At least this way, we'll have future soldiers AND the proper weapons to arm them!\"<br>\r\n\"But we arent ready to make such a move! And besides, what if Alex decides he doesnt want to go through with this? What if sooner or later he decides he wants to settle down and find a significant other?\"<br>\r\n\"He'll have SEVERAL significant others! The rabbits will be his partners! Each one of them will be his friend, girlfriend, wife, and lover! That's all he needs!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were not liking this discussion nor were you feeling up for getting caught in such a discussion. How should you be feeling about this predicament? Giddy that you got yourself a bunny-girl harem? Demeaned and degraded that youre reduced to being a breeding stallion for bunny-girls?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of, you set down plates of food for the other moon rabbits sitting at tables. Many of them were grateful. Very grateful. Many smiled your way. Some gave you kisses. A few of them smacked you on the ass. One of them invited you to sit with her and was not willing to take no for an answer. She had quite a strong grip too, but fortunately you managed to break away!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting your molestation quota fulfilled, you felt it was time to break away from everybody else for a while until the heat dies down. You stand somewhere in the middle of the hallway and finish your meal in peace. The brief moment of peace gave you the opportunity to appreciate Mao's fine cuisine. You were never much of a fan of Chinese food to begin with. But with the fresh ingredients she uses, the way she prepares the food, apply the perfect flavorful seasons, it tastes perfectly authentic. You might actually go as far as to say you LIKE her food! It sure aint Marcus's gourmet hood food, but it does have it's own charm to it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, the moment ended as soon as a large shadow casts over you. A shadow in the shape of a nurse with bunny ears. Oh dear, Eientei's got some girls that really love their Wheaties, eh?<br>\r\nTrying to play cool and not seem the least bit intimidated, you slowly turn to face the tall nurse and almost bump your head on her elegant breasts!.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBacking away from her chest, you lift your head upward to properly face the slender 6ish foot tall black haired nurse in spectacles who gazed down at you with a nervous smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHm\u2026 this nurse certainly looks familiar. And those bunny ears dont seem to be looking very\u2026 eh\u2026 'natural' like all the other bunny girls' you've seen!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cG-Good afternoon, Mr. Whitestone!\u201d she bowed politely, \u201cit's\u2026 time for your physical examination!\u201d Youre pretty sure that's Eirin's job. <br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026 I believe Dr. Yagokoro is doing my physical.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cShe's going to be a little busy later,\u201d Nurse Miyu quickly replies, \u201cdont worry, Mr. Whitestone! You'll be safe and sound in my care!\u201d That's not what you were worried about.<br>\r\nNot that it matters cuz she already grabbed your hand and dragged you off with her! Your still tilting your head, trying to properly recognize the tall bunny girl with the not-so-authentic bunny ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 um\u2026 have we met before?\u201d you ask as you eye her nametag suspiciously. Nurse MIYU, eh? \u201cYou look familiar.\u201d<br>\r\n'Miyu' tilted her head, \u201cErr\u2026 well, we couldve cross each others' paths once or twice since you first came here. It's statistically possible.\u201d Hmph. A really tall bunny girl like would definitely stick out in your head! ...But youre quite sure you seen a particular girl her size and figure without those bunny ears.<br>\r\n\u201cI think it's been more than that,\u201d you remark, \u201chavent I seen you on tv once?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNope\u2026 stupid producers dont wanna come near me after they found out who I'm related to\u2026.?!!\u201d her slightly depressed tone quickly turned to shock as if realizing she just said something she shouldnt, \u201c...er\u2026 th-that is\u2026 c-c-cuz big sis is kindof a hardass and way way too protective of me!\u201d<br>\r\nShe carefully adjusted her glasses as she finished up that lie. Just like that one girl you knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...YUMI?! Big Yumi?! Is this nurse really Goro's sis, Yumi?! SHE'S here too?! How'd she get here?! Does Goro even know she's here?! Most likely not if she's trying to pass herself off as a bunny girl nurse which she's neither (except maybe on tv). Honestly, she'd probably be more convincing passing herself off as an oni instead, but then the image of her chugging down a whole bottle of sake as alcohol drips from her lips and down her sleek slender tiger-striped bikini-clad body left you feeling a bit flustered! Kinda thirsty too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere. It's just beyond that door,\u201d Yumi says escorting you through the door.<br>\r\nWhich by the way was not the door to an infirmary room. It was to somebody's bedroom. And by the time you noticed that, Yumi had already turned to lock the door. And by the time she did that, you noticed a little raffle ticket hanging out of her dress pockets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, Mr. Whitestone,\u201d she turned back to you and smiled, \u201cif you could kindly take off your clothes and lie down on that bed over there, we can begin the examination!\u201d</span></div></div>",

She turned to your attention and asked to do what she said earlier and you did. You took off you shirt and your jeans, and laid back on the bed. Miyu then started to examine your body by pressing your chests to your theighs. You felt uneasy as if this Miyu person were actually big Yumi after all. After few minutes of physical contacts she told you to get up slowly and look at her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cMy greatness..haven\u2019t seen you in a while..\u201d Miyu murmured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWhat?\u201d You spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cUm, nothing! Now I want to see you breath in and out.\u201d Miyu replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You just nodded and did what she did as she put the the doctors stuff on your back you breathed in and out. She nodded and when she puts it away she pressed her chest on your back. You felt the marshmallowy feelings on your back and before you could say anything you two heated the knocking noise again.

Miyu sneered with annoyance as soon as the both of you heard that familiar high pitch wailing of little Tewi! You could sworn your tall nurse mutter 'It just had to be THAT twerp!'. Seems like she already had the pleasure of introducing herself to her.<br>\r\nNevertheless, Miyu attempted to keep her facade, er, remain CIVIL, \"Excuse me, but we're in the middle of an exa-\"<br>\r\nBut that sneer of hers immediately vanished without a trace as soon as she saw Tewi's companion and your old friend and sleep-rapist Reisen, who appeared to be staring coldly at your rather tall non-rapist (yet) companion!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being significally taller, Big Miyu seemed to have quite a bit of trouble keeping a straight face toward Reisen as the mentally ill bunny girl locked eyes with her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An exam? Cool! Let me help! Alex, tilt your head and cough!\" the little brat quickly rushed over to check THAT part of you.. with her mouth! Unfortunately, Miyu was quick to leap in and block her, denying you of potential loli-oral!<br>\r\n\"That's... really unnecessary!\" Miyu assured her, \"like, REALLY unnecessary! I can handle Mr. Whitestone's exam myself.\"<br>\r\n\"Isnt that supposed to be master's job?\" Reisen finally spoke, only to question your old pal incognito.<br>\r\nAgain, 'Miyu' got a bit nervous from Reisen's icy cold stare of death, \"W-well... s-she's very busy at the moment... you know, with trying to talk Kagu-the Princess out of having him properly siring all our children!\" That wasnt a lie, yet she somehow successfully make it sound like it was!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd still detecting something was off about her, Reisen slowly approached her, squinting her eyes. Miyu attempted to back away, only to end up backing into you, forcing you to back into a wall and leaving you pressed between a wall and the back of six and a half feet of elegant nice smelling faux bunny-maiden. Being caught in such an intimate position left you feeling even more flustered! You werent sure whether to be worried she was gonna crush you or infatuated that youre being pressed so close against her! If Reisen and Tewi werent here AND you werent such a prude, you'd have probably wrapped your armed around her tall slender body and squeezed until you somehow manage to fuse your skin into hers!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you slightly blissed out, she was feeling the heat from Reisen's suspicious stare!<br>\r\n\"*Sniff! Sniff!*\" Reisen even SNIFFED her, \"Hm... I dont recognize your scent. Are you not from around here?\"<br>\r\n\"N-n-no!\" Miyu shivered as you thoroughly felt each ripple and vibe coursing from her body, \"I-I-I'm sorta new!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's a temp straight from the Lunar Defense Corps,\" Tewi was previously informed, \"speaking of which, how's little Reisen doing? She learned how to fire a gun PROPERLY yet?\"<br>\r\n\"She's... getting better,\" Miyu answers while looking down nervously at the Reisen in front of her, \"o-of course, I highly doubt she can handle a weapon half as good as THIS Reisen... uh... Uda... Uda guda...?\"<br>\r\n\"Udongein Inaba,\" Reisen corrected her.<br>\r\n\"*Gulp! Right, Udongein Inaba! And wow, they were right! You are FAR more gorgeous in person than all those propaganda pictures depict you!\"<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...\" Reisen just glared suspiciously, unaffected by her flattery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooo! Someone's got the hots for you, girl!\" Tewi nudged Reisen's side, \"I'd take that big girl if I were you! Plenty of her to wrap your arms around at night AND she'll give you loads of shade on a hot sunny day!\"<br>\r\n\"Tewi, I swear to god,\" the purple haired bunny girl gritted her teeth and the little black haired bunny girl while the big black haired phony bunny girl bit her lip, hoping to finally get some breathing space!<br>\r\n\"Aw c'mon! You two would make a really cute couple!\" the little brat exclaims, \"dont you think, Al?\" She's asking YOU? But it does beg a question.<br>\r\nYou finally squeeze yourself out from behind your tall companion and ask, \"Er... Yumi, do you swing that way?\"<br>\r\n\"Absolutely not! My heart only belongs to-\" Miyu cuts herself, \".....um, wait, who is this 'Yumi' person, Alex? I told you already, my name is MIYU.\"<br>\r\n\"Tsk! Please!\" Tewi snickers, \"if I had a yen coin for every time I heard a girl say she didnt swing that way right before eating cooch, I'd never need to borrow money ever again!\" Geez! Can she possibly make an already awkward situation any more awkward?! \"Even Rei-Rei here's got a thing for a certain cute undead gardener down at Hakugyokurou!\"<br>\r\n\"TEWI!!\" Reisen screamed, but blushed.<br>\r\n\"Dont get all tsundere on me! Everybody on the planet knows you like Youmu! Heck, Miyu probably already knew, didnt you?\"<br>\r\nMiyu didnt say a damn thing when Reisen turned her head back to her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heeeyy...\" the little brat then sparked an idea, \"your morning shift's about to start soon, aint it? You know, tons of boxes you gotta haul and carry around place to place, kinda rough on your back, aint it?\"<br>\r\n\"Just what are you getting at?\" Reisen questions her.<br>\r\n\"Aint it obvious? Wont the job be done twice as fast and half as painful if you had a nice big hawt vixen like Big Miyu here helping you out?\"<br>\r\n\"...M...ME?!\" Miyu blurted with surprise, \"...b...but I.. I still have to do Mr. Whitestone's physical!\"<br>\r\n\"Dont worry, Alex, can tag along!\" the twerp smirked, \"that way you can both get your thorough hands-on up and down exam on him while trying to resist the urge to get lost in eachother's eyes!\" ...HEY WAIT A SEC!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!!\" you finally blurted out, feeling a little left out, \"dont I get a say in this?!\"<br>\r\n\"Not really, stud!\" Tewi gives it to you straight, \"if these two love-birds in the making wanna double-team ya, theyre gonna!\" Again, youre having a hard time trying to figure out what youre supposed to be feeling! Offended that theyre not letting YOU give your opinion... as well as offended if (and that's a huge IF) Miyu and Reisen end up falling for EACHOTHER, youre just gonna be the side-trick between them?! Intrigued that you'd get a chance to be intimate with both Reisen AND possibly Big Yumi herself? Terrified that Anna's gonna go ballistic while Goro's probably wanna film it (seriously dude, that's your SISTER!! ...Possibly)?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, both Reisen and Miyu seemed to be ignoring your plight as the two of them stared at each other thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...THEN they both stared at you.... thinking. Uncomfortable stares. You felt ashamed of yourself for not having the guts to stand up for yourself and actually speak out. But that's what happens.<br>\r\nSo after a long uncomfortable moment of staring at you, they both decide...</span></div></div>",

Internally, I can hear just fine out of them but externally,\u201d she pinches her ears, \u201c...nothing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Reisen was giving her that cold stare of suspicion. She knew something was off about 'Miyu'. But does she suspect that she might not be a fellow rabbit?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearing the worst, you can only stand aside and wait, hoping Yumi's facade was still holding strong. But Reisen's got quite the eye\u2026 does she know? Has she figured it out? Is Big Yumi's cover blown?!</span></div></div>",

Miyu, or Yumi were now busted and was in deep trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cSo you were trying to sneaking into our facility, eh MIYU?\u201d Reisen said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI..I just..Ah...\u201d Yumi spoke distraughtly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You knew this won\u2019t end well as you stepped in, you saw Reisen point her finger at Yumi, making a bullet at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWho are you? How dare you infiltrate and impersonate one of lunarian rabbits to touch Alex Sama.\u201d Reisen said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cReisen, stop! She did no harm to both of us! Put down your weapon!\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Reisen looked at you for moment and then put the bullet away.

We need this delivery fast.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n You and Yumi nodded and got the crate and went to The ravine quickly. In the air, one robotic female flew looking at the three and fle toward the ravines. As time went on, you three got out of the forest and and it took at least 2 hours for you three to get to where Nitori were at, and once you\u2019ve got there, you saw a house that had waterwheel on the side. Once you three got to the front, Reisen knocked the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cNitori? Are you in there?\u201d Reisen said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n There were silence for moment then the door opened, revealing a blue haired girl in sweat shirt and half T-shirt on top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cAh, Reisen. You\u2019ve came! And they\u2019re..?\u201d Nitori spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cHe is Alex Whitestone, my client. And she\u2019s...well...my helper.\u201d Reisen answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cHuh? But I never seen you take humans as helpers? But oh well...come in, I\u2019m waiting for someone to come back as well.\u201d Nitori replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You wondered who it was until you felt a gust against you. You looked and you saw a robotic woman in green long hair and red eyes and had army uniform on it. You didn\u2019t know who she was then the robot puts the robotic wings away and looked at the them and noticed you and came to you. She stopped infront of you and you were little nervous about it then she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cClient Alex Whitestone, ready to take arm for you.\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWhat?\u201d You spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cShe\u2019s X-200, a highly advanced technological robotic operating bodyguard commissioned by your sis.\u201d Nitori said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You couldn\u2019t believe what you were hearing this.

Primarily because Reisen suddenly grabbed Yumi's arm and despite being towered over by her, the bunny girl's icy cold glare had no difficulty melting this tower of a woman!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WE are not done yet,\" Reisen warned Yumi who was looking back down at her, failing to hide the timid look behind her glasses. Reisen pointed to her a chair and ordered, \"Sit down.\"<br>\r\nBig Yumi sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe silent moment in the room quickly became a hundred times more awkward. The real bunny girl glared coldly at the fake bunny girl, crossing her arms, and waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W...well what?\" Yumi stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know the answer to that!\" Reisen snapped, \"dont play dumb!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour old friend could only glance back with the most timid of expressions, \"I...I'm sorry. I dont know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urgghhh,\" Reisen groaned and rolled her eyes, \"WHO put you up to this?! WHO hired you to spy on us?! How many others came with you?!\"<br>\r\n\"N-N-No one came with me!\" Yumi pleaded, \"nobody hired me to do anything-\"<br>\r\n\"LIAR!! START TALKING OR I'M GONNA RIP YOUR REAL EARS OFF!\"<br>\r\n\"That's the truth! I'm not a spy!! I swear my reasons for sneaking over are strictly for selfish ones!!\" Yumi actually said that out loud!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNonetheless, it was necessary for you stepped in. Not just to avoid a drastic situation for Yumi, but considering youre a close friend and she's the brother of your sister's acquaintance,  this situation wont look good for you and Anna if you dont curve the escalation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reisen?\" you stepped in and turned to Yumi, \"Yumi does your brother know you snuck here?\"<br>\r\n\"Of course not, Goro's never interested unless some big shot Hollyw-\" her eyes widened and put both hands to her mouth. She immediately let the cat out of the bag and blew her cover. Not that it was much of a surprise to you. To REISEN, however...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU KNOW THIS GIRL?!\" she turns her suspicion on you.<br>\r\nYou sighed, \"Yes. She's Goro's little sister.\u201d And you use the term 'little' loosely.<br>\r\n\u201cSo you already knew who she was and you didnt tell anybody?\u201d Reisen raised a damn good question that you didnt have the answer too. Which made her even MORE suspicious, \u201c...Are you two in on a scheme?!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo, he wasnt involved with me!\u201d Yumi spoke up for you, but blushed a bit, \u201cW\u2026 when Alex fled his old boss, everybody told me he was dead. Then when I heard he was alive, I took the time to find out where he was hiding and\u2026 I kinda snuck here to find out myself if it was true. I just wanted to make sure you were alright.\u201d Aww.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did you manage to find me?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n\u201cI bribed a couple of my bro's associates,\u201d Yumi answered, \u201cmy newest role in an upcoming movie really paid well, so I went on a bit of a spending craze. Paid off bro's goons, paid off some of your sis's goons, paid off some of YOUR goons,\u201d she looks over to Reisen, \u201cthat pretty much sums it up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you aware that espionage is a capital offense according to Lunarian law?\u201d Reisen warned her, \u201cone punishable by swift execution?\u201d That got the big girl's undivided attention!<br>\r\n\u201cNo! No no no no NO!\u201d Yumi constantly shook her head, \u201cHonest to god, I wasnt trying to commit espionage! I was only hoping to make sure Alex is doing alright! That's all!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell I'm afraid Alex-sama is no longer your concern,\u201d Reisen boldly states, still referring to you by her special nickname, \u201cwhatever you had or hope to have with him no longer applies anymore. He already has a special commitment with the workers and patients of Eientei.\u201d Not to mention, Reisen may or may not currently be carrying your child. You dare not say that out loud, however. You could only imagine the outrageous bloody catfight that would occur when Yumi finds out HOW that occurred!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut even being blissfully unaware of that, Yumi started to get cross with the bunny girl.<br>\r\n\u201cAlex, are you seriously ok with this?\u201d Yumi questioned, \u201cI mean, I'm not trying to tell you what's best for you, but THAT kind of thing\u2026 well, I've heard a lot of real scary stories involved in those kind of relationships. This is practically human trafficking, aint it?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAs I said, that's not your concern,\u201d Reisen spoke before you could have the chance to, \u201cthose are the princess's orders and as long as he's staying under her roof, what she says goes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEven if it means losing the opportunity to start something with Youmu?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReisen's eyes twitched from Yumi's reply. Again, she's hitting a nerve!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you really call what ALEX is going through a proper 'relationship'?\u201d Yumi continued, \u201chow would you feel if Youmu had to go through the same thing he is?! How would you feel if HER boss decided that in order for her to live under her roof, she'd be whoring HER out to a hundred or so of her associates?! You wanna imagine HER being passed around the way you and your buddies wanna pass HIM around?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI THOUGHT I TOLD YOU TO STOP TALKING!\u201d Reisen got fierce.<br>\r\nBut Yumi for some reason couldnt stop herself.<br>\r\n\u201cHey! I've got an idea,\u201d she continued, \u201cI wonder if darling Youmu would like to star in one of my brother's movies? You wouldnt mind if I ask her, would you?!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI'm warning you, 'MIYU',\u201d Reisen warned through her gritted teeth, \u201cdrop this now or-\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOr what?!\u201d Yumi cut her off, \u201cwhat's the problem? I thought you said 'Alex-sama' was the only partner you need to concern yourself with! Why should it matter whether she decides to take the offer and became a famous movie star? Surely, you dont still have feelings for her, do you?\u201d<br>\r\nReisen clenched her fists. Her top was about to blow. Yumi was clearly hitting a very very sensative nerve. But still she wasnt backing down. She probably should though, cuz that bunny girl looked to be inches away from uppercutting your friend into the stratosphere! You'd certainly never forgive her if she does that, but as she already proved, she has a bad habit of not thinking before she acts!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk guys! A quick update I need to report!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPraise be to Yevon, Nitori cut in and put the life-threatening conflict to a halt! Both Yumi and Reisen turned their attention to her, ready to hear her update, unaware that you let out a hard exhale of relief!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Very well,\" in no time at all, X-200 zipped right up to Big Yumi and did a quick scan on her, \"Destination of Origin: Dotonbori. Osaka, Japan. Initializing fastest route...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-WAIT!!\" you tried to stop her, \"you dont need to do that! Yumi's no threat to me whatsoever! Trust me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She infiltrated our establishment and passed herself off as lunarian rabbit nurse,\" Reisen stated, \"a tremendous criminal offense.\"<br>\r\n\"But she's no criminal or a threat!\" you plead, \"I know her pretty well! She wouldnt be doing anything like that! She-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright, Alex,\" unfortunately, it was Big Yumi herself that had to cut you off, \"what I did was really reckless and dangerous. If I have to leave, I'll leave.\"<br>\r\n\"BUT YUMI-\"<br>\r\n\"At the very least, I'm glad I finally got to see you again,\" Big Yumi smiled down at you, \"I'm really happy to see youre alright.\" While you were trying to hold it back outside, inside you were breaking apart! You mustve really missed Yumi that much! Now was a very opportune time to deeply regret taking advantage of all those slight skiddish advances she made on you! Hell, you had to share a freaking shower stall together while on the road cuz Goro was too cheap to pay for two! Curse you for not scaling that lovely tower of a woman when you had the chance!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd right on cue with your fit of regret, X-200 announced, \"Fastest route initialization complete. Preparing for teleportation...\"<br>\r\nYumi then turned her direction to the REAL bunny girl that wants her gone, and bowed politely, \"I'm sorry to be burden on you, Ms. Udongein Inaba. I never meant to cause you or any of the others trouble. It was all just to confirm an old friend of mine was doing ok.\"<br>\r\nReisen curled her lip but gave a simple nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was great seeing you again, Yumi,\" because you just couldnt help yourself, you rushed over to Big Yumi and gave her a great big hug, briefly blissing out on the one major thing you missed: nuzzling your head against her soft warm pillowy breasts!<br>\r\nAnd her soft warm pillowy breasts squeezed your face right back as she wrapped her arms around you and returned the hug. For the brief period, being in Big Yumi's embrace was one of the few things in the universe that could completely take your mind off of all the hardships you were facing... for that brief period, all that surged in your mind was the ambience that Big Yumi's hug offers you. If Heaven truly does exist, you hoped it would equate to being smothered in Big Yumi's embrace for all eternity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, it didnt take long before both the feeling of her hug and the ambience from it vanished. By the time you snapped of it, she and X-200 were gone. You deeply miss her already. With her gone, the rest of the world just seemed so depressing. You came down with a bad case of 'The Road Not Taken' syndrome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She was an old girlfriend of yours?\" Reisen asked, breaking the cold depressing silence.<br>\r\nYou shrugged your arms, unsure how to answer that, \"I... dont know. She was a real close friend. One of the very few associates of my sister I could actually trust... well, technically she's the sister of an associate, but still. Reisen, please dont tell anybody about her deception. She really didnt mean any ill will to you and the others.\"<br>\r\nReisen exhaled, almost sadly, \"What she did was unacceptable... but I cant blame her for what she did. I'd probably have done the same if I had the opportunity.\" Hm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Transfer complete,\" suddenly X-200 reappears. Sadly, ONLY X-200. \"Yumi Majima has successfully been returned home.\" Road Not Taken Syndrome continues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, X-200,\" Reisen thanks her, \"let's continue our deliveries.\" The wheels in your head began to turn.<br>\r\n\"Hang on,\" you stopped her, \"X-200? Can you find the fastest route to Hakugyokurou?\"<br>\r\nReisen double-taked.<br>\r\n\"Certainly, client Whitestone. Initializing fastest route.\"<br>\r\n\"Alex-sama, that's not one of our stops.\"<br>\r\n\"I know,\" you stated, \"but maybe we can take a little break and pay a visit to that gardener?\" Her eyes widened as you continued, \"X-200 can get us there in a heartbreak, so it's not like we'll be wasting a lot of time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er... but... I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fastest route initialization complete. Do you wish to teleport now?\" X-200 asks. That wasnt a question YOU were gonna answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reisen?\" you turn back to her, \"you wanna go see Youmu again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReisen raised a finger and opened her mouth about to sharply turn the offer down... but nothing came out of that mouth of hers. Her eyes glanced about, possibly hesitant to say no. Her finger lowered as she glanced down at the ground, most likely STILL mulling over the opportunity you were giving her.<br>\r\nWith a quick huff, she closed her eyes and answers...</span></div></div>",

She leapt toward you and attacked you as x-200 guarded you and took out a shotgun and shot at her fast. She dodged fast and tried to attack you firther until reisen interrupted the fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cYoumu! It\u2019s me, reisen!\u201d Reisen said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201c...reisen? Is that you!? I haven\u2019t seen you for while!\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She put the katana away and hugged reisen and the bunny hugged her back.

As you got into the living room and waited, reisen followed Youmu to help out the as X-200 just sat next to you closing her eyes.

You told her you three were not going to be staying that long but she insisted staying and left the scene. As you waited, reisen were next to you and X-200 we\u2019re behind you waiting for order, Yuyuko were just sitting quietly with fan on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cSo why did you come to hakugyokuryo?\u201d Yuyuko asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cFor a little detour, and maybe reisen could see Youmu for moment.\u201d You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cTrue.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Youmu came out with plates of round, doughy, colorful dumplings on sticks coated with a sticky brownish glaze. No surprise, you were the only one in the room and quite possibly the entire building confused by the unfamiliar exotic delicacy she was bringing it. What shouldve surprised you more was the fact that one plate of glazed dumpling-sticks was for you, Reisen, and Youmu while the other plate full was strictly reserved for Yuyuko alone!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay! Dango!!\" Yuyuko said with delight and quickly swiped a kebob of them off the plate before Youmu could even set it down!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Youmu!\" Reisen presented her gratitude to her crush before taking a kebob and biting off a piece. You, still being clearly confused by the exotic dish, stared at the kebob in your acts questionably.<br>\r\n\"Um, what are these?\" you asked.<br>\r\n\"Theyre dango,\" said Reisen's crush, \"sweet rice dumplings. An old acquaintance of Reisen taught me the recipe when she came by a while ago.\" Reisen almost choked on her dango and jerked her head over to Youmu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Acquaintance?!\" you noticed a worried expression on her face as she asked that question.<br>\r\n\"Yes, uh... Ringo, I believe her name was,\" Youmu reminisced, \"is she a friend of yours? Er, blonde hair? Kinda chubby? Usually wears her bunny ears down?\"<br>\r\nYou eyed Reisen closely as she stared off into space silently, still giving that worried expression.<br>\r\n\"N-no, cant say I remember any Ringo,\" she clearly lied, \"is... is she around, nearby?\"<br>\r\n\"No, she already left to the moon capital,\" Youmu didnt pick up on Reisen's lie, \"dont know when we'll be seeing her again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You missed out, too!\" Yuyuko added as she scarfed a whole kebob down... including the stick! \"she had a whole suitcase full of these things! Each one more tastier than the last!\"<br>\r\nReisen seemed relieved that this Ringo person was gone. Not that you were gonna pry. Instead, you took a bit out of one of the dumplings yourself. The taste... was interesting. Very doughy. A little more tangy than sweet. The dumpling itself didnt have much taste despite the doughy texture. It was mostly the tangy glaze you were tasting that overpowered whatever sweet flavor the dango itself had. Suffice to say, it wasnt unpleasant, but you've tasted better. Still, you ate what was given to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasnt that you werent used to eating exotic foods. You've had plenty when you were staying at Big Yumi's place. Guess dango wasnt one of the foods you ever had over there. You had rice balls and pockys. You loved pockys. You could sure go for some right now! ...Aw dang it, as soon as you start missing pockys, you start missing Yumi again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm sorry, did you want one as well?\" Youmu offered X-200.<br>\r\n\"I am not programmed to eat,\" was her expected answer.<br>\r\n\"Oh... alright,\" Youmu didnt seem to understand what she meant, but she accepted the answer. You dont remember much of what else happened after that. Reisen and Youmu were chatting with eachother and Yuyuko was finishing her plate and then asking if you were gonna eat the rest of yours. Then you just tuned everything out and just stared over at Reisen and Youmu talking. You werent listening to their conversation, but you were staring and noticing how bright eyed Reisen was while she was chatting it up with her crush. Envy washed over you as you thought about Yumi and kept asking yourself what if. What if.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater on, Yuyuko invited you and Reisen to their private hot spring bath(not X-200 for obvious reason!). Earlier, Reisen wouldve refused sighting that she and you didnt have enough free time, but now that she's gotten so used to being reunited with her crush, she eagerly accepts and shares a bath with her! Fortunately, the hot spring was divided in half by fence for both men and women to enjoy at the same time. UNfortunately, you were the only man at the moment so it was very lonely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hot spring water was nice and warm to counter the awful cold weather, not to mention it really put your aching muscles to ease, but it still didnt make you feel even a tiny bit better about having to say goodbye to Yumi! Quickly you were regretting suggesting that Reisen paid her crush a visit! You were happy for her that she got to spend some time with her girl, but you didnt think you were actually gonna be JEALOUS!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm getting too overwhelmed,' you think to yourself, 'I'm just not thinking straight. I need to clear my head.' You lie back in the spring water and immerse yourself in it's pleasant soothing warmth and attempt to clear that troubled mind of yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reisen, I am so so glad you finally had free time to come visit!\"<br>\r\nBut you couldnt do that, cuz you could overhear Youmu coming from the other side of the fence!<br>\r\n\"It, it wasnt any trouble, Youmu! Really! Hakugyokuryo just... happened to be on our way and... well it seemed like forever since I last got to see you, so...\" you could overhear Reisen's bashful responses, too!<br>\r\n\"Still, I hope you dont get in any trouble for this! I'm sorry if you get yelled at later!\"<br>\r\n\"Dont worry... it wouldnt be the worst thing I've done.... *gulp*... recently.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ran your hands through your hair and gritted your teeth. You just wanted some peace and quiet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still... I really appreciate you coming down here to visit. I really miss seeing you.\"<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah... m-me too, Youmu.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groaned hard and TRY to tune them out. But you dont try very hard. Especially after they bring you up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never seen that guy with you before... um, Alex, was it?\"<br>\r\n\"Y-yes. Alex-sa-um, Alex is the brother of Eientei's newest client... and er... our new... *gulp*... employee... so to speak.\" 'Employee'? Youre their breeding stud!<br>\r\nBut now that they name-dropped you, you felt it was your personal right to eavesdrop!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quietly creep over to the fence and peek through a conveniently placed hole in the middle of it. You carefully and quiet peek at Reisen and Youmu barely covered in towels staring almost longingly at one another, red on the bunny girl's face as she tries to regain her composure in front of the girl she loves!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Curious... if you dont mind me asking. If you dont wanna answer, I'll understand,\" Youmu assures ahead of time before popping the question, \"he's not... um... with you... uh... in THAT way... is he?\"<br>\r\nReisen's ears twitched, quickly understanding what she meant and her face gets red. \"Umm... n-no. Uh, not in THAT way! My relationship with him is strictly... work-related!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Work-related!' you almost chuckle. Fortunately, for her, her white-haired crush didnt get the meaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good! I was almost worried!\" Youmu sighs with relief.<br>\r\n\"Worried about what?\" Reisen's ears twitch with interest.<br>\r\nYoumu cheeks got a bit red as she replied, \"That somebody else already claimed you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer bunny girl friend got even more bashful after hearing that, \"Y-Y-Youmu... chan. You... didnt have to worry about that... Because... to be honest.... I was hoping that... you might be the one to... claim... me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn no time whatsoever, the white haired half-ghoul pressed her lips against the bunny girl's whose ears stood up frozen with surprise! Your eyes widened at the sight, yet you didnt feel compelled to look away! Reisen finally shook out of her frozen state and returned the kiss, pressing her lips right back. They both held hands as they shared a long passionate kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to feel happy for Reisen that she finally got what she wanted. But all it ultimately did was make you feel more jealous. Jealous and mad at yourself for not answering Yumi's obvious approaches when you had the chance! Perhaps you should consider sneaking out of Eientei and finding her. Hm, just how far is Osaka from Gensokyo?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you pondered, things got steamier. Reisen got a bit bold and slipped a hand under Youmu's towel. Youmu returned the boldness and slipped her hand under the top of Reisen's towel, gently caressing her breast! Next thing you knew, they were putting their hands all over eachother while they were sucking face!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, you were having a hard time looking away but for OTHER reasons! You were feeling a bit ansy yourself and that fellow between your legs wasnt afraid to show it! To be frank, the sight of two lovely young women making out did not repulse you. In fact, you were feeling a different kind of jealous! Jealous that you werent joining them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour conscious was attempting to snap you out of it! It was very wrong of you to keep peeking and you need to stop! But the sight was a bit hard to look away from! Still, if you got time to eavesdrop then youre clearly finished with the bath and need to leave now before you get caught!</span></div></div>",

They been putting super growth hormones in your carrots, little bunny?\u201d Miyu could only laugh nervously. You refused to believe Goro didnt know who this girl is! What kind of decent big brother couldnt recognize his own sister?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoro took the moment to carefully observe her, \u201cYa know something? I think you might be just what I need for a special upcoming movie I'm making paying homage to She-Hulk\u2026\u201d OH GOOD LORD ALMIGHTY, NOT YOUR FREAKING SISTER!!

Ok you cant decide which one you like better. Oni Yumi or She-Hulk Yumi?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell anyways, if you two could please excuse us,\" the nurse quipped, \"Mr. Whitestone is still in the process of his exam!\"<br>\r\n\"Not so fast, 'Miyu',\" Anna read the name tag, \"I'm still curious about this 'exam' youre giving my brother.\" <br>\r\n\"Anna, who cares?\" Goro speaks up, \"let the two have their fun.

The damn door's still open!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which, Nurse Miyu breathed a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry about my sis,\" you apologized, \"she can be a bit overprotective.\"<br>\r\n<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">\"Guess it helps to have a brother who's underprotective.\"</font><br>\r\n\"Hm?\"<br>\r\n\"Nothing!

You get reminded of how significantly taller than you she is when she looks down and you and smiles. \"There is just one last thing we need to do before we call it a day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get a bit flustered as you try to move your head away from her breasts to get a better look at her face. \"W-what's left?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiyu's glasses twinkled as she answered...</span></div></div>",

I was confined in Maeve\u2019s personal torture chamber for at least 4 months.

Kain felt little disturbance and then turned to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Y-yes?\" Kain asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You're pretty young for yourself.\" Yukari asked, \"How old are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'm 22.\" kain replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh! I thought you were 18!\" Yukari replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He expected that as many told him he looked more younger then his own age. He didn't hate it, but it was rather little annoying that everyone keeps telling him that quote. Yukari then sipped few more time and turned to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well then, since you're staying here...I want you to do some chores.\" Yukari said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Chores?\" Kain asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yes. I can see that your wanted by them but I'm not truly fond of lazy people. Think of this as a repayment for stay.\" yukari said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Uh-huh...alright, what should I do?\" Kain asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n yukari decided to let him be...</span></div></div>",

Once you got in, you noticed ran cooling some rice in big wooden bowl. You came next to her and she noticed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Is something wrong?\" Ran asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yukari told me to help you as a repayment for staying here.\" You answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Ran sighed and put down the fan. She always done the chore byherself and she was actually were used to doing it by herself as yukari rarely helped and she didn't want chen to get hurt with the kitchen knives and such. After few secons of thinking, then she turned to your direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Alright. I want you to make the inari tofu moist with soysauce.\" Ran said, \"..You do know how, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You thought hard then your mind got the way on how to make the inari tofu moist. You nodded to her and then she gave you the room to make some. You put some soysauce that were mixed with vinegar and bonito stock to the pot. You turned on the heat and once it boild you put the pouches of inari tofu and lit it simmer for while. Ran continued to fan the rice and noticed your work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n (this child..he is actually not bad..) Ran thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She then turned to her own work..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n -chireiden-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n In the underground city, where it stood chireiden (earthly spirit mansion.), a few lights were made in it. Inside the mansion, one man with three familia fairies behind him were at the open room pointing gun at the pink haired girl with blue shirt and pink dress. It was Satori Komeiji, the satori youkai who is the owner of chireiden. She was on the wall with some blood stains on her shoulder. The man smiled as satoris third eyes looked into his heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You...your heart is filled with hate and anger...why are you doing this!?\" Satori said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Don't think this is bad, lady komeiji.\" Man said, \"I'm doing this for the sake of the many whos justice were never fufilled.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The fairied besides him chuckled and then from the gate a winged girl with red eye thing on her chest and the red haried girl with cat ears bursted in. They were Kaenbyo Orin and Utuho Reiuji, satoris pets. They both came infront of satori to defend their master and utsuho pointed her cannon at the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Nobody hurts lady satori!!\" Utsuho said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"How dare you hurt our lady!\" orin said, \"And you three fairies..how dare you betray the land of gensokyo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The three were Lunachild, sunnymilk, and starsapphire. They were the three mischivous fairies who always plays tricks on the humans and others who they wish to trick. They giggled and lunachild spoke to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Betray? we never betrayed the land of gensokyo!\" Lunachild said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"She's right.\" starsapphire said, \"This mans boss, who lived in desperate area, were betrayed first.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"For that reason, he fights for what is right.\" Sunnymilk said, \"And the wrongdoers in this land will be struck by the hammer of justice..harveys hammer, that is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The man chuckled and was about to shoot satori until they heard a clapping noise. They all turned around and saw a tall man with mid-long black hair, blue eyes and small glasses. He also had good shirt on him, and as he came to them the man and the three fairies knelt before him. It was Harvey Austerlitz, east german  born man who later forced to go to america due to the collapse of eastern germany to become one of the big crime boss. He looked at satori then turned his attention to the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I can see you have done well, Jacob.\" Harvey said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'll do anything you told, mr.austerlitz.\" Jacob replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He smiled then turned to satori and others. Utsuho were about to shoot the cannon until he disappeared and reappeared infront of her, putting his hand on the cannon and slowly pushing it down gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Now now, isn't it bad for a girl like you to hold a weapon?\" Harvey asked, \"You should be punished for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n His eye glowed in red and then her eyes glowed in red as well, then she fell to the ground in pain. She didn't know what was going on as orin tried to hurt him he then turned around and grabbed her throat and hanged her infront. Utsuho slowly got up and pointed her cannon at orin, letting her know she was going to shoot at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"No wait, okuu! STOP!!\" Orin shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You will die under her as I have the power to control the victims strength and power.\" Harvey said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Just then, satori shouted 'STOP!!!' and harvey looked at her. She was sobbing and she had wetted herself as she was scared about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Please...let them go...I'll do anything.\" satori said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Harvey thought for moment and then dropped orin. He then released okuu as she fell as well, hecame infront of satori. She was still sobbing and then he knelt before her, lifting her face toward him by softly grabbing her chin. Satori looked at his blue eyes as it showed his tiredness. She looked into his heart, and it was calm for moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Miss....I didn't want to attack your people. Infact, I wanted to make this less violent, but you refused, causing me to order an issue to attack.\" Harvey said, \"Everyone deserves equality and justice until one betrays everyhing..Don't you think its unfair?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Just then, satori felt his hatred and anger in his heart. She looked in and saw many dying people on the street, hungry children, poor people...and people in the coffin. She was afraid and then he stood up with remourse on his heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Sunnymilk, lunachild, starsapphire.\" Harvey said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yes, sir?\" they all said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'm going to eientei to have little...talk to our member.\" harvey said, \"Get the chopper ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yes sir!\" Sunny said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Then he told jacob to clean things up and make satori clean up and thrown her into her bedroom as a house arrest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Meanwhile, at yakumo resident...</span></div></div>",

While you were eating the noodles, you were thinking about the past. You first remember joining the gang when you graduated high school. You looked for many jobs but with no avail until one of the female member of the gang picked you up. You were interviewed directly by the head mafia and then accepted to the gang. At first you went smoothly as there were few people in the mafia that were supportive until you felt something...bad about the head. You then left the gang 5 years after you joined, making the head mafia mad and labeled you a deserter and ordered a hit on you.  You sighed, making yukari and others notice your sighing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What's wrong, kain?\" yukari asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well...I sort of remember..that I was in mafia for while..\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n This got them intrigued and put their  chopsticks down. They wondered if your memory were recovering. They would like to know more until heard someones scream. Ran got up to see what was going on then saw a dark void open outside, dumping out three corpses. You and chen were horrified by this as both yukari and ran were serious on this until someone came out. It was white haired man with muscular body and had red eyes. He was grinning as ran were ready to defend her master and everyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"So...the famous defector is hidining in this little pithole, huh?\" Man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Who..are you?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh, don't tell me you forgotten my name.\" MAn said, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Who are you? You know it's rude to trespass and dump those bodies.\" Yukari replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man looked at yukari and cracked his fists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"This blows...name's Marcus Firevein, and I am part of the great graue Engel mafia.\" He replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Yukari and ran translated on what that ment, and it was translated as 'gray angel mafia' in german. They all knew he was one of the member that would hunt down you, then marcus pointed at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I finally found the traitor, and I'm going to take you back to the head.\" Marcus said, \"Prepare yourself, you bastard.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n He ran toward you until yukari opened the gap, scooping him in and closed it up. You were glad that yukari were on your side, and then she smiled to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Don't worry kain. As long as you are with us, we shall not anyone touch you.\" Yukari said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Thank you.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Suddenly, a dark void opened and the spiral flame came out. You and others looked and once the spiral faded, it revealed marcus with fire still lit on both of his arms. Yukari and others were shocked to see this as marcus cracked his shoulders, he cracked his neck as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What was that for, you old bitch. Interfering with my business means death.\" Marcus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Why don't you try me, little mortal.\" Yukari replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Marcus gotten angry and was about to burn the area alive until the transmittor went on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 'Marcus! this is xiaolin beetle! we need back up!' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Marcus picked up the transmittor and spoke to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"That's your business. I have the main fucker infront of me.\" Marcus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 'we need you now! or do you want harvey to yell at you!?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Tch, fucking sonofabitch...fine, I'll be there.\" Marcus spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He turned off the transmittor and then turned to you all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You'll live for today, you damn twats.\" Marcus said, \"until then, brace yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He then casted the fire wall and jumped back, sucking into the dark void. You and others began to worry about what's going on and then yukari stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ran, chen. This incident will not be overlooked.\" Yukari said, \"Get reimu notified.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yes, lady yukari.\" Ran said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Yukari and then told you to go with ran, and you nodded and followed.</span></div></div>",

It started when the mafia members told them to hand over the medicines to the mafias. Eirin, the lead doctor of the eientei, refused to help and the war broke between them. During the battle, Eirin noticed that her assistant lunar rabbit Reisen Udongein Inaba were missing. She didn't know why she was gone then immediately turned her attention to the fighting. The mafia crew were about to lose until Marcus arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Is the group alright?\" Marcus asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Surviving sir! Please help us!\" One crew told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He smiled and walked toward the eientei crew. They noticed him and was about to drive him back until both his arms were covered in fire and he shot the wave of flame toward them. Many bunny crew of the eientei got caught in the fire, roasting them into either perfect crisp or beyond recognition. The crew had no choice but to return back into the building. Once they got in, they noticed someone was standing across the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It was reisen herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Reisen? is that..you?\" Eirin spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She nodded and Eirin rushed toward her and hugged her, worried about her safety. She remembered that she sent reisen on the investigation on the outburst of disease. She went there and that was the last time she heard the assistant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Thank god you're alright! Where were you!?\" Eirin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Reisen was quiet and eirin and others felt some strong vibe from behind. Someone appeared from behind and it revealed itself as Harvey himself! Eirin got her bow ready as He smiled, he vanished only to appear infront of the doctor and broke the bow instantly with his arm. Eirin were speechless as Kaguya and Tewi tried to stop him the mafia mens caught up and shackled them with the retraints. Harvey smiled and spoke to her with some light tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ms.Yagokoro... I presume?\" Harvey spoke, \"I came here because of what my mens have told me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n He came to her and touched her jaws. She immediately tried to bite him but he evaded the bite. Eirin was furious and confused: why would Reisen, her own assistant, is standing behind the mafia man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Reisen! why are you with him?\" Eirin spoke, \"Answer me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Reisen was silent for moment and then she finally spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Because he have given me a new hope.\" Reisen spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What?\" Eirin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Reisen came infront of her master and smiled. Eirin felt the bad jive from her and then reisen slapped her masters face hard. Eirin didn't understand as she looked at her assistant with disbelief and confusion, reisen took out an picture of herself with bandage and coverage (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B6wLzmOCEAAwONG.png\" target=\"_blank\">https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B6wLzmOCEAAw...</a>).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ever since you sent me to the human village, I got sick and gotten beaten by the villagers, making it my fault for not coming sooner. You didn't come to rescue me, but this man have.\" Reisen said, \"He have given me a new hope, where everyone should live in harmony.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Reisen....what are-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Mr.Austerlitzs idea and his ambition shall not be thwarted.\" Reisen said, \"I shall assist him with all of my might.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Eirin and others were shocked to hear this and Harvey ordered the mens to give them the house arrest. Eirin and others tried to use their power but with no avail as Harvey already using his ability to negate the power of his enemy. As they took the eientei crew away, reisen stood next to her new boss. Harvey patted her head as she blushed little, he spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I have nothing but one goal.\" Harvy spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The eientei have fallen to the mafia.</span></div></div>",

As you were laying down, you became little drowsy and closed your eyes only to open again to see a street of the city that you have grown up and served the mafia. You got up, looking around thinking about how you got here until you saw a laying man on the street. You started to walk toward the person until you saw a tall man walk through you. You noticed this man but didn't recognized his face. He then stood before the lying man and stared it for moment, then sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You were pesky one to find, boy.

He then noticed the two mens talking to each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"...I know comrade colonel wants us to get the head of this mansion to have allience, but how should we do it?\" One soldier asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Dunno.

I think mylady wants to see you.\" Maid spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She then told the defector to open the door. As he did, he saw two ex-members on the ground, knifes on its head and throat. He was horrified as he saw a blue haired girl in red dress on. She looked at him as few more fairies came in, the girl spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Fairies. Take these two rats out so the youkais could eat them.\" Girl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yes, lady remilia.\" Fairies replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n They then took the bodies out and left the area. Remilia looked at the defector and showed him the wings. Defector were scared then the maid pushed him down to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Show respect to remilia scarlet, the eternally young vampire.\" Maid said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"V-vampire!?\" Defector spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She kicked on his face, causing him to bleed. REmilia just chuckled and got up from her chair and walked toward the defector. Once she stopped, she put her hand on his cheeck and rose his head up. He could see the slit iris on her eyes and moment later, she looked at the maid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Sakuya? give us a few minutes.\" remilia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"But, mylady, I-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Sakuya.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Remilia stopped her speech and sakuya just bowed and left the scene. Remilia then released him and he slowly got up from where he was at and she went back to the seat. The defector were in pain but had some intention that she's not harming him for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Sorry for my maids attitude, but I've seen many rats coming into my place.\" Remilia said, \"but ofcourse, it's natural..what is your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I...am daniel...daniel mcdough.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"And I am remilia scarlet.\" She said. \"Tell me about yourself..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n How long it lasted?</span></div></div>",

Few minutes passes, she gets up from her seat and called sakuya. Just then, the maid came next to her and then the vampire pointed at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You will be under house arrest until I make a choise.\" Remilia said, turning to sakuya \"Sakuya, take him away and lock into our special...guest room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"yes, mylady.\" Sakuya replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She then disappeared and reappeared behind daniel. She then took out her knife and pushed it on his back, telling him to move on. They both got out and walked for 3 minutes and got to the room. She opened up the door and pushed him in and closed the door, locking it up. Daniel knew he was imprisoned in the area until the further notice, but he relaxed  at least the mafia wouldn't touch him...for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well, I guess I could relax now.\" Daniel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He then went to the bed and layed down to get some rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n -hakugyokuro, gate of white jade-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n In the netherworld of hakugyokuro where the spirits go to see the cherryblossom tree, there stood a traditional eastern house and it rose some smoke. In the garden, one girl with silver hair and green dress knelt with some blood, holding a katana while a purple haired women in light blue dress were holded by a black haired women in military outfit. It was the head of the russian mafia and many of her mafioso members were with them. Few of them even had the flag of the soviet union in air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well well..you're one tough bitch, arn't you?\" Women said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"*cough* how...could my ability *Cough* nullifyed?\" pink haired women spoke, coughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The women were yuyuko saigyouji, the head of the hakugyokuro and the one with katana were youmu konpaku, her servant and yard keeper. The mafia women just smiled and then threw her to the ground. She coughed blood as the mafia boss came to her, she took out her handgun and pointed at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Why do you ask? because I have some...elite soldiers who required some ability and one of them is this young girl.\" Women said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She turned to the young girl, who were around 22-24 years old, chestnut eyes and red head. Her name was Alexandra Azarov, born few years before the soviet union fell. Her family disowned her after the soviet collapsed, and the mafia leader took her for recruitment. Afterwards, she was loyal to her and did whatever she asked. the mafia lady continued to smile and turned to yuyuko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"And now...at first I asked you to kindly use your house as a headquarter. You refused, and this is the outcome for such refusal.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You...damn bitch!!\" youmu shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The soldiers and alexandra pointed their weapons at her, but the mafia leader stopped them. She quickly shoots youmus chest three time, making her fall down to the ground. Yuyuko shouted her name and the mafia leader pointed at her leg and shot one bullet. Yuyuko screamed in pain as the leader were amused by her scream, she grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Heh. How wonderful your little assistant have absolute loyalty, ms...\" Leader spoke, not knowing her name. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n One soldier came to her and whispered, and turned back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"...Yuyuko Saigyouji.\" Lady said, \"I respect that, but sometime people must shut their own mouth to protect themselves.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You...you're cold hearted fool..\" yuyuko said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Am I?\" women asked, \"Well...you can call me that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Just then, other soldier came. It was bulky many who were 6'7\" tall. He also had short black hair and scar on his left eye. His name was Boris Vasnetsov, commander to the soviet army that accompanied the colonel. After the breakup, he was the first one to be chosen by her and followed her ever since. Boris then came to her and saluted to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Comrade vladlena, I have ergent news.\" Boris spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Speak, comrade boris.\" vladlena spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Two of our spies disguised as a peace allience were killed.\" Boris replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Vladlena looked at boris with cold eyes. She knew something would come up since those two were not experienced enough. Vladlena sighed and took out a cigar and a cutter. She cut the tip off and put the end to her mouth as she took out the lighter and lit the end, she puffed some smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Where was the scene?\" Vladlena asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Scarlet devil manor.\" Boris answerd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She didn't say anything and then heared yuyukos moaning in pain on the ground. She thought for moment and then turned to boris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"We will go see this people first thing in the morning.\" Vladlena said, \"For now..treat these fools.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She then went back to the mansion, boris saluting and then telling the soldiers to aid the two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Hakugyokuro were besieged by the mafia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Back in the mansion, daniel woke up from the knocking door and once it opened, remilia and sakuya came in. Daniel were worried about what they decided for him, and then remilia took step forward.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"Mr...Johnson. We have decided to let you stay in our mansion.\" Remilia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Thank you, mylady!\" Daniel replied happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"But with one condition.\" Remilia spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He knew something was up and gotten ready to hear what she have to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"From this forward, you will become...</span></div></div>",

You were just about to gratefully accept your new job, when you noticed Remilia and her maid were looking all directions expecting something or someone.<br>\r\nRemilia turned her head back to you and coughed, \"Ahem! I said from this day forward, you will become Gate Guarding with Meiling!\" She jerked her head toward the hallway, perhaps expecting someone to come running. No one came.<br>\r\n\"I said you will become. GATE. GUARDING. WITH. MEILING!\" Remilia shouted, \"AS IN ASSISTING HONG MEILING! MY CURRENT GATE GUARDIAN!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing but awkward silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why isnt she barging in screaming off the top of her lungs?\" Remilia question her maid, \"you know how stubborn she is about her job.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure, my lady,\" Sakuya stated, \"she shouldve done so by now.\u201d<br>\r\nRemilia scowled, \u201cShe didnt fall asleep on the job again, did she?!\u201d<br>\r\nSakuya shook her head, \u201cNo, I already punished her for the last time. She wouldnt dare do it any time soon.\u201d Already, youre not liking your new employment! But considering your position and the fact that outside of this mansion you are a dead man walking, you keep your mouth shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemilia shook her head and sighed, \u201cJust drag her over here.\u201d<br>\r\nThe maid bowed and only a microsecond later, within a single blink, she had appeared with a dizzy looking red-haired woman in her grasp! You almost gasped in surprise that in such outrageous speed, she was able to practically material the red-haired woman in a green Chinese gi suit without dropping her green Mao cap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow putting that anomaly aside, you notice the red-head looking a bit under the weather. Her eyes were droopy, her cheeks were flushed, her breathing was heavily, and you could hear her moaning under her panting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemilia raised an eyebrow, \u201cMeiling? Meiling!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm? Huh?\u201d the red-head sloped opened her blue eyes, then they widened immediately at the sight of her boss, \u201cOH! M-M-Mistress!\u201d she quickly stood up straight and gave her boss the military salute, \u201cY-you called, Mistress? Oh, hi Sakuya.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMeiling are you feeling ok?\u201d Remilia questioned her, \u201cyoure not looking too good.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine! Just fine!\u201d Meiling announced, \u201cfine and impenetrable as always!\u201d Sakuya suddenly let out a quick chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood,\u201d Remilia ignored the chuckled, \u201cbecause we were just about to introduce you to your new partner-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWh-wh-WHAT?!\u201d Meiling jumped with outrage, \u201cPARTNER?! I dont need a partner! The Scarlet Mansion is untouchable with just me!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat is not true and you know it,\u201d Remilia stated, \u201cI seem to recall a certain miko and her thieving companion slipping out of your radar one too many times.\u201d You probably shouldnt question this. \u201cI think it\u2019d be beneficial for all of us to have TWO gate guards. And I\u2018d like you to meet our second! Meiling, this is Daniel-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI dont care who he is!\u201d Meiling snapped as she turned her head to you, \u201cI don\u2019t nee-\u2026ugh\u2026\u201d Only seconds after locking hate filled eyes with you, she squirmed in some kind of agony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026Odd. What is that fragrant odor that\u2019s suddenly slipping into your nostrils?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMeiling, are you sick?\u201d Remilia questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m not sick,\u201d Meiling groaned, \u201cit\u2019s just\u2026 uggh\u2026 why did it have to be today of all days?\u201d You began to sniff at the odor, trying to search out it\u2019s source. Whatever it was, it was drawing you in. It wasnt a very good smell, but for some bizarre reason, it was inviting to you. You were partially salivating from the scent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMeiling if youre feeling sick, you need to see Patchouli immediately.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! No, I said I\u2019m alright!\u201d Meiling insisted, despite trembling a little, \u201cer\u2026. c-cant we discuss why I don\u2019t wanna work with this scrawny capitalist foreigner next week?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d Remilia shot her down. All the while, you were still sniffing out the scent. It seemed to be coming from Meiling\u2019s direction. You didnt realize until too late you were edging a bit too close to her. \u201cYou will be working with Daniel and that\u2019s final! Now take him to the front and show him how to man the post!\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cBut\u2026.\u201d whatever was wrong with Meiling was becoming way too overpowering for her to protest, \u201cerrgh.. yes, Mistress.\u201d She snared at you as if it was YOUR fault. If you weren\u2019t so intrigued by the smell, you\u2019d be flinching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018What is with that smell?\u2019 you wonder, drawing you toward it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop looking at me like that!\u201c Meiling growled, \u201cmove your ass!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYes ma\u2019am,\u201d you said with a sniff and followed your new partner down the hall. You could overhear her groaning and mumbling something in Chinese, but youre not sure whether she was talking about you or how she was feeling. Either way, you didnt give a duck. Her fragrant odor seemed to be top priority.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy does her smell entice you so? Maybe it might have something to do with her looking and acting sickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe mumbled quite a lot in what you assumed was an older dialect of mandarin Chinese. Despite learning a little mandarin from your dad during a business trip in Hong Kong, you couldnt understand most of the syllables she was spewing.<br>\r\nThe only words you could understand were curses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is the gate,\u201d Meiling finally spoke in English and announced, \u201csit down and start watching.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cUm, arent you gonna show me around?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI just did!\u201d Meiling snapped, \u201cYou see that gate? That\u2019s the gate youre gonna be watching! That\u2019s all you need to see! Now sit down and start watching!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t question her any more due to the condition she was looking and acting. Something was wrong with her but she seemed to be trying her darndest not to let it bother her. You werent sure whether to admire her confidence or be concerned for her health. Either way, the silence was killing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026 Meiling?\u201d you cleared your head, \u201cwhat\u2019s it like being-\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo talking!\u201d she wasnt in the mood for friendly chit chat. More awkward silence ensued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you stared out in the distance waiting for something or someone to come by, your partner seemed to be staring your way the whole time. It was getting uncomfortable.<br>\r\nYou turned your head and opened your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop staring at me!\u201d she didnt liked being looked at either. You sighed hard and continued staring in the distance, ignoring her unbearably rude stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough the corner of your eye, you spotted her scoot a bit closer to you. You ignored that and looked elsewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe scooted closer. You took a deep breath and continued eyeing the horizon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe scooted even closer. You bit your lip, getting a bit nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe scooted closer some more. Her cheeks slightly reddened in the middle of her impatient glare your direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe whispered untranslatable mandarin awfully loud. She was so close, she was taking up all your breathing air with those sniffs of hers! This was getting incredibly irritating! You've only been on the job for two minutes and already it was too much to handle!<br>\r\nNot like taking a stand was easy, though. She seemed to have a bit of a short temper and if she's the sole gate guardian of this whole damn mansion, odds are she's a force to be reckoned with. Still, you dont know how long you could take this! What are you gonna do about it?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The mafia mens stopped and made way for vladlena to come forward.

Meiling were agitated by her but you told her to not get agitated by her since she likes to agitate others to attack first, only to be killed by her arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I came here because two of our mens were reported dead when I specifically ordered them for peaceful allience.\" Vladlena said, \"Is there something connecting between this and the head of the mansion?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"No. Now go away before I end your breath.\" Meiling replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 'Oh brother, what did she just do!?' was the thought you had in your head. Vladlena didn't take Threats lightly as you remember she was responsible of killing not one but TWO mafia (yakuza and triads) leaders due to their intolerance toward the mafia women.

You looked at your hand and sniffed at the area where the little princess done it. It smelled fruity as you used the fruit fragrance soap, but if you sniff more, you could smell some sort of....odd odor on it. You felt that the smell of the love juice sukuna dumped on your finger.

Considering you still taste blood in your mouth, it sure wasnt a dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes almost an eternity before you come to your senses and OH SWEET MERCIFUL GOD DOES IT REEK! The horribly putrid smell played a great role in making you come to. The stench made you cringe despite the intense pain you received from cringing! It was a disastrous combination of bowel, decay, and expired perfume. If your stomach wasnt already empty, you'd already be puking right in the face of the poor soul youre lying on top of!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmphasis on poor SOUL. You found yourself lying on top of the corpse of a dead woman. Though despite being dead, she looked well preserved. Her cold pale skin still looked rather smooth and not very decomposey, there was still color in her short blue hair, her oriental style red dress looked clean despite being surrounded in dirt, and under her blue cap you could see a strip of paper sticking to her forehead written in an unfamiliar language (but instinct told you it's very VERY bad luck if you peel it off!). Unfortunately, the rigor mortis in her arms left them sticking all the outward as if eternally reaching out for something. And you were caught in between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh and she smelled outrageously foul. No sooner did you realize you were stuck in a long hole with her. Guess somebody thought you were dead and chucked you in an open grave with her? You needed to climb out before the stench makes you sick and you contract who knows how many diseases being this close to her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, you couldnt pull yourself off her, because your arms were pushed down by the weight of her body! despite the tight space in the hole, you somehow had your arms wrapped around her! Why the hell are you hugging a corpse?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You gotta be fucking kidding me,\" you groaned with little breath you had as you tried prying your arms out from under her! It didnt help that you were getting dizzy from the stench of her death. The smell at least played a good distraction from the intense pain from just struggling! You'd scream for help, but you didnt have the strength in your lungs at the moment, besides, you doubt anybody's gonna here you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you struggle and struggle and struggle until...</span></div></div>",

You swore you don't remember coming here but after few minutes of thinking you realized you  can't stay here forever. You started to walk through the cemetery and you felt some eerie vibes from the tombstone as if some spirits were around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Damn, where am I?\" You spoke to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Just then, you saw some shadow move quickly. You shivered little and petted your pockets, noticing something in it. It was an butterfly knife and you quickly took out the bladed side out and gotten ready to defend yourself. You heard some noise and you got your courage to speak out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Who's there!?\" You shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Just then, you saw someone come out of the tombstone. It was a young man around your age and had slight orange hair and had old norse-ish cloth on. You quickly remembered him as he was Adalgar, the messenger boy for the mafia you once worked. He was nicknamed 'Ratatoskr' since he always done his messaging very quick like a squirrel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Adalgar! You're here?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hey man. How's everything?\" He replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n you came to him and he saluted to you since he was younger then you. You asked him what was going on and he told you that he was betrayed by the mafia and they wanted his head since they feared he would leak the info to the CIA or FBI though he would never do it even in death. He was running from the mafia until he fell through the hole and ended up in this area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"So you're also in my shoes as well.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yeah...but at least I found an awesome ally!\" Adalgar said with smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh yeah? who?\" you responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Follow me!\" Adalgar answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You followed the young man through the cemetery and saw the opening on one of the grave hole. Both you and Adalgar went down, and in moment you saw a huge wide open area with some sort of old fashion eastern building not too far from the area. You were very surprised to see this as both you and adalgar got off from the ladder and landed safely on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What is this place?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"This place is called  Hall of Dreams' Great Mausoleum, and the person who lives in there would help us.\" Adalgar responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You were astonished to see this as it was actually beautiful to see. Once you and adalgar walked, they reached the mausoleum and adalgar opened the door. As you two got into the building, you two were walking through the hallway until you and adalgar reached the doorway.

Your eyes watered and you coughed to the point that you almost gagged! Somehow, Adalgar wasnt feeling the same way. For some reason he was completely unaffected by the horrible scent lingering in that mausoleum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you finally strengthened your will to tolerate that putrid smell, your eyes widened and jaw dropped but for a second before you had to cover it with your shirt! Before you stood that very same corpse from that hole you woke up in! Now standing up with her eyes opened facing you! And still reaching her arms out to you for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood lord, was she faking her death?! Unfortunately no. Unless she was wearing that perfume 'Eau D\u00e9Composer', the stench still emitting from her told you she was long past the whole 'faking' point!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh...wha.... y....you... youre....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiiii...\" she slurred a bit like she was a lot more exhausted than... well, dead, \"you must be Ratty's friend.

I'm a man of God!\"<br>\r\n\"...Do they taste like chicken, too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa whoa whoa, calm down Rookie, calm down!\u201d then Adalgar put himself between the two of you to defuse the situation, \u201cshe's no threat. This is Yoshika Miyako, one of the servants in the Mausoleum.\u201d That didnt really calm your nerves because 1. You never heard of this girl and 2. SHE'S A FUCKING ZOMBIE!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm a Jiangshi!\u201d she proudly exclaimed/corrected.<br>\r\n\u201cWh...what's a jiangshi?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026.Uhhhhh\u2026..\u201d she rolled her eyes upward as if thinking really hard about the answer, \u201c\u2026.ask Seiga.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAnd who is Seiga?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026.Uhhhhh\u2026.\u201d was this zombie serious?!<br>\r\n\u201cShe's Yoshika's superior and one of the heads of the Mausoleum,\u201d Adalgar had to answer for her, \u201cunlike some the others, she a bit rough around the edges and rather tough on those who arent exactly devoted taoists.\u201d Oy. THOSE types, huh?<br>\r\n\u201cI was gonna tell him that, Ratty,\u201d Yoshika exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyways, we can introduce you to the others once we get there,\u201d Adalgar said, \u201cright now let's hurry on.\u201d And hurry you did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is until you were blocked by some kind of invisible barrier. Adalgar and the jiangshi were able to pass through it no problem, but you, it was literally a wall.  You banged on it a few times, but there was no budging it for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, what's going on?\u201d you questioned, \u201cI cant go any further!\u201d<br>\r\nAdalgar looked at you with shock but Yoshika grinned.<br>\r\n\u201cSeiga made this part of the hall blocked off to tourists,\u201d Yoshika answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour former partner still stared at you with confusion, \u201cBut he's not a tourist he's\u2026\u201d He passed through the barrier with no problem as he observed you carefully, \u201cwait a minute. Youre still alive?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared back with mutual confusion, \u201cUh, yeah? Arent you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe buttoned his fancy suit\u2026 revealing several bullet wounds pierced right through his chest and out his back!<br>\r\n\u201cThey managed to riddle me good before I made that leap into the hole,\u201d he explained, \u201cby the time I landed, I had already bled to death.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cJesus Christ!\u201d you cringed looking at his horrible bullet-ridden chest, \u201cyoure actually dead?!\u201d<br>\r\nHe nodded, \u201cThat's pretty much why I'm allowed here, much to Seiga's dismay. And I cant believe that youre still alive after what you've been through!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat explains why you smell so yummy!\u201d Yoshika passed through the barrier with ease and edged closer to you! On instinct, you edged back toward Adalgar like your human shield!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is a big problem!\u201d says your former partner, \u201cif the others find there's a mortal heretic trespassing, there going to go ballistic! I'm sorry rookie, but only the dead and devoted followers of their faith are allowed here.\u201d Well, that's a problem then, aint it?<br>\r\n\u201cWell what am I supposed to do?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n\u201cYoure gonna have to die,\u201d was his best answer and not the answer you wanted to hear, \u201cbut they confiscated my weapons, so it's not like I can kill you quick enough.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI could,\u201d Yoshika spoke up with an another answer you didnt wanna hear. You paled seeing the drool drip down her abnormally long tongue, \u201c...if you let me eat ya, you'll be allowed here.\u201d Eat you?! DEFINITELY an answer you sure as well didnt wanna hear!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2026 you cant be serious! I aint letting you eat me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou would die pretty fast,\u201d Adalgar actually encouraged it! \u201cJiangshi bites are incredibly venomous. You might die of infection before she tears THAT deep into you.\u201d How deep is THAT deep?!<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I dont believe what I'm hearing! You honestly expect me to let that thing chew me to pieces?!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cC'moooooon!\u201d Yoshika whined, \u201cit'll just be a couple of bites into that ripe, tender, juicy, protein-rich meaty flesh! I wont take TOO much of ya! Promise!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cGet the fuck away from me!\u201d you demanded of this foul-smelling hungry ghoul, \u201cthere's gotta be another option!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cEither that or you can convert to Taoism,\u201d suggested Adalgar.<br>\r\n\u201cNOT HAPPENING!\u201d you said with pride for your religious heritage!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, those are the only choices you got!\u201d Adalgar tells you, \u201cI'm sorry, but those are the Mausoleum's rules.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrap. This has gotta be the worst two choices you ever made. You most likely wont survive on your own outside of this place, but you kinda really dont wanna die, especially from the method youre currently presented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, thankfully you have the other option. You can simply convert to Taoism and completely abandon years of culture, tradition, morals, and major belief that the carpenter and prophet of Nazareth was the son of God in which his very crucifixion shaped and molded the fate of Greater Europe and eventually most of the world as we know it! You can simply throw away that very faith you were baptized under as an alternative! That's MUCH easier than letting a smelly drooling zombie chew you to death, RIGHT?!</span></div></div>",

I swear if you clean it up I will give you some tasty flesh.\" Adalgar replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You couldnt believe what he was saying then yoshika agreed to his deal and she bit on the infected arm and strongly teared it off from his body, making some gross noise. You felt nausious watching as yohika swallowing the arm whole, and once she put it into her corpse belly adalgar gave her some herbs and she ate it. After few minutes yoshika pushed her stomach and started to regurgitate the arm. You felt more disturbed as the zombie were vomiting out an arm which by surprise turned back to normal. After it hit floor, adalgar got the arm and put it on his missing area  and it quickly healed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Thanks yoshika.\" Adalgar thanked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"No problem...\" Yoshika replied, \"Now  I have to go see master...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She then left the scene, leaving you and adalgar to themselves. You felt disguisted by what you saw but you also felt awsome that you gotten a new ability: the ability to spread plagues. You thought for moment until adalgar told you it was time for the sermon. You nodded and went with him, and when you reached the main hall you were met by...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Two figures before stick out in your mind like the holes in Adalgar's chest and the look on Yoshika's face right before she sank her teeth into you. One figure was of course, God have mercy, that same Jiangshi earlier that devoured you as well as swallowed your former co-worker's infected arm and puked it back out in front of you. You scooted up closer to Adalgar on instinct before you turned your attention to the 2nd figure. Beside Yoshika was a young blue haired woman worn in some sort of oriental loops entwined with a long hair stick, wearing a somewhat elegant blue dress and it seems like there's a transparent white ribbon hovering around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNO, SERIOUSLY. The ribbon does not even look like it's touching her, it's literally hovering around her! Neato trick, but nothing truly compares to witnessing and becoming part of the undead.<br>\r\nIgnoring Yoshika's creepy stare of way too much intrigue, her friend seems to be giving you some sort of disapproving frown. The last time you were given a frown like that was when your mom found out where you've been going every Sunday after midnight!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKaku-sama,\u201d Adalgar gave a humble bow to the woman, \u201cthis is the former associate of mine I've told you about.\u201d<br>\r\nYou felt nothing but bad vibes coming from that disapproving frown on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes,\u201d she stared your way, \u201cso this is the stubborn heretic that\u2026 spoiled my servant's dinner.\u201d Yoshika lowered her head with shame and you ignored the loud cracks you heard from her neck when she did that!<br>\r\n\u201cIt's an honor to meet you,\u201d you try to act polite despite feeling a little offended she called you a 'stubborn heretic'. Unlike Adalgar, you didnt bow because\u2026 well, you dont bow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoshika's boss took a couple steps toward you and held the cross around your neck in her hands and observed it.<br>\r\n\u201cFor a newcomer, this is awful bold of you,\u201d she commented, \u201cyour first day of being welcomed in our temple and youre casually wearing symbols of idol worship.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt's not idol worship,\u201d you took the cross back and corrected her, \u201cit's what I am.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSsss!\u201d Yoshika sucked in some air and stepped back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKaku-sama, please excuse my associate,\u201d Adalgar had to step in and defuse whatever s-storm you may have caused, \u201che may speak a bit too freely at times, but I assure you he is very loyal to those he owes favors to. Plus, his stubbornness means he wont be influenced by the Buddhists.\u201d Buddhists?<br>\r\n\u201cPlus his meaty bits are REALLY good, Seiga!\u201d the damn zombie remarked, \u201cyou should try them, theyre like New York Strip!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Kaku sighed, \u201cWell, I suppose his stubbornness will come in handy. Byakuren's toadies are becoming more and more resourceful. Still, should you consider renouncing that heresy and accepting the grace and harmony of pure Taoism, there would be many doors open for you in your future.\u201d Too bad for her, your faith is not something to willing to bargain!<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cSorry,\u201d you humbly decline, \u201cbut that will honestly not happen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you say now,\u201d this woman seems awful full of herself, \u201canyways newcomer, as long as youre staying here, you are free to display your symbols of idolatry in private, but publicly, ESPECIALLY during a sermon, you are to conceal them.\u201d Again, her calling your favorite keepsake idolatry is rubbing you the wrong way, but Adalgar, a CANAANITE, nodded your way.<br>\r\n\u201cI'm sorry if my Lord and Savior offends you,\u201d you take the necklace off and put it in your pocket, \u201cI dont think we've been properly introduced, Lady Kaku. I'm-\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cFirst of all, if youre going to stay here, you need to learn the proper way to address someone,\u201d she interrupts you, \u201cyou do not address me as 'Lady Kaku'. It's 'Kaku-sama'.\u201d<br>\r\nYou stare coldly but answer, \u201cMy apologies, Kaku-sama.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat's better,\u201d Seiga is pleased, \u201csecondly, whatever your name was while you were alive no longer applies here. Since it was MY servant that has granted you this state, it's only fair that I give you your name.\u201d You raised your eyebrow as she thought, \u201cHm\u2026 ah! Alright, seeing as though youre CURRENTLY  a believer of the wrong faith, I think the name of a saint of the wrong faith is proper!\u201d Oh dear. \u201cFrom now on, you will be known as Shiro Amakusa!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blinked at the name. You'll probably have to look up who this 'Shiro Amakusa' fellow is before you could give your opinion on it. That is if youre ever given the opportunity. Regardless, it's gonna take some getting used to. Not to mention, you wonder what Adalgar's new name is. And how many does that make it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI trust there's no objection to the name?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot at all, Kaku-sama,\u201d you tell her, \u201cShiro is fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood,\u201d Seiga is once again pleased, \u201cwe'll go over some more of the rules after the Miko's sermon is over. Canaanite, we need to have a word in private. Yoshika, kindly find Shiro a place in the crowd to sit.\u201d Again you began to shiver! It's almost as if Seiga's purposely doing this to you for not converting!<br>\r\nThe jiangshi's back cracked loudly when she bowed. \u201cYou got it, Seiga! C'mon, Shoru!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSHIRO!\u201d Seiga corrected her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a bit unnerving being so close to this ghoul that just moments ago tore into you in a mixture of hunger and gleeful sadism. Considering she clearly enjoyed your taste, who's to say she wont try it again later? Can you trust the caretakers of this place to prevent such a thing from happening?<br>\r\nAnd that's not even counting that horrible smell of hers that's currently still torturing your nostr-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Wait. Where's the awful smell? Sure, you can smell a little too much perfume off her, but not the nauseating decay that it failed to mask! Come to think of it, you dont even remember breathing in her odor when she was eating Adalgar's arm!<br>\r\nYou leaned in way too close to see if you can smell that decaying odor, but you couldnt! Just too much perfume!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHm?\u201d oops, Yoshika noticed, \u201cwhat's wrong, Shardo?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHow come you dont reek anymore?\u201d you tactlessly ask.<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d she tilted her cracking head as she frowned at you. She even leaned down and smelled her armpit, then shrugged her shoulders. Oh dear lord, her face doesnt even look as\u2026 cadaverous as it used to! You actually think it looks kinda cute\u2026 for a pale dead chick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEr, anyway! How much further?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n\u201cTo where?\u201d was she serious?<br>\r\n\u201cTo the sermon!\u201d you answered.<br>\r\n\u201c...Uhhhhhhh...OH! Oh right, right!\u201d good lord, she's STILL brain-dead, \u201cWhoopsie!\u201d and she quickly turned around and headed the opposite direction, wasting plenty of time! Well, at least if she tries to eat you again, you can always outsmart her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a pointlessly long walk in the wrong direction followed by what hoped to be a long walk in the RIGHT direction, the both of you finally reach the ceremonial room...</span></div></div>",

You felt little uncomftorable by their stair but kept to yourself as yoshika took you to your seat. Once you and yoshika sat down, you saw a chestnut haired girl who you see parts of her hair sticking out like an animal ears while a green dressed woman and white kimono wearing girl sat on the opposite side of the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"It seems you made in time.\" girl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"i apologizw.\" you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She smiled and started to preach. You pretended to listen and you felt kind of tired as the sermon were going on for an hour, and you wondered where adalgar were since you didn't see him yet. 30 minutes later, the sermon were finished and everyone left including you and yoshika. As you two got out and walked forawrd, you finally met with adalgar...only to see some bruises on his body and holding two ropes that lead to two girls who were tied up. One were blond/brown hair with some sort of tiger striped skirt while other were small grey haired girl with mouse ears on!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Adalgar, what happened to you?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I had an errand to do for kaku-sama, that's all.\" Adalgar replied, \"oh, yoshika..I brought you an souvinere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He pulled out an corpse that were ripped off from right arm to chest area. Yoshika drooled over this and took it as he gave it to her. She thanked him as she stood and ate, he turned to your attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Sorry for being late.\" Adalgar said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"No...problem.\" You replied, \"Who're they? and where did you get that corpse?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"They are the members of the buddhist temple. I only talked to them in peace but they attacked, so I retaliated. I took them hostage and I captured one of young buddhist monk and sacrificed it to my god ba'al.\" He answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You felt sick from that, and you wanted to puke but held in. You asked if they would attack, but he assured you he put the special talismen on them so they would be powerless. You saw the girls face and could see their rage and hatred on their eyes. Moment later, seiga came to you all as yoshika hopped to her side with her...snack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Seigaa! ratty gave me good souvinere!\" Yoshika said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Is that so? Anyway, good job canaanite for the job well done.\" seiga said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He just nodded and they all left, leaving you and adalgar.

She trotted toward you two as you wondered who this young girl were. Adalgar told you that she is mononobe no futo, one of the higher ups in this mausoleum and she is a master of feng shui. You knew little of feng shui then the grey haired girl spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"So your that newcomer that seiga was talking about!\" Futo said, \"I am Mononobe no futo, nice to meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'm Shiro Amakusa.\" You replied, noting about your new name seiga gave you, \"Nice to meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She smiled and offerd you to take a tour of the mausoleum. You looked at adalgar and he nodded, letting you go on little expedition on this area. You thanked him and went along with her as adalger follwed you two. As you all walked, adalgar explained to you about this new world as the world is known as gensokyo, and he explained to you that the one that forgotten would come to the land.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"So...we're forgotten from our world?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Technically, yes.

It looked to be a sculpture of a man with the head of a bull sitting in an alter with his hands extended out for something. You remember seeing pictures of similar depictions in church during a sermon. That sermon involved the wars between the Israelites and Caananites. During that sermon, you remember seeing that depiction when Pastor Sergios was bringing up child sacrifice. That's when it hits you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat little idol is a baby sacrificial altar to Molech!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cringed in disgust, inadvertently activating your powers causing the little figure to decay before you tossed that damn thing as far as you could throw it! Ugh! You felt so dirty just holding on to that disgusting thing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY!! That was mine!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd speaking of dirty and disgusting, you hear Yoshika's voice scream out at you! You turned and flinch at the now naked jiangshi standing stiff before you with anger! How did she manage to sneak up on you, why is she naked, and how was it that you werent able to smell her coming?!<br>\r\n\"That was a gift from Ratty!\" she scolded you with her arms still sticking out, \"how dare you just chuck it out like trash!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly turn away with a blush, trying not to stare at her exposed breasts and remind your friend downstairs she's still a filthy zombie!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-w-what are you doing here?!\" you questioned.<br>\r\n\"DUUUUH!\" she gave you a sarcastic 'duh', \"I'm trying to get clean!\"<br>\r\n\"B-but youre dead... I-I-I mean I'M already using the bath, so why are you in here?!\"<br>\r\n\"I dont know why YOURE here,\" she looked as though you asked a dumb question, \"but this is MY bath time! I'm scheduled to take my bath at 9pm, didnt you look at the schedule?!\"<br>\r\n\"But... it's 8pm,\" you looked at your watch and corrected her. <br>\r\nHer neck cracked when she tilted it questionable, \"It is?\" you showed her your watch, \"....OOOH!! Right right! I forgot. It's not daylight saving's time anymore!\" It hasnt been daylight saving's time for a couple months! But instead, she just shrugs her shoulders, \"Ya know what? I'm already here and I got my things ready, so I'm just gonna finish my bath!\" You had a feeling there'd be point arguing with this idiot, so you decided to just bathe with her. Besides, maybe she knows how to use the bath kits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, uh, since youre here,\" you look to her with your hand covering the visual area where her chest is, \"could ya tell me how to use one of these bath kits?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, I dont bother with them,\" Yoshika said, \"those things wear out your skin, anyways.\" Ironic. \"I used my own body wash. It not only cleans good, it's great on my sensitive skin. Keeps it really alive and healthy!\" More irony. But in her defense, her skin does look well preserved for a dead chick. \"I'll share some with you if you pass me a sponge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, thanks,\" against your better judgement you grab two sponges, one for you and one for her, and she gets out her bottle of body wash and squirts some in both sponges. \"Um... can you even move your arms?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. Why?\" Yoshika asks as you hear the loud cracks of her frozen joints as she rubs her sponge against her body!<br>\r\n\"N-No reason!!\" you quickly turn away, but those disgusting cracks her joints were making were loud! Even while being partially disgusted, part of you was fighting off the scandalous mental image of a naked Yoshika washing her body right behind you! You tell yourself she's a foul smelling zombie, but she aint a bad looking foul smelling zombie! And lord knows how old she is and how long she's been a rotting corpse. Maybe it is the body wash she's using. Maybe if you start using some, your body wont be rotting and decaying so fast, either. That way of thinking did make you less reluctant to rub Yoshika's body wash on your own body. It kinda smells like oatmeal, too. You like oatmeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey uh, could ya do my back?\" suddenly, Yoshika gave you a request, \"I cant really reach it.\" You looked to see Yoshika already had her back turned to you! You got a bit nervous and looked down your friend downstairs (while covering the visual area where her naked ass is!) and whispered 'NO!' to it.<br>\r\n\"S-sure!\" you reluctantly agreed, \"it's the least I can do for letting me borrow your body wash!\" Your hands shivered, worried you'd get sick just by touching her back! Somehow it didnt take long for you to get over that feeling, cuz you had no trouble scrubbing her back with your sponge. Even in close inspection, she not only didnt smell bad, her skin, despite being dead pale, did look rather lively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Yoshika?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm curious,\" you say, \"how did you die?\"<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n\"I mean back before you became a jiangshi,\" you added, \"how did you die?\"<br>\r\n\"....Uhhhhhh...\" she was probably rolling her eyes in deep thought, \"I dunno.\"<br>\r\n\"You dont know?\"<br>\r\n\"I uh, cant remember,\" she answered, \"I cant even think that far back.\"<br>\r\n\"Do you remember at least anything about your past life?\" you questioned.<br>\r\n\"Nope,\" she shook her head (you ignore the small snaps in her neck), \"last thing I remember is waking up in this big deep hole and Seiga asking me if I wanted to convert and I said yes.\" Dang. That's all she remembers? Bummer. Either her brain is that rotten or it's been an awful long time. \"Oh! By the way! Seiga told me to ask you to convert, too.\" Ugh. Shouldve expected those damn taoists to be stubborn.<br>\r\nYou groaned and responded, \"Tell her I said no.\"<br>\r\n\"Ok.\" And that was the end of it. Shouldnt have expected much from good ol' Yoshika.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after that conversation ended, so did the bath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whelp! Thanks for lending me a hand!\" Yoshika thanked you.<br>\r\nYour blushed a little and returned the thanks, \"Thanks for lending me one too!\"<br>\r\n\"I hope I forget the time tomorrow so we can bathe together again!\" you couldnt believe Yoshika just said that. You also cant believe how interested you were!<br>\r\nYou blushed again, \"Well... we'll see!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the naked jiangshi huddled over to her pile of clothes then over to the little Molech statue.<br>\r\n\"There you are, widdle Mowech! Did da big scawy hewatic hurt you? Dunt wowwy! Mommy's here now!\" <br>\r\n*CraaaaaaAACCK!* her hips let out a long crack when she bent over to pick it up!  Again you turn your head and tell your friend downstairs to stop doing what it's doing!

Seiga said there's gonna be this awesome eclipse happening outside!\" You fought off the disturbing thought of her going outside in the buff to see it!<br>\r\nWell, despite killing you, she has been pretty nice so far... nicer than certain OTHER inhabitants of this place, anyway!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" you happily oblige, trying not to stare, \"but uh, first you-\" On second thought, part of you kinda wants to see how far she's gonna go without noticing she's still naked! You know she's pretty dumb, but part of you wants to know just how dumb! Yeah, that's it! Just a joke! Absolutely NOT perverted in any way! C'mon, she's a zombie for Christ's sake!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, but first what?\" Yoshika asks with tilted her head with a snap.</span></div></div>",

You told her the info and she looked down, then getting little embarressed as you helped her get the cloth on. You questioned yourself if this was a good choice, to become a ghoul then after helping the jiangshi, you sigjed until..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Are you finished?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Your heart jolted (If it could jolt) as you turn around to see seiga leaning on the hole on the wall. You took breather as she chuckled, you sweated and looked at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Please don't do that!\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I was playing little.\" Seiga said, \"Anyway, will you join me and yoshika for a stroll? the eclipse will be beautiful.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n You thought for moment, and decided to go since you had nothing else to do. You nodded and she smiled as she guided you through the hole. Once you're out, you saw adalgar standing yawning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Adalgar? you're with her?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yeah, eclipse sighting.\" Adalgar replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I see.\" you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Seiga then directed all of you out of mausoleum and out to the grave sight. It was night time and you felt little fear as you somewhat could hear something from the grave. You and others followed seiga as within 20 minutes walk you were now in open field where you could see the vast landscape of gensokyo. You saw mountains, trees and near the place you stand stood a village.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"What village is that?\" You asked adalgar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"That's where ordinary humans lives.\" Adalgar replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You were surprised to heae that then seiga told you two to look as you looked up, you saw a red moon eclipse. You were amazed to see this and enjoyed the moment until  an arrow grazed your chin. You looked and saw three teenaged female with some sort of monk attire and had weapon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You bastard! you came back to kill our comrades again!?\uff02 One monk shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh dear, guess they came.\" Seiga said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Who're they?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Buddhist monks from the myoren temple. Guess they sent the monk warriors.\" Seiga replied, \"Shiro, canaanite, will you two give them favor?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Before you could replie seiga took the jiangshi and made the hole and fled. You didn't had that much of experience on fighting then you saw adalgar take out some sort of a card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Guess they don't learn.\" Adalgar said, \"Hey shiro, you have some spell cards right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What's spell card?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Adalgar sighed and used his ability to block off the enemy as a sky turned grey, a gust of rainstorm poured down infront of them sothey couldn't move forward. Adalgar told you to dig into you pocket and once you did, you felt something and when you took it out, you saw ten cards each with different pictures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"When we fight, we go under the spellcard rule, in which we use our power against the enemy without killing them.\" Adalgar said, \"And since you're the manipulator of diseases and viruses, you have that themed card.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I see.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You  can also shoot danmaku bullets, so go fullout on theme.\" Adalgar said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You nodded and after that, Adalgar stopped the storm, revealing the monk warriors with some minor damage. You saw adalgar grin as his arms covered with storm cloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Be proud as you three will become a sacrifice to my god baal!\" Adalgar shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He then dashed and started to shoot danmaku bullet.

You never knew he could fight as he was just a messanger, but you start to focus on fighting took one spellcard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Here I go, plague card 'raid of locusts'!\" you spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The card shined, and from the sky you heared some sort of buzzing noise. You immediatly realized the noise were actually the swarm of locusts aiming at the monk knights. You told adalgar to step away as he saw what was going on, he immediatly jumped back and created a strong storm wall. The  monks felt fear and about to flee but the locusts got them before them and started to gnaw on them. You heared their scream of pain as their blood start to come out, the locusts continue to eat them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"This card..Is powerful.\" You muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Of course, since we became a ghoul our strength and others has sharpened.\" Adalgar responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What about yoshika? she has terrible memory as if her brain is Rotten.\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Who knows..whelp, I think they're done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n With that, adalgar lifted the wall, revealing three body with blood on the ground, You smelled the horrible stentch as you two got closer you saw two monks eaten to its bones while other were eaten from waist below. The monk were female and she was gasping for life as you felt sorry for her, you saw adalgar come forward, placing the statue of baal on the head side of monk and took out a thick knife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Adalgar, what are-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Now then, you shall become an sacrifice to the overlord baal!\" Adalgar said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He oke before you could speak, adalgar  grinned and thrusted the knife down quickly and stabbed the knight. You turned away as the female gagged and flinched, she died. Adalgar quickly put some blood onto the alter of baal and put it to the side and bowed before it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Adalgar, that was cruel.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Cruel? this is just an religious ceremony.

You also noticed that she had a nice rack and she looked down at the corpses and knelt down. She closed the one female monk knights eyes and looked at both you and adalgar with menacing eyes. Yoy immediatly knew she was not the a kind of person to mess with and then she got up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Are you two the one who killed our monks?\" Female asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"...Yes, we did.\" You replied, admitting the reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She smiled and suddenly disappeared. You were surprised by this then suddenly adalgar pushed you to the side as the same woman appeared before him and gave strong punch on his chest, making a loud noise. You covered your eyes and once you lowered yourarms you saw adalgars left arm to his shoulders completely busted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Adalgar!\" You shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He then grabbed the womans arm and immediatly threw her to the sky and casted three strikes of lightning bolt on her.The first two missed but third lightning hit her right leg, making her hurt. You can see that even he is very strong as the woman landed, adalgar lightly smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You know we have both the tiger and mouse in our place. If you value their life, you should just retreat, Byakuren Hijiri.\" Adalgar said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You vile one, getting in the way of peace.\" Hijiri said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Before she could say anything else a big hole was made and from the other side seiga yanked your collar into the hole. You got up and looked back, seeing the mausoleum and looked at the hermit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Canaanite, both you and shiro's summoned by miko sama.\" Seiga said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I see, then I will go.\" Adalgar said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You will not get away!\" Hijiri shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You then felt an enormous amout of pressure from adalgar and from side of him you clearly saw the lightly visible man in some sort of traditional canaanite clothing and a helmet with two horn sticking to the air. Hijiri couldn't move as the pressure were big then adalgar spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You should be glad I would not sacrifice you my god baal. Now excuse me.\" Adalgar said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He turned around and went through the hole you saw the man disappear as seiga closed the hole. You two were quickly escorted to the mausoleum and went through the hallway and stopped at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Lady miko, the two is here.\" Seiga said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 'Let them in' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The hermit then opened the door and let you two in. You saw the same person who were giving the sermon sitting at the center of the room while you also saw the same people who were tied up. The female offered you two a seat and once sitting down, she poke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Greetings. I see this is first time shiro seeing me. I am toyosatomimi no miko, the head of this mausoleum.\" She greeted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Um..hello.\" You responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She smiled and adalgar asked the reason for coming here and she nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"These two members of myoren temple have been resisting the doctrine of taoism. I need one of you to take one of them to keep eye on them during night.\" Miko said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You blushed little as she was telling you adalgar to look out for them. You looked at adalgar and noticed him just nodding and agreeing with her. Miko then turned to your attention for your answer. Right now you had no choice as it was her and the taoist that not only accepted you in, they have given you new power within you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I guess I have no choice.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Wonderful.\" Miko said, \"Now then, I'll tell you now that they are powerless since I have put special barriers so they cannot use their power nor shoot danmaku.

Despite being technically undead, you did feel the desire to sleep. It was humid and possibly swarming with cockroaches, but somehow you had no trouble sleeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd despite being technically undead, you still dreamed. You still had that same damn nightmare. That same damn memory of that same damn moment the big bright future you had ahead of yourself suddenly got pissed away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyways, the urge to sleep was gone. And it's morning. You got dressed in the ceremonial garb that was already in your drawer and walked outside toward the Mausoleum's version of the mess hall. Wasnt much variety food wise that interested you. You were pretty sure some of the 'food' they served wasnt even food to begin with! But since you were hungry and craving protein you ordered what seemed the closest to edible which was curry and rice with chunks of questionable meat and carrots mixed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked for a bench to sit and eat, but far too many were already occupied by fellow taoists. If all else failed, you didnt mind standing and eating alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShiro! Over here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then you heard Seiga call you out and you had no choice but to head over to the small but fancy looking dining table reserved for her and her zombie subordinate which had one extra seat vacant! You took a deep breath but obediently walked over to them. Seiga continued giving you the cold stare she's always been giving you as she dines on her exotic grilled fish entree while Yoshika was too preoccupied with digging into her huge chunk of meat still on the bone (who knows what meat!).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning Kaku-sama,\u201d you properly address Seiga, who only stared back, \u201cgood morning, Yoshika.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMorning, Shoru!\u201d Yoshika hopped with excitement, \u201ccan I munch on you again, now?\u201d Ugh, THIS again?!<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cC'mon! Lemme taste your tasty meat again! I promise I wont bite you too hard!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI said no! Keep away!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSeiga! Tell Shobu to let me bite him!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs much as I'd love to let you dig in,\u201d replied the blue-haired bitch, \u201che is a necessary asset. So no more biting him.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAwww,\" Yoshika lowers her head and pouts. Thankfully that was the end of that for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA brief moment of eating later, Seiga cleared her throat then drank a little before turning your direction.<br>\r\n\u201cShiro, I've just had a long conversation with Toyosatomimi last night,\u201d she spoke, \u201cshe believes that despite your heresy, youre beneficial to the great spread of spiritual balance throughout the region and she'd like you to prove your worth.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI-Is it about that Yukari woman?\u201d you asked, \u201cI overheard her mentioning me.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDont worry about THAT woman,\u201d she responded with a tad of scorn in her voice, \u201cand dont ever bring up her name again, ok?\u201d Adalgar warned you.<br>\r\n\u201cS-Sorry, Kaku-sama.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAnyways, no. Not this time,\u201d she continued, \u201cyou see, we have a major threat that gets in the way of our goal of spiritual balance. It lives in the Myouren Temple and wishes to pervert the minds of innocent followers of faith with pure damning bollocks.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIs it Byakuren, Seiga?!\u201d Yoshika interrupted.<br>\r\n\u201cYoshika, please. Ahem. As I was saying, this wicked witch of the East and her loyal toadies have gotten wind of your escapades. And since you foolishly chose not to become a proper devotee, they'll most likely try to charm you into following THEIR brainwashed ideology!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDont worry Kaku-sama,\u201d you assure her, \u201cI'm not interested in converting PERIOD.\u201d<br>\r\nSeiga's stare grew a little more cold (for obvious reasons) but then brightened her glance. \u201cGood. Because Toyosatomimi is conjuring up a mission to have you infiltrate the Temple. Feign interest in their dangly-earlobed  sleeping idol and it's rainbow-haired cultleader, then as soon as they bite the bait, gather as much information of whatever planning, and make your way back here to report on your findings.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen do I start?\u201d you asked. She shrugged her shoulders.<br>\r\n\u201cI dunno. As soon as she gets her big plan down, she'll let you know. In the meantime,\u201d she wipes her mouth with the napkin prior to changing the subject, \u201cwe need to discuss your place here.\u201d Hoo boy. \u201cBecause you chose not to be a devotee, your membership among our ranks is still very limited. Your colleague Adalgar is an exception considering his experience in his previous job which means he's a tremendous asset to us. You\u2026 still need to earn your keep.\u201d Long story short, youre a ROOKIE.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh huh,\u201d was all you said as she kept talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cErgo, your particular rank is quite a bit lower than most around here,\u201d she states, \u201cso you keep you acclimated, I've assigned Yoshika to be in charge of you.\u201d HUH?!<br>\r\n\u201c!!\u201d Yoshika suddenly stopped chewing on her meat chunk as her eyes beamed with excitement! \u201cME?! I finally get a servant of my own to boss around now?! YAY!!!\u201dWas she serious?! Did she really make you a servant of that brain-dead simpleton?!<br>\r\n\u201cYoshika, I'm counting on you to help train the new recruit properly,\u201d Seiga tells her, \u201che's in your care, ok?\u201d<br>\r\nThe excited jiangshi nodded hard with determination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk Shadow!\u201d the zombie girl turns to you with a serious determined look, \u201cYou are now Miyako-sama's property! Whatever she says goes!\u201d This truly felt like a step down for you. A TREMENDOUS step down. Like any other step further down would send you plummeting off the face of the earth.<br>\r\n\u201cUnderstood,\u201d but you have to comply.<br>\r\n\u201cMy very first command as your master is\u2026 is\u2026 uuuuhhhh\u2026.\u201d on second thought, should you be worried that she's your new boss or RELIEVED?! \u201c\u2026..give me a back massage!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glanced over to Seiga who simply ushered her head to her lackie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk.\u201d as she ordered, you go behind Yoshika and begin massaging her back.<br>\r\n*CRAACKK!!*  But just as soon as you push your fingers in her skin, they made a loud cracking sound! You were worried that you broke something you shouldnt have!<br>\r\n\u201cOoohhhh\u2026.\u201d but she moaned with delight from it! So you continue!<br>\r\n*Crack!! Crack!! Crack!* her muscles went as your fingers pressed into the back of her shoulders, then traced from around her shoulder blades all the way down to her lower back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOooOOHH! That's the spot, Shyamalan! Dont stop! Ooooo!\u201d She panted, drooled, even stomped her foot on the ground like a dog in absolute ecstasy as your finger popped every bad muscle all across her back with a *Crack*!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeiga finally got sick of witnessing this little moment and decided to excuse herself.<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I'll leave you two to your work. If you'll excuse me, there's a few locked chests calling my name!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBye bye SeiGAAAHH*Crack!* OH YES!! YES, MAMA LIKE! MAMA LIKE!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer back massage could go on forever. It was impossible to get her back to stop cracking. Although she certainly wouldnt mind if you kept on trying!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, I think that's enough,\u201d you finally stop, \u201chow is your back feeling?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cA zillion times better thanks to my personal lackie!\u201d she said with glee as the reminder that you were her lackie made you cringe, \u201cyou really are a natural. You give great massages, you know how to scrub those hard to reach places, AND you taste super yummy! I'm really glad to have you here with us.\u201d She even gives you a thumbs up despite it possibly being a strain on her stiff joints!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd to be honest, you did feel pretty flattered by her statement. Sure it's a very ODD statement, but coming from her it's really saying something!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell...\u201d you try to keep a straight face, \u201cwhat shall we do next, Miyako-sama?\u201d</span></div></div>",

You signed, then you remembered about your partner and rival Abigail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Wonder what she's doing.\" You muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Just then, you've notice something flash. You turned to the mausoleum and it flashed again. You wondered what it was so you went back in and followed the flash. Once you opened the door, you saw a room filled with some artifacts and the body of Abigail laying on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Abigail!?\" You spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Just then you saw both seiga and adalgar come in with a bowl filled with some sort of liquid and you wondered what they are doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What are you two-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Shh! We're doing some ritual.\" Adalgar shushed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n They went to the body and seiga put fire in incense and spoke few ancient words. You didn't know what she was saying then she put the liquid on her mouth then the body. After few more chant, the incent became stronger and the body twitched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Let Mathis become the walking dead!\" Seiga spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The body twitches more then it stopped. You looked at the body then Abigail opened her eyes. She got up slowly as she looked around, she noticed you.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"...James? Is it you?\" Abigail asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Your alive!\" You spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Abigail then...</span></div></div>",

Which is ironic, considering this couldve been the last decision you've ever made in your entire life too. Either your faith just wasnt strong enough or youre that terrified of death so much that you deny yourself the key to the kingdom! Your family is spinning in their graves!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a brief moment to rethink this, but as soon as you turned your eye toward the foul smelling zombie chick that's drooling with anticipation, the moment quickly ends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you need me to sedate you first, just give me the word,\" Adalgar offers as he pulls out a syringe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no need,\" you inform him, \"I'll... convert.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdalgar looked stunned, not even noticing he dropped his syringe and stabbed his foot with it! Yoshika dropped her jaw... and quite an abnormally long tongue rolled out from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\"<br>\r\n\"WUUUTTT??!!!\" Both Adalgar and Yoshika shouted their surprise in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you serious?! But... I thought you were a proud Christian!\" spouted your former fellow associate, \"I mean, I've lost count of the number of times you've tried to convince my colleagues to attend Divine Liturgy with you!\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well...\" you took the cross off from around your neck, \"let's just say I'm beginning to doubt at this point in the game.\"<br>\r\n\"OH C'MOOOONN!!!\" the jiangshi whined as she hopped up and down for not getting her way, \"I aint eaten live flesh in like forever!!! C'mon!!! Just a little bite!\"<br>\r\n\"Not happening, smelly!\" you held your nose.<br>\r\n\"Smelly?!\" Yoshika pouted... then sniffed herself... and pouted some more, \"how rude!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared a bit at the cross, filling with regrets for your decision. It may have been a morally better decision to just die... but according to your former gang, youre already dead. Youre pretty sure all your friends and remaining family members already believe youre a goner. Might as well start anew with a clean state. Here's hoping you dont make the kinds of mistakes that the previous you made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you absolutely sure you want to do this?\" Adalgar questioned, \"because I'm gonna be honest. Even I refused to do it. I'm barred from most parts of the temple and the furthest I can excel here is quite possibly an army Lieutenant.\"<br>\r\nYou bit your lip. \"Yeah, I'm sure. So what do I do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth the zombie and the not-so-zombie stared blankly at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dont know,\" Adalgar answered, \"Yoshika, what does someone who wants to be a Taoist do from here?\"<br>\r\nShe stared silently... then looked upwards, \"Uhhhhhhhh... I forgot.\"<br>\r\n\"What do you mean you forgot?!\" the undead scandinavian snapped.<br>\r\n\"It was like hundreds of years ago!\" Paper-forehead bounced back, \"how am I supposed to remember all the initiation stuff Seiga made me do?!\"<br>\r\n\"Sorry, new blood,\" Ratatoskr groaned, \"we didnt honestly expect you were gonna change religions. This is... embarrassing, really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing's embarrassing about wanting to be a proud member of the flock!\" said a woman's voice from behind you. You quickly turn around but nothing's there... and the cross in your hand is gone! You turned back around and see a blue haired (in oriental entwined loops) woman in a blue dress with what you swear seeing is a slightly invisible white ribbon hovering around her! She smiled a smile that looked like it was sweet but hinted shady motives as she held your cross in her hand. \"As a proud long-time representative of the Hall of Dreams, I welcome you, dear child!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdalgar forceful sucked in air, but bowed as soon as the woman faced his way.<br>\r\n\"Hi Seiga!\" Yoshika casually called out to her master.<br>\r\n\"Lady Kaku,\" Adalgar took the more submissive approach, \"it's a surprise to see you here. I thought you were in the middle of a sermon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I decided to cut it short,\" she stated just before turning to you with a smile, \"as soon as I heard that we had such a strapping newcomer to my-OUR ranks.\"<br>\r\nDespite sensing something off about her, you politely bowed, \u201cIt's a pleasure to meet you, ma'am. Thank you for allowing me refuge in your humble abode.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThe pleasure's all mine, child!\u201d Seiga smirked a little wider (Adalgar exhaled hard), \u201cthank you for taking the opportunity to open your heart to the true path toward spiritual and universal balance and understanding passed down from the teachings of Liozi\u2026 ooo, are those real diamonds?\u201d Seiga observed the jewels encrusted on our cross, \u201cAhem! You'll find that the path of Tao has much to offer you. Infinitely more than any bra-stuffing budhist with really awful hair coloring can even fathom giving you besides a sexual transmitted disease.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYoure talking about Hijiri, right Seiga?\u201d quipped Yoshika.<br>\r\n\u201cYoshika? How many times have I told you not to mention that bitch to me by name?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201c...Uhhhhhhh...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNevermind,\u201d Seiga sighed to her undead and possibly unclean minion while still facing you, \u201cthere's a Southern Gate that still needs guarding. Would you and Heretic Sentry Adalgar be dears and assist our Southern Guard?\u201d 'Heretic Sentry'?<br>\r\n\u201cI already know the way,\u201d Adalgar insists, \u201cc'mon Yoshika. Good luck, new blood.\u201d The two of them left the scene and thankfully so did the smell. However, it didnt make you feel less uneasy, because there was something about Seiga's smile\u2026 even after she crammed your old cross down her blouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d you swallowed, \u201cI'm curious. Now that I've volunteered to convert, what do I do from here?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell, in all honesty, it's really not that simple,\u201d Seiga admitted, but the smirk said otherwise, \u201cyou see, not all those interested in Taoism are accepted into the Mausoleum. Many devoted Taoists dont even earn such honor.  One's spirit as well as mind and especially body must be ready to absorb the advanced teachings.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs there a special class or sermon I have to attend?\u201d you asked, \u201cdo I get baptized? ...Circumcised? Because I'm already...\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cREALLY?!\u201d her eyes nearly beamed out of her head but she quickly shook and regained composure, \u201cum, well child, there are certain trials and tests one must perform in order to gain true acceptance. But first of all, we do have to go through a few\u2026 ahem\u2026 particular rituals as a newcomer of Tao.\u201d That last part almost sounded like it was ad-libbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raised your eyebrow. \u201cWhat kind of rituals?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeiga swallowed, \"Well the first one... I will need you to remove all your clothes.\"<br>\r\n\"WHY?\" you didnt think about it for more than a nanosecond. You just immediately asked why.<br>\r\n\"So that I can bless you!\" in her hand, a jar what looked to be some type of glitter appeared in her hand.<br>\r\n\"What's that?\"<br>\r\n\"A special blessing salt,\" Seiga and her smile, \"I'll need to coat your nak-er, uncleansed body in it as part of the blessing.\" You squinted your eyes at the jar of blessing salt. It sounds a bit weird, but maybe it's cuz it's a foreign faith unfamiliar to you. Almost as unfamiliar as Seiga's smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well? What are you waiting for?\" Seiga didnt want to wait, \"hurry, child! Take off your clothes!\"</span></div></div>",

Shou was a klutz as she always lose the jewel pagoda and nazrin look for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I swear, I don't even know why lord bishamonten entrusted you with such treasure.\" nazrin said stressfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"It's not like I'm doing on purpose.\" Shou replied with teary eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Do too much and it LOOKs lik you're doing on purpose!\" Nazrin replied angerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shou eeped then suddenly nazrins dowsing rods pointed the direction.

Shou closed her eyes, but she was pushed side way and fell. She opened her eyes only to see her partner stabbed on the chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Nazrin!! Nooo!\" shou shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The lime green aura covered the two and once faded mira fell to the ground and nazrin landed safely. She looked at her eyes and had an disappointed face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Tsk, the girl interrupted...oh well, I can use this body to get more information.\" nazrin spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Mira now possessed nazrin, and judas picked miras body. Shou became angry and was about attack until an evil aura surrounded nazrin. A shadow of six devil wings appeared behind her and shou became afraid. She knew she was no match for her and mira spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Now tell me where my lucian is..or I will gnaw on you so good you will feel death come quick.\" mira said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Just then, a shadow quickly came and snatched shou, then fled.

It was an empty gem necklace encrusted with silver filigree. It was bigger than regular jewelry, and it had some runes on it. Mira was disgusted by the gem in her hand, knowing what it is capable of. She breaks it by stomping it hard to the ground. The two girls went over to her and gave her their thanks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you two didn't do anything wrong. They were the ones who were drunk on power. You don't have to worry about them anymore.\" She smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started stretching while analyzing the dead taoist followers.

After all, she knows how much you hate those who are overzealous for power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If only those traitors didn't scare him off like that. Now, he probably thinks I hate him.\" Mira said with a hint of anger. \"And that valkyrie bitch is going to make things-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, her cellphone started ringing.

In it stood dante and she was waiting for someone until a person came out. It was mira and judas and they leapt out from the void as they were expecting the nun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"So you truly came, dante valentine.\" Mira said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You know why I'm here heretic.\" Dante replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She just chuckled and snapped her fingers, then suddenly from where dante stood a huge shadow bursted, engulfing her. The templer knights tried to do something until slightly muscular knight stopped them. Miras eyes were narrow as the shadow still engulfed the nun, a three lines of pure light suddenly bursted and destroyed the darkness, revealing dante with light blue wings on her back and the silver cross that big enough to fit her hand. Mira were surprised little then just sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You always amazes me, Dante. You're truely are a holy one as your master says.\" Mira said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You should think about your safety beforehand heretic. Now I shall dispell you magic!\" Dante spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She then rushed toward her but before she could eject miras soul from nazrin, judas swung his arm very strong, making dante narrowly dodge the attack. Judas walked forward, taking out twin hatchet and swung at her. Dante quickly drew her sword and defended herself then she immediatly concentraited the holy power to the cross and shoved it toward judas, causing him to scream and backed off with some melted skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"That is fine trick dante. You, who merged with your love to paradise, now here and taking that poor-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You better close your mouth, heretic!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Dante interrupted what mira were saying then one of miras scout came and whispered to her ears. Sme smiled and gave dante the yandere looked and backed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"It seems lucian dear is found. Well then, I must bid farewell dante of the templers.\" Mira said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Wait!\" Dante shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Dante rushed to stop her but she and her crew went into the void and closed. Dante gotten annoyed by this but calmed herself down then from behind a tall man in monks robe approached her. She noticed hime and bowed to him lightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Virgil, you arrived.\" Dante said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The man took down his hood, revealing an middle-aged man with mid-long black hair and green eyes. His name is virgil, father of his roman catholic church and a poet at the same time. He was very respected father as he always have been honest and loved people. When he was 23 years old, he had gotten a power to see the sins of mortals while dante had the ability to either absolve or punish the sinner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I notice that you fought against the heretic, dante.\" Virgil said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yes, virgil. Mira would have been punished if one of her colleague didn't stopped me.\" Dante replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Virgil nodded and told her to start looking for mira by going to the village near the forest. She nodded and startec to march with the templer knights as virgil followed them. Back at myoren temple, you and shou gotten ready to go to human village to get clue on tge whereabout on nazrin.

You heart skip a beat when you saw the young girl had red eyes, orange hair in a twin tails style. She wears a checkered kimono, green shirt, and yellow apron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greeting Shou, how may I help you today?\" The girl asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl notice you and introduced herself as Kosuzu Motoori, the girl who works here and has the ability to decipher books by simply touching them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Kosuzu do you have a clue where Nazrin is?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nazrin? Hmm, I think so.\" Kosuzu replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Please tell me everything you know!\" Shou said with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I'm correct... I have seen a person with mouse ears the other day, I think was it was Nazrin since the youkai was female and had that basket on her tail. She went to the direction toward the forest of magic.\" Kosuzu said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Right where we met that girl.' Shou thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou now have a new destination, go to the forest of magic and find out if that was Nazrin. You and Shou thanked Kosuzu for the info before leaving. After you left, Kosuzu couldn't help but wonder why you acted funny where you saw her enter the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, too late to ask him now. Hopefully next time.\" Kosuzu said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Shou headed for the exit next to the magic forest. You wanted to stay and learn the village a little more, but there's no time for that. Shou asked if you're ready for this, you nodded then enter the forest. You both headed toward the area where Nazrin was supposedly to be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I guess this is where you last saw Nazrin.\" You look over to Shou.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, not quite. It's a little further into the woods. Hmm, strange...\" Shou said, noticing something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" You asked, looking at the direction where Shou was facing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw something moving behind the tall grass.

Those fur balls are youkai?\" You rise an eyebrow at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, like I said. Gensokyo is a dangerous place and you need to know how to defend yourself if you're planning to travel.\" Shou replied with spear in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen two more fur balls appear with the one that's already sighted. Hopping in a playful(?) matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just head in. Maybe they won't attack us if we don't provoke them.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure you want to do that?\" Shou sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking a few steps the fur balls stop what they were doing and just looked at you. You were frozen in place, wondering if you cross the line. You still have your sword with you in case you need to defend yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, no reason to fight something that doesn't attack first.\" You said, before immediately dodging a tackle. \"Woah, hey, back off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch out Luican!\" Shou said as she wack the fur ball with her spear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Shou, I'm guessing those guys won't leave us now.\" You draw out your sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. The youkai before us are called Kedamas, they may look cute and cuddly, but don't let that fool you.\" Shou replied, and you nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first you thought the Kedama were an type of animal youkai because of the fur, but Shou pointed out that they are a lesser spirit youkai since they have no personalities and they're nature itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So they're basically an empty husk?\" You frowned. \"That... sounds like a sad existence there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Kedamas are just materialization of a natural phenomena. So they're incapable to think like that.\" Shou said. \"Here they come!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree Kedamas as you count them out, approached forward. Shou went first. She sidestep the one that tried to tackle you and slash it down. Causing it to 'puff' into thin air. You were next. You waited for a Kedama to toss itself to you. You then quickly position yourself where the target Kedama is vulnerable, and slash it twice. The first hit only damage it, but the second one cause it to puff into thin air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'OK. Weird how there's no blood, but I guess that's how spirits work.'</i> You check your sword for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes quickly lock on the last remaining Kedama. You were thinking of charging in for the kill (even though spirit-type youkai can't truly die) until the final Kedama inflated itself and fired a good amount of projectiles in a 360 angle. Shou gracefully dodge the attack, but you got hit at the arm. Fortunately, it didn't hurt you at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I barely felt the sting!\" You said, recovering instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dodge another wave of those projectiles, until you notice Shou twirl her spear and told you to stand back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spell time! 'Absolute Justice'!\" The tiger said, pointing her spear at the Kedama.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the surrounding area got dark. Six blue laser beams shot out around Shou and aim directly at the Kedama. It didn't stand a chance. (All the sudden Megaman's Final Smash?)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Jeez, Overkill much?'</i> You mutter, after seeing that attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the battle. You and Shou continued your search through the woods. You both were almost to the place where Nazrin was supposedly to be sighted, until...</span></div></div>",

When I met, I stared to like her while fell in love with me. That changed when my dad was killed and my family went missing that I started to doubt about mira and soon I defected the gang.\" You explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I see, so that's the story.\" Shou said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As you two walked deeper into the forest, shou started to smell something. She smelled something that was too familiar and walked faster as you wondered whats the rush and catched up to her. She told you she smells blood and once you got out of the forest, you two saw corpses lying around the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Who did this such thing?\" Shou spoke in some fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"...This is  miras scouts.\" You said, easly realizing the corpses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shou turned to you as you looked at the corpses, you saw all of the corpses had the cross symboled wounds and burnes on their body.

However, Dante wasn't going to let you escape that easy. So she draws out her sword and cross, and was going to strike down Mamizou. Fortunately, the nun wouldn't think a nude tanuki would pull a cheap trick. Because when Dante got close enough, Mamizou activate her spellcard 'Futatsuiwa Clan's Curse' she lifted her palm and blows out lots of smoke.

Mira, who is still mounted on you with your arms pinned by hers. Looked down and smiled seductively upon hearing that. Which you just realize one thing; she haven't killed you. So wait, she didn't send those grunts to kill you in the first place?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it. I waited too long for this.\" Mira licked her lips. \"Now it's time for what I was dying to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't want me dead?\" You sweated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dead? Who said I wanted you dead? I told those grunts to capture you alive.\" Mira replied, then whisper in you ear. \"And anyone who dare harm my beloved Lucian, deserve to suffer a painful death.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Mira never intended to end your life? While you do acknowledge that yanderes would never want their loved ones to be killed. You couldn't help but wonder why those grunts thought it was a good idea to bring you back dead in the first place. Was it because it would be easier? Or was it something else?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now to awaken your dormant mag-\" Mira was inches away from kissing your virgin lips until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Knock* *Knock*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou all heard the knock on the door. Mira cursed then pull herself away to possess Nazrin again and hide her body from sight (And she probably wants you to keep her presence a secret).

There you are Lucian, would you mind coming with me?\" Byakuren asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, well, um...\" You mutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're not sure if you should say yes or no for whatever is on Byakuren's mind. Mira had a feeling that Byakuren is trying to make you hers, judging from the smile. She took your hands and held them with hers before saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be shy, it'll be refreshing. Besides, you might learn something about yourself.\" Byakuren smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe guided you out the room and Mira was going to follow you two until she was stop by the other members. The possessed Nazrin was annoyed by this as Byakuren took you away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Nazrin, could you tell us how you escape?\" Shou asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, tell us.\" Murasa smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Of course, where do I begin?\" Mira spoke. <i>'Dammit, this tiger youkai has the worst timing!'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, You and Byakuren were at the front door of the room that belongs to Byakuren. She open the door for you, so you enter first. It was a nicely design bedroom with bookcases, dressing room, table, and a round queen size bed with purple curtains. You felt like there's something about you that only Byakuren and Mira knows. (And maybe Dante)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady Hijiri, do you know something that I don't?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you having trouble, tapping your inner power?\" She spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Huh?\" You sweated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At first, I wasn't too sure what this faint power was. Now, that answer is closer than ever.\" Byakuren walks up to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice Byakuren is acting similar to Mira during that one time when you had the dream. You remember Mira said something about awakening before she tried to kiss you, until a memory became clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Flashback-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you feel the power we share?\" Mira said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will find out soon enough... but now, you need to rest up.\" Mira said. \"My warlock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-End of Flashback-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-warlock...\" You mutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you realize.\" Byakuren smiled. \"You realize that you may have mageblood in your veins.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, wait. I thought only female humans can gain the ability to use magic?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Male humans can if certain conditions are met. One of your parents' bloodlines may had magic-wielders in them, or perhaps there were human/witch relationships that gave offspring.\" The Buddhist witch explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMan that's some Final Fantasy 6 shit right there. But it did hit you like a ton of bricks. Do you really have the power of magic inherited from your family? Byakuren told you that learning magic would feel more natural as opposed to a human who doesn't have mageblood. But since you're male the power starts off dormant and it needs to wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, so how do I awaken it?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe push you on to the soft bed, then open up a drawer to grab something. She told you first, that in order to find out if her hypothesis is true, she have to get physical to see how the power would react when your body is feeling... happy, for a lack of a better word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What... Lady Hijiri! Aren't you a monk?\" You blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, true, but an honest person shouldn't leave others in the dark.\" Byakuren smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt embarrassed what had to be done. She's going play with you for while before you finally get the answer. Mira would go ape shit if she see 'the research' going on. What would the other members think if they saw this?

It's time for you to caste down to judecca!!\" Dante shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n (Not if I can help it) Mira thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She then chanted a spell and a big circle were made and warped both you, ichirin and herself.

Miko and her companion gotten annoyed, then Dante took the cross and a sacred light lit and shoved it toward her. Hijiri resisted, but Dante overpowered her and hit her hard, making her body disintegrate. Shou and others screamed her name and Dante did the same to everyone except the Taoist.

Along with a pale skinned girl in red/black clothes, blue cap, and a some paper on her forehead. You don't know who these people are until the one in blue leaned over to you, juggling her boobs up and down a little, then stopped when she spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you're the warlock that Dante was talking about?\" The woman smile seductively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and who wants to know?\" You remain on ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Seiga Kaku. The 'wicked' hermit that Dante called me. And this is my pet zombie, Yoshika Miyako\" Seiga observe you. \"Don't worry Lucian, your Mistress Seiga will take very good care of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master... is this...\" The pale girl spoke in a weak voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Yoshika, we have a real live warlock.\" Seiga licked her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had a bad feeling about this Seiga person when she said that. She must be the one that bonded you with ribbons when you woke up. You got up and was about to leave until Seiga told you there's a way to beat Dante easy. You didn't want to conform with this woman, but you had to know Elizabeth whereabouts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, what do you had in mind?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, you must be hungry. Lets talk this over a meal.\" Seiga smiled and you agreed. \"Wonderful! Now, this way cutie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cling your arm then guided you to the location of the dinner room with Yoshika following you behind. She was rubbing her body a bit, more noticeable her chest, against your left arm as she smiled mischievously. You realize that her bust size was almost as impressed as Byakuren's, where ever other taoist is either flat or small chested. (Now you know why Mira called them the washboard brigade) Eventually, you three reached the dinner room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then, you two have a seat while I ask the cooks to get the food.\" Seiga said before leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Yoshika took a seat at a table and waited for Seiga's return. You didn't like this zombie girl at all as she was staring you at the other side of the table. But if she does ever attack you, you could probably easily burn her down with your one and only magic attack. Yoshika was drooling on what to say until she finally spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sooo ummm... that valkyrie was a big meeeannnie... riiight?\" Yoshika spoke in her zombie like tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Valkyrie?\" You looked at her. \"Are you talking about Dante?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's riiight. Dante vanill-tine...\" Yoshika saying her last name wrong. (She has a rotting brain after all)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew what valkyries are, divine female warriors from a land known as Valhalla. You found that loathsome that someone like Dante would be divine, so you agreed with Yoshika on that one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. She really is full of herself.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know riiight? She hates my master sooo much and called her a sellout of a hermit, but my master called her a top-class moralwhore...\" The pet zombie replied, earning a chuckle from you. \"Except... I'm not suppose to say the 'w' word.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I won't tell anyone.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOK, maybe the zombie girl isn't that bad. Seiga eventually came back and told you that the food will come out in a bit. She sat with you two and that bad feeling about her came back. Does this woman have a thing for warlocks? Normal human men can't use magic unless they have mageblood. So...</span></div></div>",

She explains that this is a talisman that negates the victims power once put on their body. If it put on their forehead, it will make them temporarily blind. You knew you had to find out about your younger sister so you thanked her, ate some more and left the scene. You looked for that crusader until you saw her outside, kneeling.

Finally, two male taoist came with the food and Seiga was at least merciful to stop her little footjob. You and Seiga were given a bowl of chicken soup with futomaki rolls as a side dish while Yoshika was given a tray of some meat that had bone sticking out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yaaay!

They left the scene as you three started eating the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I have an idea of where you can start practicing with your newly awaken power.\" Seiga said after her first spoon. \"I think you're more than qualified to get it done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um sure. That would be cool, but I don't know any other spell aside the fireballs.\" You reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said I'll supplied you with the necessary materials. I do have a spell tome for handsome young novices like you.\" Seiga spoke sweetly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Didn't she said finding a spell tome is a pain?'</i> You thought before speaking. \"Alright, so where is the book?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's in my room. We should leave around 4 o'clock.\" Seiga replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4 o'clock? That's about an hour and a half from now. That should give you more than enough time to eat your food and find the book. You ask where and what this place is but Seiga wants to keep it as a surprise. As Yoshika was almost done with her cooked lamb you finally get to eat one of the futomaki rolls. You heard of such food but never got to eat one in general.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'It's... long and thick...'</i> You observe it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn the roll at one end and started eating it from there. It was delicious food with soft seaweed wrapping and sushi pieces, but... you felt like there's something wrong. You notice Seiga was giggling as you swallow the first bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nothing. Please, continue.\" Seiga smiled. \"You should use your tongue more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOK. You resume eating the futomaki roll and this time you use your tongue whenever you're sticking it in your mouth. You then let your tongue to lick the roll before biting it, then rinse and repeat until there's no more. You suddenly felt eerie vibes and you're 99% sure it had something to do with the wicked hermit, who is resting her head with one arm and her other out of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Wish she would stop staring at me.'</i> You thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put the last piece of the roll in your mouth.

Fufufu.\" She quickly replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were a bit skeptical upon hearing that. She told you where her room is so you can pick up the book. You thanked her for directions then left the dinner room. You got some strange looks on your way. Some of the monks and hermits whispered behind your back making you all the more eager to leave. Eventually, you find the room and open the door. You immediately smell a strong fragrance of some sort of mint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ding, that's a strong scent. Better find it quick.\" You mutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou enter the very feminine bedroom with some erotic designs here and there. You had the gut feeling that you shouldn't stand idle for too long.

Sadly, not a single one was the tome you were looking for. Many of them werent in any language familiar to you.

God, why is there so much blood flowing to your crotch?!<br>\r\n\u201cOh, and it's a pretty powerful aphrodisiac, too,\u201d Seiga lamented as your impulses ran wild, \u201cDoki-Doki plant extract \u2026 acquired absolutely perfectly legally from the Myouren Temple! It's so potent, it's used to cure impotence on onis.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cImpoTENCE on OniiIIIIs?!!\u201d those tingles got hella strong after that! And right on cue, Seiga suddenly looks and smells absolutely fragrant and inviting to you. Then again, so would her zombie side-kick at this rate, most likely!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm so SO sorry, Lucian!\u201d Seiga didnt sound very sorry, \u201cit must be really unbearable for you! I'll take full responsibility for relieving your excruciating pain!\u201d It wasnt really 'excruciating', but your body certainly aint used to gaining erections of THIS magnitude!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd 'relieving your excruciating pain' involved the lecherous hermit undoing her dress! Suffice to say, she had a 'hands on' approach to relieving you.<br>\r\n\u201cN-n-no, that's quite alright, M-Mistress Seiga!\u201d you nervously assured her as you tried to hide the rather large bulge sticking out in your pants! \u201cY-y-you dont need to d-do that!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh, but I insist,\u201d Seiga insisted as she wiped drool from her lip, \u201cit's the least I can do for causing such distress for you. My body is yours as you see fit.\u201d Damn lecherous hermit! This was her plan all along, wasnt it?! (AH DURR!!! COULDA KNOCKED ME DOWN WITH A FEATHER!!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face went red, your cheeks were flushed, sweat was dripping down, and thoughts of pinning this hermit to the ground and collecting the debt she owes you forcefully dominate your mind! But your will is strong! You resist!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-Y-you dont need to do this,\u201d you tell her,\u201dI-I-I'm sure this\u2026 feeling will go away over tiiIIIIiiime!\u201d Wow, what a tingle! How you didnt suddenly explode in your pants then and there is quite impressive!<br>\r\nSeiga sighs, \u201cYou poor boy. How can I possibly just stand there and watch you suffer like this? Here, just lie down and relax.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cN-No, I wont-\u201d her body suddenly began to glow and next thing you knew, you found your arms and legs pinned down against her bed by an invisible force! Seiga wasted no time floating onto the bed and lying over you. Your heart raced. Your boner was desperately attempting to tear through your ever so tight pants!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's alright, dear Lucian\u201d Seiga whispered as she wiped a little blood from her nostril, \u201cjust relax and let dear ol' Kaku-senpai take care of the rest.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNO WAIT DONT!!!\u201d you scream as she quickly pulled down your pants!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Her pervy grin quickly dropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...What?\u201d she gazed down at your member in complete disbelief.<br>\r\nYour face went red with embarrassment, practically never been more embarrassed in your entire life, while her jaw dropped from what she was looking at.<br>\r\nFor Seiga was staring blankly with widened eyes at...</span></div></div>",

Is this suppose to scare me or something?\" Seiga put a finger on her chin. \"Although pushing her buttons could be fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mistress Seiga, is there even time foOOOor this?\" You spoke, still trying to resist the aphrodisiac.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh relax we have plenty of time to kill.\" She assured you. \"Just leave it to me. Kaku-senpai will take very good care of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"V-Very good c-c-care of me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grab your manhood and gave it a nice squeeze, sending a surge of ecstasy electrifying through your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EEEEEEEEEEEEKK!!!

THE HORAS! FUCKIN A!!!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started stroking the tip of your manhood as you shutter there helplessly. You felt your resistance slipping away as each stroke made you come closer and closer to ejaculation. Seiga felt your penis leaking some of your love fluids and giggled at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fufufu, the tip is like a marshmallow! Hora~.\" Seiga's palm was cover in pre-cum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't tease me... not there...\" You moan in delight until you felt the release coming. <i>'No. No no no. I-I'm pass the point of no return. I-I got to cum!'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeiga continue rubbing the tip with one hand as she apply her other hand to stroke your manhood. You were quivering with pleasure as you were close of letting out your load. The horny hermit sped up her pace while giggling and saying 'Hora' as your where getting milked. Finally, you thrust your hips upwards and achieved a wonderful ejaculation that lasted 6 or 7 squirts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fufufufufu! So lewd! And even after that, you're still hard?\" Your nymphomaniac mistress smiled. \"Ready for the next step?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next s-step? Eh?!\" You look over her. Seeing a lewd smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe crawl on top of you while squishing her enormous breasts were touching you. As she made her amorous advances, you felt your penis entering her vagina as her hips move up and down very slowly to tease you into submission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mistress... you're driving me crazy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be silly, any man would love to be subjected to pure ecstasy.\" Seiga licked her lip as she place her lovely boobs up on your face. \"Suck my breasts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmph, mmph.\" You suck her nipples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did what you were told and suck one of her voluptuous breasts. Seiga yelped in surprise and held on tight by warping her arms around your head with your face partly buried by her bountiful boobs. You felt her moist vagina pumping your penis like mad and Seiga moaned loudly with every thrust she did. You feel the second orgasm coming but you couldn't say anything, you just kept sucking on her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh! I can't hold on anymore! I'm cumming!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment you released a larger load of your hot love into Seiga that made her squeal in bliss and trembled as she came too. Your mind became blanked and your body was fatigued of the two wonderful orgasms. With eyes closed, you can feel Seiga lying next to you. She let out a little laugh while stroking your hair with this particular love like a mistress would have for her cute little pet. After about 15 minutes of resting (and hopeful the aphrodisiac has wore off). You open your eyes and sat up to stretch your arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it done?\" You wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm, such lewd passionate love making we did.\" Seiga hugged you from behind. \"You made an lonely woman happy.

A chill you were dreading.<br>\r\nThe chill intensified as you closed in on some sort of abandoned fortress gathering moss. There was not much to see except a few destroyed monuments, a donation box gathering cobwebs, and lots of candles long burned out. These ruins looked to have been abandoned for ages. Yet, you didnt feel lonely. The chill was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSTOP RIGHT THERE TRAITOR!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAint nowhere to run now, asshole!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamnit! Idiots! Why did they have to still follow you?! If only they realized. You werent running for your life! You were running for THEIRS! You were trying to SAVE them. If only they didnt follow you, they wouldnt be targets. From your guardian angel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe angel of death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dont know who she is or why she follows you, but for some goddamned reason, she would never leave you alone. Near the unfortunately end of your career as a young respected mafioso, you had sightings of a white-haired angel in a blue dress with a glowing shield-like insignia on it wielding an orb scepter. Once in a while, you could spot her in the distance, through the window or reflection in the rear view mirror, sometimes while you sleep you could barely see her over your bed watching you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first you thought you were seeing things. Then she started doing things.<br>\r\nThe angel killed. Whenever your life was in danger, your perpetrator would meet his often gruesome end via her divine intervention.<br>\r\nWhen you were threatened in an alley by rival gangsters, she was there to break their necks. When hitmen shot up your safehouse, she was there to propel a few of their own bullets into their skulls. When a truck almost ran you over, an ungodly beam of destructive light blew it right off the road. Dang near every one of your boss's enemies that went up against you, died screaming, you could hear their screams echo when you sleep. <br>\r\nYou moved up the ranks fast thanks to her, but then your own colleagues went up against you too. When Paulo got drunk and challenged you to a fight out back, your angel learned how flammable his booze-soaked carcass was. Paulo's friends came after you\u2026 they were founded dumped in open graves the next morning. Mr. Salvatore's son Leo tried to put a hit on you\u2026 all the kings horse's and all the king's men couldnt put Leo's chopped up body back together again. That was the final straw with your boss. Mr. Salvatore had you escorted to his office tied up and gagged so he could put you down himself\u2026 by the time you came to, you were freed and surrounded by a pile of fellow associates with their throats torn open!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuys! You need to get away!\u201d you pleaded with those goons as they descended toward you with guns pointed your way, \u201cyou need to get outta here!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou fucking ungrateful brat,\u201d spits one of your stubborn associates, \u201cMr. Salvatore took your worthless ass out of the gutter and THIS is the thanks you give him?!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cFor the last time, I didnt kill him!\u201d you explained yourself, \u201cI didnt kill any of them! Sariel did!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cShut up!\u201d the other guy screamed, \u201cshut the fuck up! I'm getting tired of listening to your bullshit!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI swear! Sariel's doing all this!\u201d you try to talk sense into them, \u201cyou guys need to run or she'll hurt you too!\u201d No luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSay your prayers, traitor!\u201d You gave a quick silent prayer that your guardian angel would spare these fools.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour prayer fell on deaf ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as soon as he could pull the trigger, you caught a glimpse of one your former comrades set ablaze! He let out a howling roar of agony as Sariel's Hellfire consumed his body!<br>\r\nThe other guy panicked, looking around, pointing the gun in all directions. He shouldve looked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGyaagghh!\u201d you paled at the sight of that gunman's neck squeezed beyond the breaking point in Sariel's grip! You could hear his throat cave in from the tight superhuman grip. You hoped he completely suffocated before she set his body a light in Hellfire and tossed his burning corpse to the darkness!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was just you and her. The chills intensified as she locked eyes with you. You shivered like a frightened cat. Of all the times you spent in the mafia when your life was actually threatened, this was the only moment that truly made you want to curl into a ball and find a happy place. You wanted to wake up from this horrible nightmare, but you just couldnt open your damn eyes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shivered and shook and mumbled under breath as Sariel approached you, possibly intrigued by your fear!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-S-STAY BACK!!\u201d you pointed your gun at her, \u201cDONT C-COME ANY CLOSER!!\u201d Sariel showed no change in her emotionless facade. Either she knew your gun was ineffective against an angel of death or she knew it was even loaded!<br>\r\nWhat is it with this woman?! What the hell does she want from you?! Why is she so interested in 'protecting' you?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever the reason, pointing an empty gun at an angel is not gonna solve your problems. Perhaps it'd be in your best interest to just drop your gun and give yourself up. Maybe you'll find some answers that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut just as you were about to, you noticed the temple's doors suddenly opened. A potential means of escape? Are you kidding? What makes you think whatever's inside is any safer than here?!<br>\r\nThen again, what makes you think it isnt? Can you trust HER any more than whatever's within the ruined temple?<br>\r\nSpeaking of trust, she did save your life multiple times\u2026 dont you kinda owe her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, Sariel is still approaching you. Better make up your mind fast.</span></div></div>",

You pulled out your handgun and pointed at her as she looked back at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"This is the end of the line for you, my pretty.\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You wont kill me, I`ll jump and kill myself before you do.\" She replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Try, bitch. I am quick with the gun.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She then jumped backward, you immediatly shot three time at her, hitting her chest area and fell. You ran and looked as you saw a huge purple hole open and getting the girl.
