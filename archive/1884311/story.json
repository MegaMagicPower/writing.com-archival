This is the passage to a random story, what you see in front of you are roads, roads, and roads that never seem to end but never start in the beginning. Some even have colors much like the Yellow Brick Road, without the bricks. Some don't even start from the \"middle\". That and some have ninjas walking down them with wingless-flying pigs, while others tend to have cats that breathe in water that breaks the sense of science, since you can walk into it and it stands with nothing making it.<br>\r\nWell before I break out saying anything bad, laughing, or making any jokes.

Anyway tearing your eyes away from said road leading <b>somewhere</b> that didn't exist moments before as you walked said path like 20 seconds ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your left, is a path barely illuminated had the feeling of a dark maybe horror feeling, something that had no set words to describe but still felt as if hope was at the end of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the middle, is a path that is quite bright but extremely unsettling so, a path that you feel must lead somewhere that it doesn't want to lead, a path of turns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your right, is path that has both feelings of the two that doesn't leave any distinct feeling or feeling of ending.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the nightmare ro---I mean... totally normal road! Yeah, let's go with that. A path of uncertain endings, madness and insanity as well as calm and sanity existing in one place. Neither really dominate nor subtle, quite scary to think about but I guess that's what they call random.</span></div></div>",
