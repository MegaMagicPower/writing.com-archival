Taking the orb from one of the bags and into her hands she ran to her room. As she laid down in her bed she looked at the orb. The possibilities were endless.

'Well this is a rip-off, I don't get a swim- ah\" Runo said as she was about to give up on the wishm but saw the swimsuit right there waiting for her. It was exactly what she wanted: A yellow bikini top, a pair of swimming panties that looked ultra-stretchy, and a scuba tank labeled \"Runo\" in yellow letters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuno ran over to her new swimming clothes and admired them. \"Wow, now I can go swimming in style. Yeah\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuno celebrates her first wish being granted. \"I can't wait to go swimming in these\". Runo was anxious to try swimming with the swimsuit and diving gear, but she was taken with the curiousity of the kind of wishes she could make. She could defy the very laws of nature and physics themselves and get away with it. But she knew great power like this shouldn't be taken lightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, what do i do? Swimming's great but, wishing for anything i want sounds a lot more interesting right now\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does she do?</span></div></div>",

Her position as a reporter\u2014and best reporter in town\u2014earned her front row seats in the best shows in town. It was definitely a perk, especially when the person performing onstage was one of the most attractive she had ever seen. This one was no exception. \"Magnus the Magnificent\" was his name, and magic was his game. So far, he had done such dazzling tricks as having a woman come up on stage and pulling her own cat out of the man's hat, then her son's lizard and his puppy. If that wasn't amazing on its own, Magnus took a bald cancer patient onto then tage and made them grow hair. Julie had never seen anyone's face light up as bright as that in a very long time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the show, Julie and her cameraman, Jeff, went backstage, making sure to flash their VIP Backstage passes, and went to Magnus's dressing room. Julie knocked before entering the room. There were two leather couches, a leather loveseat, a red shag carpet, a small table placed on the center of said carpet, and mirrors and dressers on the far side wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagnus himself stood facing the door, a drink in one gloved hand and bracing against the love seat with the other. He was smiling his dazzling smile. \"Ah, Miss Julie! I was waiting for our interview. Can I interest you or your colleague in a drink?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take one,\" Jeff says, establishing his tripod and then setting up the camera on top of it. He turned to approach Magnus when the drink appeared in his hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a neat trick!\" Julie exclaimed, \"What's another one you can do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would prefer we get this interview done first,\" Magnus said, walking around and sitting on the love seat. \"But after that, I'm more than willing to put on a personal show for you two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe interview hadn't lasted long. Magnus was a very brief speaker, and Julie had been denied an answer when she asked how he did certain tricks. He was, however, highly entertaining and interesting with his answers, and Julie was satisfied with the success of the interview. She finished up the interview with her usual outro, and Jeff clicked off the camera and said, \"Tie that up with a bow and that's a wrap!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had assumed you had more questions for me?\" Magnus said as Jeff lifted the camera off of the tripod and put it away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I asked you over fifty questions!\" Julie exclaimed, dumbfounded that a man like this would assume such a thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have all the time in the world, Jules,\" Magnus said, smiling, \"And I love the sound of my own voice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, you don't say,\" Jeff interjected as he sat down on the couch. He took a swig of his drink and looked at Magnus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm sure you two are just salivating to see more of my tricks, and I did promise a personal show to the lady, so I suppose I can start.\" Magnus stood up and, with a flourish of his fingers, his hat appeared in a puff of smoke. He slipped on a pair of pristine white gloves and glanced at Julie with a smile. \"And now for my first trick...\"</span></div></div>",

Pressure began to build up in her feet, and she looked down, easing herself on the arm of the couch she sat on. Her high heels were beginning to strain as her feet grew. They busted open, revealing her growing feet and she watched her toes fuse into four and become the same size as her feet themselves widened and changed form. She would have been freaked out if the dizziness hadn't left a feeling of calm in her mind. Her legs grew as well, becoming more shapely and muscular. The wave of changes continued up to her thighs, which thickened to the point where they would be qualified as meaty. Her hips widened quite a bit, matching the width of her shoulders and stopping there, her butt inflating to match, leaving her with two fleshy globes the size of large melons on her backside. She looked down and saw silver-white fur sprouting on her feet and spreading up her legs, which would have been cause for alarm had she that ability to be concerned. She stood up and looked down as her waist and belly slimmed down to accentuate her curvy hips. Her ribs adjusted to do the same purpose, and her breasts grew another size, but still were not so noticeable. Her torso lengthened a little bit as the fur slowly spread up her body, over her hips and waist. She felt something sprout on her head, and two rabbit ears grew from her scalp, covered in white fur, as her normal ears folded on themselves and became nonexistent, fusing back her head. Her teeth adjusted and some disappeared to allow her front two teeth to lengthen and widen, growing from her mouth. Her nose fused with her top lip and the lower half of her face pushed out, forming a small muzzle, her two front teeth growing Anouilh to almost touch the tip of her chin. Fur continued to spread over her shoulders and down her arms and hands as four lumps grew on her belly until they became four new breasts. She bent over, hands on her knees, and looked behind her to see that a large, puffy ball-shaped white tail growing just above her rear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What have you done to me?\" Julie asked, more amazed than concerned as she inspected herself. She hadn't realized her clothes had been stretched to their limits, her underwear constricting her ample proportions. She looked at Magnus and tilted her head in curiosity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did say I would summon a rabbit,\" Magnus said sinisterly, \"I never said in what form.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie was about to ask another question when her skirt and shirt began to change as well. Her shirt stretched out to cover her torso effectively, then the front opened in a jagged pattern, leaving enough material to cover her six nipples, and the top receded into a v-shape, revealing her valley of cleavage. The material turned from pink to black, and the skirt fused to her top, then receded to give full view of her legs. The material then slid through her crotch and fused to the back, effectively wedging itself between her buttocks. A hole ripped in the back of her top, spreading from the spot between her shoulder blades to her rear, just enough to allow her tail to come through. Her socks all but disappeared. Her flowing silver hair, which was slightly darker than her fur, became longer and curly before tying itself into a graceful bun on the back of her head. Her wrists developed black fabric cuffs. A black collar formed around her neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?!\" Jeff shrieked, standing up, \"I'm outta here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe bolted for the door. He didn't make it far before the tripod flew across the room and propped itself against the door in such a way that it would not open. Jeff glanced back in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, what to do with you...\" Magnus said to himself, \"I think...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Ah, yes! That's what I'll do!\" Magnus said, flourishing his hands again, \"Julianna, please go and kiss Mister Jeffrey.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff backed away as Julie half-walked-half-hopped toward him, moving seductively as she closed in on him. He backed right into a wall and pressed against it. Julie closed on him and pressed against him, her hands moving seductively down his chest, his abdomen, his leg, anything to make him more compliant as she moved her face close to his. He resisted at first, trying to keep her face from his, but he gave in eventually, his hands slipping from her muzzle to her neck and down to her hips as her would-be lips pressed against his human lips, the kiss slightly awkward due to the huge rabbit teeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the kiss prolonged, Jeff began to change. His facial hair receded into his face, and his skin became smoother. His manly features became more feminine, his broad jaw and chin narrowing. His eyes drew slightly closer together. He blinked and his eyes changed from brown to blue and his lashes lengthened and thickened, becoming more feminine before he shut them altogether. His frame grew smaller and more slender, his shoulders narrowing and his arms becoming more slender. His hat fell off as his brown hair billowed out of his head in luscious brown curls. His Adam's apple disappeared and his subtle moans became higher pitched. His ears shrank down and the earlobe fused to his head. He gasped as Julie's hand closed around his manhood and pushed. He felt it slip into his body, and a slit opened there, effectively making him a her. Her head finished transforming by becoming completely feminine, not a single trace of her former masculinity remaining. Her neck lost its thickness and became slender. Two small bumps appeared on her chest and grew into two well-developed breasts, which pressed against her shirt and vest, her nipples poking through the shirt. His belly flattened and his waist pinched. With a cracking noise, her hips widened and her butt inflated, becoming a pair of globes like Julie's, her men's jeans slipping down to reveal some butt cleavage. Her thighs thickened, becoming much meatier and solid, giving her legs and hips a perfectly melded form. Her calves became shapely, her knees less pronounced and her feet became daintier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Julianna, that will be all,\" Magnus said as Jeff completed the transformation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie pulled away from Jeff and strutted over to stand to Magnus's right. Jeff was left against the wall, her mind blank and her eyes staring forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeff, come here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff did as she was told, walking over to stand directly in front of Magnus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your name is no longer Jeffrey. You are now Juniper, and I will call you June.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJune nodded, smiling suddenly, liking the way the name rolled off of her master's tongue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Juniper, I will ask you a question now,\" Magnus began to explain to his new assistant, \"You are to answer me truthfully. Which is your favorite animal: tiger, wolf or bear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJune, her mind wiped off her memories as Jeff, thinks for a moment and says...</span></div></div>",

I hoped you would choose that one.\" Magnus gave a flourish of his hand, and June watched with a smile as her master did his magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing to change was her feet. Her toes molded together and two of them fused to become four toes. Her feet lengthened some, busting her shoes open. The bottom of each foot and toe began to harden and callous, becoming padded. Her calves began to develop muscle without losing their shapliness. Her thighs began to ripple with subtle, powerful muscle without losing their thickness. Her abs hardened and she developed a six-pack beneath her shirt. Her back began to ripple with muscle, then her arms followed, remaining subtle and hardly noticeable, though if she flexed, the muscle would appear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she relished in the power her master granted to her body, her spine began to lengthen and the flesh around it grew along with it until it reached to the floor and curled upward there. It then grew orange, black-striped fur all the way along its form, twitching sensitively as the nerves and touch sensors inside it assimilated to their new body. Juniper looked down at her arms as fur matching the fur on her tail sprouted from the backs of her hands and all the way up her arms. It spread over her shoulders and her neck and down her back to meet with the fur that was already there. Her chest, breasts, abdomen and inner thighs grew white fur tinged with yellow on the edges as the tiger fur spread down to her waist, hips and thighs and then all the ay around her legs and knees. Her feet grew striped fur on top but her toes and the soles of her feet grew white, yellow-edged fur and sharp black claws developed between the toes so that, when she flexed, the claws would come out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuniper giggled as her hair fell out and was rapidly replaced by voluminous black hair that billowed out of her head in long locks, with an orange streak adjacent to her ears, which grew more open and catlike as they crawled up the sides of her head and grew the striped fur. Her nose shrunk and became much like a feline's, and whiskers grew out of her top lip. White fur grew around her chin and bottom lip, while striped fur covered the rest of her face and neck. She opened her mouth as her canines and the rest of her teeth elongated and sharpened into the fangs of a carnivore, her tongue flattening and becoming more grainy. She became slightly confused for a moment until she felt pressure on the lower half of her face, and she smiled. She closed her now-slitted eyes, reached deep within herself, and let out a magnificent roar as her face pushed out into a the muzzle of a tiger. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nJuniper purred contentedly as her outfit morphed to look like Julie's, though her outfit didn't include fishnets like Julie's had. She looked at her master and made a smile-like expression with her muzzle, her green, slitted eyes staring at Magnus with pride. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me, Juniper,\" Magnus asked, \"How do you feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel...\" Juniper searched for the right word, her voice echoing slightly with her purr, \"Perfect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagnus nodded. \"I thought you might like it. Now, ladies, I do believe we have another show we are to perform in tomorrow night, and I would Liek to have a few more...assistants, join my band. I would like for you two to go out and plant these backstage passes in the homes of those you think would be happy to work with me. Now, go, and do not be afraid to make the choice to convert your friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, master!\" Julie and June replied simultaneously, and they departed, each with a stack of backstage passes in their possession.</span></div></div>",
