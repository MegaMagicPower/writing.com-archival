She had been working a case at the Bugle, trying to get her hours up and she hasn't had a chance to get home for the last few days and so you figured you'd suprise her. Dinner was just ready to be served when that beautiful girl walked through her front door, completely tuckered out from working on the field to gather information for her article. You noticed her face light up when she smelled foot and saw you, rushing to the kitchen. MJ looked up to give you a slight peck on the lips as she grabbed a form and shoves it right into the pan, stealing a bite. \"ohmygod it's so good\" she said with a mouthful of food. \"Ya know\" she said, eyeing you up. \"It's a good thing you're here, cause I was totally going to call you over to do that thing you know I love\" she admitted. \"Right now?\" You asked. \"Right now\" she confirmed. \"I haven't changed these shoes since I started this story, I might just knock you out this time\" MJ said with a giggle as she pulled you (along with the pan of food) to the couch by the wrist, setting the pan on the table as she kneeled you in front of her on the couch, gritty with excitement. \"Okay!\" She smiled. \"Time to torture that pretty nose of yours, foot boy!\". It's not like you had a foot fetish, but you didn't hate her feet either, something to do with pheromones or something that kept you interested in her, even if she reeked.</span></div></div>",

You could feel the warmth of her foot and even smell it slightly, and you weren't even done unlacing it! \"Come ooon, footboy!\" She said playfully. \"I haven't got all day!\". With that, you took off MJ's left shoe and the sharp, cheesy smell of her feet hit you like a truck. You remembered that she made you sniff her gym shoes after practice sometimes, but this was different. This was way more intense and pungent than her regular foot scent. You began coughing as the cheesy, rancid smell entered your nostrils. \"Aww, is my footboy having trouble handling the stench of my shoe?\" She asked as she grabbed her shoe. She gave it a quick sniff and then she quickly moved her face away from the shoe. \"Poof! They really reek today...\" she said. \"Yup.\" You agreed. \"I think I was less anxious when I fought Tombstone...\" MJ laughed, then she forced the shoe right on your face, intensifying the rancid smell of her feet. You could feel how warm and moist her shoe was. \"Deep whiffs, footboy.\" She ordered. Not wanting to upset MJ, you began taking deep, loud breaths. The pungent aroma was burning your nose, but it was kinda feeling nice. Maybe you were developing a foot fetish, or maybe it was the cheesy foot odor of MJ beginning to knock you out. After a few minutes, you hear MJ say...</span></div></div>",

MJ's cheesy, sweaty scent still lingered at your nose. Though not as pungent as in her shoe, it was still as much as cheesy. \"Lie down.\" MJ ordered. \"Now it's time for my bare foot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lied down on MJ's carpet, your girlfriend's glistening bare sole hovering above you, its cheesy smell attacking youe nostrils. \"I appreciate you doing this for me, footbo- Peter. I know that they are extra stinky today...\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You talk like I had a say in this.\" You reply, which makes her laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you didn't.\" She agreed with you. Then, she lowered her sole right on your face, her toes positioned right on your nose. \"Remember the first time we did this? We were in high school, I had a deadline to finish, and you were busy printing your photos...\" You were too busy rubbing your nose on MJ's sweaty, warm, pungent toes but you remembered. You two made a bet that you would be able to smell her feet without passing out for three minutes, and you passed out twenty seconds in. After you started dating, MJ started to do this in a regular basis, seemingly enjoying it. You did too, to some extent, but not as much as seeing her happy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kept your nose between MJ's big and second toe, inhaling her putrid scent when you accidentally suck up a load of her toejam and begin coughing violently.</span></div></div>",

Why don't you go ahead and start cleaning it out for me? I wanna see em spotless when you're done, footboy\" MJ ordered. \"Oh and keep using your nose, seeing you react like that was pretty funny to me\" she said with a taunting smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sure MJ, no problem\" you replied, still recovering from your coughing fit. Not wanting to make MJ upset by refusing, you obeyed and started snorting out any toejam you could find from her sole. You repeatedly choked and coughed throughout your task, but MJ simply laughed and pressed her sole down harder on your face every time. You made sure to go between every single one of her toes and snort up as much as you can, as putrid as it was. When it was finally over, you choked and coughed violently as MJ examined her sole and toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow did you do?</span></div></div>",

Bringing up one of her pretty pinkish sweaty soles, she inspects it for a moment, resting it across her knee. You laid there feeling at her mercy and power as she furrowed her brow then brought her sole down, positioning it just over your face, letting you get a good view of the sweaty gunk between her toes. Pointing at the filth and built up layers of sweat between her wiggling toes, she gives a \"tsk\" while smirking at your disgusted expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you got ways to go footboy. You hardly got enough of it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started to protest when she suddenly planted it down roughly against your face, emitting a loud sticking noise as her putrid moist sole squished against your nose. You squirmed helplessly with how uncomfortable her silky hot soles felt pressing against your face and tried to get free. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no you don't Peter! I been waiting 3 weeks to air out my feet and I need them cleaned after walking around all day in my shoes. You're going to cooperate or i'll shove them down your throat and only make this worse for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo emphasize her threat, MJ planted her other foot roughly on the other side of Peter's head, forcing you to look straight up at her grinning face. Your vision was then blotted out as her fleshy smooth soles slid up over your face slowly, encasing you in a moist prison of sweat and putrid odor as she completely smothered you beneath her soles. Your resistance weakened as you took in more and more of the toxic cheesy stench, making a dominate chuckle come from her lips. Spreading her toes a bit, she eases your nose between her toes, forcing you to take in more and more of the sweaty toe jam, making your eyes roll back. Cupping your nose between her toes, she slowly squeezes, making your nose flare up as you snorted in more of the toe jam, making you cough violently beneath her feet. Seeing the opportunity to further her own control over Spider-Man, MJ eases her sole to your lips, pressing her foot down firmly over your mouth to prevent you from breathing through it while she used the toes of her other foot to firmly pinch your nose, making you continue to keep taking more of her overwhelming cheesy stench that invaded your lungs and brain, making you go light headed from the odor. The way your eyes fluttered only made her bite her lips sensually, clearly more amused at your discomfort and dazed state then concerned, making her only apply more pressure as she thought up of new ideas to subvert and dominate you with her beautiful soles. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(This is a foot sniffing story as said in the rules.

You went to far this time. MJ dumped you, Mysterio was still at large and then this crook in front of you was beating and robbing some kid and you.. almost beat him to death. As paramedics arrived you and Yuri went up to a nearby rooftop to chat privately. \"There's no way I'm arresting you\" she started. \"But you know I can't just let you off the hook right?\" She said. You nodded. \"What happens now?\". Yuri looked dosn, twisting to toe end of her shoe around on the gravelly rooftop. \"Actually I've got an idea for that\" you flipped backwards, facing Yuri only to see her pull out cuffs. \"Turn around\" you obeyed and she cuffed your hands behind your back. \"We need you out here, but that doesn't mean you get off Scott free\" \"I kno-\" you tried to reply but Yuri cut you off. \"Quiet.. lay down on your back\" you did that too. You were a bit surprised when Yuri sat down on top of you, slapping the bottom of her flats over your mask. \"I've.. had these shoes since I started on the force and they always make my feet really nasty.. and now that I haven't had a chance to really slip out of them during this last case\" Yuri said, slipping off her flats and letting them fall aside, her rank foot fumes immediately making you cringe in disgust. \"They're a good punishment, I'd say\" with that Yuri lifted your mask ever so slightly, your heart racing as she pushed her sweat-soaked feet force themselves in, the base of of her nasty, dirty, lint covered toes pushed right up against your nostrils. Yuri released the mask, sealing you in with her feet, your nose crammed in between her toes as her sweat soaked through the mask fabrics. \"For your sake, I hope that washes out, now come on, this is supposed to be your punishment. Start sniffing or we'll be here all day.\"</span></div></div>",

Sable was right behind you, picking up your numb body as her jet dropped what looked like a big, white, metal casket from the cockpit. Sable threw you inside and a bunch of cold metal clamps pressed down holding you in spot as the casket closed around you, her ship deploying ropes to pull the white tomb back into it. A section of the big metal box opened above your face, letting you see the underside of her jet's cockpit as Sable jumped in, sitting above you. Great, another supervillain has you at their feet, only literally this time. Sable reached down and your eyes widened as she ripped of your mask, nothing you could do to stop her. \"This is your last chance\" she said, her accent just starting to annoy you. \"Give me your information on hammerhead or you will receive the worst torture of your life.\" You stayed silent, even if you did have the info she was looking for, you were too shocked to speak. \"Very well, you have made your decision.\" Said Sable as you felt the jet blast off. \"Back in Symkaria, I've discovered what could be the best means to get information\" she said as she started to unlace her thick, heavy combat boots. \"So I have not washed my feet since I left Symkaria. Until I have the information I seek, you will be my personal foot sniffer\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought about laughing until her boots fell, clanking on the floor of the jet, her pale, slender feet, covered in dirt, sweat and some sort of nasty foot fungus dived for your face, her long, slender toes wrapping around your nose to hold it against her toe-jam. the next thing you knew an electric shock pulsed through your body from the ropes she originally tied you up with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Smell them!\" Sable demanded</span></div></div>",

They were cheesy, pungent and covered in sweat. \"You know that Symkaria is a warzone right now. We don't have time to take off our boots, so foot hygiene has took a step back.\" Sable said as she cupped her toes around your nose, making an arc of her foot stink around it. \"You can talk, or you can keep sniffing my toes.\" She said, but you were too weary to respond. As you kept inhaling her sharp foot odor, it felt like your brain was shutting down. Your eye lenses must have given away your grogginess, because Sable intensified her press on your nose with her toes. \"You will not be the only one who passes out from my smell if you do.\" She explained. \"If you pass out, I will just continue when you wake up.\" She smirked. \"Know that I will wear my boots until you wake up, so my feet will be even nastier for you.\" Your vision was fading.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After Screwball had kidnapped a civilian, Spider-Man had done research to locate the man, unaware that it was a setup to lure Spider-Man into a trap. Following the trial of clues, he locates the man inside a abandon warehouse and heads over quickly. Arriving at the scene, Spider-Man found the frightened man tied and gagged to a chair inside and makes his way over to free him when he felt something prick his neck. Reaching for his neck, he finds a dart and pulls it out sluggishly. He then collapses to the ground as everything fades to black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Spider-Man finally woke up, he found himself alone and chained down to the floor in a empty large room. His mask was still on for now but that didn't make his situation any better. Reaching forward, he tries to pull himself free from the chains but found himself still too weak from the toxin. Spider-Man then heard footsteps approaching and glanced up to see Screwball wearing a tight white jumpsuit and her head and eyes covered by a helmet so only her lips were revealed. Looking up and down her shapely form, he notices how she held a recorder in one hand, filming everything that was about to happen on a live stream making him all the more uncomfortable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well lookie here guys! Poor Spider-Man is all webbed up and ready for some fun and games!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScrewball responded excitedly in a immature voice while putting her recorder down in front of Spider-Man, positioning it in a way everyone could see his chained form. Walking over to tower above him, Screwball flexibly bends down and begins to take off her sneakers one at a time with a light plop, revealing her cute pink nail polished toes that glistened with sweat. A malodorous intense stench emitted from her hard working feet as she rubbed them against the floor a bit, leaving a imprint of her sweaty sole, picking up tons of dirt and dust in the process as she watched Peter with a amused expression. Pulling up his mask so his nose and lips showed, Screwball raised one foot above his face, wiggling her now dirtied smelly toes flexibly before planting her foot roughly on his face, smearing off her putrid earthly foot stench, using her toes to tug and cup his nose, encasing it in the overwhelming putrid smell, making poor Peter gag and shudder as he was forced to endure the torture from the crazed giddy girl while she taunted him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw look how he shivers! His senses are really getting screwed up like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(This is a footsmelling story, no feet in mouths!)</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Screwball continued rubbing her feet all over Peter's partially masked face, taking special care to make sure his nose got the best whiffs of it. Peter let out muffled groans beneath her foot as he was forced to endure the putrid stench. Suddenly, Screwball heard the chime of a notification coming from her stream. After briefly rubbing her foot even harder over the superhero's face, she removed her foot and walked over to check on her stream. Peter was glad for the reprieve and started breathing heavily as he took in as much fresh air as he could<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh Kathy Malone here says 'trample the bug full-weight and see how much he can take!', awesome idea there, Kathy!\" Screwball says excitedly as she reads off the request. She skips over to the still-chained-down Spider-Man before leaning over him with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You hear that, SM? Let's give my viewers what they want!\" she said before stomping one of her bare feet on his face, ignoring his cry of pain. She raised her other foot and also planted it firmly on his face, now smothering both his nose and his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Spider-Man struggled to breathe past the powerful stench of Screwball's feet, the internet star watched with a wide grin as even more viewers rolled in to watch the show. Keeping the excitement going, she lifted one of her legs and held it out so that she was balancing on Peter's head using only one foot. It was much more painful on Peter where the foot on his mouth still remained, but at the very least he could breathe through his nose again. Still balancing one foot on his head, Screwball checked in on her numbers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAAA, check it out Webs; that's the most viewers I've ever gotten! LOL they just LOVE seeing you like this!!\" Screwball taunted before once again planting both feet on his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter, meanwhile, could only let out more muffled groans from beneath her, and he could only hope he'd be able to get free soon. The stench of her feet were already starting to overpower him as his vision started to blur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's next for Screwball's exciting stream?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Peter was absolutely elated! He finally joined the Avengers, after years of being a lone wolf. He had been doing the hero schtick since highschool, yet no one in the Avengers thought to make him a full blown member untill now. Peter had finally proven himself and was ready to work with the greatest heroes around. The tour around the tower was done by Jarvis, the Butler, and was incredible comprehensive. From the kitchen to the helipad, everything was pointed out by his astute tour guide. As they were walking through the living quarters, something did catch Peter's attention. A pair of boots were setting on the floor of someone's room, next to the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's room is this?\" Peter asked Jarvis<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be the room of Ms. Danvers, better known as Captain Marvel. I believe she is out on the town with Ms. Drew, as of this moment. They will both be extremely excited to meet you but unfortunately tonight is their, and I quote, girls night out.\" Jarvis replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you never really think of the Avengers as normal people. At least I didn't. It seemed like they spent all their time here, always vigilant for crime. Then again, a lot of people could say the same thing about Spider-Man, I guess. Is there like a poker game or something for the guys?\" Mused Peter<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, unfortunately not.\" Jarvis responded, seeming saddened by his statement, \"The last time we tried something like that it fell apart rather quickly. Tony cheated, Thor had a bit to much Mead, Bruce almost lost his temper because of his rotten luck, and Steve refused to even get involved. All in all, it was a poor night for everyone. Including the poor Butler, who had to clean up after a near Hulk event.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh. Remind me to cancel my movie night plans. Doesn't seem like a good idea anymore. Thanks for showing me around, Jarvis. I think I'm going to turn in for the night.\" Peter yawned after he spoke, truly feeling the excitement of the day draining away. Although he did have another reason for ending his time with Jarvis, namely those boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter settling into his room, Peter quickly darted down the hall to Carol's room. The door was open so he let himself in and shut it behind him. The boots were sitting in the same spot as before, taunting him. He had always had a foot fetish, and a crush on Captain Marvel, so he has dreamed about this very moment before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he knelt down to admire the object of his admiration, he began to have second thoughts about what he was doing. He was just let onto the team, yet here he was violating the trust and privacy of one of it's founding members. Plus this would be a major blow to his relationship with Mary Jane, if she ever found out. While it may not be cheating in the most obvious of ways, she still would not be pleased. She was always there for him, including with his fetish. He could be throwing away his membership, his relationship, and his reputation. All for a single night of boot worship. Was it really worth it?</span></div></div>",

He could spend his night at them, but it would cost him everything. The respect of legendary heroes like Captain America, the reputation of Spider-Man which he has worked to uphold for eight years, his relationship with MJ... they were too much to throw away for a night with Carol's boots.

She was wearing long, black leather boots which really complimented the rest of her outfit. She slowly unzipped her boots and took them off, revealing her bare feet. Even though they were standing a few feet away, Peter could smell the scent of sweat mixed with shoe leather and vinegar that came from Carol's feet and boots. Jessica held her nose and waved her hand. She was sitting next to Carol, so the smell was probably more pungent to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carol!\" she said, moving away a little. \"Don't you think it's rude to stink up our newest member's room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, if we're gonna live together he needs to get used to this. My feet always stink when I take off my boots!\" Carol said with a smile. She then turned to Peter. \"Peter, I know it's kind of rude to ask, but could you...\"</span></div></div>",
