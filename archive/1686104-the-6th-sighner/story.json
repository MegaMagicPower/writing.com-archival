Well, at least you can get out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes a bit of effort and some fancy footwork, you manage to extract yourself from the can. Then you check yourself for trash.

You don\u2019t need to act like you\u2019re not hurt, that was a mighty big crash back there. No-one would blame you for injuring yourself.\u201d Yusei asked you.<br>\r\n\u201c.....Crash?\u201d You respond. What crash?<br>\r\nHe shrugs, a bit confused. \u201cHere, come have a look. Might jog your memory.\u201d He beckons you over to where he\u2019s standing. Curious, you walk over to him, to see a interesting sight.<br>\r\n\u201cOh. That crash.\u201d Is your response to the scene in front of your eyes. There\u2019s a Duel Runner, one that looks very much like the one in that void, rammed into one of the roadside newspaper shops, on a angle. I guess you were driving the Duel Runner, you swerved or something and hit the newspaper stand, and you got sent flying into that trash can. \u201cNow I remember. I\u2019m...not all that injured. I ended up head first in a empty trash can, so the trash can must have saved me from any major injuries.\u201d You half explained, half made up, feeling slightly embarrassed.<br>\r\n\u201cHead first in a trash can, huh?\u201d Yusei repeats back to you. \u201cWell, I\u2019ve seen worse, and and the important thing is, you\u2019re not serverly injured. Your Duel Runner, on the other hand.....\u201d he trailed off, looking at the wreak in front of him. The poor Duel Runner...! The entire front section of the Duel Runner was bent and crumpled, the only thing relatively unbent being the front wheel. The whole thing was smoking, and it didn\u2019t look like it would be easy, or cheap to fix. What should you do?<br>\r\nImprov, of course.<br>\r\n\u201cOhh....Ahhh, shoot! And I was hoping to just pass through here, and not have to stop for much.....I was making good time, too!\u201d You skim off the top of your head, sagging your head and shoulders in upset.<br>\r\nYusei looks at you, a bit confused. \u201cPass though here....You\u2019re a traveller, huh? What\u2019re you travelling for?\u201d He asked you.<br>\r\nTime for a bit more improv. A convincing coverup story can save your time and your life. And you would definitely need a coverup story with what was happening right now. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m a traveller. Just riding around Japan to find myself. What about you, Y....I didn\u2019t get your name..?\u201d You don\u2019t say much, for fear of slipping up again. You were lucky that you caught your slip up quickly, that could have gotten weird and bad fast.<br>\r\n\u201c....Yusei. Yusei Fudo. If you really want to know, I run a repair shop in Downtown Neo Domino. You look like you could use a mechanic right now, actually.\u201d He replies, with a bit of jealousy in his voice.<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I could.....\u201d You mutter, before pausing for a moment. \u201cCan you-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis response is simple, yet laced with some cheek(considering his background, and what you adlibbed so far, it\u2019s kinda deserved).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You could explore Satellite, but that might end up angering someone you\u2019re supposed to...you decide to answer truthfully. \u201cI....don\u2019t know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not surprised.\u201d Yusei pipes in. \u201cA lot of people aren\u2019t too sure what to do at first here.\u201d \u201cI can see why....\u201d You reply understandably. \u201cBut there aren\u2019t that many attractions around here, to be honest.\u201d  Crow decides to pop in a joke. You give a small, humourless laugh at that. \u201cOkay, so that one was bad. But really, we just try and make a living here and survive. Course, some of us, espically the jackels...\u201d Crow begins talking about some of the kids he keeps an eye Aoi, but you\u2019re only half listening as you think of what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you think on what to do, Maritha finishes cooking and comes out with the food. As you expected, it\u2019s soup. She pours into some chipped bowls and hands them to us. Grabbing a spoon, me and Crow dig in.  Yusei, however, blows on his and begins speaking. \u201cOnce we\u2019ve eaten, we\u2019ll show Raven around the area. All right with you, Crow?\u201d \u201cFine by mEEEEEEOOOOOWWWWWCCHHHHHH! Argh!\u201d In his haste to respond, Crow burnt his tongue on the hot soup. You can\u2019t help but giggle at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the door swings open. The person that steps through it was someone you weren\u2019t expecting.</span></div></div>",
