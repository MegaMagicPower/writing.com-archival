You may leave now, but don't go too far; I have some work for you to do when we're alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata smirked her lipstick-painted lips and, winking one of her blue eyes, sultrily said, \"I can hardly wait, Lord Hokage.\" She then walked back into the outer office, her purple skirt showing off her ass as she swayed her hips while leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto then turned to Ino and said, \"Ino, I was wondering how your baby is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno smiled as she rubbed her swollen stomach over her blue-gray kimono. \"It's only a month away, Lord Hokage. After that, I can resume my duties as leader of Team 8,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P...please do, Ino-sensei,\" Anko quietly said, struggling to find the right words to say. She fiddled with her lavender coat as she said, \"I'm not sure how long I can stand having a different sensei every week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto activated his Byakugan and said, \"It looks like the baby's healthy from where I sit, but you should probably get either Tsunade or Sakura to check up on you. You should go over to the hospital right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno bowed, allowing Naruto a view of the short ponytail behind her head as she replied, \"I will, Lord Hokage.\" She then left, careful to keep the baby in her stomach comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto then turned to Tenten and asked, \"Any news on the prisoners we captured earlier?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenten shrugged and said, \u201cIf there were any, I would\u2019ve reported them sooner, Lord Hokage. Even with all my genjutsu, I haven\u2019t been able to crack their shells.\u201d While she was talking, she fanned herself with her open trench coat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, keep at it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will, Lord Hokage, you can count on that,\u201d Tenten said as she bowed and took off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto smirked and turned to the other three. \u201cAnko, Kurenai, Shizune, I have a mission for the three of you. You are to guard a noble as he goes to visit his grandson in the Land of Honey. Shizune, you will act as team leader. I\u2019m expecting the three of you to perform well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Lord Hokage,\u201d Shizune said as she straightened out her white bandage dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, Lord Hokage,\u201d Anko shyly said, fidgeting with the ponytail behind her head. \u201cWh\u2026I mean\u2026um\u2026why us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause you have the most diverse skills among the other ninja. Shizune can heal you more efficiently with her medical jutsu, but she\u2019s also a great tactician, which is why she\u2019s team leader. You have great tracking skills because of the snakes you summon. Kurenai will be the biggest help to you, though, because of her skills at handling all sorts of weapons.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurenai raised her fist in the air, holding the scroll containing all her weapons high, as she said, \u201cNo problem!\u201d She then placed the scroll on her lower back just where her white shirt met her red pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf there\u2019s nothing else, you are dismissed. You are to leave in one hour to meet the client.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Lord Hokage,\u201d Anko, Shizune and Kurenai said before they left to carry out their mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as they were gone, Naruto jumped with glee, causing his breasts to bounce, and said, \u201cThis Exchanger is awesome! I can\u2019t wait to use it some more.\u201d He grabbed the device, but then suddenly was given a bit of knowledge. \u201cWhat the\u20263 hours? I\u2019ve gotta wait three hours to use it again?

He reached down and didn't feel a bulge between his legs, instead having it relatively smooth.

Looking further down her body, Naruto saw that she now had a man's chest under her blouse while a noticeable bulge could be seen between the legs of her pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How dare you do that in my presence?!\" Tsunade continued to say. \"If you want to feel yourself up, do it in your own room! There is such a thing as decency, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was about to ask if she found anything suspicious, but remembering her outburst from when he switched their underwear, let it drop and ran out of the building before Tsunade could throw anything else at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto walked through the village, admiring what the Exchanger had done. \"This is incredible!\" He then looked at his reflection in a store window and thought, \"However, I can't exactly show off my new body in clothes like these. I should do something about that.\" He looked around and found _______. He smirked and used the Exchanger to swap their clothes and perceived genders.

When the light receded, Naruto saw that he now wore the clothes he had seen Ino wearing just recently. He still felt the bra and panties, once belonging to Tsunade, against his boobs and vagina, which also once belonged to Tsunade. Looking at himself in the mirror, he admired how his butt and boobs were shown off by what were once Ino's clothes. \"Oh, yeah; much better,\" Naruto thought as he struck a few poses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Ino, Naruto couldn't help but laugh at Ino's new look. She now walked in a manly manner and wore Naruto's orange sweater and pants, with flat sandals on her feet. She otherwise looked the same, even wearing the same underwear as before (due to Naruto not switching those).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling bold, Naruto walked over to Ino and said, \"Hey Ino! How's it going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno looked over and responded, \"Hi, Naruto? What are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing much. I was just bored.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, why don't you go to the hot springs? I'm sure a woman like you would enjoy being pampered like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you join me, Ino?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, not so fast, Naruto. As much as I'd like to join a bombshell like you, guys like me aren't allowed to join women like you in the same hot spring. Thanks for the invite, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter their conversation, Ino walked away, staring at beautiful women lustfully as she did. Naruto snickered at the idea of Ino, the girliest girl he knows, suddenly gaining a sexual attraction to another girl, all the while thinking she was a guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This Exchanger thing is incredible!!

Sure enough, all the pinup girls and models in the two magazines were now wearing more than before Naruto had exchanged their wardrobes. After putting them away, he looked to the other three people who were gathered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first was Tsunade, who looked the same as when he had last used the Exchanger, rocking the bunny suit. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.wavygirlhairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/green-playboy-bunny.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.wavygirlhairstyles.com/wp-con...</a> However, she now sported a pair of lavender, pupil-less eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her left was Hinata, who now stood proudly wearing nothing but a white bikini which did little to hide her body. Her large breasts were on display behind the triangle-top bikini bra and her bottom basically just covered her vagina and the lower half of her ass. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://i01.i.aliimg.com/img/pb/397/930/474/474930397_740.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://i01.i.aliimg.com/img/pb/397/930/4...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last person standing was Mei Terumi. She now wore a black lingerie set. The top looked like a jacket, but was tied off just below her breasts, allowing a view of her midriff. The fabric on the lower half of the top was see-through to allow a view of her torso from all directions. The only other article of clothing she wore was a thong. Both the top and thong seemed to be tied off with pink bows. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://i00.i.aliimg.com/wsphoto/v0/527887546/baby-dolls-sexy-lingerie-sexy-women-s-underwear-lingerie-free-shipping.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://i00.i.aliimg.com/wsphoto/v0/52788...</a> She seemed to also have the same eyes as Tsunade and Hinata, lavender and pupil-less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three seemed to be unashamed of the skimpy outfits they wore, and were talking casually among themselves. Naruto took some extra time to notice pouches tied to each of their right thighs, used to carry tools and weapons. They also all wore high heel shoes on their feet and Konoha headbands on their heads, in colors to match their outfits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto decided to finally interact with them, walking up and saying, \"Hey, girls! What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade, Hinata and Mei turned to Naruto, smiles on their faces, and said, \"Hi, Naruto-sensei!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, now, since we're a new genin team, we need to learn more about our battle capabilities, so I want you to...\"</span></div></div>",

She dismissed it as a gleam of the dish, as she began musing over her life and this night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBorn into the famed Uzumaki clan, Tsunade had been teased as a child for wanting to become the first female Hokage. She decided to face the problem head-on and quickly garnered respect for her incredible skill and unique ninjutsu style.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn time she learned of her legacy, and how her chakra would lead her to be chosen as the jinch\u016briki of the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox. The pain of this dark burden was greatly helped when she fell in love with Minato Namikaze, a fellow student who rescued her during a kidnapping. They grew up and eventually conceived a child: Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, the night of Naruto's birth had been a tragic one. Evil forces had forced the release of the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox from Tsunade's body, and Minato and Tsunade fought to protect their child. Minato sacrificed his life to seal the Fox inside Naruto's body. Tsunade would surely have died as well, had not the expert Medic-nin Kushina appeared. Kushina's medical jutsu saved Tsunade's life, but at the cost of Kushina's own. It was a sacrifice Tsunade still remembered after all these years, even though it had never occurred until the Exchanger had made it so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinato had been the Fourth Hokage, and the council felt it only right that Tsunade replace him, becoming the Fifth Hokage. Sadly, the reality had not lived up to the dream. Tsunade had hated all the paperwork involved, and losing the former Third Hokage to Orochimaru's treachery hurt all the more. As much as Naruto wanted to be Hokage, Tsunade had long ago realized that would not be the right life for him. He was meant to be a hero, not a Hokage. That was why she had reduced herself to a simple waitress at Ichiraku Ramen, one whose son apparently loved his mother's cooking very much. She hoped that these humble beginnings would help make Naruto all the more legendary in time, although for some reason she had trouble remembering what it was like to have Naruto as a son back when she was Hokage...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, as long as she had the Exchanger perhaps- Tsunade felt her pockets. The Exchanger wasn't there! She was sure she had pocketed it. Had it dropped out somehow? Tsunade had to search the stand. She turned to the counter and saw-</span></div></div>",

A job with more responsibility than just going out on missions from time to time can be seen as an attractive quality. Plus, if I take the position of Hokage's assistant, I won't be sent out on missions all the time, so I can maintain our house if Naruto has to leave the village for anything!

The lavender coat covered her torso and lessened her curves to a degree that her breasts simply looked like two small bumps on her chest. The pants on her legs did little to show them off, and her new shoes didn't reveal much either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then looked at her sensei, Kurenai, and was amazed at her face. She had no makeup on her face, but was still attractive in her own right. She didn't seem like she cared, though, as she just kept talking to her buddies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizune didn't seem different in any way, that is until she got up and said, \"I'm sorry, but I want to train by myself for a while. I'll see you at training tomorrow, Kurenai-sensei.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Shizune walked away, Hinata caught a glimpse of herself in the window. She was now dressed in Anko's clothes, loving the way the mesh bodysuit showed off her body's curves and made her boobs look more pronounced. She also noticed the makeup on her face and loved how mature she looked. \"Damn, I look hot!\" Hinata said to herself as she posed in the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Hinata,\" a voice said. She looked around as an ANBU appeared behind her. \"Lady Tsunade would like you to return to your post.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata nodded and ran back to the Hokage's office. Tsunade looked up and said, \"Oh, Miss Hinata, would you please stay with me for the rest of the day.

As soon as the bright light that performed the swaps died down, Hinata had to suppress her laughter at Ino and Sakura\u2019s drastic changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno\u2019s hair was now pink and styled in the way Sakura would normally style hers. She wore the same purple outfit she wore before, but the exposed midriff was now very wrinkled, like an old woman\u2019s. Hinata could also see that her breasts now sagged well below the purple top she wore and that her butt also sagged, threatening to peek out from under Ino\u2019s skirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura looked almost as ridiculous. Although no changes had been done to her torso, she now wore the former elder\u2019s clothes, which almost completely covered her body. Hinata could make out wrinkly hands coming out from the sleeves, meaning Sakura now also had Koharu\u2019s arms and legs (according to Hinata\u2019s plan). As a final touch, Sakura now had Koharu\u2019s head on top of her shoulders, complete with the greying hair tied in a bun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmazingly, Sakura and Ino continued their argument despite their new bodies, from what Hinata could tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019d better just give up trying to attract any guys, Sakura,\u201d Ino said, using Koharu\u2019s old voice. \u201cYou know all the guys will want to get with me, since I\u2019m not afraid to show off my hot bod!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa!\u201d Sakura laughed, Ino\u2019s voice eerily coming from Koharu\u2019s old mouth. \u201cWho would ever be attracted to those prunes you call boobs. Besides, can you satisfy any man in your condition? Your junk must be out of business by now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, at least I don\u2019t look like a leather purse, you dehydrated potato!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTake a look in the mirror, Pancake Chest!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGirls, that\u2019s quite enough!!\u201d Sakura\u2019s voice pierced through the air. This caused Ino and Sakura to stand at attention (Sakura struggling due to arthritis in her new limbs) and stare at Koharu Utatane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoharu now sported Sakura\u2019s head on her shoulders, but with Ino\u2019s blonde hair done in her normal ponytail. She also had Ino\u2019s torso, complete with firm and perky B-cup breasts and a nice, plump ass; all conformed to Sakura\u2019s old clothes. Sakura\u2019s toned arms and legs were proudly displayed with the clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou two could learn a thing or two about decency. Do you really want anyone to hear what you\u2019re arguing about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, Lady Koharu,\u201d Ino and Sakura said, bowing as much as their new bodies would allow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, it\u2019s best you two be on your way. I\u2019m sure you have someplace important to be.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sakura and Ino went their separate ways, Koharu sighed and said, \u201cI swear, I\u2019ll never understand youngsters today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Koharu was out of sight, Hinata let out her pent-up laughter. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it! There\u2019s no way Naruto will fall for either of them now! I\u2019m sure they deserve more because of how badly they treated Naruto in the past, but that was just so hilarious!!

Hancock thought to herself, \"If this machine does exchange things between two people, I can use it to find a way to have my darling Luffy all to myself! But, first a little test is in order.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a second thought, Hancock pressed the button on top of the Exchanger. She saw two beams of light emerge from the lenses, which hit Hancock and Marguerite square in the chest. The area was then covered in a blinding light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the light died down, Hancock took in her surroundings. When she laid eyes on Marguerite, she was amazed at what she saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarguerite was now dressed exactly like she was, with her red top exposing much of her cleavage and midriff and her sarong skirt leaving most of her left leg exposed. Her red heels covered her feet and even the snake earrings she used to wear dangled from Marguerites ears. The clothes seemed to magically resize themselves to fit Marguerite perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at herself, Hancock was now amazed to discover herself wearing Marguerite's clothes. The brown top left nothing to the imagination as it showed her breasts well, and the matching skirt was only short enough to cover her vagina. A stocking on her right leg and brown boots on her feet completed her ensemble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHancock also noticed that Marguerite and her had exchanged snakes, as well. Salome was currently being caressed by Marguerite, while Hancock had a snake that was unfamiliar to her, yet was still attached to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, Hancock,\" Marguerite said, amusingly answering her own question. \"There doesn't seem to be anything here, though. If that's the case, how did this crater appear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing Marguerite was now the Empress of the Kuja tribe, Hancock bowed her head and said, \"I'm pleased you are well, Empress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarguerite simply walked up to her and said, \"Please make sure this area is secure. I don't want to see any unwelcome guests around here.\" With that, Marguerite walked toward the palace, where she now lived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHancock stared at Marguerite as she walked away, then looked at the Exchanger in her hands. \"This is amazing!\" she thought. \"This will make things so much easier!

Orihime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orange haired girl opened her eyes at Yuzu's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you please stop spacing out all of the time. I'm trying to find out what you want for dinner tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrihime blinked. It took all but a moment for her to recognize the curvy, buxom and leggy body under Yuzu's neck. Her cute childlike head was perched on top of the body of arguably the bustiest women Orihime had ever met. Rangiku's body, or rather Yuzu's new body, was just as it was wherever Rangiku had been at the moment. Gone was Yuzu's uniform and book bag only to be replaced by Rangiku's shinigami garb, large pink sash and chain necklace that extended down between the child's huge new boobs. Since she had actually lived with Rangiku for a while Orihime knew Yuzu was without a bra at the moment, knowing that the shinigami woman that originally owned the young girl's body never used one for two simple reasons. The main one being that her bust was far too large for her to find one and the other being that they weren't really something they had in Soul Society.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry Yuzu.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geeze Orihime. I know you've got an active imagination but I wish you could hold it back when people are trying to have a conversation with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Yuzu, I was just distracted by your outfit is all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrihime tried her best to cover up her moment of blankness by taking Yuzu's attention and putting it on the black garbs covering her shapely new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I should be wearing my uniform but it's taking so long to get one that will fit right. Plus the school did say that because of that I could just wear this as my uniform, remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the sake of everything going on Orihime simply nodded. She actually found it pretty easy to believe the cover up The Exchanger had made for Yuzu's lack of a school uniform given her new body. What she didn't understand yet was how everyone could see a young girl Yuzu's age having such a mature and developed body as being completely normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But anyways, what do you feel like having for dinner Orihime? I know that you like your \"creative\" food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyone other than Orihime would know what Yuzu really meant by that comment but Orhime's mind was so far out there that she never knew people thought the food she liked was weird or gross to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I don't know Yuzu. What do you feel like making?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe remembered that Yuzu was the more motherly of Ichigo's sisters and because of that she often did all the cooking and cleaning around the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Maybe that's why she got Rangiku's body. Maybe I remembered how much of the house work she does at Ichigo's house and wanted to help her out somehow.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them kept walking together, Yuzu going on about what she was thinking of making for dinner while playing with the chain hanging between her breasts absentmindedly.</span></div></div>",

Neither they nor the children next to them seemed to mind the older women attending classes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrihime then looked at her and Yuzu. The two girls were now wearing bikinis that showed off their bodies well. Orihime's was green, with a bandeau-style top with a metal ring in the center. The bottom was smaller than she would've liked, but it still covered the areas that she wanted covered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuzu's bikini covered less than Orihime's did. Her new boobs (courtesy of Rangiku) were only hidden behind small white triangle-shaped pieces of fabric, and her bikini bottom left the top part of her ass exposed. Thankfully, there was a small sarong-style skirt tied around her waist that helped cover her more, but it was made of see-through fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, girls; that's it for this set,\" Orihime heard a man say. \"Go backstage and change into the next set.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Yuzu said before dragging Orihime to a makeshift changing room to put on the next outfits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they were dressing, Orihime dove into her new memories to discover how this new exchange had changed reality. Apparently, before she and Yuzu were supposed to attend middle school, they were scouted out by a modeling agency because of their mature bodies, which were the result of a rare genetic trait they both inherited from their mother. Yuzu thought the pay would help the family financially, so decided to accept on her and Orihime's behalf. Orihime played along because of all the free clothes she'd receive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrihime smiled and thought, \"I'm glad that even in this crazy reality, Yuzu's still a kind soul. I wonder if there's anything I could do to make her even happier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Orihime, are you ready?\" Yuzu asked.

Taking her seat, she saw the mop of black hair turn back and the face in front of it smile and say, \u201cHey, there! I\u2019m Karin Inoue. Nice to meet you, Orihime.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice to meet you, too,\u201d she told Ichigo\u2019s former twin sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone then focused on the front as Ms. Ochi began her lecture.

No one in group seemed to react to the change, or the light that enveloped them moments ago. The continued talking like nothing was different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So now I know it works, but how did it affect my age? And I want to use this more.\"</span></div></div>",

Then suddenly, much to her surprise, two beams of light shot from the device, and hit her and Syrus. There was then a bright, blinding flash, and when she could see again, she immediately noticed the changes that had occured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of her uniform, she was now wearing a yellow blazer and pants. And Syrus was now wearing an open white blazer with blue trimming, and underneath that was a pink dress. She recognized those clothes well because they were her uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was also apparent to her that her location had changed. When she had used the device, she had been a fair distance away from her target, but now, she was standing with Syrus and the group of people he had been with, Jaden, Hassleberry, Alexis, her two friends Jasmine and Mindy, Blair, and Chazz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Sy, do you think you could write us a note to get us out of class today? I really don't want to take that test we've got today.\" Jaden said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I can't give you guys special treatment just because you're my friends.\" Syrus said. \"I've got to do my job as a teacher.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wouldn't be so worried if you actually studied for once.\" Alexis said. \"Right, Fonda?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, right.\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was truly surprised that the swap had really worked. She was now a student of Duel Academy, and somehow swapping with Syrus had made her friends with Jaden, Alexis, and the rest, even though Syrus was still friends with them as well. And as for Syrus, he was now a teacher, the school nurse, and the head of the Obelisk Blue Girls Dorm. And she had to admit that the whole thing was amusing, Syrus having her jobs, especially the part about being the head of the girls dorm, and how Syrus was wearing the uniform. She then looked down at the device in her hand that had done this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hm, this thing is very interesting.' she thought to herself. 'I can't help but want to use this some more.' She then looked around to Jaden, Alexis, and the rest.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As class went on, Fonda was simply disinterested with what was gowing on as Crowler droned on and on about something. She was more than a bit surprised by just how much that swap had affected her. She had once been an attentive student back when she once had attended school, but now she just couldn't imagine herself being like she had been then. She found class so utterly boring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut this gave her time to think about other things, like the strange little device she now. After all, it was just such an interesting device. Her first swap, between herself and Syrus . Even though she was older than the others, she was now a student. And Syrus had taking all of her jobs. Most interesting was that he was now wearing her uniform, but no one found that strange even though he was a boy. Heck, no one found it odd that a boy was the head of the girls dorm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then there was herself and Jaden. Jaden who was eagerly taking down notes. The same Jaden who had been the academy's laziest student, and who despite being an amazing duelist who was easily one of the academy's best, probably had the lowest grades. But there he was actually doing his school work for once. And since it was her own study habits he must have, she could only assume that he ws probably on par with students like Alexis in terms of his grades. And as for her, she didn't seem to have the slightest interest in class<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fontaine! Stop daydreaming and actually do your work for once!\" Crowler scolded. \"Or else its detention once again for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFonda was a bit bothered by this part. While due to Jaden's habits, she didn't have the interest in class, because of her knowledge of the device, she knew otherwise, and she kinda did wish she was as studious as she once was. Plus, she really didn't want detention. She decided maybe she should get her own habits back in this regard. So she aimed the device at Jaden, and pressed the button. And with that, after the flash, Jaden was fast asleep, and from the puddle of drool, it looks like he had been for a while. And in front of her was a series of notes that she knew she hadn't been writing this whole time, but they were all in her own hand writing. \"This really is an amazing little device.\" she thought to herself. She then looked back over to Jaden. She thought it was a shame to take away . Looking for a random student, she aimed for one who was taking notes and targetted them and Jaden and used it on them. After a moment of another blinding flash, Jaden was no longer asleep and was back to taking notes, although with the device, he technically had never been asleep in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she thought about what to do next, she looked down at her Ra Yellow uniform. Aiming her new device at a random girl, she decided she was going to swap herself into the Girls Dorm. After a bright flash, Fonda was now wearing the standard girls uniform, and the other girl was in wearing the uniform for Ra Yellow. \"There we go.\" she thought to herself. \"Now I'm back in this dorm, the same as Alexis, Jasmine, and Mindy.\"</span></div></div>",

By herself, Fonda eventually came to a display card of the Drak Magician Girl. As she looked at it, she suddenly got an idea. \"Hm, I wonder if it this thing can work on things other than just humans?\" she thought to herself. \"For example, maybe a duel monster card?\" she said, then looked over at the Drak Magician Girl card on display. \"Might as well test it out.\" she said aiming the device at it and herself. \"I always did like her costume.\" she said as she activated it, intending to swap their clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the flash, she looked down at herself. Instead of the Obelisk Blue Girls uniform, she was now wearing classic blue and pink attire of one of the King of Games most iconic monsters. She even held the wand in her free hand! She briefly struck a pose in her new attire for herself in a nearby mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then looked over to the Dark Magician Girl card, and she could see the top of the Obelisk Blue Girls uniform in her picture. And in a poster of her whole body nest to the displayed card, she was indeed wearing the Obelisk Blue Girls uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This thing really is amazing.\" she thought to herself, looking down at the clothes she now wore. \"I think I'll keep them for a while.\" she said as she straightened out her new hat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking back over to her new friends, she wasn't surprised that they didn't seem to find her sudden change of close odd. After all, she assume that to everyone else, she always dressed like this.</span></div></div>",

Once again using her device, she aimed it at Syrus and the girl, and with a simple occupation swap, Syrus was now wearing his old uniform, while the girl he had swapped with now wore the uniform that had been her own until she found this device. And of course, the rest of the group was once again oblivious to the changes.

As contemplated what to do next, she looked over to her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaden was talking with Syrus and Hassleberry, Alexis was talking with Mindy and Jasmine though the two would pause occasionally to take note of any cute boys that they passed, Chaz was keeping to himself, and Blair was following close by Jaden as she crushed on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then when she had a sudden idea. \"Ah, that would certainly be amusing.\" Fonda thought, and then using the device, she performed a few swaps amongst the group. After she was done, she observed the effects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSyrus and Chazz were currently staring at a boy that was walking by. \"Hes pretty cute.\" Syrus said, also speaking with a different tone than normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'll say.\" Chazz agreed, and the two sighed longingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez you two, do you always have to  .\" Jaden said as he shook his head at the two. His posture, as well as the other two boys, was noticably more feminine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course we do.\" Syrus said with a feminine giggle. \"Maybe you should join us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'll pass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Alexis, she was talking with Mindy and Blair. \"And then I made this sweet comeback once I activated my trap card!\" she said, recounting a durl for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds great, sarge.\" Blair said, now speaking with an accent similar to Hassleberry's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it definitely does. Wish I could have watched the duel.\" Mindy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was there. It wasn't anything special.\" Jasmine remarked as she aproached the three. \"I could have done better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, be quiet, Jasmine.\" Jaden said, as he walked over to them. \"No one wants to hear your usual remarks right now<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on Jaden, don't say that.\" Jasmine said with a blush as he walked over to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis, having ignored the brief exchange was just finishing up her story. \"...and thats how I won the duel!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alexis, you're the best!\" Hassleberry said, with his voice now lacking his normal accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the device, she had swapped the personalties of her new friends. Jaden with Alexis, Syrus with Mindy, Chazz with Jasmine, and Hassleberry with Blair. And the results were quite amusing, from Chazz and Syrus acting boy crazy, and Jasmine having a crush on Jaden in place of Chazz's crush on Alexis, or Hasleberry's crush on Alexis in place of Blair's crush on Jaden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all, she wanted to observe more from them like this. She was definitely going to leave them like this for quite a while. Now, what was she going to do them next?</span></div></div>",

I should make sure there's no damage and get back; I don't want Kaede to get mad at me again for skipping out on her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKotetsu was at the center of the crater now, when he said, \"What the hell is this thing supposed to be?\" He then picked up the strange metallic ball off the ground. No sooner than he did did he become imbued with all knowledge of the device called the Exchanger. \"A device that can make me switch anything between two people? What a load of crap! Who'd ever believe--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tiger, come in!

Sure there's a giant hole in the ground now, but there seems to be no casualties nor any major damage to any important pipes and wires.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. I'll relay it to the news team. In the meantime, I've just received word that a NEXT is wreaking havoc nearby. Get over there and stop him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?

I bet she would be so demanding of us if she knew what it was like to be a hero.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, Kotetsu heard the Exchanger whir in his hands. \"What the--\" he started to say, but the Exchanger covered the area in a blinding light before he could voice his thoughts any further.

To finish, Agnes struck another seductive pose and said, \"My ice may be a little cold, but your crime has been completely put on hold!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And another chilling arrest for Blue Rose!\" Kotetsu heard the announcer say. He decided to hang back and watch the crowd reactions.

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">The Exchanger takes the shape of a metal ball with a built-in button on top and two small eye-like lenses. Once in a character's possession, the character will be given all knowledge of the Exchanger and will be the only one able to see anything out of the ordinary in the new world the Exchanger will create.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Exchanger's primary function is to exchange a particular trait between two or more people (including the one in possession of the Exchanger, but this person doesn't always have to be involved) and alter reality to make the exchanges seem natural. Examples of such swaps include: <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBody<br>\r\nBody Part<br>\r\nWardrobe<br>\r\nAccessories (makeup, jewelry, etc)<br>\r\nOccupation<br>\r\nLife<br>\r\nName<br>\r\nSkin Color<br>\r\nPersonality<br>\r\nSkill<br>\r\nAge (unfinished option; 95% of this type of swaps only change mental age while only 5% of swaps change the actual age)<br>\r\nRelationships<br>\r\nGender (actual or perceived; can be selected or random)<br>\r\nRole (can be used on its own to make two people switch their roles (i.e. a soul reaper becoming a student) or linked with other options to reverse those options (i.e. wardrobe + role reversal = a man wearing a feminine version of his own clothes and a woman wearing a masculine version of her own clothes)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther exchanges can be made, but I ask that you send me a message to let me know the exchange you have in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Exchanger requires the thoughts of the user to work and uses DNA recognition to analyze the thought patterns to make the desired exchanges. Furthermore, the Exchanger usually requires little to no charge time after performing an exchange but larger exchanges require up to 5 hours of recharging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinor cursing is okay, but don't write too much of it.<br>\r\nSex is tolerable, but don't be too graphic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease do your best to use proper grammar. I will maintain the right to edit any grammar mistakes I find in the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther than that, have fun! Don't be shy; please add!!</td>",
