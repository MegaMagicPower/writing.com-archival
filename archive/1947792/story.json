Unlike Mercenary: Guns And Gold which uses pre-made characters New Roads gives the readers the freedom to make their own story. While the main plot can be about whatever you like the main goal cannot change: you need to earn 1 billion dollars to conclude your story. The reason you need this money can change but this end goal is what holds the interactive together. You do jobs, earn cash and kick off the climax when you reach your goal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo start you'll need to make a profile for your mercenary. You can used the official template I made for the first interactive or you can make up your own. The only requirements you need to list are name, home base, abilities, starting equipment and starting contracts. When a job is complete the character receives money to store at their safehouse which is used to contribute to their goal of a billion dollars, though some of it may be spent on upgrades and equipment if the reader wishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince this is a more reader-focused interactive I'll leave it to the contributors themselves to come up with factions and characters as they see fit. If you want to use already established characters and factions you can do so as well, but try to keep their personalities close to how they were in the original. One last thing, always include an option for more profiles if you make a new list, that way new readers can make their own characters if they want. That's about it as far as rules go, good luck out there!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelect a profile or create your own!</span></div></div>",

He's built like a brick house and in typical biker fashion he wears a black leather jacket and long scruffy jeans. When the occasion calls for more formal wear, he usually digs out his old suit and tie that's several sizes too small for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHome Base: A small house in a small town right in the middle of the Gibson desert, Australia. This old, beat up house has everything Mel could want, a kitchen with an oven he barely uses since he almost always fires up the grill instead, a bedroom with a big comfy bed that's very hard to miss when you lunge at it drunk as hell at 4 in the morning and a nice little corner where the big man himself can lift weights all day long. However the garage is where Mel spends most of his time, the place is almost as big as his actual house, to make room for all of his prized motorcycles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkills/Perks: Many years of Lifting and steroid abuse have transformed Mel into a musclebound behemoth. He has great endurance and strength but he's no superman. He can kill someone with his bare hands but he can't bend metal, he'll probably survive being shot at unprotected but he'll sure as hell feel it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeaknesses: He is generally nice enough and really foul mouthed but this attitude hides a very, very short temper. His mood can change nearly instantly once he gets agitated, and that isn't too hard to pull off. He can completely botch a job just because the man he was supposed to escort said something mean about his mother. Plus being this big has it's advantages but it's very hard to not draw attention in a crowd<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarting Assets: .500 S&amp;W Magnum - for when you want to kill a bloke and the four other blokes behind him. Many people complain about wrist pain and even dislocated elbows when using this beast, but Mel doesn't mind it too much.<br>\r\nDouble-barreled shotgun - Mel received this bad boy from his father, who got it from his father, who stole it from a sleeping old man many years ago. Al through it's low capacity may be a problem this old thing will not break no matter how much Mel swings it around at people. He also has access to standard buckshot for short range, slugs for long range and Rocksalt rounds for when he needs the target alive.<br>\r\n\"The Beast\" - Mel's pride and joy. A heavily modified black Chopper motorcycle fitted with metal spikes and skulls all over. Mel prizes this thing more than any other biker he has and is ready to risk his life to make sure that not a single scratch bestow it's beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarting Contracts<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaid Company - John Bradley is a shy, socially stunted, Australian millionaire, who has recently been having health problems. His psychiatrist atributes this to high levels of stress and has advised Mr. john to take a week long vacation in Sydney. In the end, John's paranoia got the best of him as he has elected to hire a big and menacing guy to be his bodyguard as he's relaxing, And Mel fits the bill perfectly  Pay: $1,000,000- $25,000,000<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuture Fuel - A remote military base in the Gibson desert has been researching alternative fuel sources and is very close to making a breakthrough. Oil magnates around the world fear that this new type of fuel will spell the end to the fossil fuel age and subsequently cost them their empires. After failing to convince the public that this new fuel is harmful or inefficient they have resorted to hiring criminal and mercenaries to halt the progress Pay: $50,000,000 - $125,000,000<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMad Mad Wasteland - Notorious mass murderer Stanley Caleb has been on the run from the police for the last 8 moths. The ruthless criminal has been on the move constantly changing his hideout to avoid being caught. His latest temporary home is very close to Mel's home town and since the authorities would take too long to get there they have offered up a bounty on Stanley's head so that the nearby population might catch him before he relocates. You will get paid better if you bring him in alive. Pay: $1,000,000 - $10,000,000<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFire Up The Grill! - A cult of arsonist has been terrorizing Sydney for the past month, setting fire to many homes, shops and restaurants, thus angering the city's residents and business owners. While simply getting rid of the cult would prove adequate, many of the rich victims would be glad to see the arsonists go down in a brutal and ironic fashion .

But this state of tranquility would not last as the Loud and obnoxious death metal that Mel had set as his ringtone pierced his ears. After emitting several annoyed grunts, He shoved his hand in his pocket and took out an old flip phone that was comically small compared to his hand.<br>\r\n\" 'Ello? Mel Buckley speakin.\" he said into the phone. <br>\r\n\"Ah, i'm glad to finally speak with you Mr. Buckley. I'm a representative of several large oil magnates who have chosen to not reveal their identity to you. On their behalf i shall discuss the details of the contract\" the voice on the phone said in a calm matter.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah don't worry i've done my homework. But what i gotta know is exactly how much yer gonna pay me, and a billion dollars will do nicely.\" Mel said.<br>\r\n\"Erm we were thinking more along the lines of 50 million to 125 million\" the voice in the phone answered.<br>\r\n\"So little eh? Is that how much yer bosses prize their Tycoons?\" Mel asked, already getting agitated.<br>\r\n\"May i remind you that youre far from a professional and that my employers are taking a large risk by hiring you\" the voice replied, as calmly as before.<br>\r\n\"And how many of these \"professionals\" live right next door to the damn base. By the time anyone else flies over, the  \"Future Fuel\" will likely already be a thing, them egghead work fast ya know!\" Mel said,  starting to loose his temper.<br>\r\n\"The reward will not change Mr. Mel, so stop wasting time. back to the point, how do you intend to carry out the task\" asked the voice.<br>\r\n\"It's simple Mr. Mystery Man...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNOTE: This chapter was written by EggzSupreme.</span></div></div>",

And lucky you, i'm an expert in both fields\" Mel proclaims to the man on the phone. After a short silence the man sighted and said \"Very well, i trust that you will cover up your track afterwards? Oh, and if you tell anyone about this little conversation we had we will have you killed, understood?\"<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, i'm as reliable as they come. Now piss off, i have important matters to attend!\" Mel said as he closed his phone. After throwing it across the room onto a pile of clothes he resumed watching TV. After a few hours of watching blisteringly awful reality shows, our mercenary biker finally decided he has had enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a loud grunt Mel got off his sofa. He walked off to his bedroom and started rummaging through one of the drawers, after a few seconds he found what he was looking for, an old map detailing the local area. The map was pretty empty with only two towns one of which was Mel's hometown, several gas stations and one military base, which was tonight's target. After memorizing the road, Mel hastily folds the map and shoves it in his pocket. He then shifted his attention to the nightstand next to his bed. On top of the nightstand there was an unusually large book with \"A short history of violence\" written on the cover. Mel picks up the book and flips over the cover, revealing it to be hollow, containing his beloved S&amp;W .500 Magnum. After admiring the craftsmanship for a moment he tucked it away into his belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now where the hell did i put...\" He muttered as he rummaged through the house, making a mess in the process. In a moment of clarity Mel froze in place. He then crouched next to his bed, reaching under it with his massive hand. \"There you are! Thought you could hide from me?\" he said as he pulled out his prized double barreled shotgun. The thing was far older than him, it was a gift from his father, who got it as a gift from his father, who stole it a long time ago. As he started aiming it around the room pretending to fire, nostalgic memories of him hunting dingo dogs with his father flooded his mind. Even through it's age and the poor conditions in which it's kept, this bad boy refuses to break, which was what Mel loved about it the most. He placed the shotgun on his back. After stocking up on ammo for both guns he headed towards the garage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter flicking the switch, the entire room lights up. In the middle of the room, surrounded by tools and spare parts was Mel's pride and joy. \"Damn. I'm never gonna get tired of watching you\" Mel said as he gazed upon his black, custom made Harley-Davidson Chopper with the words \"The Beast\" inscribed on the side. After making sure everything about the bike was in top shape, he jumped on top of it and drove off into the night, to kick ass and make money. After a 40 minute ride on the empty road in the middle of the night, our mercenary finally made it to his destination: Kelly  Military base. The whole complex was nothing spectacular, a medium sized grey building, two stories tall, some military jeeps parked nearby with chain link fence enclosing the place. Any other bloke would have though nothing of the place, but Mel knew that all the good stuff was hidden deep underground. He then surveyed the building, as best he could in the dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What has this country come to? No one the guard towers, a handful of patrolling guards who are sleeping on duty none the less, not even some barbed wire to stop a drunken hooligan?\" Mel said as he took the shotgun off his back \"Let the ass kicking i'm about to unleash at least be a wake up call for them to get their shit together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does he proceed?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNOTE: This chapter was written by EggsSupreme.</span></div></div>",

While most \"professionals\" would forge an intricate plan, scout the area and sneak in, avoiding or eliminating the guards, Mel was having none of that. Instead he did what any self respecting Man would do, that is walk straight in, shoot anyone in his way and destroy the \"future fuel\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel strolled confidently to the door of the fence, when he got there he wrapped his meaty fingers around the door handle and proceeded to pull. Emitting a loud creek the door refused to open, after thrashing it around for a few minutes Mel noticed that below the handle there were chains with a lock holding the doors together. \" Well at least they didn't forget ta lock the damn door. Ain't gonna stop me but still, good fer them. \" with those words Mel pulled out his sidearm, aimed the barrel point blank at the lock and squeezed the trigger. A loud bang echoed through the surrounding as the .500 magnum round shred through the lock, destroying the mechanism and making it fall to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mel pushed the two fence doors apart he wondered why no one sounded an alarm or even came over, sure they probably weren't expecting company but the unprofessionalism succeeded to anger Mel. As he closed in on the main building, he saw someone coming out of the entrance. The figure took out a flashlight and started scanning the surroundings. The man was wearing army fatigues and carrying what looked like an assault rifle of his back. The light from the flashlight finally found it's way to Mel, illuminating his body. The guard then said \"Hey you! You're not supposed to be...\" but he was unable to finish his sentence as Mel reacted quickly by raising his revolver, taking  aim at the poor bloke's head and firing. The bullet wheezed through the air and landed on the guards face, taking a chunk off the left side of his head, killing him instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the man's lifeless body fell to the ground, Mel sprinted towards the entrance. He underestimated them, they probably know someone is attacking so he needed to act fast and catch them off guard while he still can. The interior was all white with long, mostly empty corridors. The brightly lit rooms were a stark contrast to the darkness outside and it took Mel a few seconds to get used. He reloaded and raised his revolver, ready for action. There were several signs pointing in different directions, one of them said \"Armory and Elevator to the right\". \"Bingo\" Mel said to himself. He headed to the right down a long corridor. As he turned a corner he saw the elevator, and three people standing in front of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you don't understand. I'm so close to a breakthrough, just let me finish my work!\" said the man wearing a white lab coat. \"Look sir, there has been a breach in security, please just go to the panic room until we get the situation under control.\" said one of the two men in army uniforms. They hadn't noticed Mel yet, and he wasn't going to pass up the opportunity. Just like an old cowboy he fanned his revolver, sending the six slugs towards the group. The first round planted itself in the scientist's chest killing him instantly, the second two rounds found their home in the first guard's stomach making him recoil backwards, by this moment the second guard realized what's going on and started raising his rifle, the fourth and fifth bullets missed but the final bullet landed in his forehead, sending blood and bits of his skull around him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in front of their corpses, Mel raised up his revolver and blew off the smoke coming from it. To his side there was a door with a sign above it that said \"Armory\" right ahead there was an elevator that led to the deeper parts of the facility. What does Mel do?</span></div></div>",

When he pulled on the doorknob, the door refused to budge. Mel sighted, he looked under the doorknob for a keyhole or a lock, but he couldn't find any. Instead on the side of the door there was a small device with the words \"Authorized access only, please scan fingerprint\". \"You gotta be fucking with me...\" Mel said. He then remembered about the several authorized people in around him that could help, namely the scientist who was lying dead, slumped over the wall.<br>\r\nMel crouched next to him, ripped a piece of his white lab coat. He then wrapped the piece of cloth over his right hand, and then punched the glass with all his might.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class shattered instantly, allowing Mel to open the door from the other side. The small room that was the armory was filled with green ammo containers and crates with military hardware. Like a small child on Christmas morning, Mel rummaged through all of the containers in a matter of seconds. The results were disappointing, most of the crates were empty and the ones that weren't had a few glocks and ammo for them. In frustration Mel kicks one of the boxes on the ground, making a slight dent in it's wooden sides. On second inspection he realizes that he hasn't checked this box yet. After forcing the wooden lid open he finds that it is filled with foam peanuts on top of which there were four small, beige bricks with the words \"Demolition Block (composition C4)\". Smiling at his discovery, Mel shoves all four bricks in his back pockets and after emptying the foam peanuts of the ground and rummaging through them, he finds the detonator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanting to waste no more time Mel got in the elevator. Having basically no knowledge of the complex, Mel could only assume that the \"future fuel\" he had to destroy was on the deepest level. Then again it could be some other level? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuestion is, are you feeling lucky?</span></div></div>",

He hesitantly hovered his meaty finger next to the buttons, moving it up and down trying to think of something that made sense. \"Alright Mel focus\" he said to himself \"let's see now, It should be close to the armory in case of a breach, soooo... third button? No wait, should be far away from the surface right? Top secret experiments and all... Fuck it!\" Mel yelled slamming his fist on the lowest button. The elevator doors close, and it starts going down to the deepest part of the complex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elevator music, of all things got Mel on the edge. It was the perfect mix of annoying jingles and calm sounds, short enough to be played several times over. Like a psychological weapon meant to pacify intruders. But Mel wouldn't give up to easily. As he started approaching the lowest floor he took his trusty double barreled shotgun off his back and got ready to fire, in case of an ambush. The elevator made a loud ding, signaling that it had reached it's destination. As the doors slowly split open and the bright white light invades the small compartment, revealing... nothing. Or more precisely no one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was very spacious, with many tables, covered in chemistry sets, microscopes and other scientific gadgets Mel couldn't name. The whole place was a mess, obviously it had been evacuated very hastily. Mel looked around seeing many papers and documents. Mel picked up one and started reading it. For the most part it was just boring chemistry, but in the end there was a specific paragraph that stood out \"WARNING! After further testing it was discovered that the aforementioned compound is extremely reactive and will combust violently if heated up. After a visit from the Health and safety department it has been deemed unqualified for mass production. Please deposit any and all instances of the aforementioned chemical in the storage area just down the hall on the right, for later disposal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fucking perfect! I can blow this whole joint!\" Mel exclaimed. He then followed the paper's instructions and found himself in front two metal door with hazard signs over it and \"Storage room\" written on it. After pressing a button on it's side that he could only assume was for opening Mel was surprised by a loud BEEP and a gentle female voice that said \"Authorized Access only. Please slide your keycard across the surface of the button for scanning.\" \"You gotta be shitting me, why do these fucking nerds feel the need to lock everything\" Mel yelled out in frustration. As he felt his blood start to surge the placed both his large hands between the doors and started applying force, in an attempt to pry them open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of struggling and grunting, a loud metallic whirl emerged from the doors as they both gave way, slamming to the side under Mel intense force. Mel was feeling very light headed, he leaned over to a wall in an attempt to balance himself and catch his breath. \"Come on, not now i'm so close\" he said, shaking his head. Felling invigorated, he stood back up only to be greeted by a small room full of all sorts of canister, barrels and containers, short and tall, wide and thin. \"No way to be sure, and it's better to be safe than sorry so i better spread these babies out.\" Mel said as he picked took out the C-4 bars from his back pockets. he spred them out pretty evenly covering all four edges of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContent with the placement, Mel hightailed it to the elevator, being mindful of the compound's explosiveness. After another elevator ride Mel found no guards waiting for him on the top floor, but he didn't mind, made his escape that much easier. After exiting the building and running off into the night, Mel made his way to his bike. Sitting down next to it he looked in the general direction of the military base, took out the detonator, took off the safety cap and he squeezed the small red button. An earsplitting bang echoed through the surrounding desert as a gigantic pillar of fire and smoke devoured the base, illuminating the surrounding acres. The blast wave toppled over Mel's ride and made him fall on his back. After picking himself up, and checking is his bike had any scratches he said \"Fuck me that was beautiful\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then got on his bike and rode off into the night. After arriving in the small messy shack he called a home, he grabbed a beer from the fridge and collapsed on the sofa. Satisfied with his performance he then...</span></div></div>",

Such an event will surely slow down development, if not completely halt it.

You have demonstrated that you handle yourself adequately, i hope that you will work for us in the future.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah. farewell and thanks fer the cash.\" Mel said, as he closed the phone unceremoniously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel then got the sudden urge to check his bank account. Not that he didn't trust those rich guys, it's just that he knew they would sell their mothers if they found a buyer. He then got up and walked across the room, and opened his window. He looked directly at the house next to his and yelled at the top of his lungs:<br>\r\n\"OI STEVE!

A middle aged, skinny man in a tank top opened the window and yelled back.<br>\r\n\"For fucks sake Mel. It's bloody 3 in the morning, can't it wait till tomorrow?\"<br>\r\n\"No it can't wait! Don't make me come over there ya lazy git\" Mel Yelled back.<br>\r\nSteve knew better than to make Mel angry, so he just sighted and within a few minutes he was standing in front of Mel's doorstep.<br>\r\n\"Steve i need ya to check my bank account.\" Mel said.<br>\r\n\"Dammit Mel. Don't you think it's about time to learn how to use a computer?\" Steve asked.<br>\r\n\"Look, i'm a busy man. Plus i know ya don't have anything better to do. So if you can just stop complaining and do what i asked you, you can go to bed again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve sighted, Mel was a true old timer. When Mel was growing up, electricity was something this little town in the middle of nowhere lacked. And now that Computers have become mainstream, Mel refuses to learn how to use one. He only bought one so he could see what all the fuss is about, and he hasn't used it since. Every time he has been forced to use one he just call over his kind neighbor Steve, often at inconvenient times. Steve walked on over towards Mel's old, dusty computer and started it up. Steve knew Mel's credit card information but was too scared to even attempt to steal money, something Mel mistakes for loyalty. Steve just looked in awe at the glowing computer screen, he rubbed his eyes and turned to the giant biker standing behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mel. It says here that you have a hundred million dollars in your bank account.\" Steve said.<br>\r\n\"Yeah i know. Thanks for checking.\" Mel answered.<br>\r\n\"Where the hell did you find this money? You know what, it doesn't matter, you'll be set for life man!\" Steve yelled excitedly.<br>\r\n\"Shut the fuck up, Steve. You wanna wake up the whole neighborhood? And no, i won't be set for life. Cause i kinda owe a billion dollars to some real dangerous guys.\" Mel said, rubbing the back of his head.<br>\r\n\"A Billion bucks?! What did you spend that money on?\" Steve yelled again.<br>\r\n\"Keep it down ya prick! That's the strange bit, i have no goddamn idea what i spend all that money on.\" Mel answered.<br>\r\n\"Mel, i want you to tell me the whole story.\" Steve said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, last friday i got piss drunk, as usual. The next morning i wake up without a single memory of last night and i had the worst, fucking hangover know to man. So i was walking it off when i got a phone call. When i answered some guy was asking when i plan to pay off my debt. I of course ask what the hell he's been smoking, then the bloke informs me that i've apparently loaned a billion dollars during my drunken haze, and i've spent it on god knows what. So now i'm a billion dollars in the red, and the guy said he'll be sending bounty hunter's my way if i don't pay up in time.\" Mel explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God damn Mel. How are you gonna get out of this one?\" Steve said, holding his head.<br>\r\n\"Aw, don't worry about me ya bugger. I'll get out of this mess the same way i get out of every other mess, with extreme violence.\" Mel stated.<br>\r\n\"Ok then, anything else you needed help with?\" Steve asked.</span></div></div>",

While he doesn't particularly care about fashion, he does like to wear designer clothes for the sake of appearance, though he knows when to swap them out for body armor and tac gear when things get rough.  While he's usually clean shaven, he does sport a little stubble from time to time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHome Base: Miami Mansion.  A large and spacious beachfront mansion located just outside of Miami.  It's equipped with every modern luxury you can think of, including a spa, bathhouse, eleven bedrooms, a pool, a wine cellar and a fairly large garden in the front.  The mansion also has a few secret rooms that are accessible only by fingerprint recognition, such as a firing range, armory, panic room and vault.  Lastly, the whole facility is staffed with highly paid and well trusted butlers, maids and chefs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkills/Perks: Joey is an expert gunman, able to handle anything from a pistol to a sniper rifle, thanks to his years of service in the US Navy as a highly-skilled SEAL.  His military training makes him perfectly capable of handling himself in a firefight.  He also knows how to fabricate different firearm accessories, such as high-capacity magazines and suppressors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeaknesses: While he is moderately skilled in hand-to-hand combat, his true talent is with firearms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarting Assets: Enough weapons and ammunition to equip a small army, along with plenty of accessories for all of them.  Military grade body armor and tac gear.  A garage stocked with several high performance sports cars and a motorcycle, plus a helipad for a quick extraction.  Finally, private jet on a hidden airstrip about four miles away for a stealthy escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarting Contracts<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContract 1 - A team of former special ops soldiers-turned-mercenaries are plotting to kidnap the teenage son of a world renowned billionaire in Dubai.  While the leader plans to use the kid as leverage to get his brother released from prison, there is also quite a hefty ransom involved as well.  The risk is quite high, but the pay for a job well done is well worth it.  Pay - $50,000,000 - $100,000,000<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContract 2 - An infamous Mexican drug lord has been arrested by the FBI and is about to be sent to death row.  Joey's assignment is to liberate the drug lord from FBI custody and escort him safely back to Mexico.  The risk is very high, but the cartel is willing to pay a lot for the safe return of their boss.  Pay - $10,000,000 - $50,000,000<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContract 3 - A New York City mob boss is facing life in prison after a sting by the feds.  He has learned that several key witnesses are living in Miami under federal protection.  Joey's job will be to mop up the witnesses and make sure they never testify.   Moderate risk is involved.  Pay - $15,000,000 - $30,000,000<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContract 4 - One of Joey's old SEAL teammates needs help.  His young son is suffering from a serious heart defect and needs a heart transplant as soon as possible.  However, the only compatible donor heart was stolen by an organ trafficking gang, who intend to sell the heart to a dying Yakuza boss.  Joey needs to steal the heart back and deliver it to his friends son intact.  The risk is fairly moderate, but in addition to saving the life of a young child, you also get a pretty decent reward.  Pay - $20,000,000 - $40,000,000<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContract 5 - A notorious gang of bank robbers are planning a major heist by knocking over one of the largest banks in New York City.  However, the cash in the vault isn't the target.  The real target is the contents that is inside a mob lawyers safety deposit box - the account numbers and access codes to his clients' off-shore bank accounts.  The risk is quite high, but the job promises a major payday.  Pay - $150,000,000 - 300,000,000</span></div></div>",

He is often clean shaven, though he will sport a little stubble from time to time.  While he isn't exactly picky about fashion, he does prefer to wear designer clothes, though he will gladly swap them out for proper tac gear and body armor when on a difficult job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHome Base: Mansion.  A large and luxurious mansion located in the Arizona desert, a few miles outside of Phoenix.  The mansion is quite large and is equipped with every luxury one could ask for, including a spa, pool, twelve bedrooms and a wine cellar.  The mansion also has an outdoor shooting range where Thomas can practice, along with an armory, panic room and a vault.   The place also has a high-end security system and is protected by a small group of paramilitary trained security guards.  Lastly, the entire facility is staffed with highly paid and well trusted butlers, maids and chefs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkills/Perks - Thomas served in the British military as a highly-skilled SAS operative for years.  He is an efficient marksman and is also proficient in several forms of martial arts, making him extraordinarily lethal in every form of combat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeaknesses - Thomas has a few minor shrapnel scars on his chest, courtesy of an IED attack that he barely survived while on tour in Iraq.  Some say it was a miracle that he came out alive and was able to keep on serving.  However, the injuries he received on that day left him with some very minor, but noticeable nerve damage, causing slight soreness in his chest area.  Though he is usually able to brush it off, some painkillers and a glass of liquor usually does the trick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarting Assets: Enough military grade weaponry to equip a small army, plus plenty of ammunition for all of his firearms, along with plenty of accessories, such as silencers, extended magazines, tactical flashlights and night-vision scopes.  A large wardrobe that is stocked with everything from fancy 3-piece suits to military grade tac gear and body armor.  A large garage filled with exotic sports cars and high-performance vehicles.  A private helicopter on a nearby helipad for a quick extraction and a private jet on a small  airstrip about three miles away for a stealthy escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarting Contracts<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContract 1 - A ruthless Mexican drug lord has recently been put on trial and is looking at a very lengthy prison sentence, unless the Fed's key witness is able to testify against him.  Thomas's assignment will be to track down the witness and ensure that they never survive to take the witness stand.  The job is fairly risky.  Pay: $5,000,000 - $10,000,000.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContract 2 - The teenage son of a billionaire Arabian prince has been kidnapped by a group of Somalian pirates, who have demanded that the prince surrender every cent of his fortune.  The prince has decided to reach out to anyone who can rescue his son.  Thomas's job will be to infiltrate the kidnappers hideout, rescue the prince's son and get him somewhere safe.  While the main priority is the safety of the prince's son, he will pay a big bonus to whoever wipes out the kidnappers.  The risk for this job is quite high.  Pay: $50,000,000 - $75,000,000<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContract 3 - A domestic terrorist group is planning to take hostages at the tower of the Kigoma corporation.  However, the terrorist act is merely a diversion so they can steal millions worth of bearer bonds from the company vault on the 60th floor.  Thomas's job will be to help keep the hostages under control until the vault is opened.  Risk level is very high.  Pay: $200,000,000 - $600,000,000<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContract 4 - Ms. Ling has learned of a large shipment of old fashioned luxury cars that have arrived in Los Angeles and are due to be sold off at a police auction.  If Thomas is able to put together a crew to steal them, he can expect a pretty big payday.  The jobs poses moderate risks and rewards, all depending on the number of cars that are stolen and the state of the cars delivered.  Going alone reduces the risks, but getting all of the cars will require a team.  Pay: $25,000,000 - $50,000,000<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContract 5 - A New York City mob boss has recently acquired a list of federal witnesses that are in hiding across the US, and could bring down his organization if they make the witness stand.  He has offered to pay a hefty sum to whoever is willing to take out each witness.  The risk factor for this job is fairly moderate.  Pay: $50,000,000 - $100,000,000</span></div></div>",

        "created":1376686140,
        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Welcome to a new saga in the Mercenary world. Since the creation of Mercenary: Guns And Gold I've noticed that readers have expressed interest not just in the story of the characters I've created but the world itself and the potential for new stories to be told. Enter Mercenary: New Roads, an interactive set in the Mercenary universe starring new heroes and villains...created entirely by you, the reader! Design your own characters with their own strengths and weaknesses and send them out to do battle for fame and glory, profit and loot, bloodlust and mayhem. The choice is yours as new soldiers of fortune rise to make a name for themselves on the world stage... time to get paid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Adult content is fine, but don't get too extreme. This is an action adventure style of story, not an erotica or stand up comedy routine. Don't go absolutely crazy with the sex scenes and jokes. Heavy amounts of cursing and some moderately descriptive sexual content is okay. Don't add anything you wouldn't see in an R rated movie. Comedic characters are allowed but most people should be fairly serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. You are free to come up with your own story and customize the characters to your heart's content. All of the mercenaries you create need to be flexible though, with their own strengths and weaknesses. Give you characters some good starting skills and equipment but balance things out with a weakness or too. You can can make a character who is good at everything, just as long as they don't excel at everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Keep things fairly realistic. Mild sci-fi elements like satellite orbital guns and VTOLs are fine but nothing like aliens or superpowers. I'll also allow minor cybernetics like artificial limbs and eyes, but not giant mechs or super advanced power armor. (If you wouldn't see it in Deus Ex or Payday 2 don't add it here.) <br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. Violence, gore and torture is fine, but try to keep it realistic. People shouldn't explode into chunks from anything less than bombs or rockets. Exploding heads and severed limbs are fine if the caliber of bullet or weapon is high enough though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. As a soldier of fortune you are expected to gain vast amounts of wealth and equipment, but keep things within reason and try to pace yourself with the story. Remember that most of your cash should go into storage to advance the plot forward. With that said, you are allowed to spend some of the money you get on things like new properties, hideouts, vehicles and new gadgets and weapons. Just don't go giving yourself a private island and aircraft carrier during the first few chapters. This interactive is about rising to the top, not starting there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. After completing a contract the mercenary returns to their base to store however much cash they got and plan a new contract. As such, make sure you keep the amount of stored cash updated upon each return. The goal is to eventually reach 1 billion ($1,000,000,000) dollars, which enables the character to conclude their story. Always make sure the amount of cash earned is proportional to the difficulty of the contract and how well the character completed their objectives. Don't rush to the end either, try to keeps things going for at least 50-75 chapters before concluding things. Individual contracts can last as long as you like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7. Have fun, killer.</td>",
