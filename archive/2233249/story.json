            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After their mother died when they were young and after being trained by their teacher...the two young Elric brothers performed the taboo. That taboo being human transmutation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the process, young Alphonse Elric lost his entire body. Edward managed to bond his younger brother's soul to a suit of armor. Impressed by his skill, the Truth granted a mercy....he would return Edward's limbs to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis inexplicable act of kindness from the otherworldly being was shocking, but it did little to comfort the tragedy of Alphonse losing his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n=Current Day=<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get back heeere!\" Edward roared as he charged after the Homunculus Envy. \"Jeez, you don't give up..do ya shrimp?!\" Envy taunted the blonde, knowing it would cause the short boy to lose his cool. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHOAREYOUCALLINGSOSMALLYOUCANSTEPONHIMLIKEANANT?!\" Edward screamed at the top of his lungs, giving Lust the perfect opening to slice him with her claws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GaAgh!\" Ed yelped as he barely managed to avoid it, but got a good scrape on his cheek. That scrape was all the homunculus needed, after all..their goal wasn't to kill the Elrics. Especially not today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to anyone but the Homuculi and Father...Lust's claws had been enhanced with a toxin. It of course wouldn't kill the boy, but would certainly make things very interesting very soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what's happening...what did you do to...me?\" Ed's eyes grew heavy, and everything went black as he collapsed unconscious to the ground. \"BROTHER!\" Al yelled as the Homunculi fled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a short period of time to reach the hospital but it felt like forever to Alphonse who had to carry the burden of bringing his unconscious brother to the place, not knowing whether he would live or die by this point, he just can't let him down after all that he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was hooked to an IV drop as a bandage covered the scrape on his cheek, clad in a hospital gown as doctors and nurses fret about trying to figure out what was wrong with him and what this \"Toxin\" was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo tell the truth, it wasn't really a toxin, but it was a chemical that Lust injected him with, but something that was planned to speed things up, instead of killing one annoying teen, it would be better to destroy everyone that stood against them, but the chemical's work is subtle and not too obvious, his bodily sweat and odor will become stronger, his strength and durability will become indisputable, his regeneration unstoppable by mere overpowerment of Philosopher Stones, his ego will grab and warp his mind and his size will soon tower over all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinry showed up, practically bursting into the room past the guards. \"Ed! What happened?!\" she demanded. Alphonse sat in the corner, looking up at her and then to his brother on the bed. \"One of the Homunculi injected something into him...\" He said sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde girl's face screwed up and she struggled not to cry as she placed a hand on Edward's. She fought back the tears, she had to be strong...Ed hated it when she cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her surprise, the hand twitched a bit at her touch. Ed made a slight groaning sound and opened his eyes. \"W-where am...AAGH!\" Edward didn't get to finish as Alphonse grabbed him in a bone crushing hug. \"BROTHER!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teen didn't quite understand what was going on until he had a flux of memories of what had occurred came back to him, up to and including the fact that he was scratched with a strange substance from Lust and made him black out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-woah Alph, don't try to crush my bones!\" He reminded him as he tried to reassure him and the others with a nervous smile as he mercifully was let go of by his now sheepish brother, \"Sorry about that.\" He apologized as the doctor came in to check up on Edward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, what a speedy recovery you've made Mr.Elric, only out for a few hours and your condition improved greatly, but it is a bit strange however in that the effects of this \"Toxin\" is quite strange.\" He mused as Winry raised a eyebrow at what he meant by that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what? Its not poison?\" She asked him curiously as the doctor had a slightly confused look, \"Not exactly, its still in his system, we just need to take a few more samples of his blood and run some tests on him to pinpoint what exactly is it.\" He said to her in an attempt to reassure the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd's ahoge sprang up at the mention of a blood sample. Blood sample meant needles, needles meant no go for the muscular teen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er...can we do this without the blood sample..?\" Edward asked nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinry sweatdropped, \"Its just a needle, Ed.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdward glared at her and swung his legs over the side of the bed. His feet were bare and while they were always quite large and wide...Ed raised an eyebrow as he looked down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could swear the dogs looked bigger...as he flexed his toes quizically he cringed as he felt how sweaty they were. In fact, he was sweating himself despite the loose fitting hospital gown. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurse soon arrived with the needles and syringes. Edward paled as he scooted slightly away from the thing. \"Uh...n-no...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" The nurse questioned as she prepared to do the deed. Edward leaped off the bed, surprising everyone, though the doc did say he had recovered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grab him, Al!\" Winry yelled as the blonde alchemist was making a beeline to the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the suit of armor could restrain his bro, Edward had reached the door and bonked his forehead on the top of the frame. This sent him sprawling backwards into Al. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uugh...what happened?\" Fullmetal groaned as he held his head. \"Brother...did you get taller?\" Al asked, gaining Ed's attention...as he'd always had a complex about his short stature in the past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait? Taller?\" Ed asked him in confusion as he looked back at his brother, wondering if he was pulling his leg, until it was revealed that it wasn't a joke, and that it was quite true, Alphonse's metal armor stood at 7'3, horn included, and the fact that when Ed stood up straight he was actually several inches above him, making him about 8ft tall!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy crap I am taller.\" Edward stated looking around in awe and a bit of excitement at the fact that this seemingly had a pretty great turn of events, here he is practically the biggest guy in the room! His dick twitched slightly in arousal at that realization, there can be some fun with this~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's exactly why we wanted to do some tests on Mr.Elric, that chemical inside him is highly unknown and can be filled with a variable list of effects that we don't know of, and what if this is just the beginning and he can get even bigger?\" The doctor questioned them as they looked at the boy as he looked himself over gleefully, this was a pretty strange tactic from the Homunculi all things considered, but the doctor did bring a good point, nobody really knows what to come from this, and they need to get this situation under control as quickly as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdward wasn't really listening, but he did hear that he might get even bigger...and his dick twitched once more. \"Bigger? How much bigger do you think?\" Edward asked excitedly, looming over the doctor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...yes...if you'll just have a seat please? We'll get the blood samples.\" The doctor sweatdropped at the big Elric's intensity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd was satisfied with the answer and sat down on the hospital bed. He supposed he could handle them drawing blood, equivalent exchange and all that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez, we'll never hear the end of this...\" Winry sighed and rubbed her forehead.</span></div></div>",
