I glance in the driveway slightly confused. <span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms, cursive\">Strange, normally at least one parent is home by now.</span> I unlock the door and I'm about to push it open when I hear a car behind me, I turn around expecting to see my mom's van but instead I find a black limo pulling up in front of my house slowly. The driver comes out and opens the back passenger door, I stand there expecting someone to come out. When no one emerges I look at the driver confused, the driver looks at me expectantly as well. \" Miss? You may now get in.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you get in or refuse?</span></div></div>",

I point to myself and instantly feeling stupid since no one else is hanging out on my porch for him to be talking to. \" Me? This is for me?\" the driver nods patiently then gently takes my backpack from me and places it in the trunk of the limo. He looks at me expectantly. I look back at my front door thinking I could make it in but... When would I get another chance to be picked up in a limo and actually have something to tell my friends on Monday about what I did this weekend? I smile and nod.  \" sure, alright let's go.\" I walk up to the limo when my phone starts vibrating, I pull it out and find it's my dad checking up on me. I'm about to answer when I stop, he would be a complete kill joy about this and he'd probably make me feel guilty and I'd wimp out. I press the ignore button and step into the limo. The interior smells new car and the mini bar is filled with my favorite soda and there is a silver tray holding a assortment of my favorite snacks. The door shuts and locks with a sharp click, the driver gets in and pulls away from my house and heads for the highway. </span></div></div>",

I reach forward and knock gently on the glass separating the driver from me, the driver glances back at you then presses a button. The glass slides down and he asks what I needed. I glance outside. \" I was just wondering where we are heading?\" the diver nodded and casually answers. \" we are on are way to San Francisco of course.\" My mouth drops open. \" San Francisco?! What about my parents, do they know where I'm going?\" the driver reaches over and presses the button again and the glass starts to rise again. \" Miss, you do not need to be concerned about your parents any longer. I must bring you to San Francisco.\" I start protesting but the glass finishes closing up and I thinks it's sound proof and he ignores my knocking. I pull out my cell phone determined to call my parents. When the screen lights up it says NO SERVICE.</span></div></div>",

I assure you the limo is indeed for you!\" I wrestle free and stomp on his foot. He hardly seemed fazed but he didn't reach for me or my bag agian. \" does this mean you refuse, Miss?\" I nod inching into my house. The driver gives a curt nod and steps back away from me like I was no longer worth his time. \" very well, good day miss.\" with that he turns away and shuts the back limo door and gets back in the front and drives off without hesitation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI slam the door behind me and lean against it with my heart thumping. \" what was that all about?!\" I wound out loud to calm my nerves in the quiet house. My pocket starts to vibrate and I pull out my phone. It's my dad. I pick up trying to sound casual. \" hey, what's up dad?\" I can hear in the background that he's still at work. \" just checking to make sure you got home alright.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do I tell him?</span></div></div>",

I hang up and groan, maybe the limo wasn't such a bad idea after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning I open my bed room door so I can go take a shower before school when someone grabs me from behind and pulls me back in and shuts the door. My attacker shoves me against the wall and keeps me pinned.the only light is coming from the street lights and the bright crescent moon, so I can't tell who my attacker is but he seems to know me. I stop struggling to escape when his strong raspy voice paralyzes me. \" moon child, why did you turn down my gift to you yesterday?\"  Gift? Instantly the limo pops up in my head. \" that was from you? Who are you and why are you sending limos to me?!\" the man chuckles and presses me harder into the wall. \" My name is unimportant, Moon Child but you will know me soon enough.  yes it was to bring you safely me but since you declined, I will bring you with me personally.\" I feel like if I don't object right now he will take me away so I shout. \" STOP! You can't take me!\" the man tilts his head slightly curious. \" and why not?\" I glance around my room trying to think of a reason. \" because... Because I ...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nwhat do I tell him?</span></div></div>",

Don't tell me you're one of those over-achievers.\" truthfully I have no desire to go to school but I nod anyway. \" yea, I  have a test in history class that I have studied for all week. I just have to take that test!\" his grip on my arms grow tighter in an instant. \" very well moon child, I will return for you, now go to school but, tell no one of any of this or I will deal with you personally.\" I feel dizzy for a moment and close my eyes, when I open them again a second later the man is gone. I stand there frozen as the sun slowly rises and my mom calls out to me saying if I don't hurry, I will miss the bus. I snap out of it and hop in the shower quickly and finish getting ready for school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    I rush to the kitchen and sit down to shovel my breakfast into my mouth as fast as I can without choking. As I'm eating, I can't help but notice that my mom is just staring at me. I glance at her as I continue to shovel scrambled eggs in my mouth. \" something up, mom?\" almost in a daze she mutters quietly. \" she's still here.\" I'm about to shovel the last bite in my mouth when I pause and look up at her. \" what?\" She snaps out of it and gives me a sad small smile. \" nothing. You're going to miss the bus if you don't hurry. \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you push her to elaborate on her comment or do you ignore it?</span></div></div>",
