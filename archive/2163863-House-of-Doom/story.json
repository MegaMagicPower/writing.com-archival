If we hadn't had to take that lengthy detour from construction, we'd be there by now. Just be patient. We're all tired and eager to finally sleep at home in our own beds.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet was a pear-shaped, middle aged woman who had once upon a time been a high school prom queen and captain of the cheerleader squad. Although her face was still attractive and she carried herself with the graceful poise of a professional woman of the world, Janet had acquired a heavier, more rounded body over the years. Her once champagne colored hair was now dishwater blonde. Faint wrinkles now lined her eyes. Two pregnancies had widened her hips and swollen her breasts, while years of a sedentary lifestyle had added padding to her ass and thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan, age fifteen, sighed impatiently and turned his attention back to a hand-held video game he'd been toying with all day long. He never thought he'd get bored with it, but after being cooped up in the family car for so long, he found himself eager to do something... anything else! Alan was normally an athletic, outgoing teenager who was active in sports, had lots of friends, and regularly had a pretty girlfriend he was dating. Although he enjoyed video games like any other teenage boy, he wasn't a stereotypical gamer geek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan, age twelve, got out her ipod for the umpteenth time today, popped the ear buds in each ear, and started re-listening to the same songs she'd been amusing herself with all afternoon. Megan was a very self-conscious preteen girl, embarrassed by her braces, her stick thin figure, and the occasional zit on her perpetually over made-up face. Where Alan was successful at fitting in socially, Megan hadn't yet \u201cfound herself,\u201d and remained in that nebulously ambiguous no man's land of social awkwardness between childhood and adolescence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve Donaldson looked over his family through the rear-view mirror of the car. He was a tired, paunchy, easily irritated man. Steve worked as in middle-management for a big insurance company \u2013 work he found to be monotonous and uninspiring... but at least it paid the bills. Just like Janet, he had let himself go over the years with regards to his physique. Where once he had been strong and athletic like Alan, now Steve was soft and doughy with a pasty complexion, a rapidly receding hairline, and a slowly expanding pot belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the concentration of the entire Donaldson family was harshly interrupted by a sudden loud, sickening, dull explosion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShit, we just blew a tire!\u201d yelled Steve, hammering his fist down on the steering wheel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, just pull over,\u201d said Janet, striving hard to remain the cool and calm voice of reason. \u201cWe have a spare. You can change it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's pitch black out there,\u201d grumbled Steve, parking the car on the shoulder of the road. \u201cI'm not changing a damn tire in the middle of the night in the middle of nowhere!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we can't just sit here until morning,\u201d protested Janet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, guys...\u201d Alan started to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBe quiet!\u201d snapped Steve. \u201cNow... I guess I could call for a tow truck.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don't think so, honey,\u201d muttered Janet. \u201cI've been trying to get a signal on my phone for the last twenty minutes. We're in some weird dead zone out here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDammit, you're right,\u201d grumbled Steve fiddling with his own phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut guys...\u201d said Alan again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlan, not now!\u201d snapped Steve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, listen Dad,\u201d protested Alan. \u201cThere's a house right off the road. I can see it from here. Just look!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve and Janet squinted into the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, just a few yards off the dark, lonesome highway, there stood the shadowy silhouette of a tall, Victorian style mansion... utterly isolated and looking eerily out-of-place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think anybody lives here?\u201d asked Megan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho would live out here?\u201d wondered Janet. \u201cI don't see anything else out there \u2013 no other houses, barns, or anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don't even see the driveway,\u201d said Steve. \u201cEven assuming there's somebody home and they have a telephone we could use... How do we get there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust walk through the ditch on the side of the road,\u201d said Alan. \u201cHop that little fence, and we're practically in their front yard.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cold shiver suddenly ran down the spines of each member of the Donaldson family. Then, wordlessly, they each exited the car and did just as Alan had suggested. In less than five minutes, the family stood at the front door of the old mansion. It loomed much larger over them now, bigger than it had seemed from the relative safety of the family car back up on the highway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell...\u201d said Steve. \u201cI guess I'd better knock, I suppose.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe loudly rapped his fist against the heavy, wooden door. The sound of his quick, staccato knocking echoed in the dark, still night, air. The family stood, shivering quietly, for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don't think anyone lives here,\u201d said Janet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet's just go inside,\u201d suggested Megan. \u201cDad can change the tire in the morning. We'll just camp out here for the night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe can't just go inside,\u201d said Steve. \u201cThat's called trespassing and...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could finish his thought, Janet had turned the knob on the front door and opened up a dark, gaping maw in the house. Warm, dry air wafted from inside the building, almost inviting the family in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt isn't locked,\u201d said Janet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDad, let's just go in,\u201d said Alan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine,\u201d said Steve. \u201cJust don't touch anything. No snooping or vandalizing anything. The owners might just be away right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet, Alan, and Megan nodded in agreement... and followed Steve into the mysterious house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

Paint and wallpaper were cracked, chipped, fading, and peeling. Exposed wood on the floors and furniture looked badly aged and brittle. But the furnishings themselves all looked to have been luxuriously expensive. Antique chairs and sofas dotted the enormous room. Gilt framed oil paintings of somber, old fashioned looking strangers lined the walls. A large, badly frayed oriental rug lay draped across the center of the hardwood floor. Shelves of dusty, moldy-smelling leather bound books stood along one wall of the room. A distant corner housed a dilapidated, upright piano, badly in need of repair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat a dump,\u201d muttered Alan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWatch your mouth,\u201d whispered Janet in a hushed voice. \u201cThis was somebody's home. And it's still full of beautiful antiques.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but it's all just junk now,\u201d mumbled Megan. \u201cAnd it's giving me the creeps.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire family had felt an ominous shiver of fear pass through them as they entered the home. Megan was just the first to vocalize the nervous, disconcerted feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt least we have someplace to spend the night,\u201d said Steve in a loud voice. He seemed determined not to be awed or intimidated by this strange place. \u201cNow be respectful of course. Don't deliberately break anything or vandalize this stuff. But there's nothing... erm... there's nothing to... uh... to be afraid of.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if challenged by Steve's loud voice and fearless facade, an eerie spectral presence in the house suddenly made itself known \u2013 a heavy, framed wall mirror detached itself from the house, slowly hovered over near the family, and without warning crashed to floor leaving an array of shattered glass fragments at their feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell just happened?\u201d asked Steve in a nervous, unsteady voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don't think we're alone here,\u201d whispered Janet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet's get out of here!\u201d hissed Alan urgently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before anyone in the family could move, something happened...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens to the family?</span></div></div>",

It was as though some powerful magnet was forcing the family's feet to remain rooted to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm so scared!\u201d shrieked Janet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe swirling, blue-green cloud of smoke grew thicker and denser around each member of the family. Then suddenly, the smoke began pouring into the mouths and noses of the family. Each of them coughed and sputtered for a moment, then grew strangely silent... and different in terms of posture of facial expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clouds of smoke were now completely gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn, it feels good to be alive again,\u201d said Megan, her twelve-year old voice now oddly rough and gravely. \u201cWaitaminute... dammit!... I'm a kid... and a girl!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDaniel, human is human!\u201d said Alan, in a high-pitched lisp. He struck a limp-wristed, sultry pose more appropriate for an adult woman than a teenage boy. \u201cYou don't see me complaining about this silly little thing dangling awkwardly off of me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan gestured delicately at his groin, blushed, and giggled like an embarrassed lady of high society.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, Lillian, that's just fine,\u201d grumbled Megan in a deep, gruff voice. \u201cYou don't need to rub it in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid the children cross over as well?\u201d asked Alan, turning expectantly towards the bodies of his parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi, mommy!\u201d answered Steve in a high-pitched falsetto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my goodness!\u201d laughed Megan. \u201cIs that you Sarah?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve smiled sheepishly and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen Matthew, you must be... a grown woman now?\u201d asked Megan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAn' I don't like it none, neither!\u201d said a pouting Janet. She briefly stuck out her tongue at Megan, then awkwardly tried to cross her arms against her chest in a posture of pouting, but quickly grew frustrated at the large breasts in the way, and ultimately just dropped her arms to her sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d grumbled Megan. \u201cAs your mother pointed out, at least we're alive again. It's been... what?... pert near a century since the accident. Living is living, I reckon. May as well make the most of it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next? </span></div></div>",

Although they were free to float from room to room (and now capable of passing through solid walls and floors), some strange force compelled them to remain within the boundaries of the house itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInitially, they entertained themselves by exploring every inch of the decayed, old mansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few weeks, that got old... and the family started to turn a little stir-crazy with the urgent desire to both leave the house and somehow return to the land of the living. As disembodied spirits, the family was unable to sleep, breathe, eat, or even taste and smell anything. Though they had no physical needs to eat, breathe, sleep, or go to the bathroom, the lack of these routine physical sensations was beginning to take its toll on the mental health of the family. Increasingly, they were all becoming more and more the hungry, ravenous ghosts they had always feared in horror stories. Each of them would do almost anything at this point to escape their living hell and become human again... or at the very least exact vengeance upon any living being who stumbled into their realm of power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, one dark and stormy night several months later...</span></div></div>",

This isn't a hotel, its a crappy old building, nobody even lives here\" a female voice said in a British...or rather English...accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because we're lost, that's why!\" a deep ,obviously male voice replied, as Megan and her family observed closely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInto the house stepped four people, all of them obviously British from their accents. The first was a young blonde woman with short, stylish hair, 5' 2\" tall and 29-years old, she had a very feminine figure, not slim...but not fat either. She was innapropriately dressed in a short red dress with a single frilly strap over her right shoulder, and a pair of beige-colored, snakeskin high heel pumps. Her breasts were a perky C-Cup and she was more 'cute' than sexy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind her was a man, older than the woman, with a short, brown haircut. He was quite slender, about 6' tall and wearing glasses. The family estimated his age to be about 32 or 33. He was dressed in a burgundy t-shirt with a Native American Indian motif, a pair of jeans and a pair of brown hiking boots. He was one of the friends of the young blonde woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third person was another woman, about 29 or 30, standing a little over 5' 3\" in height, her long, dirty blonde hair was up in a ponytail and she was dressed in a black tank top (which emphasized her large, H-Cup breasts), a pair of low-rise jeans and brown, high heeled ankle boots. She wasn't as attractive as her blonde companion but still quite good looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the last person was an older man, about 40-years old, who was the best friend of the other man. He also had his head shaved but he was more well built than his friend, and was attired in a white skirt, a pair of black corderoys and a pair of black suede boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four individuals, the family soon discovered were called respectively...<br>\r\nCarly<br>\r\nSteven<br>\r\nLiz<br>\r\nShaun<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tourists? I don't want to be a foreigner\" Megan grumbled, as the family hovered...unseen...over the new arrivals. \"Well, we can always stay as ghosts if you like\" his father, Steve, said back to her, his voice echoing in the hallways of the house...yet unheard by the group of unsuspecting visitors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets wait okay, plus...we don't even know how the whole 'possession' process works\" Janet chimed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose!\" Steve agreed, as the couple's two disembodied children moved closer to the four 'tresspassers' to watch them.</span></div></div>",

Seeking shelter from a storm (and a hide out from the law) one night, they had entered this old house... and never returned. Something had possessed their bodies and fled from the house, leaving the violent, wanted criminals trapped as bodiless spirits in the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But of course, now we're free!\" laughed Cindy in Steven's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the law has no idea who we are,\" giggled Chastity, in Shaun's body. \"See ya later, suckers.

He used Liz's slender hands to clean the dirt and dust off of it, then it checked the barrels, it was still loaded. \"I remembered where I threw this baby\" Mitch grinned, as he shoved the gun down the back of Liz's low-rise jeans and clonked over to his girlfriend in her chunky-heeled boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready to get out of here babe?\" Mitch then chuckled, as he stood on Liz's tip toes to kiss Chastity, who was now considerably taller than him inside Shaun's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure am!\" his eager girlfriend responded, as Mitch started rubbing the erection in Chastity's pants with one of his feminine hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Save that shit for later, lets get me to a fucking clothes shop\" an ill-tempered Harry interrupted the two lovebirds, as he clumsily made his way over the car and maneuvered Carly's sexy body into the back seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He ain't changed as he?\" Cindy grinned from Steven's body, as she followed her boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitch then grabbed hold of one his girlfriend's large, male hands and led her over to the car, opening the passenger door for her. \"Thanks sweetie!\" Shaun's body grinned in a flirtatious manner, as Mitch closed the door. \"I guess I'm in the driver's seat as usual, no where else I'd rather be\" Mitch chuckled to himself in Liz's now slightly lower pitched voice, as he walked around to the driver's side door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting inside, he located the keys in 'his' jeans, started the engine, threw the car gear and then reversed out onto the main road. \"We're back on the road guys!\" Mitch said to his 'associates', sharing another kiss with Chastity before driving away at top speed.</span></div></div>",

She had thick, muscular, very hairy legs... narrow hips (and a noticeable bulge in her tiny shorts)... a strong, barrel-chested torso that stretched the fabric of her baby doll tee to its limits... and an inch-long beard of thick, dark hair all along her chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm a man!\u201d shrieked Megan, in her new deep, masculine voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, the rest of the family assessed their new situations. Each of them had been physically transformed as well. They still possessed their own clothing, but their bodies were completely changed and now sported archaic, old-fashioned hairstyles more appropriate in antique, black-and-white photos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve looked down at himself \u2013 still dressed in the casual attire of a 21st century, middle-aged man, but now with the body and elaborately styled hair of a 19th century woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet had physically become an eight-year old boy, practically swimming in the frumpy, oversized clothing of an adult woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan likewise had also age regressed, becoming a six-year old girl with long hair styled into carefully swirling little ringlets. He, too, looked ridiculous standing there in the massively oversized attire of a modern day teenage boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat's happened to us?\u201d shrieked Alan, who quickly blushed at the high-pitched girlish sound of his own voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's that... ghost or poltergeist or... whatever that threw that mirror at us,\u201d sighed Steve. \u201cIt somehow changed our bodies into... into... whoever we are now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'd guess we've changed into the old owners of this place,\u201d Janet said nervously. \u201cLook at how out of date all your hairstyles are.

A pink-striped blouse was buttoned over the long, ribbon-silk-cotton conglomerate of a dress billowing around Steve, dragging several feet behind him. A flowery night cap--suggesting this was the woman's casual wear--covered part of Steve's head, allowing enough room for the ponytails to fall unhindered. Beneath it all, a tightly-fastened whale-bone corset gave the impression of exaggerated maternity, and the rest of the era's undergarments did their part in hiding Steve's naughty bits, already swimming under layer after layer, from view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The hell is...\" Steve tried to speak and breathe at the same time, all the more difficult because of the corset. \"Those spooks are fooling arou...they're fooling around now!\" He gasped.</span></div></div>",

He was still an adult, albeit a woman now. He seemed intensely uncomfortable in both his new feminine body and his out-of-date ladylike attire. Although he squirmed frequently, uncomfortable in the tightly-fastened whale-bone corset and antique, female undergarments he now wore, he said nothing during the long drive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the back seat of the car, Megan was the next most uncomfortable member of the family. Though she had the body of adult man, both heavily muscled and bearded, she still wore her former clothes \u2013 a baby doll tee, a pair of cut off shorts, and pink, sparkly flip flops \u2013 all of which looked ridiculously tight on her huge, adult, male body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet and Alan had things easier. Both had switched genders and become little children, but at least their clothing was now tremendously oversized instead of being tightly restrictive. Alan was humiliated and embarrassed to be a tiny, little girl with a ridiculously out-of-date hairstyle. Janet still sat in the front passenger seat of the car, but now squirmed and struggled to keep her blouse and shorts (not to mention her bra and panties) from falling off the tiny, male body she now inhabited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an awkwardly silent drive back to their home town, the family arrived at their house in the mid-morning hours of the day. As they pulled into their tidy, suburban driveway, the family could see a neighbor man out mowing his lawn on one side of the house and a mother out playing with her children on the other side of the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to the Donaldson's surprise, the neighbors treated the family normally, as though nothing at all were out of the ordinary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome back from vacation, Stephanie!\u201d called out the mom from next door. \u201cI hope you and Marvin and the kids had fun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man mowing the grass on the other side of the Donaldson's house stopped his mower and called out to Megan: \u201cMarvin, you crazy son of a gun! What's with the goofy get-up you're wearing? Did you and the kids lose a bet or something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAside from Steve, the family was still speechless. He answered for them: \u201cOh, hi there Mike! We... uh... we were at a costume party late last night and... and just didn't have a chance to change clothes yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, the rest of you didn't have time,\u201d called out the mom from the other lawn. \u201cBut Stephanie, I see you looking picture-perfect, just as always. Y'know, I have always admired the graceful way you carry yourself in that lovely retro style. Just back from a long drive, and your dress looks perfect and your hair is immaculate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh... thank you Susan,\u201d mumbled Steve, blushing with hot embarrassment at being complimented on being so ladylike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou're a lucky fella Marvin!\u201d called Mike from the other lawn. \u201cStephanie's quite a dish!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan waved weakly at Mike. Then she and the others quickly followed Steve into the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat's going on?\u201d asked Janet in the tiny, high-pitched voice of a little boy. \u201cWhy are Susan and Mike calling you 'Stephanie'?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI dunno,\u201d sighed Steve. \u201cI guess reality has changed. History has been re-written or something. We're now a different family, and I'm the wife and mother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's supposed to be!\u201d whined Janet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd apparently you dress like a nineteenth century lady,\u201d said Megan to her father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe should check our wardrobes,\u201d replied Steve. \u201cI wonder if all four of us now have completely different clothes. We're probably now some eccentric family of weirdos who goes around dressing like its still the 1890s or something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

The transition was brief, startling. In place of the grand piano and dusty couches appeared a pancake house and railroad tracks, cutting through the empty plaza in which the family lay sprawled and wasted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve was the first to break through the drug-induced haze, the sudden calm and inner peace. He rose to a sitting position and looked over his thin, fragile frame. The spirit had made him a punk rocker of a girl. Her hair was pink, blonde, black, and purple, the equivalent of a broom head in how it poofed downward into a collection of bristle-like spikes, near her neck. She wore a black \"RAMONES\" shirt beneath a denim jacket and a red-and-white plaid skirt (with matching stockings); combat boots and a choker. There were ear piercings, two bolts beneath her lips, a stud on her tongue, and Steve didn't want to think about the steely iciness brushing against his chest and crotch. The joint in her hand, halfway depleted, pressured Steve to fall into euphoria, but he fought back with sheer terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan was next. She had smoked the least of the group, or perhaps she now possessed the highest tolerance. She was a massive, broad-shouldered biker dude straight from the Hell's Angels. Her cruiser jacket was zipped halfway open to reveal a chest crawling with hair, tattoos and scars. Her jeans were ripped, restitched, and reripped all over. The bushy, brown beard, melon-sized muscles, and booming voice (when Megan eventually spoke) gave the impression she was now over thirty, even though the body was just creeping on eighteen. The supine forms of her family lay below her, as she sat higher on the sidewalk, leaning against a \"STOP\" sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan's new form had passed out before he slipped in, and a minute later he woke up. He stretched out, noticed his torso felt lighter and more open to the wind, as did his legs. Why was he paler? Why did his chest feel heavier and his crotch empty? And what was this black, unkempt hair falling over his face, he had always kept his hair close to a buzz cut! With further examination Alan discovered he had become the goth girl to his father's punk, stripped down to her Hot Topic-bought lingerie (all black, of course). An enormous angel wing tattoo spread out across his back, reaching along his arms and stomach to give an impression of being wrapped in feathers. A healthy layer of cosmetics made Alan's face feel smothered and sticky, and like Steve, he sensed his fair share of uncomfortably placed piercings. He tried getting up, only to fall back down again, the girl's ruffled, black hair falling across his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet came to her senses in a firmly-built, Asian body, dressed in a white wife beater and dragon-belted jeans. The wind blew across her bald head and she nearly yelped. In one hand, lying diagonal to her head on the pavement, she held an inhalant of sort. The other loosely gripped a crudely-made shank. Both arms bore lavish tattoos, green, blue, and black, their designs unclear but intimidating, nonetheless. The shock of youth, baldness, manhood, and fitness all crashed into Janet at once, and it took her a moment to put the pieces of her transformation together: intimidating tattoos, wife beater, and a shank? Janet had become a teenage thug!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

He felt a sharp smell of cigarettes and alcohol, and someone else's hands, squeezed his ass. Opening his eyes, he saw the face of the peasant, who also looked at him blankly. The man sharply switched to kiss him and pulled the tongue out of Steve's mouth. Steve tried to push away the big guy, but instead he backed away. And then he lost his balance and fell on his ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting on the asphalt, Steve looked around and noticed that he was at a parking lot near, apparently, some bar, somewhere in the wilderness. From the bar came drunken screams and rock music. Parking was made different by the various choppers parked in the lot. Slipping on one of which was the man who touched his ass.<br>\r\nThe man was quite fat, dressed in a leather jacket, an old gray T-shirt, worn black jeans, and a hefty chain hung from his belt. The man was bald, with a rather long beard. His hands were decorated in different tattoos. A typical biker. The man looked at his hands in horror. Then he grabbed his beard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Steve had no time to consider a strange biker. He almost screamed when he saw what he looked like. Two C cup tits were on his chest. He was wearing a black fishnet topic, under which was a black bra, a bright red mini skirt that barely covered his ass, he had fishnet stocking on his feet and 6 \"stiletto stripper boots. And because of the strange sensations in the ass, he realized that he was wearing a thong. He looked like a cheap prostitute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where am I? What's with me?\" - said the biker is not at all aesthetic, squeaky voices almost crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Janet, Megan, is that you?\" said Steve, beginning to understand what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Megan\" he replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my girl.

Steve now found himself wearing a very short, skimpy looking sun dress with a red and orange flowery pattern across the fabric. The tiny dress exposed much of Steve's smooth, evenly tanned skin. His hair was now long, cascading down a few inches past his shoulders. He had a bit of baby pink lipstick on and some sparkly, blue-gray eyeshadow as well. A series of long, silvery earrings dangled from both his earlobes. On his feet were a tiny pair of wedge heeled sandals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan meanwhile was becoming the groom of the wedding party \u2013 years later. She was now a tall, paunchy, middle-aged man \u2013 much like Steve had been just moments ago. She had short, thinning hair styled in a bit of a desperate comb over designed to hide the condition of male pattern baldness. Her belly wasn't exactly fat, but did seem chubby and doughy now, as though she hadn't exercised in years and spent a lot of time sitting on the couch drinking beer. She wore a pair of colorful Bermuda shorts, a green bowling shirt, and a pair of men's sandals on her pasty, hairy feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan was now turning into his own sister's wife. He had big, puffed up, frizzy red hair, a mostly pretty face that sported a small double chin, and a heavy application of too much makeup, as though he was desperately trying to re-live his forgotten youth. He was dressed in a tight-fitting red tank top that showed the world WAY too much of his flabby, swollen cleavage and jiggling body fat. He was squeezed into a pair of white shorts that tightly hugged every curve of his fat, rounded thighs, ass, and hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet was now a wrinkled, grizzled old man with thin, show-white hair and a big, bushy mustache. Years ago, she would have been the Father of the Bride... now she was just \u201cgramps.\u201d She looked sickly thin and bony. Janet was now dressed in a yellow, short sleeved shirt and had a fat, heavy looking wallet poking out of the shirt's front pocket. She had on plain, gray men's slacks that were hiked up high above her waistline. On her feet were a pair of white tube socks and a set of old, badly worn men's dress shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

He was now dressed in an elaborate wedding gown and had a heavy application of very professionally done makeup on his face. His mascara looked a little off, as though he had been crying and it had run and needed a reapplication later. A thin, silver tiara was in his carefully done-up, long brunette hair now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet had become Alan's new husband \u2013 she looked fifteen years younger and was now a handsome, broad-shouldered young man in a sharp looking tuxedo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve had become Alan's maid-of-honor. He also looked fifteen years younger, but had become a chubby, frizzy-haired woman in a stiff, uncomfortable looking, lime green dress with big poofy sleeves. No longer Alan's father, Steve was now Alan's fat, frumpy, and very single best friend \u2013 the quintessential example of \u201cAlways a Bridesmaid; Never a Bride.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan was the Father of the Bride now. She was now much older and had become a bald, heavyset man with thick, coke-bottle eyeglasses. She was squeezed uncomfortably into a cheap looking suit. She carried a cane with her now and seemed to be moving with a limp, as though she had a bad back or perhaps a leg injury of some kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

She was a withered old woman with a tangled nest of long, thin, silver-white hair. Clothed in tattered rags, the woman shuffled along slowly with the aid of a gnarled, wooden walking stick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI... I'm sorry, ma'am,\u201d stuttered Steve. \u201cWe didn't mean to intrude. Our... uh... our car had a flat just outside and... we didn't mean any harm. We just... if you have a phone, maybe we could call for... y'know, a tow or... or something...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding right behind Steve, Janet gripped her husband's hand tightly with fear. With her other hand, she restrained Alan and Megan from coming any closer to the old crone. The entire family had an eerie sense of impending dread about this strange woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't be frightened,\u201d cackled the hag, somehow sensing their collective distress. \u201cI get so lonely here.

He felt himself shrinking, as the six-foot tall middle aged man began to become a five-foot-two adolescent girl. His face softened, his complexion grew lighter, and his thinning hair suddenly sprouted to life and grew into a thick, shoulder-length mane of fiery red, luxurious looking hair. His waist narrow and his pot belly disappeared, while simultaneously his hips widened and his thighs and butt became softly rounded. Small mounds of perky, pert, bouncy breasts swelled up from his chest. His throat grew tighter and he almost choked as he felt his windpipe suddenly grow smaller and his voice box shifted position. Finally, Steve stood transfixed with horror as he felt his manhood shrink and finally shrivel up into oblivion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome, 'Stephanie,'\u201d cooed the old hag. \u201cMy lovely new daughter. Now run upstairs to your room and get dressed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve tried to protest but found some strange force was compelling him to obey the commands of this old woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-Y-Yes, mother,\u201d he said with the voice of a sixteen-year old girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve hiked up his now oversized dockers to prevent them from falling down around his newly petite ankles, and trudged off compliantly up a staircase at the other end of the room. Upstairs, he felt a weird compulsion urging him to open the third door on the left in a long corridor. Going inside, he discovered the bedroom of a teenage girl... from the dawn of the last century! Again, a mysterious urging forced Steve to strip off all his male clothes. Rummaging through an antique dresser, he found a lacy pair of bloomers and an old fashioned brassiere. Steve quickly put them on. He followed that with a frilly petticoat, black stockings, a garter belt, a modest, tightly buttoned blouse, and finally a very long skirt. He was a bit amazed by the small size of his new collection of shoes. But sure enough, the first pair (a shiny, black ankle boot with a conservative heel) fit him perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve sat down on an antique chair in front of a small, old-style vanity. He gazed in shocked wonder at his reflection in the mirror \u2013 other than his hair looking a bit ruffled, he appeared the perfect image of a young lady from over a hundred years ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStephanie!\u201d called out the distant voice of the old hag. \u201cHurry up, dearie!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Steve felt a powerful compulsion to obey his new 'mother.' He hurriedly brushed his hair, affixed some hairpins and ribbons to it, and somehow transformed it into an appropriate hairstyle to match his new attire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he arose from the vanity, left his new bedroom, and daintily tiptoed back down the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

Instead, she stood fixed in place as her body began to swell up and grow \u2013 bigger, hairier, more muscular. Her tiny, girlish clothes were stretched to the full extent the fabric could bear as the twelve-year old girl suddenly became a tall, barrel-chested, rugged looking man in his mid forties. A thick, bushy, dark beard sprouted across her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome, 'Marvin,'\u201d cooed the old hag. \u201cMy handsome husband. But why are you dressed like a little girl?

Just like her father, Megan felt absolutely compelled to do as the witch commanded and obey her every whim. She quickly stripped of her all of her old clothes and re-dressed herself in a formal, men's suit in a style from about a hundred years ago. Then she quickly tromped back down the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, darling you look so dashing!\u201d cackled the crone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you are so beautiful, my lovely wife,\u201d Megan said, kissing the old hag on the lips. \u201cAnd we have such a lovely daughter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you father,\u201d replied Steve, blushing with embarrassment at having his own daughter suddenly become his father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow,\u201d said the witch. \u201cJust two left.

In the blink of an eye, he became the same size as his daughter Megan. He was now swimming in grossly oversized clothes as the next bit of transformation began to affect him. Steve was horrified as he felt his manhood shrivel up, shrink, and get sucked into his body. Tiny, barely bulging breasts erupted from his now smooth, hairless chest. Shoulder length hair pushed out from his thinning scalp. His face remained mostly the same, but was softer, more rounded, much younger, and visibly girlish. Although his attire had remained the same, Steve was now physically the person he would've been if he was a girl his daughter's age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikewise, Megan was undergoing a reverse transformation. Her small t-shirt and shorts were now stretched to the breaking point as her body suddenly became tall, hairy, and a bit paunchy. A fat, middle-aged pot belly now protruded from just above her tiny, girly shorts (which bulged visibly with her newly swollen male genitalia). The hair on Megan's head had largely disappeared into the badly thinning comb-over of a middle aged man. The small breasts she had once had disappeared completely into the flabby folds of her tall, heavyset, male body. Her face was the same \u2013 but older, fatter, and more masculine. Her skin looked rougher and darker now, a bit pock marked and with a heavy growth of facial stubble. Megan was now physically the person she would be if she were a middle-aged man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA similar but inverse transformation now swept Alan. His face also grew older looking and more plump, with a thin tracing of barely visible wrinkles and crow's feet suddenly developing. But there was something femininely mature about Alan's face now. Likewise, his body was undergoing a parallel transformation, becoming a little shorter, a bit fatter (especially around the thighs, hips, and ass), and decidedly more womanly. Alan gasped with audible surprise as enormous mounds of flabby, fat, flesh suddenly sprung out of his chest. He now had the breasts of an overweight, middle-aged woman. Just as it had happened to his father, Alan now felt his male genitalia shrivel up and get swallowed into the folds of body, becoming the new parts of his vagina and uterus. Stretch marks from the \u201cpregnancies\u201d he'd gone through now appeared across his belly. Alan was now physically the person he would've been if he were a fat, frumpy, middle-aged housewife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Alan's mom Janet underwent the last transformation. Where her son had gained weight, she magically lost it, becoming trim and muscular. Where her son had gained aged, she gained youth, becoming a teenager again. But she was now an athletic, broad-shouldered, masculine teenager \u2013 still standing there in the ridiculous looking clothes of a frumpy, fat mom. Like the others, her face looked vaguely familiar, but Janet had now become physically the person she would've been if she had been a teenage boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery good!\u201d cackled the old crone. \u201cOh, I've gotten so bored over the years. It's fun to have visitors to entertain myself with!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe family, their bodies now completely changed but their clothes still the same, stood transfixed with horror and paralysis over their bizarre new state. The kids had become adults. The adults had become kids. The males had become female. The females had become male. And all, apparently, just for the entertainment of an insane, old witch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

Each member of their family felt drawn to accept the preferred need of the old crone of a woman. She proved to the four people who arrived there on that great porch, letting each know their selves as useful, but in greatly varied as different ways. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs son Alan was to wander toward a barn and the three pony mares he was to find waiting and wanting of him; the parents, Steven the dad and Janet the mother, were sent to where they should join again and procreate. Dad and father to his family walked slowly, feeling sullen, maybe horrified as his body began conforming to the witch and her desire for him to become a Bull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClothing fell apart, ripping by the seams as Steve walked past the great house, and to the corral where the witch deemed he should stand through the night. He walked out of his clothes but the fact he became as naked failed to be a real bother. A bigger problem noted by a grown man was of his body changing, a tail sprouting, skin hue darkening, skin texture turning dense as leathery, and black fur sprouting, spreading, covering him from head to toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh then, not half the full distance from rear of the house to the barn and corral, but Steve tripped, falling down on one knee. As he rose again to standing, he felt his leg hunch, foot change, heel became as a hind hock, and human toes solidified, became for him as cloven hoofs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as his attention turned to how one leg had changed, he fell with the other leg, as it conformed, changing of form and purpose. Steve knew how his legs had conformed and to what then was his final form. Cursed to be a herd sire Bull, he felt oddly agreeable with the plan for his future. Steve did not feel an urge to argue with what the witch had schemed for him to be as do, he felt male in the extreme.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\"A Bull, me a bull, as me then an animal, but still male!\"</b></i> Steve thought, his deciding to like for becoming as is a bovine Bull, came via the spell the old woman thought to address with an acclimation phrase; as what he would become, he would like!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking further toward the corral, a changing Steven, father to his son, noted then Alan. He slowed his walk to give thought to Alan entering the barn, and of his wife walking almost beside his son, as Janet being naked reminded him of a bony cow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wave of changes and fur spread to cloak Steve, and as he approached the corral gate, the gate opened of its own accord.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size45\" style=\"\"><i>\"Welcome in, this farm has need of a Bull, a herd sire. Enter then friend, as come the morning your abilities as a bull shall be in demand.\"</i></font> Said a voice echoing inside the thick bone block head of a then Aberdeen Black-Angus bull.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as Steve strode inside the corral, he knew he had changed, being a four legged animal, he a bull, with a bullish tail, no horns, yet a body made for ease of breeding with cows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>As then of poor Janet:</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet, the mother of both Alan and Megan, knew of her soon demise, as herd what the old crone of a woman said, specifying of Janet to be for the farm as a moo-cow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\"No, oh no,\"</b></i> Janet cried in English as the scalding wave a Hellish transforming evil did evolve her to become a German cow, a Gelbvieh breed brown bovine animal. Her German family heritage merged with the curse, and gifted Janet with being a beef cow entering her time of estrus. She realized her new self and went to the stall there in the barn as the old crone said. As she stood swinging her weighty, bony, tail, the sensations of it sliding across her leathery anus and vulva made her want to cry!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe who was a modern day mom, housewife, and happy, her world came crashing down, leaving her as a naked, furred, bovine, animal, and what was worse, her ample breasts were then a bloating udder with four teats. Janet felt the acclimation phrase taunting her, but she being a vile as bony cow and animal, wanted to fight with her damning doom.</font></span></div></div>",

He lost all cares for his parents, and sister, having his minding sense of love changed. Even as part of his mentality knew what was happening as wrong, the essence of the curse he had enveloping him, became a driving force. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw his anguishing father stumbling alone the worn path leading toward the barn corral. Alan noted how his dad was looking more bloated about his guts and chest. His father's clothes ripping along the stretched seams, tearing away from his body with every stride he took. \"Oh dad,\" did Alan mutter, when he saw his dad, as dress slacks dropped to the ground, and what should be a bare butt was looking very different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan was as he walked toward the barn, going through very similar degrading. His attention held though as he saw his Dad bearing a bovine tail, and seeing how his skin was turning black, sprouting black body fur. \"Aw dad,\" Alan moaned, noting  how his dad, his legs were reforming, becoming the hind-likened legs of a bull. As his dad lost his balance, falling forward, he landing down hard, stood then as upon four legs with cloven hooves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs what had become mostly a black Bull and came close to the corral gate, the gate opened to accept its new tenant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, oh help no,\" Alan heard the voice of his mother, as she having already entered the barn, saw and did realize her cursed new self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom,\" Alan groaned, his own body, legs, arms, neck and throat undergoing drastic changes. Yet from having heard what the old woman said about his dad and of mom, he knew his mother was to become a dairy cow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Alan did reach the big barn doors, he peering inside, saw a nervous, tail flicking, golden brown dairy cow standing in  her appointed stall, she craning her head to gaze about where she would know as her new home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven then, as Alan took his first step inside the barn, he turned his attentions to the right, looking at three furry butts with long hairy tails. He gawked at three dappled brown colored ponies, they flicking their flaxen colored tails, as if excited by his coming. Alan walked slowly, taking note as to the three mares craning their necks to cast a wary eyed look and their new trainer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me, a horse trainer, that seems so silly...,\" Alan thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Alan walked closer to the three pony mares, he began to note that of each carried a different smell. As if the tails flicking were helping to broadcast at him the rather fragrant scents, he became oddly aware that what he smelled was urging a sense of sexual arousal about his loins. Alan felt embarrassed right then, he seeing and smelling the three mares, knew his masculine attraction for them as unholy wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, oh my, but you do...,\" Alan had a thought, his sensation for wanting to do a great wrong was turning into an undeniable urge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, yes what did the old woman say, she said something about the three pony mares as having come to the house as uninvited, and became then as pony mares. So, if they were girls, the act of mating could be a near righteous act!\" Alan stood there mentally arguing with the parental religious teachings taught and adhered to by a loving son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello,\" Alan thought to say, but what echoed the barn was a loud, shrill whinny. The sound of the whinny startled Alan, as it seemed to encourage the mares; they raising their tails, showing each a winking vulva as if to beckon Alan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Alan snorted, it worked to clear his mind, as he looking around, along his furred flanks, he saw his tail swishing as anxious feeling of stallion passions assailed his sensed desires for wants of mating each cute mare!</span></div></div>",

Although Alan by then was too far into gawking at his desired mate, his equine cock bloated larger, spreading the head of his black cock to resemble the bell of a trumpet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinking wet lips with such a savoring scent worked to allure a new stallion toward his becoming a herd sire!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSniffing brought then the instinctive urged idea that Alan should give a broad tongue lick at and up, over the glistening wet lips of lusty mare sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><b>\"Aw yuck,\"</b></span> Alan groaned mentally, as his tongue retracting, went back inside his muzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuffing his breathing, Alan let go a snort as his front legs leaped him aboard the horny mare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"GOOD - GOOD, NOW DO AS YOU KNOW YOU WANT TO DO,\" </b>said the old woman, as Alan swung his pony head to cast a look back at her, seeing she was watching. Right then, Alan knew what he was about to do would by the evil powers of the crone witch doom him, damning him, forcing the future to accept Alan as being a pony stallion, permanently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mare then whinnied to her stallion, returning Alan to thinking about his having become an animal, a stallion, equine-like endowed, was prepared to let jab and sink away his might male member inside a horny mare.</span></div></div>",

As well Alan knew, that she knew of what had others did, as she put to them to the dare, mating or mated with any of her farm animals. To Alan the dare seemed more like a gift, something any youth his age if given would do and be proud from the deed. As much he stood there and recalled his attained age, but according to what he had become, being then an animal, such rules and laws failed to apply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA staggered small stride step of a hind leg brought the flared cock-head to brushing at the sensual black lips of that mare vulva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"DO IT, TINA WOULD APPRECIATE YOU FOR DEFUSING HER SEXUAL PANGS</b>,\" screamed the old woman as she saw Alan wavering from plunging away his soul and future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan just stood there, obvious to the two females that he was thinking, considering his options. Tina, the mare below Alan had learned to accept the fact she became a pony animal.

I know of him, as he did breed, mate me, dooming me and my future, as he damned and doomed his lifetime. The old woman then sold Lee, as I for one was sorry he left us; his cock was so large as long I about went cross-eyed from how he delved it deep, stirring my pony mare desires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo as she wants and become as another pony. Our lives here being ponies comes with other delights than just sexual play. We give children pony rides, as they squeal with glee feeling our size and strength.

A Bull on the farm is there for one purpose and to that even a man changed into being a bovine animal, he a Bull, knew what would keep him from going to the slaughterhouse. Steven knew the sound of what was his wife mooing, as just from thinking about her he gained a partial erection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"MOO,\"</b> bellowed the bull, as did his wife seem to know her husband stood outside, in a corral, in raw weather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\"MUROO...,\"</span> cried then the cow Alan knew was his changed mother and outside, stood his bullheaded father, as both seemed intent to offer their witness as of what he, Alan should do.</font></span></div></div>",

The place was furnished in the antique style of the Victorian era, yet seemed perfectly pristine and maintained in mint condition. Also curiously out of place were the modern, overhead fluorescent light fixtures that had just been turned on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom a still darkened room just beyond the cavernous entrance hall, a tall, gaunt, bald man in a gleaming white lab coat entered the room. He silently surveyed the family, adjusting the thick, goggle-like glasses on his face while squinting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh... hello, sir,\u201d said Steve. \u201cThe... the door wasn't locked and we... well, we... we got caught with a flat tire and... could we maybe use your phone to call for help or something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bald man in the lab coat remained expressionless and continued to slowly walk toward the family, looking them over as though they were lab specimens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh... sir?\u201d tried Steve again. \u201cWe just need to fix our flat tire and then... and then... uh... we'll be on our way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo need for that,\u201d said the man. \u201cPlease come in and sit down.

The rest of the family followed suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSplendid,\u201d said Professor Von Strasser, finally displaying some emotion on his face. \u201cI am delighted you all are here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe professor looked down at an ornately complex wristwatch he wore and pressed a small button on the device. Without warning, a glowing blue gas emanated from some hidden machinery in the antique settee, instantly enveloping the Donaldson family... all of whom quickly succumbed to unconsciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens to the family when they awaken?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>(Originally written by SandySeeker.

Wake up and let us see if my experiments have been successful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan was the first to awaken. She blinked her eyes a few times and realized she was now strapped to a table in a brightly lit, modern looking laboratory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProfessor Von Strasser was immediately hovering above her with interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey all said I was mad!\u201d he laughed. \u201cBut now I have successfully proven I can transplant the human brain, moving it from one subject to another.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan reacted with horror: \u201cWhat?!? What have you done to me... m-m-my brain... m-m-my body... I'm...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour consciousness is in the body of someone else,\u201d said Professor Von Strasser. \u201cAnd his brain is now in your body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHis?!?\u201d shrieked Megan. That's when she realized her voice was much deeper and lower now. And her body felt considerably heavier, more muscular, and hairier!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat have you done to me?\u201d she yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan tried to get up from the table but discovered she was secured tightly by leather straps across her arms, legs, and chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are in the body of a man named Jack Scarborough,\u201d replied Professor Von Strasser. His voice was calm and clinical in contrast to Megan's urgent, frantic shrieks. \u201cJack is an escaped convict \u2013 a serial murderer I believe, wanted by authorities in several states. He sought to 'hide out' here, and I easily subdued him, much the same as I did your family. Jack's brain is now in your body, over there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe professor flipped a button on the table and Megan felt machinery beneath her moving, lifting and rotating the table about so she could see across the room. There was her twelve-year old body, strapped down to a similar table. She watched with horror as her old body fluttered its eyelids and slowly regained consciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJack?\u201d said the professor. \u201cMister Scarborough \u2013 how are you? Can you speak?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWh-What have you done to me, you freak?\u201d shouted Jack. He had tried to roar angrily, but it only came out as a high-pitched squeak from Megan's younger, smaller body. \u201cI'm... I'm a girl! I'll kill you when I get out of here you miserable, scrawny little, pencil-necked geek!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, yes,\u201d dismissed the professor. \u201cBut the important thing is that my experiment was a success. And you really shouldn't be complaining so much, Jack. Once I'm done taking some notes on this experiment, you're free to go \u2013 and now that you're a twelve-year old girl, you'll no longer be wanted from the law. You and your 'new family' will be free to explore your new lives and do as you please.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan's jaw dropped in shock. Was this wanted criminal going to assume her life and leave her trapped in his body?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>(Originally written by SandySeeker.

He could see long bleached blonde hair cascading down his shoulders and two giant breasts covered by only a skimpy bikini top. They were too big for him to see the tight jean shorts that left little to the imagination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell? He asked again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your family are all part of my experiment, Mr. Donaldson. You've all had your brains swapped. After I successfully swapped your daughter with Jack, I switched your brain with Vanessa here.\" The professor gestured to the left where Steve caught sight of his own body coming to. \"Consider your swap a bit of a psychological experiment. Vanessa is a nymphomaniac, and I am quite curious whether her impulse remained with her body or with her mind. Perhaps it is a mix of both. From my testing, I see that you haven't had sex with your wife--or any woman--for about two years. You were the perfect candidate to swap with her! I hope this swap allows me to pinpoint my suspicions. Tell me, Mr. Donaldson, how do you feel? Do you feel horny?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel like I want to kill you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that won't do at all. But after I observe you both for a few days, I will let you go, and you both can enjoy your new bodies!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"New bodies? Are you not even going to change us back!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not! It would be far too dangerous, I think.

Then... you took me back to your creepy old mansion and... what happened next?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe had sex,\u201d said the professor, in a dry, clinical tone of voice. \u201cTwice, in point of fact. It was a zesty, energetic experience. After that I drugged you and kept you down in my lab, sedated until I found an appropriate test subject. Fortunately, the Donaldson family wandered by. And Mister Donaldson proved a wonderful specimen to test you with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEwww,\u201d said Steve's body. \u201cYou made me have sex with some strange dude while I was all unconscious?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot at all,\u201d laughed the professor. \u201cYou misunderstand. I removed your brain, Vanessa. Then I transplanted it into Mister Donaldson's body. His brain is in your body. But back to your reaction just now \u2013 you find the thought of having sex with a strange man disturbing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, duh,\u201d answered Vanessa with Steve's voice. \u201cAnd it's way creepy thinking you'd do anything to me while I was knocked out and stuff... and... hey, you really did swap our bodies! I... I... I'm a man now, aren't I?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, yes,\u201d said the professor curtly. \u201cYou're a man. And Mister Donaldson is now a woman. He has your body. But let's get back to your diminished libido, Vanessa. It seems you not only have Mister Donaldson's body; you also possess his waning, middle-aged sex drive. Or lack thereof, actually. How about you, Mister Donaldson? What is your reaction to the thought of engaging in sexual intercourse with me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cScrew you!\u201d shouted Steve angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, yes,\u201d said the professor impatiently. \u201cIn the popular, gutter vernacular, that is exactly what I mean. Would you like to 'screw' a person such as myself?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way! I... I...\u201d Steve suddenly trailed off, his voice becoming softer and a bit higher pitched. \u201cOh shit! What have you done to me, you maniac? I... I do feel all horny now. I... shit, this is embarrassing... ohmigod, I think I really would like that. Uh... can we, please... y'know... have sex?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPity,\u201d said the professor. \u201cWe're in the midst of evaluating an experiment. We really don't have time for that right now. But perhaps after we're done here... in fact, maybe you and Vanessa could service one another later. I suspect a woman such as yourself, Mister Donaldson, might be able to break through whatever intimacy barriers a man like Vanessa might be struggling with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cP-Please,\u201d begged Steve softly. \u201cDon't talk about... sex. God, I can't stop thinking about it now... change the subject. I just... I just want to... I mean... oh, God, could someone please touch me? I just need to be touched right now. Please? touch me... someone, anyone!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWas I that pitiful?\u201d asked Vanessa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuiet please, both of you,\u201d ordered the professor calmly. \u201cI have several more test subject to attend to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>(Originally written by SandySeeker.

Her brain had been surgically transplanted into the hairy body of a young, male chimpanzee named Bobo. Now in his animal body, she was naked and strapped down to one of the lab tables. She even had a gag of some kind in her mouth, presumably to keep the originally Bobo quiet before the operation while the professor's sedatives were still taking effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe professor carefully removed the gag from Janet's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you feel?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoog ack-ack, AIIGG!\u201d screamed Janet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe still possessed her own consciousness, but the clumsy chimpanzee body she was trapped in lacked the muscle coordination necessary to use lips, tongue, mouth, and vocal chords in creating speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFascinating,\u201d noted the professor, furiously jotting down notes in his clipboard. After several minutes of Janet's wild, animal screams, the professor replaced the gag in her mouth and moved on to examine Bobo \u2013 now in Janet's human body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBobo?\u201d the professor softly asked. He gently touched the shoulder of Janet's body trying to rouse the creature from sleep. Abruptly, Janet's body opened its eyes and looked nervously around the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's me, Bobo,\u201d said the professor in a calm, soothing voice. \u201cI did exactly what I promised I would do. Now, do you remember our conversation from earlier? What did I promise to do for you? You may speak, Bobo. Please go ahead and use your words.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet's body thrashed about for a moment, struggling against the restraints that pinned it to the table. Finally, it stopped trying to move and looked up at the professor expectantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou must use speech,\u201d said the professor. \u201cCan you speak, Bobo? You must try. It is vital to this experiment. What did I promise you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMah-Mah-Mah...\u201d stuttered Janet's body. \u201cMe... Me... Me... mah-make... oo-man. Oo-man. Mah-make oo-man, me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSplendid!\u201d laughed the professor. \u201cKeep practicing Bobo, and you'll get it yet. Ah, this is wondrous! I successfully taught you English while still a chimp, and now that you have the body of a human being, you are able to actually speak! Oh, how exciting this is! Keep practicing, my boy... erm... girl, I guess I should call you now. You'll get better at it with time. Here, why don't you come be my lab helper, Bobo. Just like old times.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet, still bound and gagged in the hairy chimp's original body could only stare with terrified horror as the professor un-bound her old body and began leading it around the laboratory. Bobo, in Janet's old body, lumbered along low to the ground, with a wide-legged crouching stance, dragging his knuckles behind him and occasionally stopping to scratch curiously at his new, empty crotch and his new, heavy, fat breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, yes,\u201d said the professor. \u201cYou're a woman now, Bobo. It couldn't be helped. You'll adjust. Your name is Janet Donaldson. Can you say that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM-M-Me Ja-Ja-Jaaa-net!\u201d exclaimed Bobo with Janet's voice. \u201cMe Ja-Jaaaa-net!

She struggled with her chimp hands, but was unable to remove it. With high heeled boots that he was unaccustomed to wearing, Steve walked awkwardly towards her and removed the gag.

But these weren't the lustful feelings inside of her that bothered her, it were the violent ones!

Huh... maybe getting trapped in your girly little bod wasn't such a bad thing after all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoog, Akk Akk, Akk!\u201d screamed Janet furiously. Although unable to communicate with the others, she still understood every word that was being said. It frustrated her immensely to see her daughter stuck in such an awful situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve meanwhile stood silently fixated on his own big, bouncy breasts. He only looked up occasionally to cast a lustful glance at Vanessa or Megan \u2013 the only human, male bodies currently in the room. Then immediately embarrassed by his own naughty thoughts, he'd blush and go back to staring down at his boobs again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment or two of awkward silence, Vanessa finally spoke up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can't go back to my pimp like this,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd you guys prolly can't... like... go back to your old lives neither.

Something about inhabiting Jack's body was making her turn darkly violent. Yet Jack (in Megan's body) still seemed pretty violent himself. Would that start changing the longer they stayed this way?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what's it gonna be, gang?\u201d asked Jack. \u201cCuz, I can go either way.

Either I will have to expel her, or I can pull some strings and get her admitted to a reputable girls reform school. It is a private institution, however.

Vanessa's body had an insatiable thirst for sexual encounters with strange men. Steve had never been strong enough to resist the urges.

Vanessa was a high school drop-out with few skills and no work experience. Steve had been forced to turn tricks in order to survive. The abnormal hormone levels in Vanessa's bloodstream elevated his libido to the point where Steve actually enjoyed making money this way. To give up this life would be almost impossible for him, both economically and emotionally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * *<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet sniffed the air cautiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the female chimpanzees would soon be ready for mating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet knew she wouldn't be able to fight the urges. In her male, chimpanzee body she now had all the same urges as Bobo the chimp had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn another day, maybe two at most, Janet would be squawking and aggressively fighting the other males for the chance to mate with the best females.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first couple times she had struggled in vain to resist the hot blooded, primeval urges. That mental distraction had cost her. By the time she surrendered to her animal desires, the other male chimpanzees were already pretty aggressive. She'd gotten pretty badly bruised those times, and had to limp away frustrated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, Janet had surrendered to the fact that she would likely spend the rest of her days as a smelly, hairy, male animal trapped behind bars in zoo cage. As humiliating as it was, Janet tried to make the most of the situation, using what remained of her superior, human intellect to outsmart the other chimps at things like getting the choicest bananas or mating with the best females.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet now existed day-by-day, in a simple, animal survival mode. She had completely lost track of the time and hadn't the foggiest notion of how long she had been trapped in Bobo's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * *<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will help if you wear some makeup,\" said the lawyer. \"Just a little lipstick and some eyeshadow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll look like an idiot!\" moaned Megan in a low, gravelly voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all Mister Scarborough,\" replied the lawyer. \"It'll go a long way towards convincing the judge of your sincerity, that you really are mentally unbalanced and have multiple personalities.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not multiple personalities!\" snapped Megan. She banged her hairy, manacled arms on the table. The handcuffs around her wrists jangled sharply in the air. \"Just one personality. I'm a girl! I'm 12, no wait, I should be 13 by now, and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't need to convince me,\" interrupted the lawyer. \"I'm your attorney. But if we're going to convince the judge of your incapacity to aid in your own defense...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't do anything!\" sobbed Megan. \"I'm not this criminal everyone thinks I am. And now I'm going to get executed for a bunch of murders I didn't commit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't give up hope,\" said the lawyer. \"I think I can get you committed to a mental institution. You'll probably be there for the rest of your life, but it's better than death row.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't deserve this,\" cried Megan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And even if the judge denies our request,\" continued the lawyer. \"We can strike a deal with the prosecution. I think they'll work out a plea agreement where they take the death penalty off the table in exchange for you pleading guilty and agreeing to a life sentence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not fair!\" cried Megan, noisily banging her big, meaty fists on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * *<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan smoothed the wrinkles from his dress and stared out the window into a sunny garden just outside the hospital grounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smiling nurse entered carrying a hospital tray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Mrs. Von Strasser!\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan glanced up, a look of perplexed confusion on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ma'am?\" said the nurse. \"Are you with us today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not Esther,\" said Alan in the creaky, hoarse voice of a 97 year old woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, dear,\" sighed the nurse. \"I'll have to speak with the doctor about adjusting your medications again. I really thought we were making progress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan frowned at the nurse but said nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of your medication,\" said the nurse. \"I've brought your pills here with your breakfast. Please be a good patient. Don't fight with me today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan grimaced and shook his wrinkled, old head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I need to go get the orderlies to hold you down?\" asked the nurse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, Alan opened his toothless, old mouth and swallowed his Alzheimer\u2019s medication.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good,\" smiled the nurse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thin trickle of drool rolled down Alan's chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurse wiped it away, and Alan went back to staring out the hospital window at the sunny garden beyond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * *<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a remote, underground laboratory, a proximity alarm began chirping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn athletic looking teenage boy wearing a pink, polka-dotted dress spoke up: \"Victor, dear. I think we have visitors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm busy with an experiment, mother,\" came the irritated voice of Professor Von Strasser from the next room. \"Are you quite certain someone is there? This isn't another of your episodes, is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You never believe in your own mother!\" huffed the boy. \"I take my medication every morning. It's done wonders for me. My mind is just as sharp as it was 80 years ago...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why do you insist on dressing that way?\" asked the professor, now entering the control room. \"You really must adapt to your new roles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm still your mother!\" snapped the boy. \"And I'm still a woman. I may be stuck with this strange boy's body, but I know who I am!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mother, the medication has helped you,\" replied the professor. \"But you do still have 'episodes,' and the cross-dressing behavior is... hmm, it seems you were right after all. We do have visitors. Trespassers, just outside the gate. Janet, would you come in here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the next room, a naked, fat woman lumbered in, her cellulite thighs and flabby breasts jiggling wildly as she walked. There was something unusual about her movement as well. She crouched a bit while she walked, with her knees bent low and her legs stretched out a bit too wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I going to do with you both?\" sighed the professor. \"One of you won't wear appropriate clothes, the other won't wear clothes at all! Unless the two of you can adapt, I shall never be able to take either of you out in public.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sowwy,\" said 'Janet' in a dull monotone and flashing her teeth like a monkey. \"I no wike cwothes. They ma-ma-make me twip and faw down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must practice your speech as well,\" said the professor. \"You've made great stride, 'Janet.' But you would still arise too much suspicion out in public like this. Now go get dressed at once. We have guests. And mother...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not changing,\" said the teenage boy, stamping his high-heeled foot for emphasis. \"I am your mother, Victor. You don't give the orders around here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes,\" grumbled the professor. \"Have it your way. The interlopers are at the gate. I'll be back shortly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpstairs, a group of unsuspecting victims were just entering the professor's house, seeking shelter from a storm...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe End?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>(Originally written by SandySeeker.

He spoke, \"Megan, could you turn away for a moment? I am going to go to the other corner of the room. I...um...need to pee.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ew! Gross, Dad! Why don't you use a bathroom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no idea where the bathroom is! Do you SEE a bathroom? Besides, it serves this asshole right if I pee on his floor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan grumbled as she hid her eyes, \"Alright...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve walked over to the other side of the room and pulled down his shorts. Vanessa hadn't even bothered to put on any underwear! It didn't matter, Steve had to do this quickly anyway. He started playing with his vagina, rubbing, stroking, and soon thrusting his fingers inside. He was hoping he could quickly achieve an orgasm in order to feel some kind of relief. After a little while, he started to moan. Puzzled by the sound, Megan peeked at what her father was doing. She wanted to scream about how disgusted she was, but he didn't. In fact, she realized that she wasn't disgusted at all. She was feeling turned on, but the violent feelings were there as well--both more intense than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked over next to Steve. He was so engulfed in his masturbating that he didn't notice. She grabbed his long blonde hair forcefully. Megan knew she had to try and stop these feelings. She yelled at him, \"You'd better fucking stop it before I pull your goddamn hair out.\" She threw Steve towards the ground in an aggressive way, but not quite hard enough to be injure him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started crying, \"I'm sorry. The feelings of this body are stronger and worse than ever.\" Steve wouldn't admit it, but he actually enjoyed how Megan had thrown him around a bit. Instead of getting turned off, he was now hornier than ever. He wondered if it was better for him to go off alone and find a room somewhere or take his chances staying with Megan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>(Originally written by Ash.

It was as though he somehow had a squeakier, higher pitched version of his old voice. \u201cWhat's wrong with my voice?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI imagine it's a combination of factors,\u201d the professor said cooly, suddenly stepping out of the shadows. \u201cYou have your original mouth and sinus cavities, but now possess the throat and voice box of a twelve year old girl so...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?!?\u201d roared Steve the best he could. Springing up from the hospital bed he was sitting in, he finally caught a glimpse of his new body. Looking down, he was greeted with the small, adolescent breasts of his own daughter. Much to his horror, Steve found himself wearing his daughter's clothes \u2013 her tiny baby doll tee shirt, her shorts, even her sparkly pink flip flops. He even had the purple, glittery nail polish she always wore... now on HIS finger- and toe-nails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do I have Megan's body?\u201d demanded Steve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause I carefully sedated the two of you, surgically amputated your heads, and painstakingly grafted said appendages on the other subject's donor body,\u201d replied the professor in a dry, matter-of-fact manner. \u201cHow are you feeling by the way? Have you noticed any interesting side effects \u2013 headache, nausea, loss of appetite?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want my own body back!\u201d shouted Steve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, hush for a moment!\u201d scolded the professor. \u201cYou're awakening the others.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, just across from Steve the head of twelve-year old Megan was waking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhmigod!\u201d she suddenly screeched. Again, her voice was a combination of her old one and her father's voice. The professor had attached their heads directly above the throats of the donor bodies. \u201cDaddy! Wh-Wh-Why do you have my body? Why do I have yours?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan was hysterically distraught and immediately fell into a paroxysm of tears, looking absolutely ridiculous as the sobbing head of a young girl on the overweight, flabby, adult body of her own middle-aged father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmmm,\u201d noted the professor. \u201cEmotional shock. Not entirely unexpected. What I'm quite curious about though is whether or not you'll grow facial hair now. I expect you probably shall, seeing as your donor body should still be producing its normal levels of testosterone. Perhaps your new 'daughter' will have to teach you to shave, eh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan and Steve refused to acknowledge the professor's little joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

As Von Strasser struggled to pull her off the guerney and stick her in a fifth cage that was next to the others, her friends were aghast at what the demented professor had done. \"Ooh, your first erection my dear, hope the drugs wear off soon so you can enjoy it fully\" Von Strasser joked, as he noticed the bulge in Liz's boyish jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You f*cking sicko!!\" Carly spat out in anger, causing Von Strasser to turn...and raise an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think not my dear.

The result was disconcerting, coming from atop Carly's petite, feminine body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my, yes!\u201d he grinned. \u201cI have just the perfect experiment to conduct next. And this time, my volunteers shall be \u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaun was positively elated when Von Strasser pointed one of Carly's delicate fingers directly at himself. The professor's other choice was the fat, middle-aged American housewife. Shaun shuddered to think what precisely Von Strasser planned to do to the two of them. Of course if Shaun had his way, there would be no experiment and this nightmare would soon be over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe American woman, Janet was her name, was sobbing hysterically as Von Strasser prepared two hypodermic injections. Looked like she could really use the sedative, mused Shaun. The way she was wigging out, it was remarkable the poor woman hadn't already suffered a heart attack or just outright fainted from panic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a good thing Shaun was made of sterner stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr was it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaun was rapidly coming to the conclusion that Von Strasser wasn't the one calling the shots around here. For one thing, the man seemed crazy as a bedbug. His experiments were just random torture. There was no logic about the man's actions. Acting alone, he would have slipped up and been caught by the authorities or killed by one of his victims years ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was the other big red flag: there was simply no way the professor could have removed his own head and attached it to Carly's body without at least an assistant. Maybe he just had some automated, robot equipment next door that had helped him. But it seemed quite likely to Shaun that there was someone else in the next room pulling Von Strasser's strings, perhaps even using him. Was Von Strasser acting alone, or was the man taking orders from some shadowy figure unwilling to allow his test subjects to catch a glimpse of his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnything was possible, but how to find out?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat if Shaun were to suddenly \u201cfaint\u201d?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps the mad scientist would neglect to give him a sedative injection. Then Shaun could get into the next room, see what was going on, and take action to stop this bloody lunatic and whomever was behind the scenes helping him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was worth a chance, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, Shaun drew on the inner thespian within himself, and went into action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNooooo!\u201d he screamed at the top of his lungs, rolling his eyes back into his head and thrashing about a bit in his perspex containment box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVon Strasser took the bait, whirling around to chide his victims for being too loud and disruptive. That was when Shaun abruptly went limp, allowing his body to collapse (rather painfully) to the floor within his perspex cage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPathetic,\u201d spat Von Strasser with a cruel laugh. \u201cLook, even the little girl over here hasn't fainted!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gestured at Megan Donaldson, still shivering with fear and softly whimpering to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you know what happens to weak people?\u201d Von Strasser asked of Shaun's apparently unconscious body. \u201cPeople with weaknesses get killed by the people who lack weakness.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe professor flipped a switch, and Shaun's perspex cage opened up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd please take notice, I have not yet been killed,\u201d grinned Von Strasser, hefting Shaun's body into a nearby wheelchair. He did so with surprising ease, given the lighter, female body he now possessed from below the neck. \u201cBlessed are the geeks, for they shall inherit the Earth. But as for the meek, the faint of heart, the weak-kneed milquetoast who swoons at the sight of a needle \u2026 well, you my pitiable friend, are about to become a minor footnote in the history of science. History that is about to be written by none other than myself!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a maniacal laugh, Von Strasser administered the hypodermic to Janet, then quickly removed her straps and rolled her into another waiting wheelchair which he promptly steered off into the adjacent operating room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow was Shaun's chance! He was free from his perspex cage, yet hadn't been drugged. He only had a moment before the professor returned.

Looks like you're having fun with my dick!\" Alan protested, pointing to the bulge in Liz's pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This stupid thing has a mind of its own, its not my fault you idiot!\" Liz snapped back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ENOUGH!\" Steve Donaldson suddenly shouted out, as he continued barricading the door as best he could. \"We're all free now, so we've got a better chance of subduing that asswipe and making him reverse these changes\" he then said, lowering his tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think so?\" a hopeful Carly sobbed, as she refrained from feeling her own, much older penis and balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" Steve nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too bloody right, lets take that sicko down!\" Shaun said, slamming a fist into his other hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No killing him Shaun, we need him!\" Liz reminded her companion. \"Remember...he still has Carly's body, so we can't harm him\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you're right\" Shaun sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I don't think he knows we're free, otherwise he'd be here stopping us from escaping right?\" Megan chimed up from the back. \"If you want I can go for help while you all try to get mom back and get him to reverse all the changes?\" she then suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good\" Liz nodded in agreement, but Steve wasn't sure about letting his daughter out of his sight in the house of horrors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Originally written by Switcher</b></span></div></div>",

Well, a fair woman now, I guess I should say,\u201d Von Strasser said, smirking at the roundly swollen assets on his chest, unwillingly donated by Carly. \u201cI like to give my victims a sporting chance every now and then. After all, the race does not always belong to the swift, nor victory in battle to the strong \u2026 but that's still the wisest way to place your bets.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing the restraints on the Donaldson family were rigged somehow with a trick clasp, Shaun finally relented and turned around to face Von Strasser. The man was considerably shorter now, but no less intimidating. There was a quietly evil confidence about the man that made Shaun begin to lose all hope. No matter what you did, you just couldn't surprise the arrogant bastard!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVon Strasser walked right up directly in front of Shaun and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe experiments will continue,\u201d said the professor. \u201cBut first, you will have to punished. For one thing, I'm highly annoyed at how you've been tampering with my equipment. And for another thing, I simply cannot abide stupidity. You squandered an ideal opportunity to defeat me. Stupidity must be punished, my poor fellow. And punished you shall be \u2026 then we shall resume the experiments, right where we left off. And that would involve you and the housewife.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaun had more than he could take.

The large house was a veritable maze of corridors and staircases and he had absolutely no idea where he was actually going. \"You cannot escape this house my foreign friend, you're simple forstalling the inevitable\" Von Strasser's taunting voice echoed out on a loudspeaker for all to hear. \"Now be a good fellow and return to the room and accept your punishment. Are you a man...or a mouse? Maybe you'll be a little of both once I'm done with you\" the voice then said, followed by a maniacal laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaun tried his best to block his tormentor's voice out, but it was no good, instead he sighted...and barged into a room with a large, double doorway. The hinges on the doors creeked as he used all his strength to force them open. Then Shaun stopped dead in his tracks, and his jaw fell open in shock. The room was a fully stocked laboratory, all kinds of medical equipment, funny looking machines and a large metal ball suspended in one corner with a constant field of electrical energy buzzing around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit!\" Shaun exclaimed, as he looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly he felt a dart pierce his neck and he began to lose the feeling in his limbs, though he didn't fall over. It was as though he was frozen in stasis, a look of horror etched on his face. \"This certainly saves us the trouble of having to transport you here\" the voice of Von Strasser said, and the professor stepped into view, no hologram this time...and his head was still securely fastened on Carly's 5' 2\" body, dressed in her provocative dress and stiletto pumps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this is one of our English guests!\" a woman's voice then spoke up. A voice with a thick German accent and very sultry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes my dear!\" Von Strasser replied, turning to look at his wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaun moved his eyes to the left and could just see the woman, a 5' 8\", grey haired woman in her late 50s. She was dressed conservatively in a black dress that fell beneath her knees, and had a pair of black, 2-inch heeled court shoes on her feet. \"The one who is causing all the trouble no less\" the woman mumbled, as she approached Shaun and looked him over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let us go!\" Shaun managed to mutter, as Von Strasser maneuvered his frozen form onto a table and strapped him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let you go?\" the woman laughed. \"I think not. You are essential to my husband's experiments. Your pretty young friend has already assisted my beloved Victor by donating her body to him, and your other female friend and the American boy have greatly assisted us in the field of partial body transplantation\" she rattled on. \"And now you will be able to make your own generous contribution to science. Oh...and by the way, I am Hilda Von Strasser, it is a pleasure to meet you\" she laughed, sounding equally as demented as her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaun was able to move his head enough to see the unconscious form of Janet laid on a table beside him, Then Von Strasser injected him with a syringe and his world faded...at least temporarily, so the experiment could commence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Originally written by Switcher</b></span></div></div>",

The constant clicking of Carly's heels on the floor and the scent of her perfume was a pleasant reminder of how things were before this awful day. But it all disappeared as Shaun opened one eye slightly...peering up past Carly's ample chest...and gazing at the wrinkled, bald visage that now sat atop her lovely body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew he would have to act before the demented freak did anything to him and the American woman, but saying that...he didn't want to act too early. After going through a couple of doorways, the wheelchair finally came to a halt, and Shaun again peeped through a half-open eye at his surroundings. He saw Carly's cute arse wiggling away as Von Strasser leaned over Janet's table to secure a loose strap. Shaun he looked at the second table, which was no doubt to be his next destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a limited field of view however, Shaun couldn't see any other people in the laboratory, which was full of all manner of machines he had never seen the likes of before. Then again he wasn't a scientist himself, so there wasn't a lot he would have recognized. There was also no sign of any assistants that could have helped to transplant Von Strasser's own head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Puzzling!\" Shaun thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, I think we're all ready my weak-willed friend\" Von Strasser suddenly mumbled, thinking Shaun was still unconscious. The professor walked back over to Shaun, stumbling once or twice in Carly's 'clumsy' footwear, and with no feminine grace to his walk at all. Shaun was once again amazed at how easily his captor lifted his limp body out of the wheelchair and places it on the table, there was no way Carly's body was that strong...physically. It was yet another mystery to solve in this house of horrors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, my, look at the time!\" Von Strasser suddenly said, glancing at Carly's ladies gold watch on his slender wrist.

He hoped no one would notice anything different about him, but he knew that was likely unrealistic. It was undeniable that he was taller now, and the fact that his pants were all new didn't help hide things. But he had come up with a good excuse -- a sudden growth spurt. It seemed a plausible enough excuse for everyone, and not a single person questioned it. First period science was easy enough, but he had gym second period.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, in the locker room, he found a quiet corner where no one saw him change. He used to wear shorts, but not wanting to show off his legs, he wore sweatpants now. They were playing basketball this week, and his new height made him a focus of the two boys picking teams as well as the gym teacher, who was also the school's basketball coach. Alan was usually picked nearly last, but week he was picked fourth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis new legs turned out to be a surprising asset on the court. They were lighter than his old ones had been and actually more athletic. That British chick must have worked out quite frequently or something. He still wasn't a great shot, but merely out-running everyone else on his team and his taller height was a significant advantage. After class, the gym teacher insisted on talking with Alan, to try and get him to join the team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a bit of a blessing in disguise. It would mean all the other boys would be done showering and changing by the time he even got to the locker room. But during the conversation, Alan was sweating hard. He could feel it run down his back and forehead. He could also feel it dripping in his butt. It felt so weird. He was so concerned with the sweat on his new lower parts that he ignored most of the gym teacher's talk encouraging him to join the basketball team. He also kept an eye on the locker room, making sure everyone was out before going in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, he caught himself before absentmindedly agreeing to join the team, and instead only promised to \"think about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was lucky that everyone had left before he got into the shower. But as he washed up, the bell rang, and the next class started filtering into the locker rooms. He started to panic. And then he realized he had forgotten his towel!

Jordan, if you tell anyone, I'll kill you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan noticed that Jordan's own cock was rock hard and sticking out from the front of his shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, Alan... You... Uhmm... Dude, you're so hot, man...\" Jordan stuttered. \"Can we, umm... meet after class?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan realized that if he didn't give Jordan what he wanted then his secret would be all over school by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright... Let's hang out... You and me... Alone!\" Alan sighed. \"Now, get outta here so I can get dressed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay dude! Please don't tell anyone I'm gay, okay?\" Jordan whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Jordan closed the curtain and went into another shower and undressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan became a little concerned.

For the first time in a long while, Alan realized that Jordan was only an inch taller than him, but he was still considerably more muscular. Had Alan still had his own legs, he would have been at least three inches shorter than Jordan for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJordan then started to remove his shirt and shorts, revealing his incredibly muscular torso and his well-developed legs. Alan figured that a guy like Jordan, who spent most of his days running up and down a large soccer field chasing after a soccer ball, would have amazingly muscular legs. Indeed, his quads were the thickest and the widest he had ever seen, and his calves were as big and as hard as melons. Jordan wasn't the captain of the soccer team for nothing. Alan noted that out-running and even trying to fight or wrestle Jordan would be completely fruitless. He was bigger and a lot stronger!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead and crawl in the bed, Alan!\" Jordan said, as he was removing his socks and cleats. \"I'll be joining you in a minute!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan was nervous. Just what was going to happen? What did he have in mind? What was Jordan going to do to him? Alan had never laid in bed before with another girl, let alone with another guy! Normally this wouldn't faze him one bit, but now that he had experienced this weird operation thanks to this wacko scientist at this creepy house in the middle of nowhere over the past weekend, where he ended up coming out of there with a girl's genitals and legs, he was feeling a bit fearful. He was a bit confused. Even though he still looked like a boy on the outside, he was now experiencing the sexual fears and anxieties of a girl! This was so messed up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJordan finally climbed in bed and lay right next to Alan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you feel, Alan?\" he smiled, as he turned and looked Alan in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Alan began to feel something in his groin. His vagina started to ache. His heart was beating faster. It was as if being was Jordan was making him aroused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... Uhh... I'm not sure...\" Alan whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me help you out....\" Jordan grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Jordan turned and two big, long, muscular arms reached over and grabbed Alan by his torso. Then, he pulled Alan's body, faced down, on top of him, while Jordan was laying flat on his back. Jordan's cock was thick and hard and sticking out like a flag pole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan moaned slightly as he felt something slide straight into his vagina! He couldn't move! If he moved, Jordan would move with him. It was like his body was attached to Jordan's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he felt some liquid being shot into his vagina while Jordan moaned slightly with his eyes closed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alan... I wanna be your boyfriend...\" Jordan whispered to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan just nodded. He was unable to speak as he felt an odd tingling spread through his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Originally written by scriptboy</b></span></div></div>",

Not all that much, but he was pretty sure that his gym teacher would be bugging him to join another team today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe still couldn't believe what he had done with Jordan yesterday, but he found himself excited to do it again, hopefully later today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got dressed by throwing on a shirt, but he paused before putting on pants. Instead of the boy underwear he wore yesterday, he looked at the pile of feminine clothes he had been ready to throw away just the other day. He pulled out a silky pair of panties. He was sure they would turn Jordan on, particularly as he hid them under a pair of his baggy pants. He looked at the pile of feminine shoes, also bound for the trash. He had types of heels and boots that were way sexier than anything Jordan's mom owned. He pondered slipping a pair into his bag to surprise Jordan with later, but he decided it was too risky. Instead, he simply put the entire pile of feminine clothes and shoes back into his drawers and closet, just in case he wanted to wear any of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Originally written by scriptboy<br>\r\n</b></span></div></div>",

Silently and sullenly they ate the breakfasts Alan had prepared for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan still wore his mother's pink pajamas and fuzzy pink slippers. He had to make a conscious effort not to cross his legs in a womanly fashion, but found in his groggy, early morning stupor that he was unable to resist the temptation to drink coffee from the mug labeled \u201cWorld's Best Mom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet seemed grouchy and grumpy, gulping down her breakfast with only the occasional growl or grumble if another member of the family looked likely to start talking. She didn't wish to discuss their situation at the moment... and so they didn't. Janet still wore her husband's \u201cProperty of the Steelers\u201d t-shirt and cotton pajama pants. She too drank coffee, guzzling two refills from Steve's Pittsburgh Steelers mug. She idly scratched the patchy, bald spot at the back of her head and eyed the rest of the family, making clear her unspoken wish that nobody make mention of their obvious predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan seemed less mopy than the others, but still remained silent during the morning repast. She hungrily devoured her breakfast with the appetite of an athletic, teenage boy. She wore an old t-shirt of Alan's that sported a faded logo of his high school mascot with the words \u201cGo Wildcats\u201d emblazoned across the front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve was the most moody and morose of the bunch. He barely touched his breakfast and sat at the table fidgeting uncomfortably with his long hair and periodically releasing loud, petulant sighs of frustration. He still wore his daughter's white and pink \u201cHello Kitty\u201d pajama shirt and matching bottoms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he noticed Janet had finished eating the last bit of her morning meal, Steve finally summoned up the courage to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, what are we going to do now?\u201d he announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe family was silent for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuess we'd better get dressed in... uh... our new clothes,\u201d said Alan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou're my teenage son \u2013 not a grown woman,\u201d said Steve. \u201cI don't want you wearing your mother's clothes again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, get over it Steven,\u201d snapped Janet. \u201cHe'll look like a damned idiot running all over town dressed like a teenage boy. Despite the way we see ourselves right now, everyone else seems to think we're each other. I don't want people thinking he's me, and then wondering why Janet Donaldson is running errands while wearing her son's clothes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Steve. \u201cWe're not falling into this trap. That's what... what... that stupid book wants us to do, don't you see?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh huh,\u201d said Janet, rolling her eyes. \u201cThe book wants us to wear each other's clothes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe book did this to us!\u201d replied Steve. \u201cUnless we fight back and refuse to cooperate, the book wins! It switched all our identities around \u2013 God knows why \u2013 and then wants us to fall further and further into the trap of acting like each other. I'm not Megan! That might be what I see in the mirror, but it's not me! And even if the rest of the planet sees me as her, I'm not going to wear Megan's clothes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou already are,\u201d laughed Megan, pointing at her father's girlish pajamas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCorrection then \u2013 I'm not going to wear them any longer,\u201d said Steve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe Dad has a point,\u201d Alan said gently. \u201cWe've all been acting a little odd lately.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's just the shock and stress of all this weirdness,\u201d said Janet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think it's more than that,\u201d Alan replied. \u201cMaybe we ought to struggle more against... oh, I don't know... against feeling too comfortable in these new roles? Surely our first priority has to be finding a way of changing back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Janet. \u201cThat's important of course, but that has to be our second priority. The first thing we have to do is damage control. And that's why I have to get dressed in your father's clothes, and then go to work at his job today. If we all play hooky to stay home and clutch desperately at straws, then your father will get fired and you kids will get detention. We'll work on studying that book later tonight. But for right now, our number one priority has to be this: avoid damaging the lives and reputations of one another.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDad, please talk some sense to her!\u201d Alan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve was silent for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour mother's right,\u201d he finally said. \u201cI hate to admit it. But because we've already tried the book a couple times and had no success, there's no reason to believe we'll be able to reverse these changes by staying home today. Logically speaking, the best course of action is for us each to pretend we're the person we each see in the mirror. Your mother will have to go to my job, Megan will go to high school, you, Alan, will have to run whatever errands your mom has scheduled... and... and as much as I'm loathe to do this, I'm going to have to go put on Megan's clothes and spend the day pretending to be a twelve-year old girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood,\u201d said Janet. \u201cNow that's settled. In the meantime, let's all try not to attract any unnecessary attention. Today is a good day for each of us to lie low, blend into the background, and not do anything to make matters worse. But throughout the day, each of you keep thinking about ideas. We'll leave the book here on the dining room table. Tonight after dinner, we'll take another look at it and brainstorm a bit for ways to change ourselves back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

He took off his mothers robe and hung it on dresser next to his mothers side of the bed. He then walked across the bedroom into his or should he say his parent's closet. He looked over the huge section of clothes that used to belong to his mother. He found a pair of mom jeans that had the cuffs rolled up. Then he picked a sleeveless gingham top. He walked out of the closet and placed the clothes on the bed. He then went to his dresser and pulled out some granny nylon panties and a matching vanity fair bra. He took off the nylon pink pajamas and proceeded to get dressers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Janet was still coming up the stairs. She felt especially grumpy for some unknown reason. She walked into the bedroom and caused Alan to jump. He instinctively tried to cover his non-existent breast and lifted his leg to hide his nether region. \" oh god Janet it's just you I thought it was one of the kids.\" Alan stated then shook his head in shock over what he said.

Then she proceeded to shake his shaving cream can and spray some on her hand. She lathered her face like an experienced man and then reached out for Stevens razor and shaved her face. When she was done she was in totally shock. \" what the ...\" she thought. Then she put on Stevens after shave and walked into the closet and got his business suit ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDownstairs Steven entered Megan's closet and pulled out a puffy sleeved pink top and some skinny Jean capris. What shocked Steven was how well the clothes fit and the fact that as he was pulling out the clothes his mind was thinking about Ted and how he would like him in this outfit. Weird Steven thought as he put on his stripy sandals and looked down at his feet. Ugh I really need a pedi he thought as he headed out to get his book bag ready for school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Alan's room Janet was in the mirror admiring her physique. \"Oh yeah Sarah you will be mine.\" she stated as she put on Alan's Abercrombie shirt and American eagle jeans soon the entire family was in the front room ready to head out into the real world.</span></div></div>",

While his hair had mysteriously vanished (except on his head, where it had grown and changed color to look like his daughter's), he was still tall and relatively muscular. Where it counted, he was still a man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he had squeezed himself into a pair of Megan's plain cotton panties and put on her training bra over his hairless chest. To say that this was humiliating would be a huge understatement. Worse, it was like his daughter's clothing was messing with his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid I really wonder how big my boobies were going to get? Where did that thought even come from?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the answer was obvious; it was one of Megan's thoughts. As he finished dressing, the mental intrusions continued, and by the time he was finished he knew the name of a boy he liked, that he had a math test today, that a new Justin Bieber album would be coming out soon, that his period was due in less than a week, and that he didn't like the way his mom treated him sometimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it's not me. Filing in behind the other students entering the building, Steve had to keep reminding himself of that. I'm taller than all the other kids, and even most of the teachers. I have a penis still. I'm not a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe glimpse he caught of himself in the bathroom mirror told him otherwise. It wasn't until he was back in the hallway that he realized he had, without thinking, entered the girls' bathroom. Fortunately, it had been empty at the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his first class, English, Steve discovered the downside of keeping his body. His knees would barely fit under his desk. While the teacher droned on, he took notes in pink ink, his handwriting neat, tidy, and undeniably feminine. Flipping to a previous page in Megan's binder, he found he could not distinguish her writing from his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now it's time for you to get into your groups to discuss the reading,\" the teacher suddenly announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith practiced efficiency, the students moved their desks into several circles. Dozens of conversations were breaking out around him as the kids used the opportunity to catch up on their weekend activities. When a girl named Laura began describing her Saturday shopping excursion to him, Steve found himself an eager participant in the discussion. \"That top is so cute,\" he said, looking down at her, and at her bare shoulders. Inside, he found himself jealous over how well Laura filled out her new tanktop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAside from Laura, there were two other people in the group, two guys and another girl. While Steve had never read the work they were discussing, he remembered it, and found he even had strong opinions about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when one of the boys disputed his interpretation, he smiled shyly, averted his gaze, and withdrew from the conversation. He really wanted to disagree with the boy, but it seemed inappropriate somehow. While the conversation continued without him, he doodled in Megan's binder, letting the butterflies in his stomach settle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as the groups broke up, he found the boy staring at him, and the butterflies were back. Along with an unexpected and very unpleasant erection. Steve could only squeeze his thighs together and hope nobody noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He likes you,\" Laura whispered. Steve shook his head. Could this get any more humiliating?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he remembered what his next class was.</span></div></div>",

There was a brief, embarrassing moment when he considered going into the boys' changing room instead of the girls', but he knew that would be a disaster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, there were about twenty girls in various states of undress. All of them were young, just his daughter's age, but they seemed more developed than he remembered girls that age being when he was young. Must be hormones or something in the water, he thought, finding a bench far away from everyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had just stripped down to his bra and panties when another latecomer arrived and placed her stuff down beside his. Unlike the plain cotton underwear he was wearing, hers was black and far more mature than he ever would have let Megan wear. Stacy, the name came to him at once. She'd been held back a year. Tall, although still shorter than Steve, she kept her back to him as she unhooked her bra. When she suddenly spun around to get something out of her bag, Steve quickly averted his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's just a kid. Still... she has nice breasts. But that was as far as it went. Oddly, he didn't even feel the familiar stirring down below that never failed to show up when a nice pair of breasts did. Curious, he glanced around the room at the few remaining girls who were still changing. Yes, they were young. But still... Shouldn't I be feeling something? All he really felt was an urge to pull his sports bra and the rest of his uniform on before the gym teacher came in and yelled at him. Beyond that, he felt nothing at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShivering, he slipped into his gym clothes and left the locker room just behind Stacy. Even as he regarded her shapely posterior with something like envy, she didn't arouse him. Not even a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Megan! Stacy!\" The gym teacher was shouting at them. \"Get over here right now.\"</span></div></div>",

With his daughter having trouble in math class, Steve and the teacher had worked together to devise a study schedule that would help her improve her grades. Now he sat glumly in his chair beside Laura and waited for him to hand out the math test Megan had been dreading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much did you study?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a lot,\" Steve admitted in response to Laura's hissed question. \"I was... busy over the weekend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPencil already in hand, he brushed his hair out of his face just as the test paper was delivered to his desk. Laura's query had left him slightly concerned. Quickly consulting his daughter's memory, he realized she really hadn't studied before this test, not even when she was supposed to have been doing it. Not that it should matter, right? I did college-level calculus, after all. How hard could this class be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Steve saw the test paper and his mind went blank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, not blank. Not exactly. He remembered he needed a pedi before too long. He thought about asking Laura to come to the mall with him later to get one, if their moms would give them the money. He wondered if the boy in English class -- Darren -- thought he was pretty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't know the answer to this one. It was a simple enough question, but he couldn't wrap his head around it. As soon as the class had gone quiet, Megan's thoughts had begun invading his head, driving out his own. With the clock ticking, Steve knew he had to focus if he had any chance of passing this test.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried remembering the last time he had seen his wife naked. That seemed like it would be a stimulating, distinctive memory, but as soon as his attention got anywhere near it he found himself blushing and vaguely ill. The closest he could get was a memory of a pool locker room where Janet changed in front of him. One of Megan's memories. Steve sighed in frustration, finally guessing at the answer to the question that was stumping him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were several more on the test that were equally difficult. Each time, he tried to focus through a particular memory in his life as Steve. Each time, he found his train of thought derailed and sent toward one of Megan's thoughts. The most disturbing was when he tried to imagine having sex with his wife and ended up thinking of Edward Cullen from the Twilight movie. Judging by the way his heart began racing, his daughter found the actor very attractive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Craven allowed students to leave after they handed in their tests. With ten minutes to spare, Laura finished, gave Steve one last smile, and left the room. That top really is pretty. And I wish I had cleavage like that. For Steve, that thought was all he could take. As best he could, he finished the final questions on his test, answering the bonus with \"i don't know <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/smile.png\" alt=\"*Smile*\" title=\"Smile\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\">\" where the dot on the lowercase i was a tiny heart.

He blinked in confusion a few times, as he realized everything around him had changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor one thing, the rest of his family was no longer in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor another thing, the room was no longer a cluttered mess of old, rotten debris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the old, broken-down furniture in the room had been magically restored to its original splendor. A thick, luxurious oriental rug was on the floor. Fine oil paintings lined the walls. Expensive looking, Victorian antiques everywhere now looked shiny and new.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing Alan noticed was his clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything he'd been wearing had completely changed. He was now wearing a long, blue gray, ruffled dress that hung down to his ankles. On his feet were a pair of flat heeled, old lady shoes. In one hand Alan was grasping a finely carved cane of shiny, polished wood. Additionally, he felt the strange, constricting sensation of unfamiliar female undergarments on beneath his dress. All the tight straps and laces associated with an old-style brassiere, corset, bustles, and old lady bloomers were rubbing painfully against Alan's skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe still seemed to be completely masculine and physically unchanged. He was just now dressed like an old woman from more than a century in the past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan put a hand up to his head and discovered he was wearing an old woman's bonnet of some kind. Also, his hair seemed to have grown out considerably, though it was now styled up in a tightly coiled bun hidden beneath the bonnet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe also found a pair of old, heavy glass spectacles perched on his noise. Removing them, Alan was shocked to discover the world around him dissolved into a blurry, unfocused blob of blotchy colors. He quickly put the spectacles back on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWeird,\u201d muttered Alan. \u201cI've never needed to wear glasses before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpotting a full-length mirror at the far end of the room, Alan decided he'd better examine himself. He took a step forward and felt the sharp needles of hot pain flare into every joint in his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOuch!\u201d he muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried again, this time leaning heavily on the fancy cane. With the aid of this walking stick, Alan was able to hobble slowly across the room and reach the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, he saw his reflection was now that of a seventy- or eighty-year old woman! In the mirror, he was very short, hunched over, sickly thin, and very frail looking. His hair was silvery white and wiry. His face was craggy with deep wrinkles etched into his pale, leathery skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm an old woman!\u201d he cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

The Donaldson family all shielded their eyes. Steve dropped the book to the floor. It collapsed with a heavy, dull thud... and the brilliant aura of light instantly ceased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWh-What happened?\u201d asked Megan, blinking and rubbing her eyes. \u201cWh-What's wrong with my voice?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan had become a boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot just any boy, but Edwin Callen \u2013 the teen heart-throb boy vampire from the Darklight series of books that Megan loved so much. She was now a tall, skinny boy with ghostly pale skin and short black hair. She was wearing a plain gray t-shirt, a black jacket, a pair of black jeans, and some shiny, black boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDad \u2013 help me!\u201d she cried, in a masculine voice. \u201cI... I've turned into a vampire!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPointed, razor sharp teeth popped down from the roof of her mouth as if on cue with her comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Megan's father was in no condition to help her. Steve was also transforming. While Megan had become a boy, Steve was becoming a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve was now a lean, tanned, very busty red-haired woman... dressed in a tattered loincloth that barely hung down below the crotch, and a matching strip of cloth tied loosely around his enormous, new breasts. A simple necklace of sea-shells strung together hung from his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly recognizing the obscure character he had become as a secret, guilty pleasure from his youth, Steve informed the others: \u201cI'm Luna, the cavewoman from A Bajillion Years B.C. \u2013 you know, that cheesy old sixties movie with Rachelle Welsh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve's voice was now soft, lilting, and sultry. He was considerably shorter than he'd been as a man, but seemed to make up for it in muscle tone. His new, feminine body seemed strong, agile, and athletic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe're becoming fictional characters,\u201d he told the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that it would do them any good. The transformations had already begun to affect Steve's wife and son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan was next. He had become a tall, thin, athletic looking woman \u2013 with heavy, round breasts, just like his father. Alan was dressed in a ridiculously short and tight pair of cargo shorts, some brown lace-up boots, a tight, ribbed, white top... and a dizzying array of knives, gun holsters, and ammunition belts strapped to him. He had long, dark hair tied back in a single, utilitarian ponytail. He spoke with a British accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm Lori Craft \u2013 from the Grave Robber video games!\u201d he exclaimed, still staring down with fixated fascination at his big, swollen breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Janet transformed as well. She became a tall, broad-shouldered, muscular hunk of a man. Her short, brown hair seemed to reflect a style from the '70s... as did her tight, one-piece jumpsuit of shiny, red fabric (strategically unzipped halfway down the chest to display her new, thick coat of chest hair). She wore big, bright white boots and looked like she had just stepped off the set of some old sci-fi/action movie or television series.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing down at herself for a moment, Janet recognized a small, stylized logo on one side of her jumpsuit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm The Cybernetic Man,\u201d she said glumly, her voice now the deep, booming baritone of a '70s action hero. \u201cI'm Scott Dallas \u2013 the bionic secret agent in that old show? You remember, he was played by Lou Sargent. Wow, I wonder if I have all his bionic powers now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wonder if I can jump like Lori Craft,\u201d muttered Alan, still staring fixedly at his breasts. \u201cOr... oooo, do the splits like she can?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can't believe you two!\u201d said Steve. He tried to fold his arms across his chest in an authoritative gesture, but his newly swollen mammary glands got in the way. \u201cYou're not a cybernetic secret agent \u2013 you're my wife! And you're not some grave robbing bimbo \u2013 you're my son! Look, you don't see me running around grunting incoherently like a cro-magnon woman would, do you? And Megan isn't attacking us and sucking our blood like a vampire would!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve turned to Megan, who winked roguishly, flashed a fiendish smiled that displayed her sharp, new teeth... but said nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh...\u201d stammered Steve. \u201cLet's all just remember who we are... and... uh... do whatever we can to change back to normal ASAP.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

What about you, Marvin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name's not Marvin, it's Megan. And I only remember you as my older sister who's a star tennis player and gymnast, but I do remember our parents being the same as you described. I remember being a middle school girl who's going to turn thirteen next month. Let's just hope you all remember that.\" However Megan/Marvin looked, her face was obviously a little scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephen thought. \"OK, so let's all get this straight. I think I'm a man named Stephen but you all think I'm Stephanie. You're Gene, but you think of yourself as Janet. Alison thinks of herself as a jock boy named Alan, and Marvin thinks he's a twelve year old girl named Megan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone shook their heads in confused agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, so this means that the book, whatever it is, altered our perceptions differently for each of us. We each see things a little differently from one another, but we don't know which is the right perception. Everybody take any kind of identification.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephen reached for his wallet and found his picture and identification to be that of his given name, Stephen Donaldson. His DOB, gender, height, weight and otherwise were all correct.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet reached for her purse, but remembered that she left it in the car. However, she did have a tattoo on her right thigh from when she first got engaged that said Janet Hearts Stephanie. She lifted her leg and showed it to her wife, who only in his mind saw it as Gene Hearts Stephen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It says Gene loves Stephen, love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet lifted up her thigh behind her to look, but saw the exact opposite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan reached for his school identification from last semester, as did Megan for hers. Both ID's confirmed to themselves that they were indeed Alan Donaldson and Megan Donaldson, but when they showed their ID's to each other, Megan saw Alan's picture as that of a smiling photogenic blonde girl named Alison Donaldson and Alan saw Megan's picture as that of a gangly, somewhat nerdy middle-school boy named Marvin Donaldson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, our ID's don't prove anything. We each see something different\" whined Megan<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not your mom!\" barked Stephen. \"Would you look at her thigh for me. What does it say, Marvin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name's Megan\" she huffed, then looked down at her father's right thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It says Gene Hearts Stephanie, mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth parents shouted \"What are talking about?\" in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan stepped forward and confirmed that he saw it as Gene Hearts Stephanie too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's a little weird that a guy would get a heart tattoo\" said Alan. \"Maybe our dad really is our mom, and since mom seems so aggressive, she might really be our dad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your mother has ALWAYS been a little bitchy\" said Janet. \"That's why I started dating her in the first place. She's wasn't a wallflower like other girls and is opinionated and is never boring.\" Janet smiled at Stephanie, hoping that their mutual love and affection could cross this strange memory barrier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember things differently, but we're wasting our time. Should I look in the book and try and change this or what? It couldn't hurt to try it again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh honey, let's just go back to the car, and we'll settle this tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kids, what do you think?\" asked Stephen.</span></div></div>",

I don't like what that book did to all your memories.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMarvin's right,\u201d agreed Alan. \u201cI don't know why you all think I'm a girl.

I don't want that creepy book actually changing me into this 'Allison' person you think I am.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, poor Ally!\u201d said Janet sympathetically. \u201cI know what it's like to wonder about being the opposite sex. Until I met your mother and fell in love with her, I sometimes thought I might be a man trapped in a woman's body. It's okay to be different.

Get that through your head. You're queer as a three dollar bill, but you're still a man. And you too, Marvin. Knock on acting like you're a twelve-year old girl. That's getting creepy if you ask me!

Nobody except for Megan said a word to each other, and even that one word was \"Goodnight\". Everybody slept in the car at the side of the road until morning...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun rose, and the family of four were still asleep. Steve had been having strange dreams about a paramilitary group chasing him through the woods, and Janet had had felt a bad omen about the future ever since her husband had opened that stupid book. Alan was the first to wake up, and he quietly got out of the car to feel the early morning breeze and see if he could fix the tire himself. As he opened the passenger door and stepped out, Alan suddenly forgot why he stepped outside in the first place. Ally looked around the wooded area, then back in the house, shuddered, and went back inside the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom! Dad!\" she whispered loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom. Dad. Wake up!\". Then she started to wake up her dad by rubbing his left shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer father woke up with a slight jolt, and then rubbed his head. \"Oh great. I so do not want to change the tire today...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can do it if you don't want to do it\" suggested Ally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no. I'll...I'll do it.\" Groggily, Gene got out of the car with his teenage daughter and the two of them began to replace the tire. When they were done, Gene put the flat into the trunk, and he then woke up his wife to start up the car.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGene shook Stephanie a little out of her slumber. \"Honey, wake up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie jerked out of her bad dream violently and almost hurt herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Oh, it's daylight. I'll go fix the tire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already took care of it\" said Gene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie breathed a sigh of relief. \"OK, just give me a minute to calm down, and then we'll start the drive home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want me to wake up Marvin?\" asked Ally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, let him sleep\" said Stephanie. \"He's still only twelve, he needs the extra rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie started the ignition, and started to drive home. She was thinking of the happier days back in high school and college back when she was a star athlete. If it weren't for that one broken arm that she got arm wrestling...who knows where she would have ended up? Not in insurance anyway. Hell, she would have settled for doing something with her minor in history. Anything must be more inspiring then her current predicament. She looked at Ally in the backseat, who seemed to be taking after her in terms of athletics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drive home was surprisingly pleasant and uneventful, and Marvin woke up about a half hour after they had started driving. As a slightly insecure kid, he couldn't wait to see his friends again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they got into their house, the gang all went their separate ways and would reconvene at dinner time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarvin went to instant message Jared, his best friend, and Ally did the same for her friend Katey.

After his first sip of scotch however, Gene noticed something oddly uncomfortable. He hadn't been aware of it before, with all the excited nervousness and stress of that freakish haunted house they'd been in... and then changing the tire... and then the long drive back home... but now that he was relaxed, Gene definitely felt something \u201coff.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down at himself and that's when it hit him. In fact, he was shocked he hadn't noticed this before \u2013 he was wearing Stephanie's clothes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Gene looked at himself he saw his flat, manly chest wearing a red woman's blouse and a pair of wide-hipped \u201cmom\u201d shorts. The uncomfortable sensation Gene had felt stemmed from the stiff, white cotton bra tightly strapped across his chest and the big, white, cotton granny panties around his waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo something weird did happen back in that haunted mansion!\u201d growled Gene. He stomped off to confront Stephanie, curious if she was now dressed in his clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElsewhere in the house, Marvin was in his bedroom on his computer, sending instant messages back and forth with his friend Jared. At one point in their conversation about guy stuff, Jared said he had something to show Marvin and asked his friend to get on webcam. Marvin obliged... and Jared was shocked to see a stick-thin, preteen girl with braces, a few zits, and way too much makeup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMarvin?\u201d asked Jared over the webcam connection. \u201cWhere'd you go, man? Who the hell is this girl?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up, you stupid doofus!\u201d replied Marvin. \u201cNow what were you gonna show me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d asked Jared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm me \u2013 Marvin \u2013 what's wrong with you, Jared?\u201d asked Marvin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNuh huh,\u201d replied Jared. \u201cMarvin, dude \u2013 for some crazy, insane reason I'm seeing some chick over this webcam. She's talking and everything you say is coming out of her lips.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up, dipshit!\u201d said Marvin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I swear to God it's true,\u201d replied Jared. \u201cDude, how are you doing this? Did you write some crazy computer program to replace your image with this chick? It's so realistic!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElsewhere in the house, Ally was also engaged in a lengthy instant messaging session with her best friend Katey. After a while, Ally also began to notice something strange about herself. First she noticed her large, rounded breasts were hanging free! She was sure she'd put on a bra this morning. Next she realized that her clothes were completely wrong. She'd been wearing a cute, lacy top and a skirt this morning. Why was she in a t-shirt and jeans now? And most shocking, why was she wearing boys boxer shorts instead of her own panties?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a panic of embarrassment, Ally excused herself from the instant messaging with Katey and ran off to change clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

I'm sorry. I could have sworn that I was wearing something else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stephanie, I'm wearing your clothes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephanie, who's eyes had gone straight from her body back to the book, looked back up at her husband and started to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on here now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That creepy house did something to us! Remember the one we went in after we blew out the tire? We switched clothing somehow. I'm looking through the rest of the house to see what else is wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do that\" nodded Stephie, who went back to her book and frankly didn't care what people wore as long as they were comfortable. Who knows, thought Stephanie. Maybe Gene wearing women's clothing and me dressing like a tomboy might even spice up our marriage!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGene searched through the house, briefly cursing his wife for being such a ditz. When he went into the den to look through the family photos, he noticed that all of their clothing was switched by gender also. A picture of Ally during her second grade piano recital had her wearing a boy's dress shirt and dress pants, something the very girly Ally would never wear. And during Marvin's little league win a year ago, he was seen in the picture kissing another boy in the stands. Unless Marvin was a very good actor, Gene knew that his son wasn't gay, given all the talk about his \"acquisitions\" he gets in school(i.e: make out sessions with older girls). Not to mention that Gene took that picture himself, and it was a girl he was kissing! And his wedding photo was the coup de grace. He was the bride and Steph was the groom! Then he heard Marvin walk in, who started complaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSearching further through old photo albums, Gene noticed that he was dressed like a girl in every one of them. What in the devil... Then there were photos he didn't recognize of himself as a cheerleader. Below it was the name \"Janet Seaton\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad, do I look like a girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but you're wearing girls clothing. Look!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarvin's face contorted into confusion and looked down. \"Holy shit! Why didn't I notice this before? Dad, it's that house doing this, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it probably is\" whispered Gene, embarrassed for his son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom! Dad! I can't find any of my clothes!\" screamed Ally from upstairs. This prompted Stephanie to walk into Ally's room and console her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about this, honey. We're going to get everything back in order-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Ring Ring*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doorbell buzzed. Who was it?</span></div></div>",

She's the night owl out of all of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve turned around. \"Do you mind Ally?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Alan, and no, I don't mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have battery power for your console?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm hmm\" affirmed Alan. \"I'll keep watch for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Until 6:00 A.M or so\" Steve said. \"The sun will be out by then, and we can get the tire fixed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotcha.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK then, goodnight everyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\" Alan muttered. \"Goodnight mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad. I'm your dad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodnight dad\" said both Alan and Megan in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve dreamed that night...whatever it was he dreamed about, this writer can't say. But he was awakened by his daughter at around 5:00 A.M, just as twilight was in it's last throws and was soon to give way to dawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, dad, whoever you are, there's a State Trooper outside!\" said Ally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Steve muttered, and then looked over to see a flashlight being pointed in his face. He opened the door to go outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss, this area is considered unsafe due to a recent string of disappearances.\" The patrolman then gave a quick glance behind him towards the house they vacated. \"I see that your tire is blown. Would you like me to call you a tow truck?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that's fine. I have a spare in my trunk. I can get it taken care of.\" Steve grimaced a little at the \"Miss\" comment, but didn't say anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK then. Just be careful and vigilant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe officer nodded and then went back to his bike and sped off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the officer was out of sight, Steve knocked on Ally's door for assistance. She got out the door and followed him to the trunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get the tire iron and jack out, will you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFather and daughter...Mother and son...father and son...whatever they were, the two got the tire on in about four and a half minutes. The emerging sunlight helped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What time is it, Ally?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Alan, and it's 5:20 A.M.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alan\" Steve nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them got back in the car. Steve started the ignition, and began the rest of the drive home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, that patrolman called you \"Miss\" said Alan. \"Shouldn't that settle it that you're really my mom and not a man?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and what if he referred to you as a girl? Would you be comfortable with that?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan shut up and went to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later, the Donaldson family made it back to their Tudor style house in their comfortable, middle class neighborhood. As the car pulled into the driveway, Janet started to awaken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh honey, I just had this awful dream where we went into this haunted house, and you and Ally thought you were both men, and Marvin thought he was a boy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't a dream, Gene!\" Steve shouted. \"That house and that book were real. We're in a real pile of shit here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you all still think I'm a boy still don't you?\" Megan moaned. \"I wish it was all a dream too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it isn't. We all have to deal with it until we find a solution. Gene, I want you to use your phone. Call up one of your friends, and notice how they respond to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, sure thing\" Janet answered. She decided to call her friend Lindy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lindy? Oh hey, it's Janet. Yeah, we just got back from vacation. What's that? We took the kids to Bluffington to visit some relatives, then we went to Funkytown. Yeah, it was wonderful, a lot of fun. Stephanie? She's doing fine, how's Brandon? Good, and yes, the kids loved it as far as I can tell. Do you want to talk to Stephanie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve made a hand gesture indicating that he didn't want to talk to Lindy right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet went back on the phone. \"I guess she doesn't want to talk. No, she's not butch or anything, Stephanie is just a bit of a misanthrope. Ohmigod, you heard what?! No...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve got out of the car before he was infected by the gossip. He needed a good stiff drink and some sleep. He fished the keys out of his pocket and opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't believe it, there was no way out. Was everyone going to call him \"Stephanie\" and think he was a woman for the rest of his life? And what about the way Gene was acting. He was totally out of character. Under normal circumstances, no one would ever confuse either Gene or Steve with the media stereotype of gay men. Neither of them were camp, neither were promiscuous in front of others or talked about sex in polite conversation and both were good providers for their kids. And now this stupid curse or whatever it was threw it all out the window, with Gene having effete mannerisms. After drinking a quick beer, Steve went upstairs to get some needed sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan entered the house shortly thereafter, just as worried as her mom(dad?) was. Using her computer to check Facebook, she was relieved when her profile was exactly how she remembered it. There were pictures of her hanging out with her friends, as a girl and not as a boy, and no-one called her \"Marvin\"...whoever the heck that was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ally! No wait, Alan! Come quick! There's something I want to show you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan walked into the house shortly, with Janet still in the car on the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look! This proves I'm a girl. I typed in a post a minute ago, and Ashley referred to me as \"Megan\", not \"Marvin\"! See, other people still see that I'm a girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's weird\" said Alan. \"I can see where they call you Megan, but your name in the heading still shows your name as Marvin. And I still see your picture as of a boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan's face soured. \"OK, I'll check your profile.\" She signed out, and handed the tablet to her not-sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan signed in with his e-mail address and password, which to him showed his name as Alan Donaldson and with a few, much less than Megan, pictures of himself either at school, on the field, or with friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ask your girlfriend a question, see what she says.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan did so, and shortly got a response that referred to him as \"Alan\", but when he showed it to Megan, she predictably saw Alan's picture and name heading as those of the mysterious Alison. His girlfriend confirmed that his name was Alan, but everywhere else suggested otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did that curse do to us?\" Megan wondered.</span></div></div>",

Something was... off. Not just all the bizarre misunderstandings about gender. There was something subtly different about the bedroom. Getting up out of bed, he rummaged around a bit through the room and then cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGene, get in here!\u201d he called urgently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, be that way, Gene. Janet, get up here!\u201d he cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet sighed with irritation, said goodbye to Lindy, and headed up the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought you were going to take a nap, Stephanie,\u201d she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop calling me that,\u201d snapped Steve. \u201cLook at this \u2013 all my clothes have been messed with! My dresser is full of a bunch of girly shit \u2013 shirts, bras, panties, nylons... and I've got all this makeup and jewelry scattered around on top of everything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh... 'Steve'... those are your clothes,\u201d laughed Janet. \u201cNothing here is changed at all. I know you don't wear much makeup and jewelry, but all this stuff here is yours. And these are very nice clothes you have in these drawers, but none of it is my style. Heck, it's not even my size. I could never fit into one of your bras! Are you convinced yet that you're my loveable lesbian life partner?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet leaned in and gave Steve a playful kiss on the lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm not 'Stephanie' and these aren't my clothes,\u201d growled Steve. \u201cThey're not your clothes either, Gene. You're a man! Of course you could never fit into one of my bras... and they're not my bras anyhow! I don't wear bras. I don't have breasts. And neither do you, Gene! Good God, I can't believe this is happening to us! Tomorrow, I have to go back to work \u2013 and now, I'm going to have borrow some of your clothes to wear. There's no way I'm going to work dressed like a woman!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine!\u201d laughed Janet. \u201cYou're welcome to wear my clothes instead, Stephanie. But everything I own is female, and none of it is going to fit... huh?!... wh-wh what's happened to all my clothes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet started to panic as she rummaged through her dresser drawers first and then through the closet. Every article of clothing she owned had been replaced with its masculine equivalent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat're you talking about, Gene?\u201d snapped Steve. \u201cYour clothes look fine. I know they won't fit me quite right, but I'll be damned if I'm going into work as a drag queen! I may be gay, but I've never been into cross dressing and making a spectacle of myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cB-B-But, Stephie... my clothes... all my... entire wardrobe... it's all...\u201d Janet seemed to be on the verge of crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, whoa whoa, there!\u201d Steve said softly, giving his partner a tight hug. \u201cI'm sorry, Gene. I didn't mean to bite your head off. I know this is pretty weird for both of us... ohmigod \u2013 the kids!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve and Janet both ran downstairs to find Megan and Alan still surfing the 'net, exploring the very different perspectives each had of one another's online identity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKids,\u201d said Steve. \u201cHave either of you... been in your rooms yet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them shook their heads slowly and nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet's all go look together,\u201d said Janet. \u201cAnd... prepare yourself for a shock.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe family examined Alan's room first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSame messy pit as always,\u201d laughed Megan. \u201cFor a prissy little princess, Ally, you sure don't have a very clean room.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan, however, was speechless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlly?\u201d asked Steve. \u201cTell me what you see in here honey. The room looks normal to me. There's your tennis skirt, your gymnast leotard, all your stuff everywhere...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThese are girls clothes!\u201d said Alan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you're a girl, honey,\u201d answered Janet, checking the inside of Alan's closet. \u201cWhew! Thank God your prom dress is still here. That cost us a bundle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd it took forever to find exactly the right one,\u201d laughed Steve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can't wear this stuff!\u201d protested Alan. \u201cYou guys really think these are all my clothes? I... I... I'm a guy named Alan \u2013 not a girl named Allison!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbruptly, Megan ran off in a panic to check her own room. The other three members of the Donaldson family followed behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, no!\u201d sobbed Megan. \u201cAll I have in here are boys things!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank God for that,\u201d said a visibly relieved Steve. \u201cAt least Marvin and Ally's room are the same.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is not the same!\u201d cried Megan. \u201cAll my stuff is changed around and... I can't go to school dressed as a nerdy boy. Ally... I mean 'Alan' \u2013 you saw on Facebook how Ashley called me 'Megan,' right? Tell them! My friends still know I'm a girl. I'm gonna look like a freak if I go around dressed in these clothes!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe's right,\u201d agreed Alan. \u201cAshley did refer to Marvin as 'Megan.' But everything else on his Facebook page was normal, regular, male Marvin. So... I don't know what to think.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

Steve took a personal day and drank and slept to forget his problems(he rarely missed work, and almost was almost never sick). Janet and Alan left home as early as possible and returned home as late as possible every day that week. They wanted to forget their problems at the moment. Megan tried to reconcile the changes going on while staying in her room, trying to figure out just what that book did to them. While Ally was gone, Megan tried on a few of her outfits, but only the ones buried at the back of the closet were big enough. She sulked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunday dinner was a humorous affair, with snarky comments for everyone. made about their respective eating habits being out of sync.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonday:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve looked at Gene's side of the dresser and decided that he didn't have any other choice. He picked one of Gene's dress shirts, a tie, pants, underwear, socks and loafers. None of them fit quite right, they were a little tight, but he was more or less presentable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stephanie, you look downright cute dressed up in a suit and tie!\" beamed Janet<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve grimaced, but at least he wasn't sulking. \"Gene, since you believe that you're a woman, you can wear the remainder of my clothing. It won't fit you perfectly. Apparently 'Stephanie' is even more curvy than you are, but it's the best you can do other than going to the thrift story. Lord knows Ally would never let you try on her clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ally seems really convinced that she's a boy though and won't wear any of her stuff now. It's Marvin you have to worry about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've explained to Marvin that even if he see's himself as the opposite sex, nobody else does, and that he'll get beaten up for wearing girls clothing outside the house. Ally can get away with being tomboyish, but a boy acting girly in public is not acceptable. If he wants to dress that way in his own room, fine, but no where else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe subject abruptly changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you really think that we should go back to that house?\" Janet asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you ever want to get back to normal, yes. Something happened there, but we were unprepared and walked right into a trap. Now we have to fix it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK. Call me when you have a chance\". Janet then hugged Steve warmly, and kissed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You be good now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will\" smiled Steve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then walked to the car and went to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe commute was normal, the parking was ample, and while stepping into the building, Steve didn't notice any female reflection looking back at him reflected off the glass or off the polished surfaces like he had feared. All he saw was good old Steve. The work day required no gender-disparity politics that Steve could notice. Everyone, either in person, on the phone, on the computer or at the water cooler, all called Steve by his given name and seemed to think of him as a guy. This contradicted the State Trooper a few days ago who referred to him as a \"Miss\". At the lunch period, Steve went outside and called up his wife(for the sake of Gene, he called him his wife) to tell him the good(but peculiar) news update:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Gene, you won't believe the news. Nobody thinks I'm a woman. Nobody. Everybody think that I'm Steve.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a little strange\" said Janet. \"Talking to the neighbors, they all think of you as Stephanie. I have some strange news of my own. Some of them remember Ally, but others remember Alan, and some remember Marvin, but others swear that we have a twelve year old girl named Megan. Ally has had trouble around her friends because they see her one way or the other, and the same goes for Marvin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis spoiled Steve's perfect (work) day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it. What about the book from the house, The Book Of Life Changes? Any word on that yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I found someone who's a paranormal detective.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah fuck, don't tell me you fell for a scam like that Gene.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I looked for his phone number and called him up. He's completely free until the case is solved to our satisfaction, and he lives right in the city, so we can either go to him or he can come to us. He doesn't sound like a fraud. Sure, he's probably a fake, but he's not asking for money, so it can't hurt right, honey?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not exactly, Gene. It's a waste of my time, and time these days is a resource I don't want to waste. But since I'm not good with these things in the first place, I leave the ball in your court. Gene?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes babe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the guy's name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. E. He goes by an alias.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. E? Wasn't he a comic book character? I could swear he was. I known I've heard that name before...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not exactly original, but all the original names were taken\" laughed Janet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So when do you want to see him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tonight\" said Janet. \"It's spookier that way. Ooooo....\"</span></div></div>",

Much to Janet's consternation, both greeted her by saying, \u201cHi, Dad!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow was school, kids?\u201d asked Janet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot too bad,\u201d answered Alan. He was dressed in very unisex fashion \u2013 a pair of jeans, tennis shoes, and a plain, black t-shirt. Janet noted with disapproval that he wasn't wearing a bra, but she chose to say nothing, knowing he perceived himself as male while she still saw him as a teenage girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't get me wrong, dad,\u201d continued Alan. \u201cSchool today was pretty weird at moments. I know you all think I'm some girl named 'Alison,' but practically everybody at school still sees me as Alan \u2013 a guy. The only weird part was gym class. I tried to change clothes in the boys locker room, but got in trouble and they kicked me out. So for that one class, I got treated like a girl. Everyone called me 'Ally,' and I had to change in the girls locker, and I had to wear a sports bra and everything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan paused and shuddered with disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut,\u201d he continued. \u201cAfter gym class, everything went back to normal and all my friends and teachers saw me as Alan again. Marvin says he had a pretty similar day too, didn't you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan looked very frustrated and embarrassed at being dressed in boys clothes: basically the same jeans and t-shirt ensemble Alan wore. But she nodded her head and agreed about the strangely routine way her day had gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlly's right,\u201d said Megan. \u201cAll my friends see me as Megan still. A bunch of them were all like, 'why are you dressed like such a tomboy' and I got made fun of a bit, 'cuz I'm not wearing lipstick and my hair looks like I just rolled out of bed. But other than that, it was all just like Ally said. The only time anybody thought I was a boy named 'Marvin' was in health class. We're doing sex-ed, y'know? And they made me sit in a room full of boys and learn about erections and prostates and... ewww... just all kinds of gross out stuff!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you are at that age,\u201d said Janet. \u201cYou're becoming a young man, and...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDad, I'm a girl!\u201d protested Megan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, okay,\u201d sighed Janet. \u201cHave it your way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell Dad about the other thing,\u201d urged Alan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwwww, why did you have to bring that up?\u201d asked Megan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat's the 'other thing'?\u201d asked Janet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfter school, I met up with Allison,\u201d said Megan. \u201cAnd while we were walking home, some other girls came up to us, and they were all laughing and stuff, and one of them said... she said she liked me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd then she kissed him on the cheek!\u201d said Alan. \u201cMarvin's got a girlfriend!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am a girl! Just like you, Ally!\u201d protested Megan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlly, Marvin \u2013 Please!\u201d said Janet, trying to broker the peace between the bickering siblings. \u201cBut... Well, since the two of you brought up the obvious topic \u2013 your mother and I are meeting with a paranormal investigator this evening...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA what?\u201d asked Alan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's like a detective who specializes in weird, unexplained stuff, sweetie,\u201d answered Janet. \u201cHis name is Mister E, and since all of us have been affected in some way by what happened in that... that... that creepy house...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want us to meet with this private eye, too?\u201d asked Alan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, yes I do,\u201d answered Janet. \u201cI want my entire family to stick together until we get this whole paranormal confusion resolved.

A man walked out of the shadow's, and rang a second buzzer attached to the wall to let them inside. Steve entered, holding the door open for Janet, Megan, and Alan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't there any electricity in here\" asked an annoyed Steve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. There is.\" Mister E then turned on the lights casually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe family got a good look at Mister E. Janet and Megan both thought that he could be attractive if he had better posture and his skin wasn't so pale. He was youngish, late twenties or maybe early thirties, tall, brown hair, and judging by his biceps he obviously worked out. He wore a fedora reminiscent of Indiana Jones, and a billowing black coat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around the office, there were posters on the wall of various famous detectives, everyone from Sherlock Holmes to Columbo to various cartoon detectives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello. I am Mister E.\" His voice was low and strangely awkward. Steve was convinced that they have run into a crackpot, or even worse, a crackhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet reacted first. \"I'm Janet Donaldson. We spoke on the phone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YYYess\" he drawled. \"You went to the dilapidated Cameron Manor, opened a book with a greenish glow to it, and now you've all lost your memories. I recall the chat we...had.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you help us?\" asked Alan. \"We all see ourselves differently then how everyone else does. I see myself as a guy, but everyone else thinks I'm a girl named Ally. My name's Alan by the way. Marvin thinks he's a girl named Megan, my mom thinks he's a man, and my dad thinks he's a woman. And some people perceive us as one or the other. Like some people see me as Alan, but others swear that I'm Ally. And when we got home, all of our clothing was different. And our identification is different too. I went on Facebook, with an account that I set up for myself under the name Alan, but it says Allison instead. But when I talk to people there or in real life, they usually see me as Alan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan shook her head in agreement. \"It's the same story with me.\" Steve acknowledged that, yes, it's happened to him too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" said Mister E. \"The Book Of Life Changes usually doesn't act this way. It usually alters just alters reality, but this case...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You all look exactly as you claim to be.\" He point at Steve. \"You're a man, not a woman. I know that you work in insurance, and your average yearly salary is-\", and then the detective pointed all the way down the line, explaining what he saw in each person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait\" said Janet. \"This is my wife. I'm gay, not straight. I met Stephie in college. Are you telling me that my memories are wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\" said Mister E. \"Your memories have been altered by the Book Of Life Changes. It came into this dimension in the year 541 B.C.E in Australia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" exclaimed Megan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a magic book used to alter people, as you can tell by the name. There was a collector of extra-dimensional artifacts who used to live in that house named Cameron. He and his wife left under mysterious circumstances, I'm still looking into it, but they left their library of magic books behind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this means...that I really am a girl and not a boy?\" asked Megan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes and no. You are all confusing yourselves and being confused with your parallel universe's counterparts. There are several versions of a boy named Marvin Donaldson who fills your role. I spoke to one of the alternate universe Donaldson's this morning. They were just as confused as you were.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve looked at Mister E with trepidation and a large dose of skepticism. \"I'm guessing you didn't help them yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMister E responded \"Not yet. It will take a few days to fix everything and stopped the various continuities from bleeding into each other. You know, my deductive abilities are a lot sharper when I'm not hungry. Would you all like to go to dinner with me? There's a diner nearby, and I'll pay.\"</span></div></div>",

He selected a real greasy spoon place. The staff all greeted him as though he were a regular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe food here is delicious,\u201d said Mister E, settling into a booth and gesturing for the family to join him. \u201cPlease \u2013 do sit down and enjoy yourselves. As I said, dinner is on me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe family reluctantly climbed into the restaurant booth and each of them ordered something from the friendly waitress who hovered about them, calling everyone \u201csugar\u201d or \u201choney.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, let's get back to business,\u201d said Steve. \u201cMister E \u2013 you said it'll take a few days to put everything right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's correct,\u201d replied the mysterious private investigator. \u201cYou were all affected by the Book of Life Changes \u2013 a powerful artifact that has never, to my knowledge, behaved quite this way before. Had your curse been a little more run-of-the-mill, I could reverse it much more easily. But to disentangle so many different parallel realities... well, it is tedious, difficult, time-consuming work, Mister Donaldson.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wish you wouldn't treat Stephie like she's a man,\u201d complained Janet. \u201cIt's all so weird hearing you call her 'Mister Donaldson' and all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I am a man,\u201d said Steve. \u201cAnd you're my gay partner Gene \u2013 not... not... this frumpy housewife you seem to think you are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, everyone, please,\u201d sat Mister E gently, waving his hands in the air for effect. \u201cSettle down for a moment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe family grew silent and patiently waited for the detective to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs I said, I can and will correct everything,\u201d continued Mister E. \u201cBut are you all prepared for that? If we go down this route, in two or three days I will have reality straightened out... and you will all be Steve, Janet, Megan, and Alan. You'll each be the person you remember being \u2013 but the rest of your family will no longer be the people you currently mis-remember them as.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou're saying our memories are all wrong?\u201d asked Alan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d answered Mister E. \u201cTo a certain extant. Each of you recalls your own identities correctly. But you \u2013 and certain random other people in the world \u2013 each see the rest of the family and your relationships to them... well... incorrectly. After I put things right, most of your memories should return to normal. But quite frankly, there is no guarantee that everything you remember will 'snap' back to the way it was before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMister E turned to Steve and Janet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou two will become a male and female heterosexual couple,\u201d said Mister E. \u201cAre you prepared for that? It's what you used to be, prior to your run-in at the Cameron House. What I cannot guarantee is that everything about your private memories and personalities will be properly restored. It is possible you will see each other normally, but Steve will remain a gay man and Janet will remain a lesbian. I just want to prepare you for this distinct possibility.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, since I am a gay man,\u201d said Steve. \u201cI won't mind that. But I have to admit, it sounds strange to hear I'll be married to a woman. And a lesbian one at that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut we'd all agree on how we see each other?\u201d asked Janet. \u201cI mean, even if some of our memories remain a little goofed up, we'd all agree on what we see? And we'd still be a family, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d replied Mister E. \u201cYou and the rest of the world will go back to seeing one another as Steve, Janet, Alan, and Megan. There's just a certain possibility of a few old memories lingering or some small personality changes from before the accident. Now, is this what you want me to do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

On one side of the device there was a series of tiny, unmarked, gray buttons \u2013 about two dozen of them. On the other side of the device there was simply that small, flashing red light.

Mom will be fine, she just...hopefully won't mind a lot of dirty jokes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUneasy, the reduced family walked to Megan's locker, on the lookout for any other peers who knew them and wanted to whisk them away on a middle school adventure they had no intention of taking. Leading a middle school body through their class schedule was no problem: everybody but Megan had already been through the early teen grind and dealt with the material. Doing it a second time would be easy-peasy. Adjusting to the new demands of a hormone-driven social life, as the opposite gender? Way beyond their league.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet understood this immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get your hands out of the chicks' panties, Jared,\" the mouse-like punk prattled on with breakneck speed. \"You could lead 3/4 the schools' girls in an orgy, we know, don't flaunt it, jeez!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverybody but Janet laughed. After a second, she nervously joined in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you be part of an orgy with Jared, Sam?\" the basketball player asked the tomboy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Todd! Fuck no!\" she said, making a grandiose \"No way\" sign with her arms. \"You want to try anything on me Jared? Just try, see that I don't kick you in the balls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks...\" Janet muttered. \"I trust you will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam made a sudden U-turn and moved as if to kick Janet right between the legs. She flinched in a very unmasculine manner, withdrawing into herself and squeaking when the sneaker nearly made contact. It never hit, and her three \"friends\" cackled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be such a baby.\" Todd knuckled Janet on the shoulder, a pain that didn't leave throughout the rest of her first period. Will I deal with these hooligans every day now? she thought in horror.</span></div></div>",

Nothing came however, and he banged his fist against the metal door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, Dad...\" Megan whispered. \"If you don't know the combination, you can go to the principal's office and ask to see it. You'll be late for class, but...that shouldn't be a huge deal, all things considered.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Worse than trying to remember combinations we never had,\" Alan added. Steve considered the option, continually wiping the blonde hair from his face and toying with his skirt, trying to magically make it reach further down than it was designed to reach. Residues of stubborn, male pride urged him to avoid waltzing into a middle school office, asking in a bubbly, female drawl for a locker combination, introducing himself as somebody he wasn't.

Speak up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember my combination,\" he said in wonder. \"one turn right, 33, two turns left, 45, two turns right, 06.\" When Alan applied the numbers and turns to the locker, it swung open, revealing an interior filled with mirrors, celebrity posters, and pictures of Molly's equally fashionable and pretty friends. Apparently she had come early enough to school for an intense exercise in decoration. There was some makeup, a gym uniform, and a green backpack. A piece of paper stuck out from one of the flaps, a schedule of Molly's classes. Alan reached for it, browsed through the list, and discarded it immediately. He knew where all his classes were; Molly had checked their locations earlier, the moment she arrived at school (dropped off by her stern, white-collar mom, in a nice, brand new Lexus). Against all common sense--Alan knew he had been a high school male some minutes ago--the middle school now resounded with familiarity and deja vu. He knew its name was Benson G. Wilkes Middle School. There was no mistaking what was happening, as Alan had gone to a different middle school than Megan. Molly's memories were being made available to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve, likewise, made a similar discovery. He pried the locker open, found paper flowers, Hello Kitty dolls taped to the door, and an array of mirrors, posters, and photos much like Alan's. There was no class schedule inside, but Amber too had joined Molly in hunting down their classes during the hour before classes when school was open. Steve remembered this vividly, their laughter and dreamy stares at Jared as he walked by, hands in his collar in a perfect imitation of James Dean (if they knew who she was). There was no confusion about him having been an aging husband and father up until that moment, but he carried his old memories alongside the new, which were growing in number and intensity with each passing second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm remembering Molly's life,\" Alan said. His voice wavered with fear. \"All of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm remembering Amber's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe school bell rang. Every other student still in the halls made a mad dash for their classes, backpacks slapping against their backs, teachers calling for stragglers to come in immediately. Megan, Steve, and Alan stood perfectly still. There were more important issues on their minds.</span></div></div>",

Quietly and instantly, the Donaldson family abruptly transformed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan had been transformed into a shaggy haired, twelve-year old boy from her school \u2013 a boy named Jared whom the shy Megan had long harbored a secret crush on. She still held the mysterious device, but was now dressed in Jared's t-shirt and jeans and looked every bit like him. She cringed at the strangely horrifying sensation of her new male genitalia swinging between her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan had been transformed into his girlfriend Katey \u2013 a busty, athletic, blonde currently dressed in a pastel blue tank top, a tightly fitting pair of matching cotton, blue shorts, and a pair of fashionable looking wedge heeled sandals. Alan looked down at his mammoth new chest with a mixture of wonder , awe, and horror. He was familiar with Katey and recognized her body instantly... but had never seen it from a first-person perspective before, much less actually felt the weight of her heavy breasts hanging off his own chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet had been transformed into a muscular, hulk of a man \u2013 strong, athletic, and well over six feet tall. She looked considerably younger (in her mid twenties) and had short black hair and quite a bit of facial stubble. She was dressed in a workman's jumpsuit of some kind and carried a heavy tool belt around her waist. A name patch sewn onto her uniform identified her as \u201cTed\u201d and indicated she worked for a city utility company.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Steve had become his own secretary \u2013 a petite, young, redhead named Audrey. Fresh out of school, Audrey was young and working for Steve was her first real job. Steve now had her body: her pert, bouncy, medium sized breasts... her long, lean legs... her tiny waist... her apple shaped rear end... all of it. He was dressed in one of Audrey's black mini skirts, a tight leopard print top, and a pair of black, strappy heels. Big, dangly hoop earrings hung from his ears. Steve looked down at himself in Audrey's tight, revealing clothes. A look of panic washed across his face as he realized her tiny, little, beautiful body... was now his!</span></div></div>",

The Donaldson family plunged into their second set of new forms with the same, breakneck speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan was the only family member to return to her original gender, only now she was a foot taller and clear-sinned. She had become Shannon, the older sister of a classmate she knew named Molly. Rich, fiery red hair spilled down her back. She wore a \"WILLOW PARK TOWNSHIP HIGH SCHOOL\" volleyball t-shirt and spandex short-shorts, tight against her rotund, fuller ass. C-cups, contained by a plain-white sports bra, jiggled from the force of the transformation, a new sensation for the previously flat-skinned Megan. She cupped the melon-shaped spheres in her hand, squeezing them with both awe and fear. Her body felt more powerful and athletic, like she could run for miles or jump a hundred hurtles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve went from buxom secretary to frail, hunched over grandma--his mother. Gray wisps hung along his face, cheeks clinging tightly to withered bone. He wore an old-fashioned, European style dress, drab with its browns, blacks, and grays, and a gray, white-dotted babushka down to his neck. Arthritic hands clutched a cane, needed to make even the slightest step forward, and his mom's false teeth were nowhere in sight. When he moved his talk, he talked in a heavily-accented, scratchy mumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet was transformed into an old, college classmate she had gone out with for a few weeks before graduating. She remembered him only after looking down and recognizing the distinctive birthmark on the back of his left wrist. A boy who had been dirt-poor and asthmatic in his college years now stood tall, in a two-piece business suit, with polished dress shoes and a red tie. His graying hair was neatly combed back, his smile white and sparkly, and his eyes, though sunken in, filled with a warm, charismatic radiance. His workout regime, started shortly after applying for graduate school, made him fit, healthy, and more vigorous than Janet was used to being on any given day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan had become his AP US teacher, a young Asian woman with cascading, raven hair, straight and highly reflective. She wore a modest business skirt with small slits and a white, button-up shirt, the top two buttons undone enough to show her cavernous cleavage, between two walloping breasts even larger than Katey's. Even worse, they sagged, despite the support provided by her white, cotton bra, and the faint suggestion of love handles and excess flab was already forming along her otherwise admirable curves. Dealing with rebellious, sarcastic teenagers was already taking its toll, along with the birth of two children in the last two years. Alan found himself craving a cigarette and good can of beer, and for the first time in his active life, he smirked at the thought of crumbling into bed, flipping on the TV, and eating something fatty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow what?</span></div></div>",

They were all within eyesight distance of each other, but had to walk closer to one another to get a better look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve looked down and saw that he was a woman again. Damn it. He was wearing a teal cocktail dress and teal colored heels. Shaking his head, he could feel a long curtain of brunette hair reach down to his elbows. A purse was slung over his shoulder. Looking for a mirror, Steve rifled through the purse and then after he found one, looked at the face of a pretty young(ish) woman he had never met before. A woman named Halle Keelar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's strange...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve suddenly recalled Halle's memory, and he realized that whatever that remote was capable of doing, it pulled her out of an anonymous Manhattan dinner party. It appears that Halle was some sort of rogue secret agent, a carefree and amoral woman who ran away from home at an early age and later, betrayed her superiors in some bid for power. Steve grimaced as more memories flooded in. Someone was tying her arms behind the chair, her mouth was being gagged by a mean spirited looking man in a tuxedo. Was that where he was right now? Was his life in danger?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad? Your face looks all funny, like you just got hit by a truck.\" Steve turned around and saw Alan approaching. He had turned into an an annoying hipster girl with a mixture of platinum blonde/black hair, with her bangs off to one side. She had a sleeveless black wife-beater on, a purple leather skirt, and light up in the back sneakers. Alan's memories suddenly merged with the girls, who's name she now realized was Eve McCool. She was dancing in a nightclub on the other side of the country when the switch happened. Unlike Alan, Eve was very needy and loved attention more than anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So does yours, Alan. Do you still remember who you are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan looked down at his new body, then back up at his \"dad\". In Eve's voice, he answered, \"Yeah, but I have this girl's memories. I don't like them. I feel like I want to have sex with the first guy I see, and it disgusts me saying that\". Alan/Eve pointed at his mother \"Like him\", who then came up the hill and was now a very large, muscled Muay Thai boxer. Janet's new form had nothing but swimming trunks on, and he was all wet from the chest down. Janet could remember that this man was in a hot-tub with a bevy of beautiful women at the beach, in what looks like Miami. She recalls that his name is Jinn Yamashita.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...feeling the same ways towards you Alan\", said Jinn's voice in a nervous stutter. \"I curse us for ever going into that house. Oh my god, is that Megan?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three family members looked over, who then saw the figure walking up, holding the remote, crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho did Megan turn into?</span></div></div>",

Her frightening large, muscular body was clad in an orange prison jumpsuit with a black stenciled number across the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Megan?\" asked Steve with Halle's voice. \"Is that you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" growled Megan. \"I mean... not really.

When he was out of hearing distance, the family began to speak up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So he DOES have it!\" exclaimed a surprised Jinn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Somebody has to stop him.\" said Halle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve looked at Jinn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a big guy. You could take him on, couldn't you?\" Eve started to jerk/shake in a weird fluid dancing motion, as if she were nervous. She then grabbed on to Jinn's right arm for support.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eve. I mean Alan. I mean Eve! Gaaaawwwwd, I'm in no shape to fight. It's like on one hand, yeah, I could potentially kick his ass, but then on the other hand, at the exact moment I'm about to beat him, I turn back in the direction of being a lazy housewife. I'm practically schizo. I don't know if I could stop Megan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinn then looked at the two women, both of whom looked like toothpicks compared to him or Frank. Eve looked like she could knocked over by a feather, and Halle, while perhaps deceptively cunning and sneaky, held no chance in a fair fight in his opinion against a notorious hardened criminal like Frank Wilson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if you're not going to, I'm going to\" announced Halle. She suddenly remembered something and pulled it out of her purse, another metallic looking device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A toy ran gun? Are you kidding?\" replied Jinn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not a toy. This baby just came out of the Navy's R&amp;D; department. It has non lethal functions including a freeze ray, a force field generator, and a temporal dis-locator.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're serious?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"According to Halle's memories, I am. Unless she's crazy, this could stop him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then use it\" huffed Jinn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, I will!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalle then walked straight into the woods for a good position to shoot Frank while he couldn't see her. Jinn and Eve/Janet and Alan watched from afar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, walking in heels through a wooded area was never pleasant, and Steve's memories was putting Halle's normal catlike grace off balance. But she soon found a good spot behind a rotting log. After adjusting the sci-fi gun, Halle searched through the scope for Frank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh, there he is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank was busy hot wiring the Donaldson's car. Since he's been in prison for ten years, he had gotten a little rusty at it. And since he was rusty at it, he was too busy and frustrated to have noticed Halle running through the woods in the first place. He banged his fist on the hood, severely denting it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve wanted to shout \"My car! You bastard!\", but he wisely kept his mouth hut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat remained of Steve's mind was excited at this. He hadn't had this much excitement running through him since he last played paint ball. This was kinda/sorta like a spy movie come to life!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPointing the gun at him, Halle pulled the trigger...</span></div></div>",

Like, whoa dudes... where am I and how did I get here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan immediately clapped her hands across her mouth in shock at being unable to mouth the words she had intended.

This time though she recognized the sound of her voice. She was now inhabiting the body of Jared \u2013 a cute boy in her grade that she'd long harbored a secret crush on. And now some unseen force was making her talk like the real Jared would in this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike, I dunno where I am!\u201d said Alan in a sing-song, girly voice. He was now inhabiting the body of Katey \u2013 his own girlfriend.

Suddenly I'm here, wherever this place is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatey's body seemed twitchy and agitated, as Alan struggled in vain from inside to assert some control. Some strange curse was forcing him to act the way the real Katey would. It was a struggle for him to do much more than shrug his shoulders cluelessly and daintily stomp a petite, high-heeled foot on the floor in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I dunno what's going on here, guys,\u201d said Janet in a gruff, low-pitched voice. \u201cI'm Ted, by the way.

His tiny, girly body shaking in a paroxysm of rage and frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name is Audrey,\u201d said Steve, finally speaking. He continued staring down at his own cleavage, fascinated by the modest but firm and pert breasts peeking out from the tight, leopard-print top he wore. \u201cI don't know how I suddenly got here either.

It was just an inquisitive but emotionless something in the back of her head asking urgent questions about what she most wanted to be. But as quickly as it had crept into her mind, it just as quickly slipped away with the speed of thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, there was no flash of light or sound of any kind. But quietly and instantly, the Donaldson family abruptly transformed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan immediately recognized the changes. It was everything that tiny, quiet presence in her mind had silently asked her about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer father Steve was now a young, athletic girl. His face seemed mostly unchanged \u2013 what it would've looked like if he had been a girl Megan's age. His formerly thinning hair was now thick, youthful, and girlish \u2013 pulled back into a sporty ponytail. He was dressed in a loose fitting white and blue basketball jersey that read \u201cDonaldson\u201d across the back. Likewise, he had on a pair of girls basketball shorts, knee socks, and athletic shoes. Megan could see the outline of a sports bra on beneath her father's shirt. He appeared strong, flexible, and healthy \u2013 the star of the school's girls basketball team... and just the sort of person Megan wished she could be every day in gym class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan's brother Alan was also now a girl roughly her age. Like Steve, Alan's face was mostly unchanged, just a bit softer, younger, and more girly. The rest of Alan, though, was radically different. He was now a preppy looking \u201cpopular girl,\u201d dressed in a pink and silver striped top, a pair of black jeggings, and a pair of shiny, silver ballet flats. He had an extensive amount of perfectly applied makeup on his face \u2013 foundation, rouge, lipstick, eyeliner, eyeshadow, etc. His hair was now just past the shoulders, and was immaculately styled. Alan now looked exactly the sort of always fashionable, super popular girl Megan wished she could be. The worst, thought Megan jealously, was that although she and Alan were now physically the same age, her brother's breasts were noticeably bigger than her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Megan's mother Janet had also regressed to the same age. The entire family now looked like a group of sisters or perhaps cousins \u2013 preteen girls who were obviously related to one another. In contrast to the others though, Janet now looked incredibly nerdy! She had thick, black framed glasses and long, stringy hair done up clumsily into a pair of braids that hung from the back of her head. She was wearing a frumpy looking, oversized fuzzy green sweater and a knee length green and yellow plaid skirt. Her exposed legs were pasty white. On her feet she wore a pair of dull green ankle socks and a scuffed up pair of brown leather maryjanes. An unfashionable looking, heavy book bag was slung across one shoulder. As much of an outcast nerd as Janet looked like now, Megan recognized this image too from her subconscious. Megan's mom had become the sort of super smart book worm that Megan sometimes wished she could be... if she couldn't succeed as sports or be popular and beautiful, she sometimes wished she could at least be the smartest girl in school. And it looked like her mom had now become just that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

The red light had turned to yellow and seemed to be blinking a bit faster, but everything else was the same -- just a couple of rows of unlabeled buttons. But, she decided, there had to be one that would turn her family members back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to work methodically, she aimed the device toward her father and pressed the button at the upper left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the blink of an eye, the preteen version of her father was now wearing a cheerleading uniform -- a blue and white sweater, matching ruffled skirt that extended to mid-thigh, athletic shoes in a blue-and-white pattern, and ankle socks -- and holding a pair of pompoms. Instead of being in a ponytail, his hair was in pigtails, tied off by ribbons that matched the rest of the outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan hadn\u2019t been expecting that. She knew cheerleading was fairly athletic, but she\u2019d rather be a basketball player. She hoped the next button would reverse the costume change if it didn\u2019t transform her father back to his regular self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hit it, and instead, he changed in several ways: his brunette hair was now streaked through with blonde and the pigtails stretched to the middle of his back; his face rounded a bit, with higher cheekbones, a more shapely nose, and slightly larger eyes with longer eyelashes; and his pale skin darkened a few shades to the point where it appeared he\u2019d spent some definite time in the sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan liked the look of the more beautiful face, and the tan was certainly appropriate for a cheerleader. She couldn\u2019t help wondering what the \u201cpopular\u201d version of herself would look like with the same changes, so she aimed the device at Alan and pressed the same button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gained the same face and skin tone as her father, and his hair was about the same color and now went halfway down his back, with a slight wave to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn\u2019t resist, and tried the button again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hard to describe exactly what had changed about the face, just that it was almost breathtakingly beautiful. His hair had lightened to a honey blonde, become wavier, and now fell to his waist. His skin appeared smooth and unblemished, the tan darkening further to make him look like a serious sunbather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan wondered what would happen if she hit the button a third time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings seemed to have gone a little too far -- his eyes wide and a shimmering bright blue, his lips puffed out, his hair platinum blonde and just past his ass, his skin dark enough that it only seemed realistic to be a spray-on tan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan hoped the next button down would fix things. However, what happened instead when she pressed it was that Alan\u2019s outfit suddenly showed more skin: the pink-and-silver top was now a sleeveless tank, the jeggings became a knee-length skirt, and the ballet flats were now silver sandals with a low heel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious, she pressed it again. The top shrank to reveal her midriff, the skirt\u2019s bottom hem shrank to reach only to mid-thigh, and the shoes became a stiletto-heeled version.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer finger slipped as she reached for the next button. Alan was now wearing a small halter top, a skirt that couldn\u2019t have been more than 6 inches long and was now made of latex, silver high-heeled shoes with tall platforms, and fishnet stockings. The waistband of a pair of pink panties was visible above the waistband of the skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, Megan more deliberately hit the next button down, hoping it would reverse some of the alterations.</span></div></div>",

It might not have been obvious before due to the dark skin, but Megan now noticed that the makeup on his face was thicker, the eye shadow brighter and applied to a wider area, the lipstick a bit glossier. His fingernails now had manicured white tips as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan pressed the button one more time. There were now several smaller silver hoops through the sides of each ear and a similar hoop through one of Alan\u2019s nostrils. A silver charm dangled from a piercing in Alan\u2019s navel. The necklaces and bracelets hadn\u2019t apparently changed, except for the choker, which now had silver raised letters spelling A-L-A-N. Even against his skin, his makeup appeared vivid and colorful, particularly the wet-looking pink of his overstuffed lips. His fingernails had grown to about an inch long, still with white tips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, it was a little bit over the top.

Alan\u2019s voluptuous curves were well out of place on Megan\u2019s body. Interestingly, the clothes seemed to have grown somewhat to accommodate what they were containing, although the top was straining against the melon-sized objects -- and was tight enough, Megan realized, that it appeared the nipples were pierced with jewelry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was getting a little disillusioned about the prospects of the device turning the rest of her family back into her normal selves, or even reversing the changes she\u2019d now given her father and brother, and took another look down at the device as it rested in her hand. This inspection revealed that four of the buttons seemed to be slightly out of line with the rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan decided to concentrate on those four, and hoping one of them wasn\u2019t a \u201cleave everyone like they are now and turn off this device forever\u201d button, she did \u201ceenie-meenie-miney-moe\u201d to pick the one to try first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt came out as the top one of the four. She shrugged, pointed the device at Alan, and pressed that button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA green aura appeared around him, but there seemed to be no other effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan was taken aback by the aura, but pointed the remote at her father -- currently in the form of a \u201ccheerleader\u201d version of herself -- and pressed the second button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe now had a blue aura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned toward her mother, as the \u201cnerdy\u201d version of herself, who she\u2019d been ignoring up until now. She pressed the third button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother now had a red aura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan looked down at the device again, wondering what the fourth button would do, and discovered that the light on the device was now glowing a steady green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere goes nothing,\u201d she thought, and pointing the device up in the air, she pressed that fourth button.</span></div></div>",

You will be locked out after you change.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hadn\u2019t quite finished processing that statement when she noticed the red aura around her \u201cnerdy\u201d self getting brighter -- but then it suddenly dissipated, and standing there was her mother, looking just as she had before Megan had picked up the device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan breathed a sigh of relief. The blue aura around her \u201ccheerleader\u201d self and the green aura around what had been her \u201cpopular\u201d self -- but now looked more like it was her \u201cslutty\u201d self -- also brightened. Instead of dissipating, though, they moved toward each other, now looking like semi-transparent clouds. Her brother and father\u2019s original forms were restored, but Megan was watching the two clouds meet, merging together, enlarging, the colors mingling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt suddenly flew toward her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan almost fell over from the shock. It almost seemed as if her body was absorbing the bluish-green cloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blinked several times. The cloud had disappeared. Her family stood there, slight looks of confusion on their faces. Megan was overjoyed and was about to let out a \u201cyeah!\u201d, until she realized that she felt odd. Her body seemed to have too much weight on it, with the weight in the wrong places. She felt taller and that she was leaning forward, standing on her tiptoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down to see a deep valley between two oversized orangish-dark brown breasts, being barely held in by a skimpy halter top, a couple of necklaces dangling down into the cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gasped. She realized she could feel the hair tickling the back of her thighs -- her incredibly long platinum blonde hair. She reached down and felt her narrow waist and navel piercing, almost poking herself with a long fingernail. She reached up to her nose and felt the ring through a nostril. On the choker around her neck, she started at her right and traced the letters M and backwards E before giving up. She shook her head a bit and felt not only the heavy hair from her scalp, but also the cold metal of her hoop earrings hitting her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her other hand was the device, and she saw that the colored light was now dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked back up at her family.</span></div></div>",

Janet was pretty tired. She sat down for a while and played with some toys behfore remembering what Megan said. So Janet got out of her skirt and top.

She slipped on the clothes on and her budding breast shown threw the thin material of the wife beater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan had found Mrs. Liefelds nyllon pajama bottoms, and a light pink cotton top that said \"A woman's place is in the mal\" on his side of the bed. Alan walked over to get a fresh paitr of panties then he had to do his nightly ritual.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan carried his clothes into the bathroom, while Megan turned on a basketball game cause the Liefelds had a TV in their bedroom. Alan sat down at his vanity chair and looked into the bathroom mirror. He found his brush and brushed his boyish hair. He tried hard to shape it, but it was to short. He then put his curlers into his hair, and found his toothbrush and brushed his teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he applied some of his cold cream on his face. He then took off his clothes and put his panties on, and the nylon pajama bottoms. He then put on the shirt  and walked out of the bathroom.
