He was an average height of 5'10\" and an average weight of 150 lbs. He had some good looks, maybe not male model material but he was handsome enough. He wasn't too athletic like the jocks at school, but he was certainly stronger than the more nerdy people. On the outside, he looked like he was an ordinary, average person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he wasn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time ago Parker discovered he had powers. He felt that his powers were really useless to him as well. Instead of granting him super human strength or shoot lasers out of his eyes, his powers was to make other people grow! How did he make people grow? Well, he made them grow...</span></div></div>",

Admittedly when he accidentally grew a few guys at school it was kinda fun, but he was still disappointed with his power. How would he be able to defend himself in this mutant discriminating world if his powers would just grow his enemies? Fortunetely not too long after his discovery of his powers, a Xavier Institute for Higher Learning contacted and said they would send someone over to pick him up. Naturally he knew that the Xavier Institute was a school for mutants, so at least he wouldn't get pushed around for being a mutant there. And he'll be able to see the X-Men, the mutant heroes from TV close up, so that would be a little cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker sighed as he sat in his living room, his bags packed and just waiting for his chaperone to arrive and take him to his new school and new life. He was a little nervous about going, but there was nothing he could do now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the doorbell rang. Thinking it was the person to take him to the school, Parker went up to the door and opened it. Standing behind it was...</span></div></div>",

The man was on the shorter side, shorter than even Parker was, but there was something about this man that made him feel like he was looking up at a giant. The man was dressed like some sort of trucker or something. He wore a brown hacker over a yellow plaid shirt underneath, with faded jeans and a pair of heavy boots. He had a thick coating of stubble on his chin that made him look even more rugged, and almost animalistic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey kid, you Parker?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-huh?\" Parker stared at the man like a deer caught in the headlights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man growled. \"Listen kid, I don't got all day to sit around and repeat everything twice. Now then are you Parker?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNumbly he nodded. \"Y-yes, I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man have a sniff if his nose. \"The names Logan, I'm here to pick you up and take you back to the school with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a teacher?\" Parker asked in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I look like one?\" he asked, and Parker flinched. Logan gave Parker one look and sighed. \"Listen bub, I ain't gonna eat ya, so you might as well get used to me. Honestly why did Xavier pick me for his errand boy? Jean or even Beast would have made a better pick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry.\" Parker said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For what? You didn't do anything wrong.\" He placed a hand on Parker's shoulder. \"Listen, you didn't ask to be born a mutant, but it's not something you should blame yourself over. Your powers is a part of what makes you who you are, and you'll learn to accept that. At the school you'll meet tons of other kids who are goin' through the same thing, so cheer up alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan's words made Parker feel better, and he began to ease up. Despite his rough and tough looks and behavior, Logan was actually a nice guy...maybe even a little attractive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When they got in the car Logan started to head for the school when Parker noticed his bulge. He knew that wolverine wasn't horny but he stretched out the crotch on his pants anyway. Parker knew he wouldn't be able to resist much longer and he knew he had to make Logan grow but he couldn't do it while he was driving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Parker got an idea. Parker asked, \"Hey Logan, are you hungry, we could stop for breakfast or something?\" Logan looked over at Parker and said, \"We'll be at the school in 30 minutes bub, just wait.\" Parker couldn't wait, he had to grow Logan now, and then he got another idea. In addition to being able to make people stronger and their muscles bigger he could also make certain parts of people grow larger at will. For example, if he were to touch Logan he would be able to expand his stomach to the point where he would have to stop somewhere to eat. Parker put on a hand on Logan's shoulder and said, \"I can't thank you enough for letting me join your school, I promise I...\" before he could finish his speech Logan shrugged him off and said, \"Sorry bub, don't do emotional stuff.\" Parker then turned to look out the window to hide his smile. He knew he had made Logan's stomach so big he could out eat the Blob right now. All of a sudden they pass a diner and Logan makes a hard right. Parker tries to look shocked and Logan says, \"Sorry kid, emergency food stop,\" and with that he jumps out of the car and runs into the diner, his gut roaring the whole time. Parker follows Logan inside where he has already ordered one of everything and is seated in a booth. Parker joins him and he says, \"How can the be taking so long, God, I feel like I haven't eaten in days. Parker shrugs and then holds up a menu trying to figure out a way to make contact with Logan when all of a sudden he hears a thud and Logan's head has hit the table. Parker immediately becomes worried but then hears snoring, \"he must have fallen asleep from severe hunger\", Parker thought, but this was his chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slowly reached for Logan's face and felt his chiseled chin and strong neck and knew he was going to enjoy this. He begins using his power and hears the fabric of his clothes stretching, his muscles stiffening and then swelling all over his body. Parker can see his neck growing thicker and causing the neck of his shirt to start to tear open, revealing his growing pecs. Logan was also getting taller, and he was now probably around 6 foot 4 causing him to hunch over more revealing his now defined back muscles and lats. His shoulders were growing into thick boulders and making him broader and his arms were growing bigger too. When he is almost ready to stop the waitress comes with the first trey of food and...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The waitress seemed bored and oblivious as she set the multiple plates of food in front of Logan and the one order of fries in front of Parker. At the smell of food, Logan stirred making Parker quickly jerk his hands back. Logan blinked a couple of times, clearly disoriented by his new size. For a second Parker was worried about what he would say but then the ravenous hunger overtook Logan and he began to eat with gusto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker did his best to sit still and keep his breathing level as he watched Logan's enormous new muscles strain his now almost comically small shirt. His pecs pressed his shirt out so that the ripped neckline now didn't even come close to covering them, leaving the tops of his glorious new mounds exposed for the world to see. The sleeves of his flannel shirt were stretched to their maximum limit by Logan's two ponderous biceps and the right sleeve had actually split open as Logan inadvertently flexed shoveling food into his mouth. Parker felt his mouth go dry as he watched the split get bigger and bigger, revealing more and more of the glorious bicep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You gonna eat that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan's voice snapped Parker out of his revere. The huge man was pointing at Parkers fries, most of his plates already empty. In the back of his mind a little voice wondered if he hadn't over done the appetite just a little but he could do nothing but shake his head numbly as he pushed the plate of fries toward Logan. He looked at Parker with a quizzical look on his face before something clicked. With shock he looked down at himself, seeing his newly enlarged muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell kid!\" Logan shouted, earning several stares from other diner patrons. \"What did you do to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, I'm really sorry!\" Parker pleaded, although inwardly he just couldn't bring himself to be. \"I can't control it, it just happens!\" He lied smoothly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Son of a bitch!\" Logan slammed his fist down on the table, cracking the wooden top. \"Ah shit! You, sit here, and don't move. Don't touch anything, or grow anyone else!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAppetite forgotten, Logan got up from the booth. He stood for a moment, disoriented with his new size, before he stumbled slightly towards the restrooms, his clothes creaking and straining with every step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatrick let out a sigh of relief and slumped in his seat. The way Logan had looked at him, he was fairly sure he had never been more scared or more turned on in his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;~&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck me.\" Logan muttered as he checked himself out in the floor length mirror on the door of the one person restroom. The kid had made him fucking huge! He looked like a damn bodybuilder. Logan slowly felt himself with his hands, running them along his biceps, over his cannonball like shoulders, down and across his pecs, that looked like someone had stuck two pillows under his skin, and felt his ripped abs through his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis jeans were fairing no better, in fact now that he thought about it, they fucking hurt! It felt like his legs were in a vice, looked like it too. His tree trunk legs looked painted into his blue jeans, there wasn't room for so much as a dollar bill in there. He was also a fair bit taller too so his once long pants now stopped a few inches above his ankles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs carefully has he could, Logan pealed off his ruined flannel shirt and white tank top, which now stopped a good two inches from his pants, leaving him impressively bare chested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit kid.\" He muttered as he flexed his arms, admiring the curl of his biceps. He bounced his pecs experimentally, enjoying the weight of them in spite of himself. He turned and checked out his ass, which had grown into a bubble butt that would make even a republican hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, a tight pain shot through his crotch, almost making him cry out. In his examination of his muscles, he'd over looked what Parker's touch had done to his cock. Logan had always been fairly \"well hung\" by most standards. Certainly his occasional bedfellows had never complained. In fact he normally found his jeans to be somewhat constricting in that regard. But now, as he looked, he wasn't just well hung, he was fucking gifted! It looked like a tube of fucking salami was fighting it's way down his right leg, with what appeared to be some very healthy oranges above it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis fingers actually trembled a little as he unhooked his belt and worked to slide his pants over his massive legs until he managed to kick his pants and his shoes off, leaving him stark naked except for a pair of ridiculously small briefs that weren't covering anything. Logan made quick work of them, not even taking the time to take them off, instead ripping them off with breathtaking ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFree from its fabric prison, his hardening cock sprung and bounced up, almost hitting his rock hard 8 pack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck, I look hot.\" Logan smirked as he gripped his new equipment with his larger hand. He was surprised how thick it was, even with his bigger hands he could barely one hand all the way around it. Hard as a steel girder now, Logan estimated he was at least 14 inches long. 14 fucking inches!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a grunt, Logan slowly began jacking himself with one hand, caressing his pecs with the other. This was so hot, so fucking hot! He'd probably have to put on an angry show when he came out, but right now he was positively ecstatic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe picked up the pace now, breathing heavily as he traced his diamond cut abs with his finger. \"Oh yeah, oh yeah, come on.\" He panted, feeling the orgasm building him his new, orange sized balls. His vision blurred around the edges and he realized he'd need to bite down on something to keep from roaring when he came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly yanked a handful of paper towels from the dispenser, probably breaking it in the process, and clamped down hard on them as the most powerful orgasm of his life rocketed through him, coating the door back mirror in gooey white.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took the towels out of his mouth and used it to wipe away as much of the goo as possible, his enormous chest heaving up and down as he panted heavily, his cock still hard against his abs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck yeah.\" Logan smirked as he through the cum soaked towels into the toilet. He was about to flush when he heard a knock on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Logan, are you ok in there?\" He heard Parker ask. Right away, he knew he had two choices.</span></div></div>",

Logan immediately got horny again with his 14 nch rising up to his abs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAye bub, you did this, now you gotta help me with this huge thing\u201d said Logan. Peter immediatey took off his clothes and got on his knees. Logan took his tight clothes off and got ready for what was to come. Logan suddenly got a huge rush of his beast side, but Logan didn\u2019t go alonng with what he wanted to do, so he took it slowly.. Peter slowly kissed Logan\u2019s thick neck to his huge biceps and hairy, thick, musky armpits. Peter went to Logan\u2019s Pex and started sucking on them and worshipping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan grew rapid breaths of intensity from Peter\u2019s worshipping. \u201cI love your huge meaty pecs\u201d said Peter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI fucking bet you do\u201d said Logan. Peter went down to Logan\u2019s hairy 8 pack abs. Logan started to get even hornier and Logan said deeply \u201cPeter, suck this huge ass cock.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter started sucking on the head, but Logan couldn\u2019t hold back his beast side, so Logan threw Peter on the floor and started forcing his huge cock into his small mouth. Peter was choking on his huge dick, but Logan didn\u2019t care. Logan came huge loads that could fill a milk gallon. Load after load until Peter\u2019s stomach was big as a ball from all that cum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAch ach, Logan.. ugh, please my throat hurts and look at my stomach!\u201d Said Peter. Logan didn\u2019t care and Logan turned Peter on his stomach and shoved all 18 inches into his ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAHHH AHHH, UGH, YOUR HURTING ME!\u201d Peter said in pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t give a fuck, if it does. You did this and i\u2019m horny as hell. You are gonna take it all!\u201d Logan said heavilly. Logan continued to fuck Peter faster and harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter started to cry from the pain and begged Logan to stop. Logan didn\u2019t care and continued to fuck him. Logan came so many times that he had lost count. Logan finally got tired after at least an hour. Peter was on the floor with cum leaking out of his ass and cum all over Peter\u2019s face. Peter could barely speak or get up, but for some reason he wanted more. Logan was laying down sweating and heaving from the intense sex. The sweat made his chest and body hair wet and his musky smells grew muskier and got Logan hard again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAye Peter, I want you to grow me even bigger and harier than I am now\u201d Logan said deeply. Peter was very confused on why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do you want to be bigger, you\u2019re so huge already\u201d said Peter. Logan got fustrated with the kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen bub, I want to be even bigger and hairier. Do it now or i\u2019ll fuck you again, but even harder\u201d Logan said angirly. Peter decided to obey Logan\u2019s wishes in fear of being fucked again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter touched Logan\u2019s face and Logan got a tingle in his body. Logan growled in pain and fell to the floor. Logan\u2019s jaw became more pronounced and his beard grew thicker. Logan\u2019 no longer had just sideburns, he had a full beard. Logan\u2019s neck grew even thicker and veins started to become more pronounce. Logan couldn\u2019t help but grunt because he was in a lot of pain. His shoulders started to widen even more and his his biceps and forearms grew bigger and harier. Logan\u2019s back widened and was very muscular. Logan was getting so hairy, he could be a fucking werewolf. Logan\u2019s huge biceps grew even bigger, that they looked at least 36 inches. His pecs grew bigger and his nipples grew bigger too. His pecs reached was almost towards his chin and they got hairy. His abs got harder and grew a 10 pack. Logan\u2019s tree trunk legs, grew fucking bigger, that he had to open his legs up more. His hip windend so he could walk with his huge muscle legs. His calfs grew to be as big as basketballs. His hands feet grew bigger and his feet were at least a size 18 and his hands were as big as hulks. His cock went from 14 inches to 26 inches and at least 7 inches thick. Logan fell to the floor in pain as his balls, doubled in size. They were the size of a really huge cantelopes.He looked like a short body builder. He was 6\u20193.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPeter.. make me taller NOW!\u201d Said Logan tiresly. Logan went from 6\u20193 to 7\u20192. Logan looked like a muscle god and it turned peter on. Logan\u2019s was hairy like a werewolf and his veins looked so thick and pronounced. Logan jacked off and cummed at least 40 times. His cum sprayed all over the walls and covered the mirror and toilet with cum. Logan got covered with cum along with Peter. Peter\u2019s huge stomach went away because of his high metabolism.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan walked out of the restroom along with Peter. Peter looked in shocked to see a huge naked muscle man covered in cum with a twink boy. Logan got in the car where he couldn\u2019t fit, so he ripped the roof off and Peter got in the car. They drove off to see Professor X</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As great as it was to experience all of this, Logan wasn't the type to give in so easily. Even if he ends up liking something in the end. Outside, Parker waits patiently by the bathroom door. In a matter of minutes, the door clicks and Logan shows himself outside. Parker wanted to apologize once again but before he could, he was immediately entranced by the now-burly figure. His chiseled features, broad shoulders and his heaving, thick chest were enough to make the boy bite his tongue. Not to mention his clothing was pretty tattered up from the scuffle, and added muscle. The larger mutant then taps Parker on the head with his meaty fist, not realizing it was harder than expected as the smaller mutant holds head in his palms from the pain. Logan was sure good at keeping his angered complexion too. \"Oh. Sorry kid. You did kind of deserve it though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah...\", Parker grunts. \"Yeah, I know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on. Let's go before you make me cause any more trouble.\" With that, the two get back to the car and take their leave. On the road though, Logan was already having a tough time adjusting his muscular physique to the seat. As well as not trying to break the stick or pedals while he drives. \"Shit. Will these muscles ever go away?\" This was also going to be more of a question for himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker slouches a bit, \"On their own? ...No.\" He slowly reaches out to Logan's arm, \"I can easily return them to normal on my own if you want though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold up!\", Logan roared. \"Not while I'm driving, dumbass!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker jumps back to his seat. \"R-right, my bad!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersonally, it was a sigh of relief for Logan. Not only was it dangerous, but he wouldn't want to lose all of his added beef so soon. Surely he can entice the boy not to do so in the meantime. \"But here's another question, are you able to change other parts of the body other than just muscles?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. I can also change someone's organs, their bones, their teeth... Basically I can perform surgery only, without the actual surgery.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Perfect.', Logan thought to himself. Maybe there's something else this kid could make help him with. There was one thing people have teased him for in the past, and it was his height. Maybe Parker could help him with this small, personal dilemma. It wasn't long before they reached the school too. \"Alright kid, we're here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker takes a quick glimpse at the X-Men building. It's sure big, but the bigger thing racing through his head right now was the overgrown superhero sitting next to him. \"This place looks nice. It's really big too. So, you want I take care of those-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah. Don't worry about it. After taking some time to think about it, I think I can get used to all this added bulk.\", Logan remarks calmly, watching as he bounces his firm pecs a bit. Parker wasn't dumb though. He could tell Logan was liking what he did to him. \"But while we're on the topic, you think you can do one more thing for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sure. Anything.\", the boy slurs with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Parker could help with his size, he'd be all set. For now. \"Think you can use your powers to make me a little taller?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker's grins in return, \"Yeah of course! I'd be happy to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, <b>taller</b>. Don't mess with my muscles, don't fuck around with my organs, just a few more inches in height. And if you try to pull a stunt like the one from this morning...\", Logan unsheathes one of his claws, the tip pointed right in Parker's face, \"...I will kill you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing Logan and his attitude, Parker believed he would too. \"Uh...alright.\", he gulps. The boy then grips Logan's arm firmly with both his hands. It was quite nice finally getting to feel Logan's bulging, hairy arm, as well as witnessing Logan's rugged body start elongating all over. Logan's muscles remained the same but they were stretching out nicely to accommodate his growing bones. The sound of the growing mutant's clothes ripping further causes Parker to halt his powers. \"U-uh, how's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe expression on Logan's face shows he was very impressed with his added growth. He shifts his seat all the way back in response to see just what he was dealing with. With the added six inches in height, his head was nearly touching the roof his car now. All of his clothes were ready to burst too, even though his flannel and jeans weren't buttoned. His muscles were adjusted so they were more lengthened with his taller, beastly bodybuilder self. Logan slips off his tattered flannel, which didn't even cover the lower two rows of his diamond-cut abs. \"Heh, not bad.\", he grins, looking down at his half-naked, herculean body. He stretches out his right arm and flexes it up and down while taking note of his large 24-inch bicep as it rises to full peak and then drops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan looks down at his hulk-like legs, being that his jeans now rose up to his immense calves. His thighs and hamstrings were so massive he could probably tear those jeans to shreds if he were to flex his leg muscles hard enough. He decides to do something else, only ripping off the lower half of his jeans above the knees so it looked like he was wearing ripped jean shorts. \"Yeah, now we're talkin'.\", he smirks, hardening his thick calf while caressing it in one meaty palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker's face was already a rosy red. \"Y-yeah, uh...pretty impressed huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit, you still here? Almost didn't notice. So what the hell you waiting for? The Professor's expecting you inside.\" He could tell by he look on Parker's face that the boy was interested in getting a piece of that action. Logan sighs, \"Look kid, I'll make it up to ya later. You're already late for you meeting with Professor Xavier. I promise, you'll get to feel these soon enough.\", Logan grins, lifting and flexing both his sinewy arms in a double-bicep pose. \"Now, go on, get going.\" Parker nods his head and then steps out of the vehicle. \"Hey, one more thing. If anyone asks, I've been going through a really tough workout. They'll believe it. Nothing against you, I just have a reputation to uphold.\", he winks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker nods once again and then takes off. Logan speeds off to a close but secluded location where he knew no one would be around.</span></div></div>",

After recovering for a second, he noticed that this beast was actually dressed in a black suit like a businessman or something, but instead of wearing leather shoes the beast went barefoot, and for good reason. Emerging from the bottom of his pants were two large, <i>blue furred paws.</i> The same went for his hands, and most importantly the face was completely covered with blue fur as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Parker remembered seeing this blue furred beast...of course! It was the X-Men known as Beast! He had appeared several times on TV and the newspaper. \"Oh i am so sorry, I didn't mean to, I mean,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright, I get that a lot.\" Beast chuckled. \"I suppose introductions are in order. My name is Hank McCoy, I am a professor at Xavier Institute for Higher Learning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Parker.\" He said, still trying to no stare at the blue fur so much, but it was hard since it was all over Hank's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I know.\" He smiled...a big, toothy smile...\"I'm here to escort you to the school. Are your parents around?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker shook his head. \"No, they...well, they didn't take the news about me being a mutant very well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah I see...\" Beast gave him a sympathetic look. \"Well then, I am sure they will come around eventually. Now then, is that all your belongings?\" He pointed at the suitcases next to the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, they are.\" Parker nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well then, we might as well get started, it's a very long drive to the school after all.\" Beast walked over to the luggage. Parker was about to help him since there were pretty big and heavy, but Beast simply placed his hands under them and lifted both of them easily. Parker couldn't help but stare some more at this display of strength, maveling at how the suit stretched across those big beefy arms as they effortlessly carried his luggage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that all of them?\" Beast asked, still holding the suitcases in the air like they were full of feathers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNumbly Parker nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Splendid. Now let's be off then!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker followed Beast out to the car, watching that broad back as he moved. In the back of his mind Parker was in awe of the strength this man had...and wondered what he would be like if he were a bit bigger!</span></div></div>",

Maybe it was because of his power or whatever, but he had a thing for large muscular guys, and seeing Beast lift those heavy suitcases stirred something in him. However, he managed to restain himself and didn't use his power on Beast. Even though he seemed like a nice enough person, Parker didn't want to see what he looked like if a 10 foot tall blue furred muscle beast got angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after what seemed like an eternity, they arrived at the institute. Immediately Parker was overwhelmed as they drove through the large iron gates and into the driveway of a front lawn that was as big as a park.After a few more additional minutes they reached the main building, and Parker was impressed right away by the size and look of it. It looked like one of the most expensive prep schools Parker had ever seen, certainly leaps and bounds above overcrowded public classrooms and tacky posters everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to your new school Parker.\" Beast said as Parker got out of the car. \"Now that we have arrived, there are some things that need to be taken care of.\"</span></div></div>",

Beast's shirt and pants starts to rip from his body as he slowly grew. Parker was still taking in the view of his new home, when all of a sudden, \"Uh... Parker, you can get off of me\" he heard coming from Beast as he constantly grew bigger and more muscular. When Parker turned around to look at Beast he was surprised to find out that the big, blue, hairy guy that picked him up was even bigger than before, he looked down and saw his hand placed on the man's thigh, Parker took his hands off of Beast and he felt relief as he stopped getting bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sorry about that... Usually people don't grow when I touch them...

Before Parker opened the car door, he felt Beast's hand on his shoulder, \"What is it?\" Parker asked as he turned around. \"You know, your powers... I suggest you try to wear something to prevent skin-to-skin contact, unless you want fifty foot tall mutants running around this place\" Beast explained as he opened and took of his pants. The muscular blue, furry man was all down to his underwear, Parker was alone with a guy in tidy whities, his heart pounded more, he started to sweat and all he could do was reach up to...</span></div></div>",

He concentrated his powers and then lunged for Beast's package. At first Beast was surprised and shocked but when Parker's ability began to take effect Hank couldn't refuse his magic touch. Before Parker realized it he had grown Beast's dick so big that it had begun to spill out of his underwear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeast gained a second of awareness and drove away from the school where they wouldn't be noticed. When he finally parked he sat back in his chair and let the growth take effect. Parker knew Beast was his now and he had to use the full extent of his power to make sure he could make Beast as big as possible. Parker rubbed his hands together to get the power flowing again and placed his hands on Beast's furry blue chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he made contact Beast began to grow quickly with new muscle. His pecs jutted out farther and farther, becoming a barrel chest that would make Juggernaut feel inferior. His abs were becoming a defined 8 pack and Beast kept rubbing his now flat stomach feeling the smooth ab muscles. While he did this he noticed his arms had grown bigger than any mutant he had ever heard of. They were at least 35 inches around by his calculations but as another wave of growth pulsed through him he lost and brain function he had and now just moaned in pleasure. His legs were growing thicker and his ass was swelling larger forcing him higher up in the seat until he was squished against the ceiling of the car and the seat. His dick as rock hard and if it grew any more he would put a hole in the windshield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker didn't notice that it was getting tight for Beast and kept the growth coming. He sent another wave, all of it directly to his dick and with that he couldn't hold it in any more and Beast roared like a wild animal as he blew his spunk all over the interior of the car, covering everything, including Parker, with his seed. As Parker started to rub the white goo off of him Beast began to get a hold of himself and realized what had just happened. Parker waited for the worst when all of a sudden...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The massive Beast reached over to Parker's side of the car, squishing him into his seat as Beast's giant, thick arm looked around for the glove compartment. Parker could help but rub Beast's arm, causing him to grow a foot taller and everything more muscular, pushing Parker further into the seat.<br>\r\nBeast pulled out an old flip phone, calling a number on speed dial. \"Uh, hey. I have a code 8845. We'll be late.\" He spoke to the person on the other line in a deep baritone. Parker couldn't help but stare at Beast's heaving pectorals and smelling his strong musk. Beast hung up the phone and put it back into the glove box.<br>\r\n\"8845? What is that?\" Parker asked Beast. \"It means that one of has transformed.\" He replied,  looking at Parker with a smirk on his face. He reached for Parker's hands. \"Can you do it again?\" Beast asked as he rested his massive hand on Parker's lap. Parker smiled back to Beast and gave a slight nod off approval.<br>\r\nParker rubbed his hands together and started to massage Beast everywhere. It was all that Beast could do but moan loudly as he expanded in every direction. Taller and taller and more muscular then he had ever dreamed, the car was like a pair of skinny jeans that were a size too small for Beast, and it was starting to become quite compacted for Parker as the Bohemian\u200b next to him swelled and grew.<br>\r\nBeast was bending over himself as the roof of the car prohibited him to stand upright\u200b. Beast moaned loudly as his dick elongated in both length and girth.<br>\r\nHe moved his arm over to window on the passenger side just above Parker as another wave of growth introduced itself to Beast. Parker couldn't help himself, he sniffed Beast's armpit, the musk overwhelming. Parker and Beast could agree on one thing that very moment; they wanted Beast bigger. Much, much MUCH bigger. Parker didn't care that there was only a small little space in the front. He wanted it BADLY and NOW. Parker reached over the massive Beast and pooped the seat down, allowing Beast more room to grow inside before he had to grow outside. Parker grabbed the redwood-trunk sized arm of Beast and continued to inhaled the giant's musk. He then started to lick it, the sensation apparently being highly erotic to Beast as his meat started to become stiff.<br>\r\nParker moved into Beast's upper abdomen and massaged his chest, causing him to grow taller and his chest widen with pure muscle. Parker slapped his face into them, licking the slabs, causing more growth all over. Parker started to suck on Beast's\u200bnipple, making Beast's already hard dick even harder, and causing less room in the car. \"<b>More.More. MORE! </b>\" Beast hollered in ecstasy. Parker willingly obliged and started to lick, kiss and rub Beast's gargantuan neck muscle. It nearly doubled in size as Beast's head pushed back to the 3rd row of seats and his feet pushed onto the windshield.<br>\r\nParker set to work on the monstrously\u200b sized avenger in the car. Parker licked each individual abdominal muscle first. As Beast continued to push on all sides of the car, Parker outlined the crevices of his stomach. The massive penis swelled, pushing up against the roof of the vehicle.<br>\r\nParker then went down to Beast's goliath legs. His quads were fighting for space on each thigh. Each piece of muscle bulging out with veins visible. Parker licked and massaged them, growing them and Beast. A large drop of pre fell onto Parker as he was working on Beast like a piece of clay. Parker kneaded Beast's brobdingnagian legs, causing the muscles of his quadriceps to fight for what little room was left. Beast's ass had grown with so much muscle, it swelled and plumped up so much that it far exceeded the term \"bubble butt\". No, this ass required a new term to be made, maybe helium balloon butt or something, but Beast's elephantine ass would give anyone, even Kim Kardashian, a run for their money.<br>\r\nParker continued his muscle worship and growth of Beast to his calves where he rubbed, massaged, licked and kissed those indefatigable, inured calves of his, pumping them up with more muscle, along with the rest of his body. His titanic penis stretched\u200b out another inch, dropping a hefty amount of pre onto Beast himself and onto Parker. Parker licked off the semi transparent liquid off of him.<br>\r\nBeast cried out in ecstasy as Parker got to his extensive, extravagant feet. The already impressively\u200b massive feet could be larger Parker decided to himself. He was able to massage the blue avenger's feet, making them amplify in size.<br>\r\nBeast's beefy, muscular arms that were being propped up on the car doors, broke through the windows. His gargantuan feet finally crashed through the window shield. The tires couldn't withstand the newfound weight in the car and pooped at once. The sudden jolt from the tires bursting caused Parker to slam into Beast's meat. All five feet of it, causing Beast to expand and for his now 6 foot tower to break through the roof.<br>\r\nIt was all that Beast could do to laugh. His planetarium pecs bouncing, his neck muscles to flex and massive, gargantuan balls to move up and down. The Earth quake like shaking from Beast's laugh caused the the of the car to break. The 24 foot blue avenger and 5 foot mutant laid there on the ground, surrounded by car wreckage.<br>\r\nBeast got sat up and looked down at his newly grown body and chuckled some more.<br>\r\n\"Wow kid. You certainly outdid yourself,\" Beast told Parker. He stood up to, by his amazement, saw the university from the mile of Evergreens. He then proceeded to sit down and flex his arms.<br>\r\n\"I mean, people thought I was muscular and tall before. But now, NOW. Look at me. I'd like to see any villain try to take me down. HA! They wouldn't even think of coming near me.\" Best looked over at Parker, who was in a daze, still wanting to play with his new piece of clay. He knew that men loved growing bigger. The feeling of dominance and having the physical advantages, it would drive them into a power craze. Luckily, they would want to take back the advantages as soon as they realized they couldn't fit through the doors at school. But, Beast was different. He didn't care if he couldn't fit. They'd just adjust the doors, problem solved. Parker knew that he had the blue furred avenger wrapped around his finger. He just had to play it out to make Beast think he's in control of this, that's all.</span></div></div>",

It was unmistakable, as he was wearing his famous red and blue skintight suit. Parker tried not to ogle him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShhh!\u201d Peter hissed. \u201cYes it\u2019s me, but you don\u2019t need to announce that to the whole neighborhood!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker cringed on the inside. Not the best first impression he could give. \u201cDo you want to come inside I guess?\u201d he awkwardly proposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter looked appreciative of the offer. \u201cI don\u2019t see why not. We don\u2019t have to leave for the Academy immediately.\u201d He stepped through the doorway around Parker, taking in the room around him. \u201cThanks,\u201d he added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem,\u201d Parker spluttered, closing the door behind him. He wasn\u2019t quite sure what to say. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you ran errands for the X-Men,\u201d he ventured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter chuckled. \u201cWell this isn\u2019t exactly usual. The only reason I\u2019m here is because they\u2019re in some big conflict with another group of mutants right now. The Brotherhood, I think.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker had been warned about them by the Academy when he was contacted, but so far they hadn\u2019t showed up. He supposed that was good. \u201cDoes that happen a lot?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter snorted. \u201cWaaay too often,\u201d he complained. They were both still standing around awkwardly in Parker\u2019s front room. It was quite a sight. A (mostly) normal teenage boy and a spandex-clad superhero. This was definitely turning out to be an odd day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker gestured awkwardly. \u201cWould you like to go sit down in the kitchen?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, thanks!\u201d Peter smiled. \u201cI\u2019ve been traveling most of the day to get here, so I appreciate it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys entered Parker\u2019s kitchen, and Peter quickly sat down at a table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you like a glass of water or anything?\u201d Parker asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWater would be fine,\u201d Peter responded. \u201cI\u2019m parched.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kitchen was silent as Parker went about pouring glasses of water for Peter and himself. He set the glasses down at the table and sat down across from Peter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter attempted to break the ice. \u201cSo uh, what\u2019s your power? Nobody actually told me.\u201d He looked across the table at Parker as he sipped his water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh uhhh...\u201d Parker blushed, a little embarrassed. \u201cI can uh... make people grow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter arched an eyebrow. \u201cWhat do you mean, grow? Like make people taller?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMainly muscles,\u201d Parker explained. \u201cPlus a few other things...\u201d He trailed off, not wanting to elaborate on those, as they were rather... unsavory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter seemed to take the hint. \u201cWell that\u2019s kind of cool,\u201d he responded. \u201cUnique, but cool. You\u2019re going to the right kind of place to learn how to use that. Man, I wish I had been able to go to that Academy when I first got my powers. Would have made things sooo much easier....\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe talked on, but Parker wasn\u2019t listening. He was focused on Peter, mainly his body. Spider-Man was a rare superhero who was actually fairly slim. No heroic build. But Parker could see that he was still fairly athletic, as his full-body spandex didn\u2019t hide much. He was actually pretty hot. Parker knew that he should keep a hold on his powers, but the opportunity was tempting...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The power to make a guy\u2019s dick grow was cool but not the power that Parker was most... proud of. But, it could be fun from time to time. He fondly remembered the time that he grabbed a jock\u2019s bulge at school and made it so big it wouldn\u2019t fit in a speedo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now, he had a superhero in front of him. A superhero that was fairly distracted by his stories of trying to learn how to control his powers when he first got them. So against his better judgement, Peter slowly reached under the table (which thankfully wasn\u2019t very long), and firmly grabbed Peter\u2019s cock through his thin spandex outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo next thing I knew, I was stuck to the ceilingooooOOOAAAH!\u201d Peter half moaned-half yelled as Parker\u2019s grab caught him by surprise. \u201cWhat the fuck are you doingooohhh...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter moaned and Parker grinned as the hero\u2019s formerly average-sized cock swelled under Parker\u2019s firm grasp. God, this was hot. Parker was becoming quite turned on by the spectacle. Peter was sitting before him, his eyes rolling in pleasure as he pawed half-heartedly at Parker\u2019s hand, which encircled his spandex-clad dick and balls. Under the table, Parker could feel Peter\u2019s cock swelling longer and fatter as he worked his power on the paralyzed hero. With every pulse of growth that wracked Peter\u2019s dick, Parker could also feel his balls swelling accordingly, becoming increasingly prominent in the red and blue spandex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker was shaken from his thoughts by a moment of clarity on Peter\u2019s part. He felt the Avenger\u2019s hand close on his, trying to pull it off his still-growing tool. \u201cLet me fucking go!\u201d he growled as the sound of stretching spandex sounded through the kitchen. Parker resisted, sending another strong wave of growth through Peter\u2019s weapon-sized member, which ballooned again, becoming increasingly constricted in his skintight suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNoo!\u201d Peter yelled, not willing to let his pleasurable torment go on any longer. He nimbly kicked Parker\u2019s hand off his dick and immediately shot two webs, pinning the horny teen\u2019s hands to the wall behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShocked, Peter stood up, finally revealing the extent of Parker\u2019s growth spree. Both boys\u2019 mouths widened as they took in the heavy, prominent, 8.5-inch log that now occupied Peter\u2019s costume. It was long and incredibly thick, topped by two balls the size of large eggs. The huge equipment hung down the inside of Peter\u2019s thigh, confirming Parker\u2019s suspicion that Spider-Man went commando.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter pointed his finger in shock and anger at the wide-eyed Parker, still pinned to the wall. \u201cWhat the FUCK did you do to me!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker was horrified (and a little turned on) by what he had done. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry!\u201d he apologized. \u201cI got a little carried away!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCarried AWAY!?\u201d Peter yelled cupping his monster cock. \u201cNormal people don\u2019t just go around grabbing dicks, and they definitely don\u2019t make them twice as big as they used to be!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry!\u201d Parker pleaded. \u201cI think it\u2019s a hormonal thing with my powers. It\u2019s hard to resist.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter sighed, releasing his package, which hung down to its full, glorious length. \u201cCan you undo it?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker turned red. \u201cNo.... I haven\u2019t learned how to yet,\u201d he answered quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter sighed in resignation, glancing down at the massive cock and balls which would apparently be his companions for a while. \u201cWell, put that on your list of things to learn at the Academy then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I will. I\u2019m really sorry about that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter quietly chuckled. \u201cI\u2019ve had worse. At least I don\u2019t have six arms again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker shifted uncomfortably in his seat. \u201cWould you mind?\u201d he asked, gesturing to his still-stuck hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah!\u201d Peter begrudgingly apologized. \u201cSorry about that. Bit of an instinctive reaction. It may have been a little warranted though, so keep your hands to yourself from now on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe finished pulling the webbing off a grateful Parker, then looked over at a nearby clock, which read \u201c10:30 PM.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn, it\u2019s already pretty late,\u201d Peter sighed. \u201cI know this is a lot to ask, but do you have a guest room I could spend the night in? It\u2019s a bit late to start out right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, yeah,\u201d Parker replied. \u201cThere\u2019s one at the end of the hall. No biggie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter smiled. \u201cThanks, I appreciate it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned to leave, obviously quite tired. Parker smiled as he went, getting a long eyeful of Peter\u2019s new monster package. Jesus it was huge. He may have overdone it. That thing looked heavy. Well, at least he could distract enemies with it or something like that. Maybe that would justify it a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis day was definitely not going how he expected it to.</span></div></div>",

Parker immediately recognized the distinct figure - it was Rocket Raccoon, one of the Guardians of the Galaxy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon kid, we don't got all day.\" Before Parker could even say anything, Rocket had already turned around, starting to trot his way back to the limo that was parked in front of Parker's house (quite fancy, he noted...). Parker realized that this hero wasn't going to be helping him with his bags... which was somewhat understandable, considering some of them were a good deal bigger than him. That gave Parker the seed of an idea, though...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly picking up his bags, the boy ran to catch up with Rocket, managing to do so quite easily. \"So, um... if I'm going to live with the X-Men... why are you here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked, Rocket looked up at the kid, eyeballing his form and taking in all the info he could gather. \"All the guys at the institute are busy - as usual - and apparently I owe the ol' Professor a favor. So he asked me to come pick you up and make sure you stayed safe till you got there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRocket jogged ahead of him, clicking open the trunk and stepping aside, gesturing for Parker to put his bags in. Parker complied, stepping forwards and starting to load the car up, but thoughts were swimming through his mind. Rocket was probably tired of being the short, scrawny one of the group... and to be honest, despite his dismissiveness, he didn't seem like that bad of a guy. Besides, it would be interesting to see what a little raccoon like him would look like packed to the brim with powerful muscle...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mind picking up the pace a bit? They want you at the Institute by 4.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker tossed his last bag into the car and turned to Rocket. He had already made his decision... and he was DYING to at least try it out. Moving too quickly for the alien raccoon to react, Parker reached out, grasping Rocket by the sides and focusing on his powers.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once Parker had figured that enough time had passed he opened and eyes and was quite surprised at what he saw. There now standing right in front of him was Rocket Raccoon, but the only difference was that all of his muscles were about the size of a pro bodybuilder. Two large and heavily muscled arms and forearms where on both sides of the anthro like raccoon. Along with this the young man could easily make out two large and firm looking pectoral muscles that were causing Rocket's vest to look like it was just painted on his body. In fact Parker could easily see both of the nipples on the raccoon's chest since it most of it was now outside of the clothing. Below that Parker could clearly see a thick and well defined sixpack that led down to his pants that also looked like they were just painted on his legs due the amount of muscle that was added to each of them. But when he looked in between the raccoon's large thighs he found himself blushing upon seeing that his bugle had grown as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man soon found himself looking back at Rocket's face only to see a very displeased look on the Guardian's furry face as he nearly shouted, \"Uh, kid? WHAT THE HECK DID YOU DO TO ME?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this prompted the brown haired young man to lower his head as he confessed, \"I'm so sorry Rocket. I thought that maybe you were sick and tired of the being the smallest member in the Guardians. And so I not only made your muscles bigger, but I tried to make you taller too. Although I guess that didn't work......\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think?!\" Rocket snapped, while his large chest began to raise and fall. After a few seconds had passed though Parker was surprised/relieved when he heard the alien raccoon let out a heavy sigh before he added, \"But then again I gues that's why the Professor wants me to take you to the school. BUT once you do get full control of your powers I want you to do something for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, what is it?\" Parker asked, curiosity now getting the better of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again the young man found himself blushing when he saw Rocket begin to flex the various muscles on his body while he told him, \"Once you get full control of your powers I want to you.....\"</span></div></div>",

While he did this though Parker could not help, but blush a little when he heard Rocket's now deeper voice as he asked, \"H-Hey kid, I don't know what you're doing? B-But could you cut it out for a minute. I-I need to say something.\" The young man didn't reply or stop using his powers at first. But after a few more seconds had passed he did move his hands away from Rocket's body when the alien raccoon added in a louder tune in his voice, \"Kid, seriously I need you to STOP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I-I'm so sorry Rocket. I just thought that maybe you were sick of being the smallest member of your group. I hope you aren't too mad at me.\" Parker apologized, while he opened his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he did this though the young man let out a loud gasp when he opened his eyes and saw that he was staring right at Rocket's......</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>All Parker could see in his line of vision were two very large and muscled white furred pectorals. He then found himself blushing as he looked down and saw that the anthro like raccoon now had an eight pack. In fact each slab of muscle looked like it could cut diamonds. When he looked even lower the young man's blush became even an even darker shade of red when he saw Rocket's large balls and sheathe that had also grown along with the rest of body. Speaking of which Parker found himself leaning forward to get a better look at Rocket's butt. And not to the human's surprise he saw that it had also grown and seem very firm, and his tail had also gotten longer and seemed a little thicker as well. Parker quickly looked away from that area and saw that Rocket's legs were also very large and muscled just like what the rest of body was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey kid, would you please stop staring at my body like that.\" Rocket commented, wich caused the young man to look upward at Rocket's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoing so caused the young man to let out a sigh of relief when he saw that the Guardian's head also grow with the rest of him. Parker took note of how the raccoon's face seemed bit more defined, perhaps even handsome like. The brown eyed young man also saw the raccoon's thick and muscled neck along with his huge shoulders and arms And before he knew it Rocket turned from left to right to make sure no one was around the area which gave the human a good view of his large and wide back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he had turned back around Parker closed his eyes and lowered his head as he told Rocket, \"Like I was about to say earlier. I am so sorry for using my powers on you, Rocket. I guess I was ust really curious to see what you would look like with huge muscles along with being taller. And plus I thought maybe you were sick and tired of being called the short one of the Guardians of the Galaxy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute of silence had passed the young human felt one of Rocket's large hands place itself on his right shoulder before he replied, \"Look I won't lie to you, kid. I do not like it when people just grab me out of nowhere like that. However, I have to admit that what you did might not be so bad.,\" Hearing this prompted the young man to look up and into the raccoon's red eyes while he added, \"So I guess we're going to be going to see the Professor a little later then what he wanted us to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um ok. But why are you telling me this?\" Parker asked, as he turned his head to the side in slight confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he had said this the young man felt that same hand of Rocket's move itself off of his shoulder before it cupped his chin and moved his head back to being straight when he responded back with, \"Well, if you must know. I'm teeling you this because I feel I need to....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Parker nodded his head in understanding after Rocket had told him that. Of course that was obvious to the young man since he knew taht the anthro raccoon wouldn't want to be naked upon not only taking him to the academy, But he would obviously want to be fully clothed when he met back up with the other Guardians. But while Parker got into the limo he couldn't help but be a little excited since he found himself staring at the raccoon's large and muscled body before he heard Rocket tell the driver that they were making a pit stop before heading to the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe former normal human looked at the guardian in slight confusion before he saw Rocket's red eyes look over at him as he remarked, \"What? I told you that I had to get some new clothes before going there?\" A grin formed on his face though as he pointed a finger at him and added, \"Although I guess it'd be best to say that YOU'LL be getting me my new clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. But, how can I do that without touching people therefore using my powers unintentionally?\" The young man asked, before he saw Rocket move to a small glove like compartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd once he did this the size changing gifted mutate saw it open up revealing a pair of gloves and some scissors. But when Rocket offered Parker the items he did his best not stare at the large forearm as the muscled anthro explained, \"Here, these gloves should conceal your powers. Or at least that's what they told me before sending me off to pick you up.\" He then surprisingly heard the large hero let out a chuckle before he added, \"But I guess it was my own fault for ignoring the Professor when he told me to give them to you when picking you up.\" Hearing this prompted the young man to look up at Rocket who was now during a double bicep flex while he finished with, \"Although to be honest I think I could get used to my new look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's great. But what are the scissors for?\" The brown eyed mutate asked, as the limp came to a stop into of a clothing store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh duh, isn't it obvious? I'll need you to cut a hole in the underwear and pants you get me for my tail.\" Rocket commented, while he crossed his arms over his chest. He then saw one of the raccoon's eyebrows go up while he continued with, \"But that reminds me. You got cash on you right, kid? Otherwise this trip is pretty worthless.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis comment prompted Parker to blush alittle bit as he muttered out, \"Of course...I knew that. And don't worry I'll buy the clothes since your \"new look\" is because of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he had gotten back into the limp Parker let out a sigh of relief as he handed the pair of pants and underwear to Rocket after he had cut the hole for his tail. He honestly didn't think Rocket wasn't going to make him do that....but since the scissors had been in his pocket earlier the young man somehow saw it coming. And while the anthro raccoon put on his new clothes Parker turned his head away to give him some privacy. But of course he looked from the corner of eye he mentally sighed with relief when he saw the triple X shirt he had gotten Rocket seemed to fit over his large muscled body....even if it did look a little tight on him. This was the same result for the underwear and pants as well, but from the looks of it Rocket didn't seem to mind. And by the looks of it, it seemed that picking out a sleeveless t-shirt was the best opinion as Rocket began to flex his arms again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as he did this the young man began to stare at him again before his voice broke him away when he asked, \"Hey kid, once you've gotten control over your powers can you do me a favor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um sure, Rocket. What's the favor?\" Parker asked, confusion clear in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his surprise he saw a wide grin had spread on Rocket's furry face as he told him, \"The favor is that I want you to make me even bigger. I'll even give you my I think Peter calls it a e-mail address. This way you can contact me as soon as you know that you can turn me back to normal size after our over with. Of course with that said I DON\"T want you to turn me back to my original size like when I came to pick you up, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this proposal caused a big smile to show on the young man's face while he replied with joy, \"Of course Rocket, I'd love to do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, I'm sure you will.\" Rocket commented, before the two soon realized that they had reached the academy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd once the car had came to stop Parker felt himself smiling from ear to ear. And how could he not since he wasn't only going to learn how to control his powers. But once he had done this then he and Rocket oculd go somewhere...most likely away from other people and really see what his powers could do. The only question that remained was how long would it take him to overcome this hurdle?</span></div></div>",

Of course the young man knew that it was only thanks to his Professors who took the time to help break certain things down so that it was easier for him to understand the material that he was learning. And of course just thinking about hanging out with Rocket Raccoon again was also added motivation since now he oculd actually touch him without warning about using his powers. To which he made sure to prove to the Guardian when Parker not only sent him an email letting him know that he could come back to Earth. But he also attached a short video clip to where the brown haired former human had placed his hand on follow student and after some time had passed without anything happening he figured that, that would be proof enough to the anthro like raccoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd to his surprise it must have been since he sent him a response the next day letting him know that he was on his way. Which of course led to where Parker was now which was outside of the Academy waiting for the Guardian to arrive. And after a bit more time had passed the brown eyed mutate to look up and see the Milano up in the sky before a hatch door opened up to reveal the buff anthro like raccoon who was sporting clothes that looked just his old attire only in a much larger size. Parker then saw him jump off of the ship before Rocket reached behind himself and pushed a button on his back which revealed a jet pack along with two joysticks which the young man figured acted as the main controls for it. And upon seeing Rocket land on the ground Parker couldn't help but find himself blushing upon noticing that the raccoon's larger attire seemed looked a little tight on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever he was quickly broken out of his thoughts when Rocket cleared his throat and said, \"Hey kid, quit staring at me. Besides you can do that while we have our \"fun\" together.\" After saying this Parker then saw him turn around and squat down towards the a little as he added, \"So hop onto my back so that we can to it already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, right.\" The brown haired mutate let out as he walked up to Rocket and got onto his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he did this Parker then found himself holding onto the anthro like raccoon's neck when he shot upwards in the sky. This caused the wain to blow rapidly against the young man until Rocket stopped and then moved straight ahead which was much more bearable. But while they soared through the sky he saw the Guardian turn his head to look back him when he told him, \"But you know I've got to be honest kid, I really wasn't expecting you to figure out how to control your powers so quickly. After seeing that little video clip you send me in your e-mail though I've got to admit that I was actually kind of impressive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well, thanks for saying that Rocket. Besides it helps that I had added motivation to figure it all out as soon as possible.\" Parker confessed, while a light blush formed on his face from Rocket's words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the size changing mutate's surprise he heard Rocket let out a chuckle when he remarked, \"Yeah I'm sure you did. But I'm going to tell you right now that before we get to using your powers I'm going to be taking off my clothes first alright? Besides I don't need another pair of clothes getting ruined.\" After he had uttered these words though Parker's mind began to think about Rocket being naked in front of him again which only caused his blush to deepen. However this didn't last long once the raccoon continued with, \"Hey kid, don't go daydreaming on me just yet since I haven't told you where we'll be having you use your powers at.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this prompted the young man to look away a little out of embarrassment as he responded back with, \"Oh right, sorry. A-Anyway though where we headed, Rocket?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon asking this question Parker saw a wide grin spread across Rocket's furry face while he replied, \"Well, as I'm sure you know we need to go to someplace where other people won't bother us while you use your powers. And I'm confident I found the perfect place to do that which is....</span></div></div>",

Which prompted him to smile quite gleefully since the young man figured that no one would notice them on an island. At least not unless Rocket told him to make him larger then the island itself. Although the size changing powered mutate couldn't help but kind of hope that it did end up leading to that since in the end he knew that he could shrink the Guardian back down to a more modest size if the anthro likie raccoon felt like things were getting out of hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, while Parker was thought in his own thoughts he had had failed to notice that Rocket had landed on the island in the middle of the ocean. The brown haired former human only realized this when he heard the well muscled raccoon clear his throat when he told him, \"Hey kid, we're here. So you can get off of my back now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right. Of course.\" Parker let out, as a light blush formed on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he had done this the brown eyed young man saw the red eyed raccon walk behind a big tree before he said, \"Now stay here while I get undressed.\" And once he had moved behind said tree Parker saw the raccoon pook his head out from behind it and point a finger at him as he added, \"But no peeking you got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this caused the mutate to nod his head before he saw a large grin spread across the Guardian's face before he moved behind the tree once more. Parker then heard the sound of clothes being removed along with seeing them being hung on lower branches of the tree. He then felt his blush return only it was much darker when he saw Rocket walk out from behind the tree completely naked with a cocky grin on his face. And as the anthro raccoon strutted towards him the young man began to wonder how he should handle growing Rocket. Should he make the growth slow so that both of them could enjoy Rocket's expanding body? Or should he just show the anthro raccoon what he really do and make him grow huge right away?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose two question were what Parker was thinking about as he saw Rocket flex various muscles once he was standing a few inches in front of him. Not only that but the brown haired former human also saw the raccoon's large balls and currently soft cock out in the open which prompted him to make a decision as Parker looked away from that part of his body and back up at his grinning face. Doing this caused him to decide that he would......</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Wow.\" Parker breathed as he took in Rocket's near-flawless musculature. \"You, uh, you look like you could put bodybuilders to shame.\" He mumbled out, as his blush deepened slightly at his admission of admiration of Rocket's body. Rocket's muzzle shifted into a cocky smirk as he raised a huge arm and flexed; the thick muscle swelling impressively, his chocolate brown fur distorting over the bulge of his bicep. \"Oh yeah, and I feel like I could put bodybuilders to shame!\" He chuckled before pausing. \"So, you like that kid? You like the sight of me towering over you, with muscles that most people could only dream of?\" He smirked, glancing down at his bulging 8-pack abdominals, the thick, tightly corded muscle set in a cobblestone-grid pattern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker's blush deepened even further as he averted his gaze. He swallowed around a suddenly dry throat as he managed to croak out a response. \"Uh, well, I mean, like...\" He stammered out as Rocket's smug grin only widened. \"Well, I suppose I have to admit that I am kind of jealous, yeah.\" He confessed, to which Rocket snickered before he threw back his head and let out a roar of laughter. The thunderous rumble of his deep bass easily rivaling the sound of a freight train as the sound waves buffeted against Parker's smaller frame, thanks to Rocket's substantially greater size and his much more powerful vocal cords. \"Yeah, I thought so! I mean, who wouldn't? I'm huge!\" He beamed down at him, his eyes seeming to almost sparkle with glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe colossal raccoon casually swaggered across the beach, his massive paws kicking up plumes of sand as he walked, his thick, bushy tail swaying above his firm, muscular rump. \"Come on, kid, let's see if we can't find somewhere nice and spacious!\" He chuckled with a sly, almost mischievous wink. Parker ran his tongue over his suddenly very dry lips that had nothing to do with the blazing tropical heat, following right behind him eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two continued their stroll along the beach, Parker moving slightly to Rocket's side to avoid the kick-up of sand and huge pawprints left in the warm, gorgeously coloured sand by the 7-foot tall Racoon's passage. It looked as if it could have been off the cover of a travel brochure. \"Alright, this spot looks roomy enough!\" Rocket cheerfully proclaimed, linking his fingers together and raising his arms above his head as he stretched out his entire muscular body. His biceps swelled to the sizes of small watermelons, the thick, solid muscle bulging out impressively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe brought his arms back down, stretching them out to the sides and flexing them again, letting out a surprisingly deep growl as he did so, drinking in the sight of just what his bigger body was capable of. With a chuckle, he dropped the pose, glancing down at his abs before looking over at Parker. He felt a rush of heat as Rocket grinned smugly at him. \"I see someone's enjoying the show!\" He laughed, leaning forward and bringing his arms forwards slightly as he tensed his stomach. His abdominal muscles flexed outwards, looking as though they were easily able to cut glass with the crevices seeming as though they were deep enough to hide quarters in. With a sly wink, he rose back up and turned around, so that his back was facing Parker. He raised his arms and flexed yet again, but this time, the focus was on his back, which rippled and shifted with bulging, powerful muscle. Parker swallowed around a sudden lump in his throat as Rocket squatted down, his big, bushy tail swayed around behind him as his massive rear flexed, his backside looking like it could probably have a quarter bounced off it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe huge raccoon stood back up again, smoothly turning back around and stretching a leg out before him as he knelt down so that his left leg was extended out before him. With a grin he tensed his legs, leaving Parker to gape in awe as his calves bulged out until they looked like they could easily rival one of their namesakes in size. Parker was sure that there was no way he could possibly wrap both of his arms around that enormous limb and even with Rocket's greater size, while he knew he would be able to wrap his arms around it, he doubted that even Rocket himself would be able to wrap both of his huge hands around it. His gaze drifted lower to his thighs, which were just as impressive as his calves. Proportionately, they had grown as much as the rest of him, and even though they were still smaller than his calves, Parker held no delusions over just how strong Rocket's legs must be. Given that bigger animals need great muscular strength to reach the same speeds as smaller, leaner animals as told in Biology, he couldn't help but wonder if Rocket would be able to reach speeds rivaling those of other heroes, like Captain America.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Parker only had a few brief moments to dwell on that thought, as Rocket called out to him. \"Hey, Parker! Get over here, I've got something very important to ask you.\" He smirked. Parker jumped at the sudden baritone of his voice, stumbling backward as he jolted. \"Uh, sure thing!\" He replied, rushing over to the giant Raccoon. \"Uh, what's up?\" He asked, grinning bashfully, to which Rocket's cocky smirk grew ever wider. \"Well you see, kid, I like being this big!\" He flashed a grin as he linked his fingers together and raised his arms above and behind his head and flexed. His huge pecs swelled outwards, the thick, tight muscles looking like two huge solid concrete slabs beneath the thick, rich brown fur. Parker swallowed again, barely resisting the urge to reach out and touch them. \"But, I'm thinking, courtesy of you and your magic touch, I could get even bigger!\" He grinned widely as his eyes seemed to almost flash with eager glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, uh, sure thing Rocket. I don't see why not. How big are you thinking?\" Parker managed to get out despite his throat feeling as dry as the warm, soft sand he stood on. Rocket's eyes seemed to flash again as he grinned down at him. \"20 feet.\" He said simply. Parker blinked at him. \"20 feet?\" He gasped out, eliciting a nod from the Raccoon. \"Yeah, it's not too big, but it's almost three times as big as I am now! Can you believe that?\" He grinned widely. Parker shook his head slowly. \"No, I can't. I mean, I believe that it's three times bigger, but it's three times bigger! Man, it's only when you put it like that that it's really put into perspective. Man, that really makes me think about my power now that you mention it.\" He mused, looking at his hands before he was jolted out of his introspective state by Rocket's deep chuckles. \"Well, speaking of your power, any chance you could use it on me?\" He snickered as he lowered himself to the ground, bracing his arms against the warmth of the sand as he laid back casually. With a smooth wink, he raised his beefy left arm and gestured to his huge, powerful pectorals, inviting Parker to place his hands against Rocket's thick, soft fur and begin his growth anew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker ran his tongue over his lips nervously as he approached Rocket, readying himself to make Rocket even bigger. Up to 20 feet tall, almost three times bigger in fact, as Rocket himself has so eagerly stated. He swallowed as he gently placed his hands atop his great, muscular chest before he took in a deep, steadying breath and allowed his power to flow. Immediately, Rocket's massive frame began to surge outwards, the great Raccoon letting out a gasp of pleasure as his body pushed outwards in every direction, pushing the surrounding sand into growing walls around the imprint of his tremendous and still-increasing weight. Parker let out a yelp as Rocket's flank smacked into his legs, knocking him onto Rocket's stunningly well-defined stomach. He let out an embarrassed smile as Rocket winked over at him smoothly, somehow able to pull it off despite the near overwhelming rush of growing. He let out a moan that Parker could have sworn dislodged a coconut from a nearby palm tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't have time to think about it for long though, as Rocket let out a whine of delight as his height soared past 10 feet, rapidly smashing past 12 as his musculature continued to expand proudly, easily outclassing even the greatest of athletes. Parker had to admit the temptation to wonder if his musculature was reaching the level of The Incredible Hulk - from what he'd heard and seen, The Hulk was possibly one of, if not the, strongest being in the universe! Yet Rocket was still getting bigger and stronger, as he blew straight through 15 feet, his frame utterly dwarfing Parker, who now could comfortably fit onto his stomach lying stretched out and he was pretty sure that he could easily sit atop one of his pecs with plenty of room to spare, possibly even with enough room for another person. As he rushed past 18 feet, Parker turned to see his paws, which looked as though they could outsize SUVs with ease! He looked back at Rocket's face, which was contorted into an expression of pure, unadulterated pleasure. As he reached what had to be 20 feet, Parker finally broke off the growth. There was still no sign of his usual cockiness or smugness, only the thrill of growing bigger, stronger, tougher. More powerful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker watched as Rocket took in great, heaving breaths, his muscular chest rising and falling with each gasp as he adjusted to his substantially greater size. After a few moments of catching his breath, the enormous Raccoon lifted his huge head and grinned down at the young man sprawled across his stomach. \"Oh yeah kid, that's what I'm talking about!\" He smirked cockily as he raised a massive, beefy arm and flexed, his eyes almost shining with glee at how utterly massive his bicep was now, no longer was it the size of a small watermelon. Now it was closer to the size of a large boulder. Rocket turned his gaze away from his bicep and back to Parker. \"Hey, kid?\" He asked.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Parker wasn't for sure why he did it. But as soon as Rocket had asked him that question the young man found himself nodding his up and down thus giving the now 20 foot tall heavily muscled anthro raccoon his answer even if it was wordless. Upon doing this though the mutate saw Rocket grin down at him while he remarked, \"I knew you'd want to see me show off, kid.\" Parker then found himself being surprisingly picked up rather gently by the huge anthro raccoon to which he was then set down onto the sand on his feet. Once that happened the young man looked up at the towering raccoon as he stood up straight as well and placed his hand on hips. He then continued to grin down at him when he added, \"Now you just say right here since I'd hate for you to get hurt and then not be able to use your powers anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, right.\" Parker let out, as a light blush formed on his face upon seeing Rocket bounce each of his huge pecs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then saw Rocket nod down at him before he began to walk off a short distance away from the mutate. Although to Parker it was more like Rocket was stomping onto the ground, but he knew this was only caused by the increased height and muscle mass. But to the young man's suprise he saw the massive raccoon stop his walking when he came upon a boulder that was in the sand. To which then he saw Rocket squat down and take a hold of the large boulder from the bottom it to which gave him a very good view of his now even larger, firm, and muscled rear as the raccoon's tail moved from side to side. Parker then heard Rocket take in a breathe of air before he released it and then proceeded to lift the boulder with relative ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd upon doing so Parker saw the red eyed raccoon turn to face him again as he told him, \"Hey kid, watch this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the young man did what was asked him and watched in both shock and amazement when he saw the raccoon move the boulder away form him a little bit before he closed his eyes and grunted while he pushed both of his hands together. Upon doing so caused the boulder to break into tiny pieces within no time at all. And after doing this Parker saw a huge grin on Rocket's face as he asked, \"Heh, pretty impressive right kid?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah, it really is, Rocket.\" Parker replied, while he saw the raccoon wipe the dust off of his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup, it really is.\" The huge anthro commented, before Parker saw his eyes fall onto him. And once they had done this Rocket went on with, \"And it's all thanks to you and your powers, kid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well it was no problem, Rocket.\" Parker reassured him, as his face turned a shade of red again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm sure it wasn't. Nor would it be a problem if I wanted you to make me even bigger would it?\" Rocket pondered, as he squatted down in front of the young man. Upon doing so gave Parker a very good view of the raccoon's large balls and currently soft member as he continued, \"Besdies I know that I want it. And I bet you want it too, don't you? You want me to get even bigger and stronger, don't you, kid?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this caused the young man to blush even more as he meekly replied, \"Um, well I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could keep going though a huge finger from one of Rocket's hands was pushed up against the mutate's head when he cut him off with, \"No need to answer that question, Parker. Because I can tell that you want me to get bigger just as much as I want to get bigger with the use of your powers.\" Parker then saw the raccoon's eyebrow move up and down suggestively as he continued, \"So what will it be kid? Do you want to use your powers on me again right now? Or would you rather we take this someplace else first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing Rocket let Parker decide what they'd next caused a surprised expression to show on his face. But once Rocket had removed his finger from in front of his face he told him.........</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rocket's muzzle lifted in a lopsided grin. \"You're pretty eager there kiddo. You really wanna see me grow, huh? All this thick beef spreading out taller and wider. Ha, you know, isn't it just the weirdest coincidence that you got the power to make people grow and it turns out that that's what you're into!\" He chuckles, his mighty chest shaking so much that if Parker had been standing up he would have been thrown to his hands and knees. He looked up at the massive raccoon as a light blush crossed his face. Grinning sheepishly, he nodded slowly. \"Yeah. Yeah, I guess it is a weird coincidence, isn't it? I mean, I didn't even really realise that this is what I was into until I met you, and now here I am!\" He agreed. Leaning his head back, Rocket let out a contented sigh. \"So, since you're so eager to see me get even bigger, you wanna get started?\" He asked, to which Parker nodded in reply. \"Yeah, of course!\" He grinned widely, placing his hands atop Rocket's powerful chest and focusing his power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRocket let out a low, rumbling growl of pleasure as a soothing warmth spread throughout his body, radiating from Parker's touch. As the warmth spread, wherever it reached began to swell outwards, his already ludicrously powerful frame bulking up even further, long past the point where Rocket could have ever naturally achieved such a physique, even if he were somehow 20 feet tall already. As Rocket's towering frame began to stretch out further, his massive pectorals, already huge enough for Parker to comfortably sit on, stretched and swelled outwards to the point where Parker was reasonably confident that he could sit there and easily have room for another person to sit with him comfortably. His abdominals carved out a chiseled eight-pack, looking less like a complex, well-defined muscle structure and more like a set of cobblestones set out on a garden path. Parker turned to see his legs stretch out, swelling with thick muscle as his paws, which could rival the size of SUVs, doubled in size in mere moments, leaving Parker staring in awe as they looked like they could easily crumple an SUV beneath his thick, meaty toes with laughable ease. Parker swallowed thickly as he turned to see Rocket's face contort in joyful bliss as his height hit a whopping 25 feet and simply smashed straight on past without stopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRocket let out a grunt of pleasure as he kept growing, his arms thickening in tandem with his legs while his torso broadened and lengthened. His biceps promptly surged past the size of boulders, quickly bulging outwards until they had casually doubled in size. Rocket raised a massive arm and flexed it in clear view so that Parker could get a perfect, completely unobstructed view of the raccoon giant's equally giant bicep. He swallowed thickly as he felt his throat go dry at the sight, his cheeks now burning as his face turned a deep, brilliant scarlet. \"You like that little guy?\" Rocket smugly asked although it was clear that he knew what the answer was perfectly well. Parker didn't try to deny it, nodding enthusiastically as he grinned lopsidedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good!\" Rocket smirked cockily as he moved his arms out to the side and flexed his chest, his pectorals bouncing so much that Parker was almost pushed onto his side, forcing the young mutant to grab at the massive Raccoon's abs for support, the deep crevices between the huge muscles more than enough for Parker to grip onto as easily as if they were handholds on a climbing wall. He glanced up at Rocket, his face bright red in embarrassment, only to find that Rocket was simply grinning down at him smugly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph, not so big that you could get lost in there yet, but with your help, I just might get there!\" He winked down at him which sent a thrill straight through him. He could just imagine falling into the crevices of his mighty abdominals, surrounded by powerful muscle as if it were a natural cave and not the abdomen of an impossibly huge raccoon. He lowered his head and sighed at the comfortable sensation of soft fur against his cheek, feeling the heat of Rocket's huge body radiating outwards and further providing a comforting suggestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha! You like how my fur feels?\" Rocket smirked, bursting out into peals of laughter that shook the nearby trees. Parker flinched as the sound of breaking wood sounded out as a tree toppled to the ground, unable to withstand the trembling of the ground from something as simple as Rocket's laughter. He swallowed thickly as his thoughts raced. How powerful was Rocket to be able to bring down trees? And, more importantly, if he was this powerful already, how powerful would he be when he got bigger?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought jerked him back to the fact that he had been growing Rocket before losing concentration. He quickly looked behind him to see a trench of sand that the huge paws which could easily crush SUVs beneath only a couple of toes had dug out with impressive ease. He let out a breath as he did a quick mental calculation. Jeez, Rocket must have been 30 feet tall at this point and judging from the slightly smug, very satisfied expression on his face, it was evident that Rocket knew that too. Parker shook his head. God, Rocket was bigger than a house at this stage! And it was all because of him! And... and... he liked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya know, it's almost a shame we're out here on this island, alone, all by ourselves, with no trace of civilization around us! It means we don't got any buildings or stuff to measure how tall I am! I can't go parkin' my butt on the roof of a store or leaning on the roof o' some offices, so we gotta use our imagination, you know?\" He smirked, wiggling his huge toes slightly. Parker swallowed as his throat went dry. He nodded dumbly as he stared at the thick digits as they wiggled teasingly. A thrill of heat went through him, spiking his core temperature to an almost uncomfortable level combined with the heat of the sun blazing down on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker's blush only intensified as Rocket's smug tone sounded out. \"I'm sure you're not having any trouble with that though! Gotta be a good student to master your power so fast, so you're obviously one of the sharper tools in the box!\" He said, evidently quite confident in his assessment. He closed his eyes as he felt a wave of embarrassment mixed with... something else that he couldn't quite identify.</span></div></div>",

That's an interesting idea.\" rocket replied, as Parker slowly saw him sit up. And upon oding so the anthro raccoon's grin only widened as he added, \"But hey why not. Let's see if this island has anything good on it just so we can find out how huge am I now!\" Right after uttering these words the young mutate found himself being grabbed by one of the raccoon's huge hands. And once he was standing up to his full height of 30 feet Parker found himself being set down onto the giant anthro's right shoulder. He then saw Rocket looking down at him from the corner of one his eyes when he went on with, \"Although I don't want to have to wait all day for you to catch up with me while we walked due to how much smaller you are to me. Also I don't need you getting hurt by accident either. So you'll be sitting on my shoulder while we walk around the island.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh um, okay. That's fine, Rocket.\" Parker let out, before he saw and felt the raccoon begin to walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd upon this happening the young man took a hold of the anthro's neck to keep himself on Rocket's shoulder. But while Rocket walked around the island Parker couldn't help but stare at the raccoon's huge muscled front as his pecs slightly bounced with each step that he took along with his balls and currently soft member. Seeing this though only caused Parker face to turn a bright red to which he turned and looked behind him and Rocket only to see the raccoon's now huge paw like foot prints in the sand. Not only this, but he also saw the anthro's large and wide back along with his long and bushy tail which seemed ot be slightly swaying form side to side above his two large and very firm looking buttcheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis only caused Parker's face to turn an even darker shade of red as he knew that he couldn't really deny it anymore. That being the fact that he found Rocket very attractive at his current size. And the if the mutate had to be honest he had a feeling that Rocket knew it too. And might feel the same as he did. Of course with how Rocket acted, it didn't seem like he wouldn't be flat out admitting to these kind of feelings. But maybe after growing to a certain size, he would? Or at least that's what Parker hoped before he saw Rocket come to a stop.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Parker blinked, reaching up and rubbing his eyes to allow himself a clearer view of the area before them. It was a decently sized pond in what he had to guess must have been the middle of the island. The water was surprisingly clear despite appearing to be stagnant, perhaps due to the waterfall that cascaded down into the body of water. Even from the impressive vantage point of Rocket's broad shoulder, he still had to look up, gripping the soft fur of his thick, muscular neck for support. It must have been no more than 20 feet up, but it was still impressive to see, given that Rocket was so unnaturally huge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.\" Parker managed to mutter out, to which Rocket turned his head to look at him. He was briefly surprised to see that the enormous raccoon's usual smug grin was instead replaced by a much more subdued, impressed look. \"Yeah.\" He nodded slowly, his gaze roaming across the area in front of him. \"It's pretty cool, isn't it?\" He mused, before his usual lazy smirk returned. \"Perfect place for showing off too! I bet we can have all sorts of fun with that waterfall there! How high does that thing go?\" He wondered. Looking down at his huge paws, he looked back up at the top of the waterfall. \"Alright, let's suppose I'm... 30 feet tall, that sounds about right. Say I'm 30 feet tall, how much further is that? 20 feet, yeah, that sounds right, what do you think kid?\" He asked, to which Parker nodded in agreement. \"Okay, so that's 50 feet tall. Heh, yeah I can have lots of fun with this, right now and after I get even bigger!\" He chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker felt his face heat up as he blushed a bright red at the mention of him getting even bigger. He couldn't help but find some mild amusement in his assumption that he was going to end up bigger, because he knew without a shadow of a doubt that he was absolutely correct. He knew he was going to make him bigger, he couldn't stop himself. Rocket's sheer size and strength... his impossible power... it defied so many laws of physics and biology, although it seemed that it happened so much that it sometimes seemed they were fluid rather than fixed. Regardless though, he was so big... so strong... it thrilled him like little else could hope to, and the thought that he could get even bigger still only thrilled him even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was startled by a thunderous rumble from right next to him, with the volume of what sounded like a jet engine. After a moment it subsided, allowing him to register that the rumble was actually Rocket chuckling. \"I heard that - that little whimper! You like the sound of that, don't ya kid? The thought of me, with all this thick muscle getting even bigger, huh?\" He grinned teasingly, raising a beefy arm and flexing it for him, gleefully showing off the sheer size of the muscle, the corded striations of muscle bulging outwards impressively. It must have outsized a small car at this stage. Parker swallowed thickly, his throat suddenly dry upon seeing the stunning display before him. Rocket's bicep easily outsized him. It only helped further emphasise how huge he was, especially when he looked down at the ground afterwards, letting out a deep breath to steady himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded slowly, unable to find it in himself to deny the truth that was so obvious. Again, the booming chuckle rumbled out, forcing him to grip onto the raccoon giant's neck and shoulder fur for stability as his massive, muscular frame shook with his laughter. \"Well then, isn't it just great that you have the power to make me even bigger!\" He winked, before strolling forwards, his massive paws closing the distance to the pond easily. \"But, let's not get ahead of ourselves here! We've found this sweet little place, there's no way we're just going to stand around talking the whole time! I've got this smoking hot body, I'm putting it to use!\" He smirked confidently, reaching up and gently grabbing the comparatively tiny human in his paw dextrously. Parker let out a little gasp as he was gripped by the massive furred digits as he was lowered to the ground, leaving him looking up at the towering giant's impressive body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRocket grinned down at him smugly, very much aware of how impossibly immense he was, especially when compared to his original size. It left him feeling slightly weak in the knees as he looked up at him, he was so tall he had to tilt his head back just to see his face. The hulking raccoon tensed his upper body, pushing his chest out as his thick pectorals flexed impressively, his broad shoulders rolling as his arms pumped. His mighty core flexed and shifted, showing off his eight-pack abdominal muscles. As he confidently displayed his breath-taking physique, he dropped his grin, raising his head and looking into the distance. A sterner look of determination crossed his face as he posed as if he was a superhero of some kind. Well, certainly, it could be said that he was a superhero, but nevertheless, Parker couldn't help but let out a breath of awe at the sight, before blushing slightly as he realised that he actually looked more heroic shirtless, with his musculature on display, than he probably would if he were clothed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRocket remained in that stance for a few, wonderful moments before his stoic expression faltered. His muzzle lifted into an amused smirk as he raised one of his thick, mighty arms. \"Heh, man. You have no idea how good this feels! You've got the power to make me grow! That's just incredible, mutant powers can do pretty much anything, huh? Heh, the world we live in...\" He mused. \"I'm so big! I'm so strong! I feel big and powerful, and I love it! Man, I think I'm probably even stronger than I look! Stronger than I feel! And let me tell you kid, I feel really, really strong! Like, I feel almost unstoppable! Can you imagine when I get even bigger?\" He grinned almost deviously. \"Can you imagine if I actually was unstoppable?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker let out a weak chuckle, feeling a rush of heat in his chest as he pictured Rocket at a truly staggering size, skyscrapers reaching up yet barely scraping his knees. Rather, his shins. Better yet, his ankles. His titanic form loomed over the landscape, casting the world below into shadow as his hulking frame blotted out the sun. The tiny specs beneath his glorious form could only look up to his waist at best, even helicopters could only get lower body shots of the titan. He swallowed thickly as he shivered lightly. \"Ye-yeah. That... uh, that sounds pretty... pretty, uh...\" He stammered. \"That sounds incredible.\" He managed to breath out, to which Rocket chuckled deeply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe let out a deep breath, the warm air blasting over Parker's comparatively tiny frame, ruffling his hair and clothes. Parker let out a little giggle as Rocket winked down at him smoothly, before looking around, observing the surrounding trees. The cool breeze ruffled his fur along with the leaves, the rustling sounding out alongside the muffled crash of the waves. The sounds, the heat that was just the right temperature, the sights... it was so picture perfect that it was almost amusing. \"Well, that power of yours is pretty incredible! You can literally grow other people just by... well, willing it, I guess? I don't know how it works to be fair, but still! You can sort of bend the laws of biology!\" He grinned. \"Still, I'm willing to bet it has its limits, so I'm not going to end up outsizing countries. Probably. I mean, it'd be freakin' sweet if I could! But, probably not.\" He shook his head, refocusing his thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, got a bit distracted there! It's a nice thought, being that massive. Man, at that size I'd practically be a god! Ha ha ha! Oh man, can you imagine that? Ah, what I am saying, of course you can! I bet you love that idea, don't you?\" He winked, his muzzle cracking into a wide, smug grin. He swallowed thickly, blushing as a thrill of heat blossomed in his chest, his stomach tingling as he wrung his hands excitedly. Taking his silence as an affirmative, Rocket glanced towards the pond. \"Well, I might not have the clouds at my ankle, but maybe I'll have this waterline at my knees!\" He grinned, lifting his huge, heavy paws and strolling towards the body of water, dipping a paw in before walking right in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker watched as Rocket casually strolled into the middle. The waterline didn't come up to his knees, but it did only come up to his muscular chest, barely reached his thick, firm pectorals. The massive Racoon turned to face him, leaving his huge, powerful body framed against the waterfall behind him, the mist giving him an almost ethereal appearance. Parker couldn't help but shiver slightly, unable to keep himself from grinning slightly as Rocket called out to him. \"Come on in kid, the water's fine!\" He laughed, raising a beefy arm and flexing it, leaning his muzzle down to deliver a kiss to the flexed muscle. He was blatantly showing off, demonstrating his substantial physical superiority over him. Truth be told - Parker couldn't deny that he absolutely loved it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe licked his lips, taking a few steps towards the edge of the water, keeping his eyes locked on Rocket's massive frame. As he came to a stop, the water gently lapping up against his shoes, Rocket let out a snort of laughter. \"Yeah, that's right, come on in! The water's fine!\" He smirked. He ran his tongue over his lips again, before moving his hands to his pants. He kicked off his shoes and pulled off his pants before swiftly removing his shirt. Not particularly caring about being neat, he discarded his clothes in a messy pile. He hesitated at removing his own underwear before doing so. Rocket would hardly care, given that his own member was probably easily as large as one of his legs, and he wasn't in the mood to be walking around in wet boxers. The sun would dry him out quickly enough anyway. As he waded out into the surprisingly warm water, before swimming his way over to Rocket, the enormous Racoon grinned down at him. \"See, I told you it's not bad kid! So, now that here, waddya wanna do?\"</span></div></div>",

Once that happened the mutant found himself just staring up at Rocket's 30 heavily muscled frame in awe as the water started to fall down and around his massive body. However, this only lasted for a few seconds as he was broken out of his staring by Roceket's voice when he added, \"So you going to start kid?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, yeah, right.\" Parker let out, before he turned and then laid his eyes onto the palm of Rocket's massive hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd within seconds the young man heard the guardian's deep voice again as he reacted with a, \"Oh, yeah... That's the stuff...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd while both of his hands were pressing Rocket's palm he knew that the anthro raccoon was growing as his head and body rose higher and higher into the air. Not only that, but the water was flowing down the massive shoulders of the raccoon and even between the space between his unbelievably massive pecs and huge eight pack of abs to which he knew mean that he had grown up to 40 feet. And all the while he did this he could hear the anthro giant murr in pleasure as he rose more and more until Parker saw that Rocket's head was the same level as the waterfall which meant that he had just grown Rocket up to the 50 foot mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then found himself removing his hands from the Rocket's even bigger palm after he had stopped using his powers. Although this wasn't the only reason why he had swallowed a lump in his throat as Rocket opened his eyes and stared down at him with his red eyes when he told him, \"Thanks kid. Once again that felt amazing. In fact I feel like I should thank you in some way. And I know just how to do that....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd after saying this Parker just stared at the raccoon's truly massive 50 foot body before he found out what Rocket meant by what he had said as the now truly giant raccoon decided to.....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Parker's breath hitched in his throat as his eyes widened, jaw dropping open as the towering raccoon's bulky arm lifted up, the thick muscles of his shoulder bulging while he flexed his bicep with an almost torturous slowness. His thick fur rippled over the swell of his muscle as his bicep rose higher by the second as he flexed harder and harder, the slow pace not from any strain or effort but rather from the delight in showing off as made abundantly clear by the smug smirk that lazily crossed his face and the glee in his eyes. Shifting into a more comfortable sitting position, Parker could only gape dumbfoundedly at the display, prompting an amused snort as Rocket's shameless flexing continued, the muscles of his arm flexing and bulging impressively, his bicep alone easily the size of a small car. He couldn't even begin to fathom the sheer strength Rocket could wield. As if his very thoughts had been psychically connected, which wouldn't have surprised him if he were being honest with himself, Rocket let out a thunderous, rumble from the depths of his mighty chest. \"Hah... you know, I'm almost disappointed I'm not in the middle of a city or, uh, somewhere where I could find loads of stuff to show off with! Lifting stuff's fine, I guess, but sometimes you wanna just... ya know, heft somethin' up and just crush it! Stuff it between this beauty and my forearm and just squeeze and see what happens!\" He grinned toothily, his eyes almost sparkling with delight at the thought as his bicep rose to its peak. The massive wall of muscle held the pose, sliding his eyes closed as he let out a satisfied rumble. Every single muscle in his arm was tensed to its fullest, the sheer power held in that limb alone on full display like some treasured artwork. Parker had to admit, with the glow of the water reflecting the sunlight as it cascaded over his muscular frame, it made him look like a statue from the Greco-Roman era come to life, set against the backdrop of a travel brochure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a heaving sigh, Rocket relaxed his heavy frame, the tension in his muscles easing as he dropped the flex. Parker swallowed down a throaty whimper as he tried to calm his thudding heart, shifting at the rush of warmth throughout his body, a slight shock coming from his back and armpits as beads of sweat began to appear, the sudden coolness a sharp contrast to the blazing heat of the sun which was only enhanced by the thick fur over Rocket's muscular body which made the surroundings even hotter with the sheer heat his huge body gave off. \"Still... I gotta admit, even when ya don't got anything to show off with...\" He paused, growling deeply, his eyes screwed closed in pleasure. Grinning almost savagely, he continued. \"Just flexing can still show off just how freakin' powerful you are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker pressed his lips together tightly, nodding shakily as he clenched his fists, his shoulders shaking slightly with the effort. Despite his hopes, the expression on Rocket's face quickly made it clear that he'd noticed his excitement. With a sly grin, he brought his hand closer to his face, drawing a gasp from Parker. He frantically grabbed at the strands of fur for support as the wind whipped past him, jolting him from his daze and reminding him that he was forty feet in the air. He tried to quash the instinctive fear at the fact that if he fell, the outcome wouldn't be pretty. While falling into water from this height was nowhere near the 150 feet that would turn the impact into one comparable to falling onto concrete, it would likely still hurt. Fortunately, he found himself torn from those thoughts as he found himself less than a foot away from the towering Raccoon's broad muzzle, twisted into a huge grin. \"You know, kid, I can't help but get the feeling that you're enjoying this show just as much as I am!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker blushed deeply, turning his gaze away in embarrassment. He couldn't help but feel further embarrassment at his embarrassment, he knew that Rocket was fully aware of his own fascinated desire with such fantastical sizes and extraordinary strength, but for some reason, someone else being aware of his desires left him flustered. At this, however, Rocket's smug grin softened slightly. \"Hey, come on now kid, you don't need to be all bashful about it! I'm loving this, and it's kind of obvious that you're loving this just as much as I am!\" He chuckled, his tone becoming more cocky at the end of his reassurance, to which Parker grinned lopsidedly and nodded. \"I mean, yeah, that's true, it's just... you know, it feels kinda weird, you know?\" He tried to explain, to which Rocket snorted. \"Yeah, yeah, sure thing. It's because we're in person, isn't it?\" He asked, to which Parker nodded affirmatively. \"Yeah, that's it. Don't worry about it, I'll just need to get used to it is all. It's just... I never imagined anything like this to ever come true!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRocket's grin widened as he shifted his gaze from the tiny human held in his palm to the side as he lifted his arm and flexed once again. His eyes flared with glee as he drank in the sight. It was as if he could scarcely believe what had happened to him. Parker couldn't help but find it somewhat amusing - a raccoon who had been had altered and changed until he became like this who went on incredible, daring adventures in space was blown away by something like this. Of course, then again, he couldn't really blame him. For Rocket, this was practically a dream come true. Besides, the actual ability of his was unbelievable in and of itself to be fair. To literally turn someone into a hulking giant just by putting his hands on them and willing it to be so? It was impossible, yet it was so. Physics be damned. Of course, with what happens so often in this mad world... he shook his head as Rocket let out another laugh and spoke up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn... this feels so good!\" Rocket thundered out, a powerful growl blasting from the depths of his impressive chest. He had to admit, it sure as hell looked good. In a way, he was somewhat envious that he couldn't do it to himself. The sight of such huge, powerful muscles bulging with strength and vitality, practically radiating raw, pure physical power, left him staring in awe. Even if he didn't turn into a giant of an Adonis like Rocket had, just the ability to develop a healthy six-pack would be all he wanted. He'd be content with that... of course, despite his amazing ability, such a feat was impossible. He'd have to stick to old fashioned exercise if he wanted a body like that. Ugh, so much work. Then again... with the way Rocket looked... and his face and the look in his eyes... maybe that hard work would be worth it....</span></div></div>",

The only thing he did was wink down at the mutant before he let out a low chuckle and finally answered back with, \"Oh I think you know where I'm talking about kid. But perhaps I should just show you instead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so Parker watched with baited breathe as Rocket slowly moved him down his body passing by his rock ahrd giant sized eight pack abs until the young man saw that he was between the Guardian's giant and massively muscled thighs and was now facing his giant cock which looked like a giant pole compared to him and his two giant balls which looked like truly gigantic boulders that was underneath. This however, only caused him to blush a very dark red as he just stared wide eyed and in awe of what he was seeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Parker was soon brought out of his daze like state when he saw Rocket move his hips from side to side for a bit which caused his giant cock and balls to move a bit while he remaked, \"pretty big down there, aren't I kid? And as you can tell all of this growth and showing off has really got me turned on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah, I can see that....\" Parker softly replied, as he did his best to control his emotions and not finally let out a groan from all of his Rocket's growth and with just how gigantic he had grown up into thanks to him and his powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough these thoughts were taken out of his head when Rocket gently set him down onto the sandy ground after he had walked away from the waterfall completely. This caused the mutate to look up at the giant raccoon in confusion. Though the only thing he saw when he looked up at Rocket he only saw the anthro wink down at him again. The young man then let out a gasp when he saw the brown, black, and white furred giant turn around and place his hands onto his hips and present his two giant, large, muscled, and very firm buttcheeks which only caused Parker to swallow another lump in his throat as he just stared at the two cheeks in awe as they looked like two full blown up hot air balloons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough while he was staring he only heard another chcuke from the raccoon before he commented, \"I'm glad that you're liking this as much as I am kid. He then saw and Rocket lay down onto the sand covered ground while continued to grin down at him as he continued with, \"But I think that's enough of me teasing you since if you really want to you're more then welcome to give into your lust. I promise I won't tell anyone.\" Though he then saw the anthro wink down at him again as he kept going, \"Though if you want to grow me I certainly wouldn't mind that either....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing these suggestions however only caused Parker to keep the dark blush on his face while he gave his next move some thought. And upon reaching a decision in his head the young man decided that he was going to.........</span></div></div>",

Peter also wouldn\u2019t mind seeing a giant black widow. So he went to her at the Avengers headquarters and found her in the training room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter explains about his power and offers to use them on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how big will I get?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIm not sure, how big do you want to get?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLets start slow and work our way up if we need to, will it hurt?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah, apparently it feels great actually\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI accidentally used it on my aunt and she grew 5ft.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, ok well lets start\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter concentrated his thoughts to growing her, almost immediately widow started growing, it was slow at first but sped up as it went. Peter stopped to check how big she was and was and was face to face with her chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShould I keep going?\u201d He tried hard to not star.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes we\u2019ve barely started\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started again and thought to speed up the process so she grew an inch a second. She grew and grew and grew. She got so big that soon the training room was going to be cramped. She hit her head on the ceiling but kept growing. She sat down, spreading her legs around Peter who was deep in thought. He was so small to her now. She had to be 50ft by now, but she kept growing. She didn\u2019t want to destroy the room so she poked Peter on the head and he stopped. He was shocked to be surrounded by her leather legs and her crotch as tall as him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHows the view?\u201d She asked jokingly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe he so um is this big enough?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah I think 60ft is pretty good, I feel so powerful, I want to test this new size out. Jarvis, increase the height of of the training room\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe A.I replied and raised the roof so she could stand. She stood up and Peter was amazed at how big she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWanna be my sparring partner?\u201d She asked him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure but go easy on me\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo they started, black widow tried to grab peter but he swang out of the way in time. She turned around and tried again but missed again. Peter swung around her to confuse her. He land on her head but she tried to reach for him but he fell off and slid down her nose and fell again onto her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour quite the charmer aren\u2019t you Peter\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe swung away again and had an idea. He went to the ground and shot web around her legs. She fell backwards but Peter was right below her. She landed on him and Peter got crushed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, nice trick Peter bu- Peter? Where are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter was squashed by the russians giant assets but didn\u2019t get hurt as it was so soft. Widow tore the web off her foot and stood up. Peter stuck to her ass as she did so and she didn\u2019t notice. She looked around and couldn\u2019t find him anywhere. She then started feeling herself all over incase he was hiding on her. She reached her ass and felt him there. She pulled him off and put him infront of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLittle perv\u201d she teased<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey I didn\u2019t get sat on on purpose\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I bet you enjoyed\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I could definitely get used to this size but maybe I could get bigger\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBigger? I think you\u2019re pretty big already bu Alright\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe placed him on her chest again and sat down. Peter thought hard and she grew again. Peter felt himself sinking into her growing breasts but he kept going. Widow grew until..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She kept growing and the pleasure was so great, she couldn\u2019t help but grope her breasts and massage them. Peter was being pressed by the soft growing walls of her breasts. She went further down and groped her ass, moaning loudly, She was at 130ft by now and kept growing. She reached her crotch and pulled her zipper down and reached down and started master baiting. She didn\u2019t mind that Peter was there, she couldn\u2019t stop herself. She rubbed as she grew and was reaching her climax. Peter felt her shaking herself as she played with herself, he could tell she was doing something but didn\u2019t know what. She climaxed and suddenly she exploded with growth. She shot from 150ft to 250ft almost instantly. Peter was snapped out of his thought from the sudden jolt. He fell ever deeper in her chest. Widow was also shocked to by this. She was now filling the even bigger training room. She reached into her chest amd pulled Peter out. Peter saw her face flushed red and sweaty and that it was much bigger than before. She was holding him with two fingers instead of her whole hand like before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d He asked <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t help myself and I umm\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter looked down to see her fly down and realized what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you say I\u2019m a perv\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you\u2019re not the one who\u2019s getting turned on every foot they grow\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFair point, but it looks like it made you grow double in height.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJarvis increase training room size by 10\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did so and the room was much larger than before. Widow then stood up and pulled up her fly, still embarrassed by her actions. Peter didn\u2019t mind but was sad he didn\u2019t get to see her do it. She placed Peter on the ground and said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis new size is great and I think I should thank you for it, so what would you like?

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Parker was on his way back home from James's place.  Parker and James had been friends for years, they had the same taste in girls.  The same taste in movies, books, comedy.  And just about everything.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey even shared another, less common taste.  They both wanted to be fat.  James was huge, tipping the scales at well over 500 pounds.  But Parker had never been able to gain so much as an ounce.  For a long time he was insanely jealous of James, and that feeling just got worse once his X-Gene had manifested.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker's mutant powers would seem worse than useless to most people.  He could make people gain weight just by touching them.  He couldn't make people lose weight, or gain muscle (though typically when he added fat to someone they also seemed to gain the strength to move easily with it).  He could only make people fat.  Which, on the whole, most would agree is fairly useless compared to many of the other mutant powers that are at large in the world right now.  Though there is one other advantage to the weight Parker could add to people's frames, it would cause them no poor health.  And that was it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis powers didn't even work on himself either, so he couldn't just fatten his own body.  Which brings us back to James.  When Parker found out that James also wanted to be fat too he had kept his gift to himself at first.  No one had found out about him yet, and he'd only ever used it on two occasions before that, both purely accidental.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut eventually, after a few months of trying fruitlessly to use his abilities on himself, he decided that fattening up his gainer friend was almost as good as getting fat himself.  That was a year and a half ago, when James was just over 200 pounds.  Chubby but not yet huge, with Parker's help however he was now nearing 600 pounds.  Nearly a 400 pound gain in less than two years.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker put these thoughts out of his head as he trudged down the road toward his own house.  He knew he wouldn't be able to keep using his powers on James for too much longer, his friend was already having some trouble walking.  'At least he probably won't get heart disease from the fat...' Parker thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was finally getting close to his house he felt a tremor run through the pavement.  Followed by another and another, something very heavy was moving rapidly toward him.  He turned as a shadow fell over him, and found himself looking at a very fleshy chest.  He quickly canted his gaze upward and saw that the Blob was standing over him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker was struck by uncertainty and staggered back a few steps.  The Blob just laughed at his apparent fear.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know all about you, Parker.\" He thundered.  \"You're the mutant with the useless ability.  Well, useless to most.\" The Blob added, smiling darkly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what do you mean?\" Parker said taking a few more steps away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Blob closed the distance between them in one stride.  \"You can make people fatter, to most that would be useless at best, and an impediment at worst.  But for me...more mass would make me stronger.  The bigger I am the more powerful I become!\" He shouted grandly.  Stomping his foot on the ground and cracking the pavement for emphasis.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker stumbled backward and fell.  The Blob loomed over him and rumbled.  \"Use your power on me, pipsqueak.  Or I'll crush you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker gulped, certain that he had no choice.  Grimacing, and feeling loathsome for helping a villain, he reached up and grabbed a handful of the Blob's belly.  The mutant's belly wobbled and started to expand.</span></div></div>",

Blob knew that it would take forever if he had to waddle and slowly stomp his way around to avoid attracting attention, so he placed Parker deeper in his FUPA. After he hid Parker in his FUPA, the Blob rolled himself away at a leisurely pace, but quick enough to prevent Parker from jumping out for risk of bodily injury. After a few hours on the run, or should I say roll, the Blob found this old cabin in the woods away from the city that had been abandoned for years, it was just what he needed to contain his captive for the indefinite future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter slowing down enough to ensure his \u201cpackage\u201d (Parker not his scrotum) was safe, he lifted himself up &amp; shook his body down, even going in the nude now that his super suit couldn\u2019t contain his girth anymore. As the Blob shook himself down he noticed Parker plopped down on the floor, soaked to the skin (with both Blob\u2019s sweat &amp; the Parker\u2019s sweat), gasping for breath, &amp; a little worn out from the rough ride. Despite all of this, Blob noticed Parker was actually hard down in his pants if his eyes weren\u2019t deceiving him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, well, well, looks like someone is a horny little boy. Isn\u2019t that right Parker?\u201d Blob chuckled going straight into a full-on belly laugh, while nudging Parker\u2019s groin area with his sausage-like toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, wait, no I\u2019m not hard?!?!?!?! I don\u2019t even like you, let alone lust after you or anything like that\u201d Parker shouted in desperation trying to cover up his own sexuality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, heh. Don\u2019t try to deny it Pipsqueak, you are gay &amp; an FA, I know this already. But even after that ride, you still felt horny from touching my glorious gluttonous girth. This could make breaking you in as a slave go by even faster than I could have imagined\u201d Blob retorted with satisfaction &amp; an almost carnal desire-filled eyes, yet predator smirk on his luscious lips. \u201cSo here\u2019s the deal. You make me fatter &amp; fatten up my food based \u2018victims\u2019, &amp; I will start to give you all your sexual desires you could ever imagine, without any other responsibilities. The catch is that you gotta fatten me up in big blubbery bursts at least once a week. &amp;, if you don\u2019t accept this deal, I could make your life a living hell as you hopelessly try to escape. Got it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I can\u2019t stay with you forever, my powers take time to recharge, so I need to eat &amp; I need to sleep? How are you going to look after me if you can\u2019t even go into town to steal food? What\u2019s to keep me from running out on you anyway or calling for help on my, cell phone?\u201d Parker explained smugly, quickly changing to a frown as he realized his cell phone was gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa, ha, ha!!! We\u2019re currently in a cabin in the middle of the woods that no one knows about, you\u2019ll have a bed, clean water, a bathroom plus a tub, I\u2019ll be bringing you food, &amp; I get new powers the fatter I get so don\u2019t worry about amenities. Just do your new job, &amp; I promise you\u2019ll live comfortably\u201d the Blob steps away revealing that Parker was in a dimly lit, musty, old corridor. The Blob escorted you through it to the light behind him &amp; now you were in some sort of underground military bunker. It would have been nice due to the sheer enormity of the dimensions; the huge plasma screen TV monitor; the sink &amp; bathroom were well accommodated &amp; clearly running based on the dripping faucet; &amp; the bathtub looked like it was a public marine aquarium tank for sharks. It was clear that you were a well taken care of prisoner But Parker then noticed that the door was like a bank vault safe with a mechanical lock &amp; a digital lock. You were almost claustrophobic, as you begun hyperventilating. \u201cAlso, don\u2019t worry about breathing, I had an ally design this bunker to self-sustain oxygen, power, &amp; water for weeks on end. The door is the only way out that you &amp; I can fit through, &amp; with my new powers of technopathy, you\u2019ll never get out or send a message with the electronics I\u2019ve stolen from you. Oh &amp; as for the other part of the deal, you\u2019ll be fattening up my \u2018victims\u2019 to eat\u201d. Blob slurred sinisterly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he brought in what appeared to be small pack of injured wolves, through the corridor. The Blob broke their legs before coming in &amp; held the alpha male\u2019s mouth shut tight without covering its nose. \u201cYou want me to fatten up animals to eat.\u201d Parker asked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh, not just animals, I\u2019ll be kidnapping humans &amp; mutants for me to eat.\u201d Parker looked horrified at that last statement, now knowing the Blob is a cannibal. He would ask Parker to fatten up humans and mutants alike to fill up his insatiable appetite. \u201cDon\u2019t worry Parker, you\u2019re too special to eat. But I am warning you, one escape attempt, one act of resistance in the use of your powers on my victims, or if you deny me my power, I could still absorb your body &amp; powers to permanently make my own. Got it\u201d Parker was disgusted with his powers. Is this what his life would turn out to be, a big fat, joke with him being the butt. Parker finally knew what the Blob meant stood dumbfounded as he realized he had no way of getting out. The Blob had planned this out perfectly. Even with the Blob\u2019s limited maneuverability, he was still fast at rolling over to capture him. The only thing he could do was submit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I got it. But can I at least get some food right now before I fatten up these animals?\u201d Parker requested, \u201cI\u2019m still kind of hungry from fattening you up earlier\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Blob contemplated giving in to Parker\u2019s request as he realized Parker was testing his boundaries of this new relationship &amp; pleasurable services. \u201cOK, you\u2019ll get some food.\u201d Blob relented, dropping a jumbo bag of potato chips in front of Parker. Parker opened them up &amp; ate them as quickly, &amp; politely as possible, enjoying the savory tastes of salt &amp; grease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay I\u2019m ready\u201d Parker replied after licking some salt off of his hands, barely finishing a quarter of the bag. \u201cI\u2019ll fatten up these animals for you to eat\u201d. The Blob then held the alpha male\u2019s mouth shut as Parker then touched its belly &amp; began using his power. There was a strange side effect though. What was it?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I was just picking up a few things for the graduation party and these things start chasing me.

I'm too young to die!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when Parker was about to meet his end a pair of claws slashed the Sentinel. Before he knew it a short man who appeared to be in his late 20s or 30s appeared. The man wore a yellow and black outfit and was also muscular and hairy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Wolverine!\" Parker gasped as the mutant hero dismantled  the Sentinel before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ok kid?\" Wolverine asked in his usual gruff manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am now. It's an honor to be saved by a famous hero such as yourself. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any idea why that Sentinel was after you, bub?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just minding my own business when they started coming after me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're coming with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute!

Anytime he suggests food all around him become enthralled into eating. His powers happened to manifest six months ago, but he didn't realize it back then. He first unknowingly used his powers on his own father. At the time they were at a buffet. Now at the time they were at a buffet. The way his powers triggered is when he joked with his father about him eating out the buffet. Parker's father used to be an extremely athletic man, but over time and without Parker realizing it, he was not only making his father fatter, but his whole family as well. Currently his father was the fattest people at the office and his mother one of the fattest chefs in the state. Besides hunger, Parker's power of persuasion gradually brainwashes all who are near him into wanting to get fat. Yet this side effect can be broken if said thrall spent several weeks separated from Parker, consequently the thrall's willpower to fight their hunger would be obliterated. If the thrall wasn't under Parker's influence for long then they would return to normal within a few hours or a few days depending on their exposure to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that Parker and Wolverine were heading to Riley's Pizza Buffet, Parker's power of persuasion were subtly taking hold of Wolverine. All that was on Wolverine's mind was eating some pizza with some kid he just saved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the place. Let's eat.\" Parker said as he and Wolverine proceeded inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hearing Parker say \"Let's eat.\" Parker's power of persuasion intensified. Luckily Parker already paid for two when Wolverine went on a blitz for the buffet line. Parker stood in awe as Wolverine stacked two plates full of pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Dejavu. This reminds of the time my folks started putting on weight a few months ago. I'm sure it's due to Wolverine's healing factor that he has to eat a lot.</i> Parker thought not knowing that Wolverine was under his control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting a plate full of pizza Parker noticed that Wolverine had already clearer a few plates. Parker then notices the lunch rush arrive. The crowd was larger than usual since Parker's high school graduation was tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like everyone wants to eat pizza today.\" Parker mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIronically, after Parker finished talking everyone in the building was under Parker's influence.

I better do something before things get ugly.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can everyone please take their time? Just fill up your plates in a single file line so the rest of us may eat. Also the chefs may want to make some more pizza so the more ravenous customers can have something to eat if they are still hungry,\" Parker said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOddly enough everyone in the buffet headed Parker's \"words of wisdom\". Parker gave a sigh of relief as he walked to the buffet line to get himself some pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>My power is stronger than I realized. I wonder how far I can test my powers.

It's like every time this kid opens his mouth and mentions food Wolverine finds himself swayed.

However, Logan was his own personal project intended to test the full extent of Parker's powers of persuasion. To Parker's surprise Logan appeared to be bulking up faster than he expected. He theorized that Wolverine's healing factor made it easier for the new poundage to pile onto his stocky frame. Logan had managed to pack on 125 lbs. putting him at 425 lbs. given his adamantium skeleton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently Wolverine was trying to workout in order to lose weight. Unlike other thralls Logan tended to quickly break free from Parker's control every night. He contemplated on throwing Parker into the Danger Room, but with the rest of the X-Men slowly becoming enthralled Wolverine had few options to work with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to lose this weight. That damn kid keeps getting into my head. I don't know how much longer I can keep snapping out of his control. What's worse us that my healing factor makes it harder to lose this weight. Sure I'm starting to heal faster, but at the cost of my waistline,\" Logan grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter two hours Logan finished his workout. His tank top was drenched in sweat. It was now eight o'clock. Parker should be up by now. If Logan is lucky he could avoid Parker altogether. However, on his way to the shower he ran into Parker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning Mr. Logan. I see that your up early today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan lets out a low growl and pops his claws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what kind if stunt you're trying to pull kid, but ya better knock it off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker gulps. Logan may be a lot fatter, but he can still be irritable at times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy there big guy. Save that ferocity for today's eating contest. Remember you promised to enter the contest to prove that I'm not manipulating you,\" Parker said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolverine withdraws his claws as falls back under Parker's control. A smile forms on his chubby face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I totally forgot. I was just trying to build up my appetite. Yet I really do got to lose this poundage, bub.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure you do.
