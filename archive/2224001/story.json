No death and yes I know a bit unrealistic with rule 3 but if I can give an exmaple ( build falls down because of a Charizard's massive tail the build is mostly recked and people have seen better but it's still standing and the people can walk) is what you should be be going. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</td>",
