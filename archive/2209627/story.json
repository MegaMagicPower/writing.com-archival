Currently, you were wandering around Gotham City thinking about what to do next. All of a sudden you get a bright idea to test out your powers. But the question is who do you go to to test out your powers on? Do you go to a villain or to a super hero?</span></div></div>",

As you step closer to investigate, all of a sudden there is a loud rumbling as all the different Marvel characters come pouring out of the portal. There are different heroes and villains that you recognize such as Spider-Man, Captain Marvel, Black-Cat and a lot of others. They shake themselves off before they all head in different directions. You stand there stunned at what you just witnessed. In your amazement, you fail to notice the portal closes and disappears. Now, you think to yourself. \"Do I follow one of these heroes and villains from the Marvel Universe and test my powers on them?\" You stand there thinking until you suddenly get the idea to follow one of them but who?</span></div></div>",

You look around the park you are currently in trying to find any sign of her. All of a sudden, you have the feeling that you're being watched by someone. You look around the park for any sign of Cheetah. You don't see anything until you look up into a large tree not far from you.As you look upward into the tree, you see a pair of glowing feline eyes staring right back at you. \"Cheetah, I know you're up there.\" You nonchalantly call out to her. She then jumped out of the tree, landing in front of you. \"Have you finally made up your mind on which side to join?\" she questioned you. \"Well, I have a plan but I prefer to stay neutral.\" \"And what is your plan?\" she asked you as her tail swished side to side. After she asked you that, you grinned to yourself as you walked up to her. \"Cheetah, do you know about my power?\" You said while as you stood in front of her. \"No, only a few of us heroes and villains know about your power. Excluding me.\" You then put your hand on her shoulder. \"Well Minerva, my power allows me to grow and transform people into whatever I want and anyway I want. And I all have to do is just touch them.\" you say with a smug grin. Cheetah eyes widened as she realizes that you just touched her. You then see a list of options that only you can see.</span></div></div>",

You see an option to transform her into a kaiju. You've always loved kaiju movies like Godzilla and Pacific Rim so picking this option was an obvious choice for you. You pressed the option making the menu let out a little *beep* noise and with the menu saying \"transformation starting in 3...2...1...\". When the countdown hit one the menu disappeared. Realizing that the show was about to begin you quickly made some space between you and Cheetah. Cheetah saw that you were quite a ways from her. \"Why are you over there?\" she asked you curiously. \"Because the show is about to begin!\" \"What do you mean sh-\" she couldn't finish her sentence as a strange and somewhat pleasurable feeling overcame her entire body. Her body began to grow as she slowly transformed. Her lithe body gained muscle and fat at an incredible rate. \"Gh, What is h-happening to m-me? What am I becoming?\" Minerva groaned as she looked down at her hands and saw that her claws were lengthening. Her body continued to grow and increase in size until she reached 7 feet then 10 feet then 15 feet. Some of her fur was then replace by dark screen scales as her muzzle became longer and her teeth sharpened into fangs. She began to gain weight and height until she was a 20 foot tall blob of muscle and fat. Her breasts also swelled up in size until they were ginormous to match her body. Her whole body was ripped with muscle to carry her new weight. Cheetah's changes weren't done yet. She then sprouted two large curled horn out of her head as well as a couple rows of spikes ran down her back. Her last change was that her orange eyes changed to a bright green. With her transformation complete she was now a hybrid cheetah-reptile. \"GROOOOOOARR!!!\" Minerva roared out as she flexed her mighty arms. You then let out a whistle at what you've done to her. \"God damn! I love my power.\" \"Minerva come pick me up.\" You shout out to her. She heard you and made her over to you before grabbing you and placing you on her head. \"Ah another plus side to my power is that they'll never harm or kill me.\" You said as you laid down on your stomach and pet her head causing Cheetah to make a weird mix of a purr and hiss. \"Now what do I do next?\"</span></div></div>",

You whisper into Cheetah's ear and tell her the direction you saw Felicia heading toward. With that done, you quickly grab on to her fur as Cheetah bolts for Black Cat's location. Cars, trees, bushes and the pavement were knocked loose and around as Minerva ran through the city streets. You then thought to yourself. 'Hm, I wonder what to do to Felicia? Eh, I'll figure it out when we find her.' You shrugged to yourself. It wasn't long until you saw a black and white figure running around a corner. You told Minerva to follow her. Minerva nodded as ran after Black Cat and caught up to her before grabbing her. \"Hey, let me go!\" she yelled as she struggled and squirmed to get out of Cheetah's grasp. You told Minerva to set Black Cat on the nearby roof. She did so and you dropped down onto the roof with Black Cat. \"Who are you? And who is that?\" She shouted at you. \"Okay, first of all, calm down. Second of all, her name is Minerva and what happened is I used my power on her and transformed her also my name is (Y/N).\" You then reach out your hand to her for her to shake. While freaked out at first and dismissing the fact you told her you transformed Cheetah. She then smiled before shaking your hand. \"My name's Black Cat. Nice to meet you.\" You then activate your power and time freezes one again as the menu pops up again. \"Now what to do?\"</span></div></div>",
