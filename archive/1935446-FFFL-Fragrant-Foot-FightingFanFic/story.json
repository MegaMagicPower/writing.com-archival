This was the type of neighborhood her mother had once told her to avoid, on her way to the dojo for her daily practice. Boarded business, streets littered with trash, and broken streetlamps potmarked a neighborhood which seemed to be devoid of life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bus driver had asked repeatedly if this was where she reaaaaaallllyy needed to depart, and Penny's polite response was that yeah, she'd had the correct spot. With a smile on her brown skinned face, and her trademark afro puffs on each side, she'd waved at the bus driver as he drove away, shaking his head the whole time as hurried to leave the \"rough part of town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny hiked up her bookbag and began walking down the street, memories of what she'd left behind bouncing around her 20 year old head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt'd all began when she was sixteen, and had come home from school. She always made it a point to arrive home before heading to the dojo, to see if her mother needed help with anything. The first indication that things had been wrong was the lingering smell of sweat and unwashed feet hanging in the air of her home. Penny had wrinkled her nose in disgust, thinking maybe her mother had forgotten to wash the laundry. As she stepped further inside she hadn't been prepared for the horror that awaited her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the living room was her mother laying on the floor, seemingly on the verge of unconsciousness. Standing over her was an Amazon of a woman, statuesque, and refined in a black leotard and leather jacket, looking for all the world like a biker chick. Her long flowing black hair fell behind her head in a braided bun, and she flashed a wide black lipstick grin at Penny as the teenager looked on horrified. Think a certain Amazon heroine with a bad girl streak and you had Rachel The Ravager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat made the scene even worse is that Rachel was laying a long, and black toe nail polished foot on her mother's face, rubbing her sweaty and long toes over her mouth, nose, and forehead, leaving a trail of slimy sweat all over her face. And she was laughing as if it was the most casual action in all the world. Penny swore she could see tendrils of stink wafting up from the size 10 ballet flats that Rachel had unshod to get her maldrous toes on her mother's poor face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GET YOUR NASTY FEET OF MY MOM!!!!\" Penny yelled rushing at the tall woman, ready to do battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny spun a roundhouse kick at the tall woman, who blocked her outstretched foot as if swatting a fly. Penny dropped her leg and attempted to punch the tall woman, but she dodged each potential blow as if she were a leaf gliding in the wind. This only strove to frustrate Penny all the more, and her anger was such that she barely dodged the punch, but just barely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe statuesque lady's fist grazed the side of her head sending her falling to the floor, dazed. It was then that she realized she saw the two bodyguards come from her kitchen, both barefoot with equally disgusting looking corn, and callused caked feet, rushing at her to lay some more damage upon her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Halt,\" the lady in black yelled, stopping both of her underlings, one Asian, the other African American. Beautiful, and statuesque like their boss, their beauty was offset by the seething looks they gave Penny as she lay on the floor, her head still somewhat ringing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lady in black removed her foot from her mother's face, who moaned in relief from the onslaught of foot funk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny's attacker leaned toward her on the floor, and smiled those pearly whites. Her eyes were a piercing green, and bored holes into Penny's soul as she tried to muster up what little courage that was slowly fading. This woman could, and might do anything she wanted with her, and her mom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there was nothing she could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're Lizzy's little brat, huh?\" the lady said with a sneer cupping Penny's chin in her hand. \"The one she left the tournament for, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look's like she's taught you some stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked back at her fallen foe with a wicked grin and said \"Apparently not enough!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back at Penny, with a lick of her lips, \"When she comes to, tell her, there's more where this came from, if she ever opens up her mouth again about the tournament!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shoved her face in front of Penny's gripping her face forcefully and whispered from her black death like tinted lips, \"Otherwise she gets the toes in her mouth. And believe me..... she doesn't want to gag on those.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way, my name's Rachel. Rachel the Ravager. Look me up if you want to get your ass whipped, like I did 'ole mom over there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny had been seething at that point and yelled, to the disbelief of the two guards, \"I'll whoop your butt, you old smelly footed bitch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Ravager face had contorted into a fierce anger, with a flourish she whipped out her flat, and held it in front of Penny's nose, which immediately began to twitch as an assault of cheese and sweat assaulted her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world grew blurry, as the shoe was stuffed over her nose and mouth she heard the final words before passing out \"Like mother, like daughter.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd awoken an hour later, with her head on her mother's lap, as her crying mother laid out a story of escape from an illegal fighting tournament in her early fighting days, how she'd been approached by the FBI to take out said tournament, which had ensured a visit from one of her fiercest former rivals, Rachel. As her mom swore to not cooperate with the authorities for Penny's safety, Penny swore that she would find this tournament, and get her revenge for the suffering her mother had experienced<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter years, and years of practice and searching for the storied FFFL she now stood in front of a door which led to her upward climb for revenge. She wiggled her sweat caked toes in anticipation in a pair of ratty shoes.....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Upon knocking on the door and providing the needed secret password to enter (Jam of Toes), Penny entered a dimly lit boxing gym. In the middle of the seedy looking building stood a standard ring, where two women were sparring viciously. Even from where she stood, Penny's nose wrinkled from the sweat encased shoes of each of the ladies, as they traded blows. And the smell of funk and sweat wasn't confined to just the ring. Everywhere within the room a wide assortment of women worked out barefoot, with sweat and dirt caked toes slapping the bare floor, or sweat drenched mats. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny fought the urge to cover her nose, knowing she would have to come correct when it came to this unsavory group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lil' girl! The name's Alice. What bracket are you in?\" Penny heard a voice demand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning she saw a short motherly Asian woman, with huge bifocals staring her down, with clipboard in hand. Wearing a pair of sandals, which she tapped impatiently as, Penny once again refused to cover her nose as the sweat drenched toes of her questioner slapped the same sandals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, whatever one Rachel is in,\" Penny responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Ravager?\" Alice responded with a whistle, and her foot stopped in mid tap. \"Well lil' girl, if that's the way you want it. The road to get to Rachel is going to be a hard one. A long and smelly one at that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf of the gymnasium's occupants had stopped what they were doing to listen to the exchange, as the mention of the FFFL most prominent fighter always piqued the interest of many.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny, seeing that she had the attention of most of the women, laid into her pre-arranged spiel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And for anyone who thinks they can step in my way of getting to Rachel The Rank Foot, better step aside. Otherwise my sweaty ass feet will lay them out. I've got enough toe jam to destroy an army of you wimp's!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice arched an eyebrow as Penny now had drawn the grimace faced, fist punching ire of the gym's occupants. Most began to wiggle their slimy toes in anticipation of shutting this \"brat\" up, and sending her on her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so, little girl?\" a voice remarked. \"I'll take that offer, and hand  you an ass whooping you've neeeevvvver experienced. A stinky one at that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to the voice Penny turned to see......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Latasha: A product of the ATL, Latasha was the resident bully of her college campus. Her favorite past time was to take her size 10 slimy, callus caked toes and ram them down the mouth of many unfortunate classmates. On one such occasion she stalked a nerdy girl home, smacked her for the hell of it, and smothered the poor girl out under her toes. She is haughty, beautiful, stuck up, and see's the world as her oyster. After living the life of a hip hop video dancer, and kickboxer instructor, Latasha entered the FFFL to show \"these bitches who a real queen is\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Officer Bridgett: One of NY's finest, Bridgett is one of the force's best and brightest. If best equate's to, being a hard ass, dirty cop, then Bridgette's your lady. Think a female version of The Big Boss man, and you've got an idea. Thing is, Bridgett's always had a problem with her smelly size 10's. She'd always clear out her police academy locker room when after drills, and long runs with her smelly feet. On one occasion when she'd wiggled her lint infested toes, one chick had the audacity to laugh at her sweat encrusted toes. 5 minutes later the chick was moaning in pain as she lay crumpled on the floor, with one of Bridgett's smelly socks stuffed in her mouth, and those same toes she had laughed at earlier smothering her tiny toes. Bridgett was even known to use those maldrous toes in off the books interrogations.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Penny turned around to see a tall and beautiful looking African American woman in sweats and a T-shirt which read \"Bitches Come Round...\". Leaning back on the edge of the ring, the statuesque beauty eyed the defiant Penny with a hint of derision, smirking with arms folded. A large set of feet were encased in a skin hugging pair of ballet flats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard what I said lil' chick,\" the brown skinned beauty said, now studying her bright purple painted, well manicured nails. \"So you best be moving on unless you want a grade-A ass whooping tonight. Last I heard, punk bitches don't deserve to be allowed through the doors of this place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a righteous fury Penny strode right up to the face of this aloof woman, and stood her ground in front of her. Alice and the other gym occupants watched from a cautious distance, sensing the rise in the tense situation playing out in front of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You talk a lot, and I mean a lot of mess for someone just cooling by the boxing ring!\" Penny exclaimed, leaning in close to her soon to be opponent. \"Talking usually means the other person's scared of what could happen!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bitch, please,\" the woman coolly replied. \"You think you come in here talking mess, and that's going to get you up the ladder. Please. Ain't going to happen. Figure I might as well use your face as a floor mat for my crusty ass toes before some real competition shows up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny wiggled her slimy toes in her beat up trainers, itching for the chance to shut this chick up. With her luscious lips coated in black lipstick, and her porcelain features, Penny really, really wanted to knock this chick down a peg or two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You looking kind of hard lady,\" the lady said with a sinister sneer. Leaning forward, pressing her chest against Penny, the newcomer was shocked to feel two erect nipples sticking out of her competitors shirt, onto her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lady grabbed Penny's arms suddenly, and reversed positions with her, pressing her tightly against the back of the boxing ring. Leaning in closer her beautiful competitor whispered in a breathy rush, \"By the way, name's Latasha. See, if you want we can dispense with the bullshit, I take you back to my place, and take you under my wing. My even let you suck my toes if you're good. I've done it before. Turned some of these new chicks out, got 'em sucking toe jam, and filing my corns. Kiss 'em. Fondle 'em. Do other things. Then I train 'em. They aint NEVER the same. And some come back to become winners.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this time Latasha's lips were so close to Penny's that she could smell the faint scent of peppermint coming from Latasha's breath. She found herself mesmerized by those beautiful pillows as Latasha spun her spiders trap, and Penny soon felt herself falling into. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGod this woman is beautiful, I'm feeling myself becoming, becoming, oh God I want to taste her lips.....Penny thought, biting her lip in small pout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's it 'lil chick.\" Latasha said with a small grin. \"Keep falling. I'll get you like I used to get those lame nerds back at college. I use to leave 'em begging to get out from under my stank ass toes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you haven't seen my beauties now that I think about it. Let's rectifiy that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's what broke Penny out. As soon as Latasha produced both of her bare size 11's from her shoes, a foul, acrid, cheesy stench filled the arena's air. Even those standing far away found their noses wrinkling as her massive mocha colored toes slapped the floor with a steady deluge of sweat. What made it even worse was the sorry state of affairs of her feet, including corn marked toes, calluses caked heels and soles, and chipped toenail polish which had been worn away by the steady production of sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get your hands off of me!\" Penny yelled, slapping Latasha with a resounding hit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLatasha, stumbled back, shocked, and her wide eyed shocked expression reflected her confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You slap me!?\" Latasha yelled. \"How did that happen!? HOW!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, from where I'm standing, she raised her hand and hit you. Yeah, that's about what happened.\" Alice explained nonchalantly with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLatasha whirled on the woman and yelled, \"Smart ass, after I'm done with her, you're next!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You leave her out of this!\" Penny screamed. \"Get you're punk ass in the ring, and bring your nasty ass toes. I'm not about to be anyone's \"foot bitch\". You'll be tasting my toes at the end of this, and Alice's!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLatasha regained her composure somewhat, rubbing her bruised mouth with a small smile.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to enjoy breaking you, and stuffing my stank ass toes in your nose and mouth! Let's do this!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The spectators of the FFFL swarmed around the squared circle to witness what was sure to be another textbook squash by the boisterous yet always brutal Latasha, with few keeping their eyes on the unproven yet upstart newcomer, Penny. <br>\r\nBoth opponents convened on opposite sides of the ring, waiting for the inevitable bell while the audience continued to whisper amongst themselves the always exciting question of who would win, who would lose, and who would end up the loser's footslave. <br>\r\nOn one side, the dainty yet determined Penny faced her opposition without fear on one side of the wrestling-style squared circle. Dressed in a white T-shirt and black tights with worn trainers hugging around her already sweaty feet, Penny was the ideal image of a newbie who may have just gotten way over her head. Her eyes, defiant and unwavering, stared daggers into the overconfident and pompous Latasha who reciprocated the staredown with a look of utter vehemence and derision. <br>\r\nWith the crude message adorning her T-shirt and ratty brown flats that looked liable to unravel at any moment, Latasha was like a feral animal yearning to be released from its chain, itching to sink her teeth into fresh meat. <br>\r\nStill touching the slightly throbbing bruise on her upper lip where Penny\u2019s fingers had swatted her, Latasha was still in a state of disbelief that Penny managed to get the first hit in but quickly shrugged it off as she pulled against the ropes to warm herself up.<br>\r\n\u201cLatasha\u2019s gonna kill you!\u201d the crowd sang along in unison, almost if on cue to unsettle Penny and motivate Latasha.<br>\r\nHer lips, coated with black lipstick, pursed as she continued pulling against the ropes to get her joints ready for what should be another routine humiliation. <br>\r\nPacing frantically from ring post to ring post, Latasha seemed to get more and more riled up the more she eyed Penny who projected an aura of calmness and confidence that masked her own internal uneasiness in starting a fight with her mouth that her fists (or feet) might not be able to finish. <br>\r\nIt was only a matter of time before Alice had a hammer poised beside the opening bell, and after snorting in disbelief at the stupidity that was Penny basically forfeiting her life to Latasha, tapped the hammer against the metallic surface. <br>\r\n<i>Ding Ding Ding!</i><br>\r\nAlmost immediately, Latasha sprang into action without even waiting for the preliminary lockup. Charging at the petite Penny with both arms raised to squish her into submission, she certainly had the crowd behind her as she looked for the full splash in the turnbuckle. <br>\r\nUnfortunately for her, Penny was not so easily intimidated as the victim of said body splash. <br>\r\nJust as Latasha was about to connect, Penny sidestepped out of the way to avoid being flattened. Ducking beneath her forearms and reappearing behind her, she waited until the larger woman fell victim to her own momentum before going back in. <br>\r\nBumping her head against the turnbuckle pad, she was momentarily dizzy but that was all the time Penny needed to capitalize and gain the early advantage. <br>\r\nWailing on her with a flurry of forearms to the neck and face, Penny was absolutely relentless in her frontal assault on Latasha. Nailing her with open-handed strikes to her vulnerable face and knee strikes to the sternum, she continued tearing into Latasha with furious blows. <br>\r\nThe crowd\u2019s surprise that Penny refused to buckle to Latasha\u2019s bullish presence was certainly short-lived, as they began chanting for Latasha to take back control of the match which was seemingly inevitable anyways.<br>\r\nJust as Penny thrusted her fourth knee strike into Latasha\u2019s stomach, the more experienced fighter caught the knee with one forearm looped around the back of her knee. Preventing her from pulling back, Latasha continued to hold on even though Penny clubbed the back of her head furiously.<br>\r\nNow that Latasha overcame her dizzy spell, she relied on her size advantage to lift Penny up into the air with the smaller woman still pounding her. In another feat of strength, she threw Penny backwards into the ear without so much as a grunt.<br>\r\nLanding awkwardly on her back knee in the process, Penny lost valuable recovery time glaring down at her knee before returning focus to Latasha who was still cowering in the corner.<br>\r\nDeciding to go back on the offensive while Latasha was still on the defensive, Penny charged back in, completely oblivious to Latasha\u2019s strategy. <br>\r\nSnapping out of her previous groggy state, Latasha suddenly straightened up and connected with a swift superkick to the chin, catching Penny off guard, off balance, and definitely off her game. <br>\r\nThe sound of her sweat-dampened sole smacking against the feisty newcomer\u2019s mouth echoed across the gym much to the delight of the crowd as well as the disdain of its recipient. <br>\r\nCrumpling to the ground as warm blood began swelling up in her mouth, Penny was feeling the effects of not only being kicked in the mouth, but by letting her guard down against an opponent that she could not afford to underestimate.<br>\r\nFinding her footing as she crawled away, Penny was met by wild jeers and taunts by the audience who were relieved to see Latasha back in control. If only for now. <br>\r\nShaking off her blows like they were mere gnats annoying her, Latasha stalked towards the downed Penny with a confident smirk once again plastered across her face.<br>\r\nOblivious to her, the novice was just about to get a taste of her own medicine.<br>\r\nUttering a war cry as she got off to a running start, Latasha intercepted Penny just as she was about to fully get back up and grabbed her by the hair.<br>\r\nThen, she yanked her downwards and subsequently slammed her back down to the canvas without mercy. Feeling her neck contort violently was not a pleasant feeling for Penny, who continued to see stars.<br>\r\n\u201cYou. Stupid. Little. Bitch!\u201d Latasha screamed angrily, emphasizing each word by slamming Penny\u2019s head back to the canvas. Feeling her rage subside with every blow dealt to Penny, Latasha began to eventually let up but not before working up a mouthful of saliva and spitting it directly in Penny's face. It was the ultimate sign of disrespect, and the crowd was eating every second of it up. <br>\r\nStarting to see black spots by the end of the hair pulling, Penny groaned inwardly as Latasha leaned in to whisper into her ear.<br>\r\n\u201cYa see, I was just gonna let you eat my toejam like a good little foot bitch. But then you had to go and touch me. So now, after I finish rearranging your face, you\u2019re gonna be eating my shit!\u201d She hissed venomously, her words almost totally lost on Penny whose eyes had already glossed over after being slammed to the mat so many times.<br>\r\n\u201cCome on,\u201d she yelled, literally dragging Penny like a rag doll behind her as she sauntered towards the ropes.<br>\r\nWith the raucous crowd jeering their approval at Latasha\u2019s regained control of the match, Penny felt her hair crying out in protest as Latasha threatened to tear them out of their roots like weeds. Still feeling the dizzy, she had no idea where she was and was quickly regretting her initial tenacity. <br>\r\n\u201cAck!\u201d Penny gagged loudly as Latasha threw her throat first against the bottom rope. Wincing as she felt the rope tug against her windpipe, she attempted to roll from underneath the ropes and escape but two spectators quickly grabbed her arms to keep her pinned down.<br>\r\n\u201cOh you\u2019re gonna get it now, Barbie doll!\u201d one of them cackled, shooting her a knowing grin as Penny struggled to escape.<br>\r\n\u201cBetter get them lips ready,\u201d the other one echoed, making mocking puckering sounds with her lips as Latasha towered above the downed Penny.<br>\r\nRaising her back foot, Latasha relished in then driving her heel into the base of Penny's neck to initiate a usually illegal rope choke. Grabbing onto the top rope to support her weight, Latasha kept her foot firmly planned on the back of the novice's neck with the crowd jeering their approval.<br>\r\nFeeling the ropes tighten against her windpipe and threaten to suffocate her, Penny continued hyperventilating as her face only reddened as a result of near asphyxiation. <br>\r\n\"Betcha' ain't never felt anything like this, huh bitch?\" Latasha roared with laughter, almost drunk off her own dominance.<br>\r\nFiguring that enough was enough, Latasha gradually let up and allowed Penny to catch her breath, however short that may be. Not wasting any more time, she then proceeded to kick off one of her flats, revealing her naked ebony foot in all of its glory. <br>\r\nScrunching and spreading her purple-painted toes against the mat, she let out an almost ecstatic breath in feeling the fabric beneath her soles. And soon enough, it would be tainted with Penny's blood. <br>\r\nWith Penny still clutching her bruised throat and still on two knees, it was easy pickings to line up the next maneuver for the dominant opponent. Choosing her opening just as Penny pushed off the bottom rope, Latasha connected with a swift roundhouse to Penny's chest. <br>\r\nThe top of her foot cracked off Penny's left breast, not only knocking the wind out of her but very nearly almost knocking her lunch out as well. Barely resisting the urge to vomit, she fell flat on the floor staring blankly into the ceiling lights. In between wincing between breaths, Penny began to realize that perhaps she really did get in over her head, if the past two minutes weren't any indication.<br>\r\nThe sound of Latasha's footsteps seemed to spell doom for Penny, with the African-American powerhouse still showboating for the crowd. <br>\r\n\"I'd stay down if I was you,\" Latasha smirked overconfidently, before driving her heel into Penny's throat for yet another degrading maneuver. Her fleshy sole rubbing slightly against her throat, it was an unorthodox yet still legal pinning move. The only question would be if Penny had the gumption to kick out and continue fighting. <br>\r\n\"Count!\" she ordered an offscreen referee, evidently Alice who began counting the pinfall to signal the end of the contest.<br>\r\n\"1! 2!-\"</span></div></div>",

Latasha was standing in the middle of the ring in her under garments she was wearing a lingerie pair of garments that looked really expensive.She walks towards Penny and crotches down near her,Then out of no where Latasha kisses Penny.Their lips locked as the taste of peppermint assualts Penny's tongue Latasha ravaged Penny's mouth with her tongue. Penny was caught so of guard her opponent was kissing her she was also starting to like it her nipples were becoming erect from this dominant African American beauty kiss.<br>\r\n   Latasha pulls herself away and says \"Look bitch I've taken pity on you I'm going to train you  into one of the best fighters the FFFL has ever seen so your little punk ass can take on Alice, right now you don't even stand a chance against her let alone that bitch ass officer Bridgett\" said Latasha.\"Why'd you kiss me?\" Asked Penny still confused and blushing<br>\r\n  \"I kissed you because you are going to taste something so bad that your punk ass may give up and go home plus you were eying me before pouting you bitch lips at me\" said Latasha \"Trust me kid I saw something in you, you may be able to take that crazy bitch down once and for all but you need training first.\" <br>\r\n  Penny found what Latasha said as odd she was one of the people that was with Alice and Bridgett that fateful day why does she hate them so much. <br>\r\n  \"Ok, so right now you are a foot bitch no where near the amount of experience and training to be able to take on any one understand?\" Penny nods her head \"Good now I will be called Mistress Latasha not Coach, not Latasha, only Mistress Latasha also I will spar with you once you prove yourself to me.\" Penny nods <br>\r\n  \"Alright let's get to training first things first endurance I need to know how tough you really are, you will taste my toes and smell my stank ass feet understand until you either pass out or until 10 minutes are up ready?\" Penny gulps \"Yes, Mistress Latasha\" Latasha smiles \"Good little foot bitch\" <br>\r\n  Penny opens her mouth for Latasha foot instantly a taste of rancid feet hits her tongue, Penny gags as she tries to endure she sucks on Latasha toes starting with her big toe. \"Lick in between the toes, toe jam helps you get use to it\" instructed Latasha. Latasha starts to moan  in delight to Penny soft mouth worshipping her feet as Penny's tongue slips past in between her toes. <br>\r\n  \"If only you kissed as good huh bitch, it's like you've done this before you've been some ones foot bitch before you dirty hoe.\" This went on for about 2 minutes Latasha then forced Penny to smell her feet \"You need to get used to the smell of feet Alice's feet smell ten times worse than this.\"Penny felt as if she was suffocating the rancid smell pierced her nose as she coughed and wheezed at the smell, her eyes watered she felt like she was going to pass out she only had 8 minutes left to prove herself.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Squinting her eyes angrily and making a faint hissing sound, Penny turned around to look at whoever was daring enough to challenge her in one of her more ambitious moods. \"Who said that? I take you on, whoever you are!\" \"Ohh, really confident, are we? Let's see if we can't change that...\" The same voice from before replied and suddenly, Penny also saw someone making her way through the crowd in front of her. To her great surprise, said woman was wearing a police officer's uniform, despite being in a place like this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... you are a fighter in the FFFL?\" Penny said unbelieving, tilting her head. To her great shame, most of the women in the hall started to laugh sneeringly at her inexperience. Officer Bridgett laughed the loudest \"Bwahahahaha, oh girl, how do you expect to rise up in our ranks in any way, let alone challenge our finest girl if you don't even know who I am?\" Penny growled and clenched her fists. \"Well, by beating some of you, of course! Starting with <i>you</i>, if you insist!\" Penny taunted, pointing at the Officer. Bridgett wasn't very affected though, only chuckling mildly and shrugging. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, this is exactly why I despise people like you. You just walk in here like you belong here, talk big about beating people you don't even know and on top of that, you simply have no manners. The only reason I'm willing to put up with you is because you need to be <i>taught a lesson</i>...\" Bridgett sneered, cracking her knuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny gulped quietly as she took a good look on this policewoman. She looked like she was in her early 30's, with a very fit, muscular physique. She was rather tall and intimidating at that, a tad bigger than Penny herself. Her face gave an atmosphere of the utmost authority, as well. Her steel-like, grayish-blue eyes stared coldly and unforgiving, her face was overally very sharp and hard looking, with an expression of a permanent scowl on it. Her pale blonde hair was kept very shortly and neatly and all around, she didn't look at all like someone who would visit a place like this regularly. Officer Bridgett snickered as she saw the confused look on Penny's face and took a step forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny's eyes darted down to her foot, which was clad in a shining black leather shoe and making a faint, squishy sound upon hitting the ground, as Officer Bridgett spoke \"Oh, I know what you're thinking. 'This woman looks far too orderly and lawful to belong in a place such as this!' Right?\" Penny's eyes darted back up to her face and she gasped because that was exactly what she had been thinking! \"Well let me tell you, it's not exactly the worst thing that I am here, even for the law itself. In here, many wannabe gangster girls get to spend their energy on fighting each other, instead of... I don't know, stealing things or something, whatever it is you do...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny felt a spark of anger rush through herself and she also took a step forward. \"Either way, I usually end up teaching them a good lesson. That mostly consists of; Don't fucking mess with me. Or you'll end up face-first under my sweat-dripping feet. And trust me, you don't want that!\" Penny clenched her teeth and hissed \"I'll take my chances...\" \"Heh... Hehe!\" Officer Bridgett's spirits seemed to rise. \"If you still insist on fighting me, I'll let you smell my feet all you want! I guess I should warn you that even though my feet are naturally very, <i>very</i> strongly sweating ones, it's especially bad right now, because I've been training here for a few hours... Oh, and I worked a real long shift yesterday, so I didn't even get the chance to take a shower. Hehe, thinking about it... Even considering how bad my feet always are, this is a <i>very</i> bad time to get caught underneath them! Not to mentioned the socks I'm wearing... I always wear these for training. For work, as well! How about giving them a try, huh?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny scoffed and rolled her eyes. \"When will you shut up... And when will we <i>go</i>?\" Bridget gave her a seriously disapproving look. \"All right, now you're on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust a few minutes later, Penny found herself in the ring, with nobody behind her except for a laughing, booing crowd. Officer Bridgett on the other hand was nonchalantly leaning against the ropes, with some of the other veteran fighters whispering things into her ears. Penny sighed, this wasn't looking all too fair, but what did she expect? Suddenly, that short Asian from before showed up again. Much unlike the audience, Alice wasn't looking all too excited. \"Well... in this here corner, we have... uh, what was your name again?\" \"...Penny.\" \"Ah, right. With a record of zero fights; Penny!\" Penny slapped her palm to her face as most of the audience laughed even harder right now. \"And over here... In that corner there, we have... With a record of 27 victories, 8 defeats... Officer 'The Law' Bridgett!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the crowd was cheering loudly, screaming things like \"Smash her into the ground, Bridgett!\", \"Show her the power of justice!\", \"Make her taste your feet! Your incredibly devastating feet!\" and \"THE LAW! THE LAWWW!\" \"Alright, alright, you know the rules, I suppose, right?\" Alice yawningly chimed in \"When your opponent goes down or gives up, you may only use your feet for additional humiliation and psychological damage, further physical force is forbidden. No weapons, and other than that... Yeah, I think that's it. Fight!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly for a woman at her height, Alice jumped out of the way with extreme speed and agility. Penny was almost a bit taken aback... And almost paid the price for that as well, as Bridgett came charging towards her like a raging bull! In the last second, Penny managed to jump to the side, making Bridgett miss her and run straight into the ropes... Which she used to fling herself back at her target once more! Penny growled and tried to escape once more, but Bridgett was too fast and rammed her shoulder-first, driving her all the way to the opposite side and into the ropes! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny groaned as Bridgett pushed into her with all the might of her well-toned muscles, squeezing the air out of her. \"Hah! This is easier than I thought...\" Bridgett taunted before swiftly grabbing Penny and attempting to force her to the ground with pure, blunt strength! Penny felt that she was losing and managed to kick Bridgett in the back of her lower left leg, effectively sweeping her foot off the ground! Sensing a chance, Penny tried to push the unbalanced Officer over... And was promptly rewarded with the palm of Bridgett's hand, smacking her squarely in the face and sending her flying away! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now <i>that's</i> what I call a bitchslap!\" Penny heard Alice comment as she landed some distance away, barely avoiding tumbling to the ground... When Bridgett came rushing towards her once more!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow is this fight going to develop for Penny?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Penny tried her best to best that wicked officer in hand-to-hand combat, but she was simply not strong enough. The fight continued for a little while, but it was steadily looking worse and worse for Penny!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny was not at all unskilled in rough street fighting, in fact, she's had more than enough chances to practise and perfect it. But this Officer woman... She was just too damn good! Penny narrowly avoided a punch and attempted to counter, there was Bridgett's hand again, hitting her straight in the jaw! Penny dodged a wide swing, but before she could regain her balance, a swift kick to her stomach sent her tumbling backwards. She tried an aggressive assault, but Bridgett simply caught both of her arms by her wrists, twisted them aside... And then slammed her forehead into Penny's face, causing her to see stars and completely lose her balance!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOfficer Bridgett simply pushed her over and attempted to finally wrestle her to the ground! Penny tried a last, desperate attempt at fighting back by punching at Bridgett's stomach, but her muscles were hard as steel and the Officer retaliated by picking her up and slamming her to the ground once more, abusing all the destructive force of gravity!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Penny's body slammed into the ground of the ring, although somewhat bouncy to avoid serious injury, she felt the air being knocked out of her lungs! Officer Bridgett lost no time in taking advantage of the situation and swiftly sat down on Penny's chest, forcing both of her arms away with her own hands and leaving her utterly defenseless! Making her feet ready to kick off her shoes at any time, Bridgett placed them down Penny's chin and then started another proud series of taunts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well... Just look now! You just had to challenge me, didn't you? And where did it take you? Directly down my feet! Well, I'd say you're basically beaten anyway now, so the only thing I can do in this kind of situation is... making you smell my feet!\" Officer Bridgett outright screamed those last words out and kicked off both of her shoes at the same time! Penny could only gasp in panic as she desperately stared at those huge, threatening feet in front of her... clad in utterly disgusting, completely discolored and obviously well too long worn socks, literally dripping with footsweat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause of her position, said sweat, stale and acidic as the most lethal poison kept dropping down on her unfortunate body. Wet, hot drops kept pounding away at her sensitive skin, biting into it like distant traces of a fierce fire. But then, the smell hit Penny. And even though she had thought she was prepared for any pair of smelly feet...  She hadn't been ready for those two!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon taking her first sniff, an incredibly thick, heavy and nauseating stench of stale, well-aged cheese, litres of gathered up sweat, traces of vinegar and old popcorn, all those things combined with the classic scent of unwashed feet to create a true hellish cocktail of immense foot aroma, to be served directly upon Penny's helpless nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd directly applied to her nose it was as Bridgett suddenly pushed both of her huge feet forward, covering Penny's entire face under her long, fleshy soles of agony. Even without the stench, the pure heat and moisture of those feet would have been unbearable for poor Penny, never mind the fact that they were now rubbing all across her face and literally drenching it in stale sweat by doing so... But yes, with the stench applied as well, Penny's suffering was increased tenfold!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny thought she was literally going insane as she was forced to take another breath, this time directly from inbetween Bridgett's pungent, slimy toes. The musky, sweaty stench was so piercing and heavy that Penny was sure she actually passed out for the fraction of a second as everything around her went black and void and only the incredibly strong, overwhelming aroma of feet remained. Penny chocked and gagged behind those sweaty barrier of socks, she tried to scream and cough but everything that came out was a desperate muffled sound. \"Hmmmmghh... Hnnnghffff... Hmmmphh!\" Were her pitiful screams of suffering, but everybody else in the hall just point their fingers at her and laughed, quite pleased with seeing the arrogant new girl getting what she seemingly deserved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Bridgett kept kneading her sweaty soles into her face, more and more sweat was pushed out, which was now even running down Penny's face and started to drench even her clothes in the offending perfume of sweaty feet. As she took more forced breathes right under those walls of pure stench, Penny felt herself growing weaker and weaker... Everything started to turn swiftly and all her senses seemed to fail her... Maybe... Maybe at least everything would be over quickly?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo such luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBridgett suddenly pulled her feet back and for some reason remained them away from Penny's face for a while. As Penny's vision began to clear anew, she found out why! Bridgett was busy pulling her disgustingly wet, steaming socks off her feet and had apparently been talking for the entire while! \"...for you to go to sleep right now, oh no! You still have to taste something! Open up, I hope it tastes well!\" Before Penny could even hope to protest, both of Bridgett's incredibly sweaty socks were being shoved toe-areas first into her mouth! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny cringed and felt her eyes tearing up as she suddenly sensed tastes no human being should ever be forced to taste... The pungent flavor of Bridgett's overworked work socks! And to make matters worse... Bridgett's feet were now free again as well, quite literally!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer bare, gleamingly moist sole descended upon Penny's face once more, trapping her helpless nose directly inbetween the toes of her right foot! Penny started to squirm and buckle under Bridgett's heavy body, but it was beyond useless. Her hands weakly tapped against Bridgett's huge, warm feet, but she could not move them one centimetre. Penny was at the point where she was willing to give up anything. Even her greatest dreams and desires she was ready to throw away, if only she could escape the stench and taste of those terrible feet on her face! She tried to plead, to scream, but through the thick socks in her mouth, not a single sound was heard!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanic set in in Penny as she realised that she was now utterly and completely helpless. Even though she wanted to end this torture with all her might... There was nothing she could do, and nobody would help her, either. All she could do was lie around uselessly and sniff those huge, sweaty feet, firmly plastered to her face. \"Yeah, smell my feet. Sniff them good... They should be nice and strong, today... Hah, I'd be amazed if you ever smell anything again...\" the distant voice of Bridgett seemed to speak, but from somewhere far, far away. Penny simply kept on sniffing, poisoning herself further and further with the sickengly thick scent of Bridgett's feet, over and over again, until she finally accepted defeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny sucked one last time on the rancid socks in her mouth while taking one especially deep and lethal breath through her nose, sniffing Bridgett's toes directly... Before she was allowed to pass away into sweet, sweet unconsciousness.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But then, a certain voice was heard by her ears and instantly, a flash of burning bright anger seethed through every fiber of Penny's self, flooding her with adrenaline and clearing everything up once more.<br>\r\nIt was the voice of Rachel. The Ravager!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well, well... Look who didn't learn her lesson four years ago... I suppose I was a little sloppy, although you did pass out incredibly quickly back then. Anyway... This time, I'll make <i>sure</i> you don't forget it!\" Rachel screamed at her, coming closer slowly and threateningly. Each of her steps were making loud, resonating sounds... A typical \"clop clop\" of hard material hitting floor and an even worse \"squish squish\" of something huge, soft and smelly swimming around in its own juices, in a confined space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Rachel's scowling face appeared in Penny's field of vision; Directly over her head. Her long, gleaming black hair was hanging down and looked like long, deadly tentrils of the mawn of hell itself, ready stab into Penny's tender flesh. For a moment, Penny just stared breathlessly into the Ravager's brutal, cold green eyes, which were gazing at her with such intensity that Penny felt her innermost self being set on fire; A fire of pure, unrelenting hatred!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny growled and tried to launch herself up from her unfortunate lying position, but Rachel was already too close and simply pushed her back down by placing one of her gigantic feet directly on her chest! Penny grabbed the huge monstrosity, still resting in its deadly footwear; a pair of brutal looking, black leather boots... Even so, Penny could feel a hellish heat being emitted by those things! Penny tried to move the foot with all her might, but Rachel only laughed sadistically at her futile efforts and rewarded her by applying more pressure on her battered body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny weezed in agony as she felt the air getting pushed out of herself and she feared this wasn't even the full weight of this giantess of a woman! \"Hahaha, did you really think you could defeat me in a battle? Just look at you... Struggling in vain against even one foot of mine... Oh, speaking of which! Do you remember what I offered your dear, sweet mother should she piss me off further?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny gasped as the foot on her chest disappeared but her relief was quickly cut off as Rachel sat down on herself, pushing her into the ground with her superior mass and grabbing both of Penny's arms by her wrists. Now Rachel was putting both of her gigantic feet in front of Penny's face and began to grind them together in an effort to remove the protective footwear and unleash their true potential!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Well, I said she would get to taste my toes. And since you are here right now, I trust you woulnd't mind tasting them in her place, right, hahaha? You'll probably never taste anything again, provided you survive... Oh well, enjoy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel's timing had been excellent, just as she said this, both of her boots came off at the same time! Penny gasped as a wave of brutally hot, moist air came rushing directly into her face... And she shut her mouth instantly as Rachel, true to her word, moved in toes-first onto her mouth! Rachel's long, slimy toed pressed themselves over Penny's lips... who cringed in horror at the sticky, hot feeling as Rachel remarked \"Ah, nevermind.  You'll open your mouth eventually. I know it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel moved her second foot up for a moment, giving Penny some time to stare upon it in pure terror. From underneath those soles, they looked even bigger than they already were. Much like last time she witnessed them, they were incredibly sweaty, every centimetre of their skin was shiningly moist with sweat, and some areas like around the toes were so drenched with sweat that it was slowly dripping down. Drop, drop, drop, every bit of footsweat hitting Penny directly in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, after having her mouth shut for some seconds, Penny felt the increasing urge to take in oxygen. <i>There's only my nose... But after the torture that Officer woman put me through... how bad can it really be?</i>, Penny thought as she took a daring whiff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny realised too late that it could be much, <b>much</b> worse than Officer Bridgett's feet as her whole body shook and twitched and her eyes shot up, already starting to flow tiny rivers of tears as the most inhumane, unbearable stench ever was forced directly into her nose! Penny has had the displeasure of experiencing Rachel's foot smell before, but never directly beneath them, or after they were so fresh out of their boots. It was a whole new level of smell, nothing she ever smelled before!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stench was a smashing combination of salty, stale sweat, and overpowering scent of sharp, spicy cheese and a lingering, sour tinge of vinegar all finished off with a rounding scent of the musky inside air of old, well-worn leather boots. In other words, it was beyond hell!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Rachel herself had to cough as she caugh a whiff of her own feet's incredibly strong aroma. \"Oh... Oh holy shit, they are bad today! Mmmm-hmmmm, now that's what I call the most deadly feet in the FFFL, Haaaaah-Haaaaah!\" Rachel cheered as she removed one foot for a second and slapped Penny across the face noisily, splashing numerous drops of sweat all across the floor and the rest of Penny's body. \"Oh yeah, I did make sure to make them extra bad right now. After all, I don't get to teach someone like you a lesson every day. Oh yeah, you are deserving only of my most crushing foot scent! So what do you say, are you enjoying yourself down there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny didn't even attempt to respond, her mouth still firmly shut as the foot came down on her face once more, pressing its hot, moist if unbelievably soft and smooth sole directly into and all over it. Penny retched as the foot began to slide all over and across her face, forcing her to sniff every last part of it a few times. The amount of sweat quickly became so big that Penny clenched her eyes shut as well, to prevent the acidid sweat from getting into them... But it still burned terribly all over her face!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Rachel's toes surrounded her nose and one breath behind those babies hit Penny's senses like the crushing blow of a sledgehammer! She saw stars behind her eyelids for a second and all sounds and feelings were replaced by the unreleting, stinging stench of Rachel's sweat-toes for several seconds. <i>Argh... I can't stand this... One or two more of these... And I'm gone... Well, at least the bitch didn't manage to make me taste her toes...</i> Penny thought in agony, in some way almost happy that she still managed to prevent Rachel from getting <b>everything</b> she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Rachel was thinking ahead, as well. Grabbing Penny's nose tightly and squeezing it shut with her long, powerful toes, she sealed off her source of oxygen completely! \"Now it's only a matter of time... Can't let you go to sleep before finally tasting my toes, now can I?\" Rachel taunted as she continued to dominate Penny completely with her powerful feet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny once more threw everything she had at Rachel. Unfortunately for her, it was almost nothing. Her body trembled in vain, her legs buckled weakly, her hands couldn't move at all and her head shifting from side to side did not shake those oppressive feet off. Her situation was absolutely inescapable! Soon enough, her breath ran out for good. Her face slowly turned blue and hell was about to be unleashed upon Penny!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstinctively, she opened her mouth widely to take in a deep breath of air. Instead, it was filled to the brim with Rachel's long, drippingly wet and absolutely ripe toes!  Penny gagged and retched as said toes quickly found her unfortunate tongue and began to hug and rub it tightly, hitting her with the full force of their rotten taste! At the same time, the toes of her second foot let go of Penny's nose and instead cupped over it, sealing all the putrid, cheesy air inside for Penny to sniff. And since her body still firmly demanded oxygen, she had no choice but to sniff Rachel's toes deeply, loudly and numerous times!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel laughed loudly as she observed her victim getting absolutely annihilated by her devastating toes alone! Sniffing and sucking on the most deadly toes ever was speedily laying havoc on Penny, her entire body was twitching and spasming for a moment as the only thing she was able to feel were the everlasting smell and taste of Rachel The Ravager's feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, Penny stopped moving altogether. Rachel waited for a little while, her toes still playing with Penny's tongue, just to make sure. Then she got off of her slowly and began to pick her up. \"Well... before I throw you out like the trash you are, I think I might let the others use you as a towel for their wet, overworked feet, hehehe...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny woke up some time later, somewhere around midnight, lying in some back alley. She groaned as her entire body felt sore and tired... She was moist and sticky all over her body and everything reeked terribly of sweaty feet. Slowly remembering what happened, Penny got up and started to run home, crying all the way. She had failed, failed in the most humiliating way possible. Not managing to defeat even one single combatant, she had been shown how weak and useless she really was. And were that no enough, her archenemy had shown up as well, to fulfil her torment absolutely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Penny had really learned her lesson. There was no way she could ever compare to that Valkyrie. She should have just avoided her forever. Instead, she got to taste her toes, literally. Penny sighed and sniffled as she finally abandoned all hope to ever gain righteous retribution for herself, or her mother. \"I'm sorry, ma...\" She whispered sadly into cool depths of the night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><i>Now life had killed the dreams she dreamed.</i></font></span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\"><b>UPDATE 8-7-14: This is the Writing.com fanfic page for the FFFL comic. I (Penmaster24)won't be adding much to this page, as I'm concentrating on the comic book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut definitely add to this fanfic storyline if you want. Just, please, follow the below rules and have fun. <img style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/smile.png\" alt=\"*Smile*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Smile\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Write from the third person perspective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. All female characters, 18 and up. Outside of the initial flashback with Penny at the beginning, ages of all characters are 18 and up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. No short chapters. Get a few paragraphs going, not just 1 paragraph with 1-3 sentences which read like, \"She took her shoe off. She kicked her foot. Stuff happened\". You don't have to get all Moby Dick like, but please flesh out your additions. Give us hella' detail. It makes for a more interesting story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. We're mainly focusing on feet here. You can definitely toss in some light fem/ fem worship, kissing, embarrassing situations (think clothes ripped of in anime, etc), but don't make it a rated X affair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo scat, blood, vore, or anything that might have been done to Marcellus Wallace in Pulp Fiction if Bruce Willis hadn't layeth the smaketh down on those rednecks. You know what I mean. Any chapters which go way overboard will get deleted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou want the hardcore stuff, do that on your own interactive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. Action and violence can be kick butt, but keep it somewhat in the vein of campy fights (i.e 60's Batman, wrestling at it's cheesiest, bad martial arts movies).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. Invite folks to add. Preferably those who have some kick ass writing skills, but I don't discriminate to newbies also.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7. Touched on before, but definitely keep it smelly, sweaty, cheesy, stinky, stanky, and fun. <img style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/smile.png\" alt=\"*Smile*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Smile\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\n8. I'm not a grammar policeman, as I'm apt to make mistakes. Just try to do your best with keeping things spelled right, etc.</td>",
