He went to the Boy Scouts and climbed the ranks all the way to Eagle Scout. He played soccer in middle school, and he was now sixteen years old and started his sophomore year in High School.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was quiet and shy, but he was liked and popular. He wasn\u2019t the strongest or the tallest or the most popular kid in class. He never stood out, either. He was just average. He was only 5 foot 6 inches tall, skinny, with brown eyes and brown, short hair. He always wore t-shirts and blue jeans, and he walked to school since he only lived a few blocks away. His friends, and his mom kept an eye on him, but they were happy with his behavior and his grades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to Daniel, or \u2018Danny\u2019, as everyone would call him, the gods also kept their eyes on him. There was a big discussion on Mount Olympus, and Zeus and Perseus were trying to make a point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThose mortals! So narrow minded\u2026 So selfish\u2026 They don\u2019t think the way we do!\u201d Zeus said out loud. \u201cWe look after the needs of others and we use our powers to help others! But these mortals only look after themselves!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI object to that, Oh great one!\u201d Perseus retorted. \u201cIf you were to give a mortal the power of a god, he will also use that power to help others!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! He might\u2026 But not after he makes himself rich! Or the ruler over all the earth!\u201d Zeus sneered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright! I dare you to take a mortal, and to give him the divine powers on earth! Then you shall see!\u201d Perseus argued. \u201cNot all mortals are as corrupt as you think!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFINE!\u201d Zeus roared in reply. \u201cI will take a mortal, and I shall make him into a demigod! I will do this to show you how quickly he will become corrupt and use his powers for personal gain!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright! However, you must allow me to pick the mortal, and I must be allowed to guide him while he has his powers!\u201d Perseus said in response. \u201cIf he is successful, he must be allowed to keep his powers as well!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, Perseus appeared in Danny\u2019s bedroom, just after Danny had gone to sleep. A bright light had filled the room, and it had caused Danny to open his eyes. He was astonished when he saw a strange figure standing in his room, wearing white robes and sandals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cArise, Daniel Davis! I am Perseus! I\u2019m here to grant you the powers of a Demigod!\u201d Perseus said to the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel got up and stood in front of the god. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Who? Who are you?\u201d the teen wondered curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerseus walked closer to him and places his hands on Daniel\u2019s shoulders. Suddenly, Danny\u2019s body was surrounded by a bright, blue glow. After a few seconds, the glow had passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are now a demigod. You have the power to do just about anything! You can change anything and anyone, just by saying the command. You can control anything and anyone. You can also teleport and read minds and thought of others. You may not use these powers for selfish gain only, but to help other people! And, you may not kill or destroy other people! Is that clear?\u201d Perseus instructed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes sir!\u201d Danny said softly. \u201cI understand. But, am I still allowed to change my own body?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course\u2026\u201d the god replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat if I make a mistake? What if I screw up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will be watching you so don\u2019t worry\u2026\u201d Perseus assured him, before he disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe disappeared into thin air, leaving Danny alone in his room, wondering what the following day would be like, his first day as a demigod.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He quickly tossed and turned in his bed, until a ray of sunshine lit up his room. His bedroom door opened and his mom walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDanny! DANNY! It\u2019s almost 7 o\u2019clock, honey! You better shower and get dressed or you\u2019ll be late for school!\u201d she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOooohhhhhh\u2026.\u201d Danny groaned, as he stretched and yawned, before he rolled out of bed. He had such a strange night. What was this strange dream he had, about a guy named Perseus who made him into a demigod?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at his clock and realized he was running late. It was 7:03 AM.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCrap! I still gotta shower! I just want time to stand still!\u201d he said out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny got into the shower and washed his hair. He rubbed soap all over and rinsed. Finally he dried off and got dressed. He put on his clothes and walked back in his room. When he glanced at his clock, the time was still 7:03AM.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d he wondered. \u201cHow can that be?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly walked into the kitchen and saw his mother reading the newspaper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat time do you have to be at work, mom?\u201d Danny said to her; as he sat down to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny suddenly looked up. His mother was completely frozen! She was staring at the newspaper, frozen in time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny walked up to her and waved his hand before her face. She didn\u2019t even blink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly crap! I stopped time!\u201d he gasped. \u201cI- Holy crap! It\u2019s TRUE! I- I\u2019m a demigod! A DEMIGOD! Okay\u2026 Okay\u2026 Let me think\u2026. I got this power\u2026. What did I do? Oh! I say commands! I just give the orders! Alright\u2026. THINK! Ummm\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took a deep breath before he remembered what he had uttered before he took a shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright! I want time to unfreeze!\u201d he said out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mother moved again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFinally! Are you ready to go to school?\u201d she asked him. \u201cWell, that was a quick shower!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, mom!\u201d he said, with a deep sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny ate his cereal and walked out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he was on the street, he turned both ways, making sure nobody saw him. He knew he still had about four blocks to walk, before he would reach the entrance to his high school, but he didn\u2019t feel like walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want to be standing in front of my school, right now!\u201d he whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, he disappeared from where he was standing, and reappeared four blocks down the street, standing right in front of the entrance to his school!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa!! This is freaky!\u201d Danny whispered to himself. \u201cFreaky\u2026 But very, VERY cool!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked in with a new air of confidence, knowing now that he was capable of doing just about ANYTHING, since he was a demigod.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Danny continued watching the television. Downtown, the fight with the fiery thief Volcana and electrically charged robber Livewire was\u2026non-existent. \u201cSuperman\u201d wasn\u2019t anywhere to be seen!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe news coverage quickly discovered that \u201cSuperman\u201d was actually off flirting with beautiful women. \u201cGreat\u201d, Danny thought, \u201cMy friend could be stopping these supervillains but instead is off flirting with women. Typical. Still, I think I\u2019ll leave everything as it is for a little longer\u2026he\u2019s sure to catch on and save the day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSuperman\u201d was questioned by the media about why he wasn\u2019t fighting the two supervillains downtown. \u201cSuperman\u201d was put in an awkward and was slightly worried about what to do next. So\u2026he flew far out of sight. But to where?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny used his powers to see where \u201cSuperman\u201d was. \u201cSuperman\u201d was juggling planets! Wait a minute\u2026the news now said, \u201cBREAKING NEWS: Due to the shift in planets, experts predict that global warming is a thing of the past! \u2026We cannot believe it either.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny figured this would be a good time to tell \u201cSuperman\u201d to stop. And so he did. With just a thought, his friend realized what he had done and stopped rearranging the planets. And Danny then teleported him back down to Earth, back to right beside Danny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny told his friend that if he ever did something foolish like that again, he would take away his powers. After all, \u201cSuperman\u201d could\u2019ve seriously hurt the world if he didn\u2019t luck out and stop global warming. Not to mention the other planets. But mentioning them\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSuperman\u201d revealed that there were \u201cnew\u201d planets like \u201cNew Genesis\u201d and \u201cApokolips\u201d. Uh oh. These new planets were dangerous as Danny recalled\u2026especially \u201cApokolips\u201d. Just as Danny was about to turn everything back to normal (sans global warming, that was a nice bonus). But\u2026Jake really wanted to be \u201cSuperman\u201d. His eyes were begging and he could feel he really wanted a second chance. Danny decided to give him a second chance on one condition: \u201cThis time, actually act like Superman.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSuperman\u201d looked at the television. Despite the news about global warming, there was still chaos being caused by Volcana and Livewire. \u201cSuperman\u201d said to Danny, \u201cIf I stop them, will you let me keep my powers?\u201d Danny replied, \u201cI guess\u2026but don\u2019t do anything stupid. Don\u2019t\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Danny could respond, \u201cSuperman\u201d had already sped to the crime scene. Seeing both beautifulwomen, he stopped to stare for a bit\u2026then got back to the job at hand. \u201cSuperman\u201d said, \u201cStop right there ladies. I can\u2019t allow these misdemeanors any longer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVolcana and Livewire laughed and then fired flames and electricity, respectively, at \u201cSuperman\u201d. \u201cSuperman\u201d withstood the pain and fought back, dodging their attacks and eventually landing knockout blows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the villains into custody, \u201cSuperman\u201d was pleased and finally earned the right to remove the quotation marks. Superman returned to Danny and Danny felt that this could be fun. Enjoying their victory, Superman remarked, \u201cThis is going to be great. There\u2019s no way this could go bad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it did. But how?</span></div></div>",

Danny made them both invisible and told his friend to be quiet, if they were going to win. As the two protagonists sneaked around the enemy base, winning mini-games to unlock new areas, Danny felt like this game was composed of other pieces of other games. But no matter, it was very fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the two heroes reached a door marked, \"Boss Room\". Danny and Jake knew that the room was actually a red herring, from beating the game so many times. There was no boss in there. There was one in the room beside it, which you had to go into to proceed in the game. And that boss was considered the hardest in the whole game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo they:</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Danny had barely taken three steps inside when he saw Justin Waverly leering at a pair of freshmen, who were backed up against their lockers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny frowned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd known Justin, who was a junior, one year ahead of Danny, since 3rd grade. Danny had never really liked the guy, but he'd developed a major ego complex about three years ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn ego complex that wasn't completly unjustified. Justin was tall, popular, and handsome. Despite being a junior, he was the star of the football team. Girlfriends, for Justin, came and went every other week. He was blond and tan, and never had any problems with acne. His parents were rich, and so Justin was always wearing nice clothes. They'd also recently bought for him a hot-off-the line, banana yellow Hummer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA Hummer. Those things weren't even vehicles in Danny's eyes, but gas-guzzling, greenhouse gas-emmiting status symbols. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" 'Sup Nerd, Fatty,\" Justin was leaning up against the lockers in a pose he probably thought cool, and smirked down at the two freshmen. 'Nerd' was lanky, probably between growth spurts, and wore a \"Halo\" shirt. Thick glasses peekd out from a bush of oily hair. 'Fatty' was, well, fat and dressed somewhat sloppily. A stain of what might have been powdered sugar dotted the upper left corner of his snug black shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny, though he couldn't sense them, was acutely aware of the powers he now possessed. Perseus had advised him not to use his powers selfishly. Could there be a more selfless act than giving this bully a taste of his own medicine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pause.\" Danny said, and Danny couldn't help but be amazed as time froze again, for the second time this morning. Danny walked over and placed a hand on Justin's forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike a stream, information poured into Danny's mind. He knew Justin's fears and secrets, his dreams and ambitions. He caught bits and pieces of memory, events that had shaped Justin into the person he was today. Also, came the statistics. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin, at 165 pounds, was slender but built. He hovered at around 5'11\", without shoes. He was 16 years, 4 months, 12 days, and 37 minutes old. He would die in a little over seventy years, on a Tuesday. Completely heterosexual. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever there was to know about Justin, Danny suddenly knew it. Everything from the bully's first words to his shoe size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa...I could've done without some of that,\" Dany said, \"But anyways...what's the best punishment for you, huh, Justin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny looked from Justin to 'Nerd' and 'Fatty' and snapped his fingers. Closing his eyes, he began rewriting the entry for Justin Waverly in the dictionary of the gods. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Football was something Justin's dad always forced him into doing. His real hobby has always been anime and videogames. He hasn't played football since middle school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny looked up and gasped at the new Justin before him. His football jersey and vintage jeans had been replaced by a pair of black, baggy jeans and a black tee shirt with an anime character on the front. Justin was scrawnier now, too. His muscles were now very light, from several years of disuse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny wasn't done yet, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's make him shorter too...about their height,\" Danny said, casually this time, as Justin shrank in height to about 5'4\". \"And what the heck? Let's make him younger too. A freshman, like these guys. And let's replace his cockiness with some good ol' social awkwardness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny watched again as Justin's features became a bit younger. As Danny had rewritten Justin, the boy's pose had changed from an arrogant leaning to a shy slouch. Danny was confused, though, when Justin suddenly became more muscular. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's right. He's a high school freshman now, so he's only recently quit football.\" Danny realized, \"Well, gotta fix that. One of the reasons Justin hated football was because he's a lazy person at heart. But he's a big eater too. He's always been kind of chubby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin was no longer fit now, but plump. The baggy jeans became snug around his waist and rear end, and Justin's shirt now strained to cover an ample potbelly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Additionally, Justin will gain weight throughout high school until,\" Danny stopped, pondering, \"Until he becomes fifteen or so pounds heavier than this kid next next to him, that he made fun of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny continued to rewrite Justin's character. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took away the boy's flawless skin, replacing it with occasional acne. His hair became unruly, and particularly hard to manage in the mornings. Justin was now shy around girls, and furthermore, he would eventually go through some sexual confusion issues. The outcome of those issues, Danny would leave to Justin and to fate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis parents, while still rich, were now pennypinchers. Justin's Hummer had been exchanged for a used Corolla.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, as the ironic icing to an ironic cake, Danny changed Justin's relationship with the boys he'd been tormenting. Enemies before, they were now friends, and had been friends since the 5th grade. Where before, Justin had been leering over the two, all three were now engaged in what appeared to be friendly conversation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Resume.\" Danny said, having changed everything he'd wanted. And like that, time was flowing again. Danny, willing himself to not be noticed, eavesdropped on the three of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"J-force! You still up for the Halo party at my house on Saturday?\" 'Nerd' was asking Justin, who was apparently now nicknamed 'J-force'. \"My mom's baking cheesecake brownies!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm up for the Halo, most definately. It's my game, yo! I can't help but own it!\" Justin had snaked an arm around 'Fatty', using the other to pat his paunch. \"But brownies, man! Why you gotta do that to me? I'll effing pig out on them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And seriously, I've put on like fifteen pounds since I quit football. I'm gonna get so freakin' fat. And I'm already freakin' fat, I can't even wear my Kagome shirt anymore!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of them were wearing outlandish grins.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh gosh, and your mom's brownies! They're like...the nectar of the gods, in baked form! I'm gonna get sooooo fat...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny stood in the hallway, watching as the three friends slowly walked off, presumably headed toward their classes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn less than ten minutes, Danny had transformed Justin from a bullying jock to a complete nerd. It was kind of frightening. Any lingering doubts he had about being a demigod were now thoroughly erased. He had the power. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny raised his palms and looked at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh yes, did he have the power.</span></div></div>",

The girl's name was Miriam and she was a pretty girl, friendly and had good grades in school. Despite this, Miriam was not very popular at school. Not only because the other school girls were prettier and taller than her, but also for the simple fact that the other guys, including Bellucci and the rugby players, they preferred girls with the most seductive and muscle tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was not only the desire to be popular and to impress on the boys that Miriam wanted to be taller, muscular and alluring. If he had become, would give an exemplary lesson to bullies that they pick on weaker kids to school and maybe even to help the city, such as saving a kitten climbed a tree, help an old lady cross the street and stop thieves who steal the bags to the ladies. It would be like to be a superhero for Miriam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe part where Miriam wanted to be muscular to help the weak to defend themselves from bullies and do good deeds, so pleased that Danny decided to use his powers from demigod to fulfill the desire of the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course Danny would have altered the reality, so that no one would notice the miracle that was to be accomplished.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Danny realised that to be super popular, he needed a super popular body to go with it. So that was what he got. He felt a small tingle in the top of his head. Suddenly his dark hair all fell out, and was replaced by a blond crew cut. The tingling slowly moved down his body. His brow widened a small bit, and his green eyes became a beautiful pale blue. He felt his ears shrink in a little. His teeth straightened themselves, and the hint of yellow on top of his top layer of teeth faded away. He felt his chin and jaw straighten out, becoming more angular. All of his teenage acne was sucked underneath his skin. He now had one of the sexiest faces that anyone had ever seen. The tingling then became a buzzing, and then a pain, all over his body. He grunted, that single grunt being a deep baritone, the voice any man would kill for. CRRRR-ACK! All over his body, his bones started to break and reform, break and reform. He felt like he was in a mini elevator, as he was gradually getting higher and higher. He looked down. He must have been more than 7 feet tall! The bad thing was, he was still the same weight, so extremely gangly. Then the buzzing returned, in his feet. They started to push out, quickly filling his shoes. RR-RIP! His shoes and socks both tore, revealing feet at least size 24! He had never even imagined feet that big! The buzz moved up his legs, and calf muscles started to form. They swelled out, rock hard calves the size of softballs. Danny expected them to stop there, but they kept going, getting bigger and bigger, until they were bigger than his current chest! Then the buzzing started in his quads, filling the tracksuit bottoms he was wearing. They inflated even more, until his trousers tore, turning into shorts that rode up above his massive quads! They were absolutely huge, and ripped! There appeared to be no fat at all in any of his body parts. His glutes suddenly bubbled out, instantly tearing what was left of his trousers. He felt his ass, but it was nothing like anything he had felt before. It wasn't soft, firm didn't even describe it accurately. It was rock hard! Pure muscle! The buzz moved up, making a massive Apollo's belt leading down to his undersized genitals. Suddenly, the buzzing focused just below his chest. He saw two abs appear. Then another row. And another. Rows kept adding until Danny had 16 abdominal muscles. He knew that even the most muscular humans only had 8. Each stomach muscle was so big and bulbous that it pressed against the others around it. You would find it hard to fit a piece of paper between any two of the muscles. The muscles were also framed perfectly by the shredded obliques that now framed them. Danny then felt a heat in his chest and the sides of his chest. Suddenly, his lats flared out, giving his upper body a v shape that bodybuilders spent years obtaining. He also felt his pecs start to inflate. They pushed out and out, obstructing his view of everything except for those massive feet. He also felt his neck start to expand outwards, becoming as thick as a bodybuilder's thigh. His shoulders swelled up, nearly to the top of his neck. Then, an intense pain flared in the back of both of his arms, causing him to moan greatly. He peered at his arms. They still looked normal. Then he turned them over. It was as if someone had implanted two horse shoes into the backs of his arms. He then saw his bicep start to swell, up and up. Up again. They finally stopped, larger than Danny's torso used to be. The buzzing ran down his fore arms, swelling them in proportion to his massive body. Finally, he peered down at his still small package, smiled, and willed it to grow. His package had been 3\" long, but now it started to snake out, longer and longer. It filled his entire boxer shorts, causing him a great deal of pain. He flexed his glutes and quads, and his boxer shorts burst into confetti. The sight that met his eyes was amazing. He somehow knew that it was exactly 15\" long. He looked around, and willed himself some clothes. Seconds later, he was wearing a skin tight tank top and compression shorts that left nothing to the imagination. Looking up, he decided to</span></div></div>",

Danny willed both of them to be back in his bedroom. He also willed that Jace thought that they had been there the whole time. \"So then I went home.\" \"Right. Jace, fall asleep. \" Jace immediately shut up. \"Now increase your height to 6' 10\" \" Jace shot up.\" Now add 100 pounds of muscle to your body.\" Jace's stomach inflated massively.\" Oh shit! I didn't say where! Umm, spread the muscle evenly throughout your body.\" The muscle melted throughout his body, but completely evenly. His toes were as muscular as his biceps.\" Ok, start over.\" Jace shrank back to his old size. \" Ok. Let's see. Buzz cut. \" Jace's hair fell out accordingly. \"Smaller nose and ears. Bigger lips. Less fat around the jaw. Fuller chin.\" Jace was now almost as good looking as Danny. Almost.  \"Ok. Now go with all muscles 75% as big as mine, but do it slow. Oh, and make it as pleasurable for him as cumming.\" Jace threw his head back and moaned in orgasmic bliss. The moan got gradually deeper as his neck widened in muscle. His deltoids swelled up, and the swelling moved down his arms. His biceps pushed out, his triceps popped up, and his forearms swelled into thick, meaty, strands of muscle. His pecs inflated, which was a pleasurable sight for both him and Danny. Danny himself was starting to like the growth. It ran down his stomach, melting away all of the fat. Twelve identical, sweaty, glistening abs emerged from nothing. Both men moaned. His quads and calves expanded massively as well. His feet pushed out to a size 18. Finally, the growth finished. All of Jace's baggy clothes had shredded completely. Danny looked down. Jace had a full on boner, but it was only 3\" long.\" I want to try something different this time. Increase your testosterone production by 500%.\" He looked up as Jace's buzz cut grew out into a shaggy, messy style. A full on beard formed on his face. Both men already had a lot of body hair, but Jace's quintupled. His chest hair grew in every direction, meeting his armpit hair which was also going down his arms. His pubic hair spread out insanely quickly, completely covering his tiny package, and forming a treasure trail that met his expanding chest hair over his now furry abs. Then, Jace, who was having the wet dream of a lifetime, let out a rose. His member literally sprung up, about a foot long and like a lone mast in a forest. This was too much for both Jace and Danny, who came at the same time. Both men collapsed into a deep sleep, after coming for 5 minutes straight. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Daniel Davis was just beginning to come to grips with his Godly powers as a young, teenage, sixteen-year-old Demigod. Yes, he began to realize that he could indeed do just about ANYTHING! Amazing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, the next thing that came to mind was\u2026 find or create a friend. Someone who was incredibly loyal to him. Someone who stuck to him like glue. But how and where would he do it? He needed to think about this for he wanted to do it right the first time around.  So Danny put on his shirt, shorts and shoes and he walked out the door so he could think it over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile passing his neighbor\u2019s house, he spotted a little baby boy playing in the front lawn of the house. Miss Borovsky was sitting on the rocking chair as Danny walked by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi Mrs. Borovsky!\u201d he said politely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, hello there, Daniel!\u201d she replied. \u201cHow are you doing today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I\u2019m alright\u2026 How\u2019s the baby doing?\u201d Daniel asked with a grin as he looked at the little boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, little Jacob is growing like a weed! He eats well and he sleeps through the night, so I can\u2019t complain\u2026 He\u2019s a good boy! I hope he grows up and becomes a fine, young man just like you! He\u2019s such a happy little boy\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the phone rang inside of the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my goodness! I had better get that! Daniel, please watch little Jake for me, will you?\u201d she said as she got up and hurried into the house.  This left Daniel alone with the little 1-year-old baby boy named Jacob. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny squatted down and looked at Jake. The little tyke looked back at him and giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2026 Jake\u2026 You\u2019re my best friend\u2026 You\u2019re just too young\u2026\u201d Danny sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGoogoo\u2026 Gaah!\u201d Jake mumbled back as he extended his arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny reached down and picked up the little boy and held him in his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe I should age you\u2026 Make you sixteen years-old?\u201d Daniel wondered out loud. \u201cThen I\u2019ll make you into my perfect best friend!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGoooweeehaaaah!\u201d Jake mumbled back, like he agreed with the Demigod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, Jake\u2026 You\u2019re gonna grow up into a big, tall, strong and handsome teenage dude\u2026\u201d Danny smiled as he set the baby boy back on the grass before him. \u201cAnd everybody will think it\u2019s normal for you to be a teenager from this point forward!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Jake began to grow\u2026 and grow\u2026 and GROW! The baby went through a massive growth spurt as he aged fifteen years in just over thirty seconds! His legs grew thicker and longer; his arms bulged out as they stretched as well; his torso stretched out as it widened at the same time; his hands and feet became much bigger; his head, face and facial expression changed rapidly as he aged and matured; his shoulders grew wider and more muscular; he burst out of his diapers and stood there naked, as thick, large, rock-hard muscles began to bulge everywhere on his body; he grew taller and taller, quickly passing six feet in height and becoming even taller than Daniel; and finally, long, black, straight hair covered his head, his chest, his arms, his legs, and even his private parts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhhh\u2026 whoa\u2026 wowww\u2026\u201d Jake spoke, as he now had the wisdom and knowledge of a highschooler. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel waved his hand, and a pair of shorts, a tank top, athletic socks and basketball shoes now appeared and covered Jake\u2019s large, tall, muscular body.  Jake was about 6 ft. 6 inches tall, or a foot taller than Daniel!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome, Jake! You\u2019re a teenager now!\u201d Daniel grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhh\u2026 Yeah!\u201d Jake smiled as he looked around and took a minute to adjust to his hulking body and his impressive height. \u201cI\u2019m big and strong!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Jake walked up to Daniel and hugged the young Demigod. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you!\u201d he whispered, before he backed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Jake\u2019s mom appeared. She saw Jake and she didn\u2019t notice anything unusual. There wasn\u2019t anything weird about the fact that her 1-year-old baby boy had suddenly grown into a 16-year-old hulking teenager. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJake? Are you and Daniel going out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm\u2026 Can Jake come over to my house and\u2026 uhmm\u2026 Spend the night?\u201d Daniel asked her politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh, yes, that\u2019s alright\u2026 Just make sure he packs enough clean clothes with him!\u201d Mrs. Borovsky replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake and Daniel then went into the house. Jake walked into his bedroom and opened the closet door. All his baby clothes had changed into large clothes; size XL, which fit him now. Jake packed a soft bag with some clothes before the boys left the house and walked back to Daniel\u2019s house. Daniel and Jake were going to have a great time together as best friends for the first time ever!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He soon regretted sitting so far back however when the teacher walked in, the only teacher in the school he liked, 29-year old Kelly Pryce. She was a smoking hot brunette that all the boys in school lusted after. It was pure bad luck that Danny's view of the teacher was blocked by the big head of the class geek Martin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, just like being stuck behind someone in the cinema!\" Danny mumbled to himself. Wish I had a better view of her\" Danny then said, trying to look around the geek towards Miss Pryce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly....he found himself sitting across the room on the right hand side. \"Woah...shit!\" he gasped out loud, causing the class to look at him. \"Sam...watch your language please\" Miss Pryce spoke up...looking in Danny's direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sam?\" Danny thought, wearing a perplexed expression on his face. He then looked back to where he had been sat...and he were astonished to see his own body sitting there. A quick glance down at himself and he realized he had switched bodies with another boy in class, Samuel Edwards. \"Oooh okay, that's another power I got\" he grinned, noticing a slight change in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I had an even better view of my sexy teacher!\" Danny then said, as he sat backwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly...he shifted seats again, this time switching bodies with one of the girls sat just in front of Miss Pryce's desk. \"Brutal!\" Danny exclaimed quietly, as he looked down at himself and squeezed his breasts. He was now in the body of Katie Smith, one of the more average looking girls in school, but she still had an impressive pair of boobs on her, which now belonged to Danny. Looking back at Sam's body (which Katie was now inhabiting) Danny saw that she was acting just as Sam would have. \"Cool!\" Danny said in his new female voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quiet please Katie!\" the teacher said quietly, causing Danny to turn around...and grin. \"Oh...sorry Miss Pryce\" he apologized while giggling. Danny wondered just what else he could do to make this class more fun.</span></div></div>",

Danny just turned around and smiled. \"I can fix that!\" he responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why Katie, you're so helpful today\" Miss Pryce smiled at Danny warmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no worries Miss, I'm enjoying helping people\" Danny glanced at her...before turning around and looking back at Martin. \"If you were smaller Martin, maybe people wouldn't complain about your head being so big\" he laughed...focusing on him. The class watched (seemingly with disinterest, thanks to Danny manipulating their minds) as Martin then shrank...and morphed into a 5-year old boy, his clothes altering to fit. \"My, my, you are cute Martin!\" Miss Pryce then let out a laugh, looking at the 'diminished' geek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay class, if you pick up your books I'd like you to turn to page...\" Miss Pryce started saying as she paced back and forth, her wonderful cleavage on full display for everyone to see.

And he only got more turned on when he did some more minor 'tweaks' to his teacher's appearance. He added a couple of inches to Miss Pryce's height, he increased the size of her boobs by a full cup size...thereby straining her bra, and he gave her a nice tan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The vision of feminine perfection!\" Danny grinned as he widened the teacher's always curvy hips a little more, giving her an hour-glass figure that absolutely any Pin-Up girl would kill for. \"Nice!\" he purred in Katie's voice...before frowning and grabbing his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to move again!\" Danny mumbled to himself...quickly switching himself back into his own body at the back of the class, which of course left Sam stuck in Katie's body, not that he knew anything. He'd think he always was Katie. \"Its certainly a quicker way of moving around\" Danny chuckled, patting down his own, familiar body with his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next few minutes, as Miss Pryce continued to prattle on about what she had been up to during the day (discarding teaching the students anything she was supposed to), Danny amused himself by altering some of his classmates. One of the other, more attractive girls in class, Kristen Guilders, had long, shiny red hair that she was very proud of, Danny decided that the effeminate boy sat behind her, Greg Wilson, was more deserving of such luxurious hair and so he swapped their hairstyles. Kristen did not look quite as sexy with Greg's short haircut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother attractive girl, Yvonne Chambers, whom Danny considered 'stuck up' and bitchy, lost her expensive manicure as Danny swapped her fingernails with those of one of the more nerdy girls in class, Beatrice Hughes. \"Wonderful!\" he laughed excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfraid that Miss Pryce would soon catch cold (not that he couldn't kill the virus with his new powers), Danny made her put her blouse back on, but he let her keep her 'modifications', including her bigger boobs, simply because he had a serious crush on her.</span></div></div>",

He peered over the head of the 5-year old boy who used to be Martin the geek and focused on Miss Pryce again...who suddenly piled on about 100 lbs in weight, her increased breasts immediately sagged and her waist bulged out...straining her skirt. Her thighs began rubbing together as she walked as they also expanded in girth...along with her calves. Turning to her pretty face...Danny lengthened her nose until it looked like something an ugly witch might have, he even made a wart appear on one side of it. He couldn't help but chuckle at the sight. The long, plainum hair he had earlier given her morphed into quite lifeless, flat brown hair...which looked particularly 'greasy'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess it IS all about physical attraction\" Danny shrugged, he now didn't find Miss Pryce attractive in the least, in fact she was a fat, ugly woman, still wearing her usual clothes though. Amazingly...the class sat quiet, not saying anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, enough of that\" Danny mumbled, as he returned his teacher's now obese body to its normal, svelte dimensions. \"Welcome back sexy!\" Danny chuckled to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the clouds suddenly obscured the sun outside, Danny frowned. \"A little more light please!\" he said...and instantly the roof of the school disappeared, leaving every room in it open to the daylight. \"Better!\" he mumbled, satisfied. \"Then when he saw two more his classmates (Gillian Mackson and Scott Johnson) making out in the corner, he rolled his eyes. \"Get a room you two!\" he said, and four fibreglass walls suddenly sprung up out of the floor around them...sealing them off from the rest of the class and giving them their own little 'private room'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly feeling frustrated with the confines of the classroom, Danny tried livening things up a bit for himself by switching bodies with Miss Pryce, but that only amused him for a while. He did love playing with her tits and her vagina in front of everyone though. \"Resume the class please Miss Pryce\" Danny sighed, addressing his former body. Then he clicked back to his chair in his heels and slumped down, his large breasts jiggling in his bra. He decided to keep his teacher's body for now. She could teach the class in his body for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Danny thought hard what else he could do to get his kicks.</span></div></div>",

He could help her out in that department with his newfound powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr what about the young boy over in the video game store? He was very saddened he couldn't buy a \"Mature\" game...he could help him somehow (but maybe not give him the game).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were two little girls playing behind him. They thought Danny couldn't see them. But really, he could. He could see everything in the mall. He could talk to them, surprise them in a good-hearted manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could go see his friends in the food court. Boy, they'd be surprised to see him like this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr he could do something else...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does the now all powerful Danny do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Danny strolled over to the boy in the GameSpot and read his mind for details. He was eleven and just had his birthday, he wanted to spend his birthday money on an M rated video game, but of course wasn't old enough to even buy a T rated one. Danny used his powers to introduce himself to the boy and making it so the boy understood about Danny's powers. With that he done he strolled up beside him. \"Hey there, what's your name?\" Danny asked, wanting to be introduced properly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... H-hi... My name is Troy...\" the boy replied shyly. Troy was short and a little on the chubby side. he loved video games, and he was dying to spend his birthday money on the coolest game, so he was deeply disappointed that the clerk didn't allow him to buy the game, which he was holding in his hand. Troy was just staring at the empty boy, and was about to put it back on the shelf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you Troy,\" Danny said. Then he made it so Troy knew all about Danny's powers and what they could do. He immediatly made Troy age, growing taller in a matter of seconds and making it so nobody else noticed the changes at all. Troy was now a nineteen year old young man, though still slightly overweight. \"There you go Troy,\" Danny said to the young man who was now three years his senior. \"Now you can buy M rated games.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey... Whoa!\" Troy gasped, as he looked down. His arms were longer, and so were his legs. He was considerably taller, and his voice was much deeper than before. Since Troy had suddenly aged 9 years, he had gone through puberty in a few seconds' time, so hair had sprouted on his arms, legs, and chest. he grew a thin mustache  and a few hairs surfaced on his chin. His muscles had grown a bit, but weren't much bigger proportionately. \"Good lord man! This is amazing! How did you do that? I'm definately old enough to buy the game now!\" the big, hulking teenager said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for Troy to buy the game now and within an instant Danny teleported them from the mall, to Troy's bedroom, which Danny knew where it was simply due to having read Troy's mind. \"I'm a demigod, I told you just a moment ago, in your mind.\" Danny brought Troy's age down to eleven again and saw Troy shrink and youthen and the hair vanish. Troy was a boy again, but Danny wasn't done. \"Have you ever wanted to be more athletic or  muscular?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... yeah.... Wow this is great!\" Troy grinned. \"Thank you so much! Yes, I hate being so chubby all the time... can you change me? Please?\" Troy asked the young Demigod shyly. \"I would just love that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then, here we go,\" Danny said. All of Troy's fat suddenly melted away leaving him skinny, and thin. Then Danny started adding a little muscle. Troy's arms swelled as he became lean and athletic. With a though Danny removed Troy's shirt so he could better observe the changes. Troy's flat stomach now showed abs if he flexed it at all and his biceps were fairly obvious. Danny kept going though and added more muscle and now Troy had the look of a young gymnast, with a v-shaped torso, well defined pecs and abs, and abs that were all well developed for his age. Danny added a little more muscle and Troy was now quite muscular for his age, though also leaner and athletic like a mix somewhere between a gymnast and a bodybuilder. That way he'd have speed, agility and strength. \"How's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh!\" Troy exclaimed as he examined his amazingly muscular body, which was a radical departure from what it had been just a few seconds before, thanks to Danny's powers. Troy grinned as he made a fist and flexed his new bulging biceps, clearly enjoying his new muscles, which he had never had before. \"Oh, man! But... why me? Why did you decide to help me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\" Danny asked. \"I have demigod powers, I help people, they feel happy, I make new friends. Now come on let's see you flex those abs,\" Danny said, being just glad to help out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thanks Danny... You're awesome! You can come over and visit any time okay?\" Troy said, as he flexed his abs for Danny to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome,\" Danny said, watching Troy flex his strong six-pack. When Troy relaxed Danny spoke again while his new friend put his shirt back on. \"Well we could keep hanging out, but I also want to see if there's someone else I could help out at the mall. You could come with me for that.\"</span></div></div>",

Tom was tall and skinny and he had jet-black hair. He was a computer geek who loved playing video games and who was happy spending his time messing with his iPod of playing on his laptop. Danny and Tom would often get together and hang out at the mall, the video game arcade, or the miniature golf park. They would wander around bookstores and video stores, or they would spend hours in their favorite pizza store, where they would play all the pinball games in the back of the store, after having consumed several slices of their favorite pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though Tom only lived three blocks down the street from Danny, he decided to use his awesome powers and teleport himself to Tom\u2019s house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want to be standing before Tom\u2019s house right now!\u201d Danny said, while standing in his own bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly Danny vanished from his room and appeared, standing in front of Tom\u2019s house, about a fraction of a second later!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoohoo! I love being able to teleport like that!\u201d Danny cheered, as he walked up to the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rang the doorbell and patiently waited for the door to open.

Come in!\u201d Tom said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys walked in and ran through the hallway into Tom\u2019s bedroom.

I wasn't even expecting that at all.\" Tom said, as he fully calmed down and sat on his bed to calm his heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I saw a chance, and I couldn't help myself.\" Danny replied, to which he finished by returning Tom's room to how it was previously. \"Now then, how big do you wanna be, and how fast do you wanna grow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...one hundred feet seems good, and I wanna grow quickly.\" Tom responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok then. But I'm gonna change reality as you grow. I don't want anybody suspecting anything yet. I mean, your mom would flip if she saw you were suddenly 100 feet tall.\" said Danny, standing back from Tom's bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom seemed a bit disappointed, but understood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Danny began to actually turn his best friend into a giant. Tom wanted fast growth, and so he would get it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could realize it, Tom was already 6 feet taller, and gaining inches by the second. By the time Tom noticed he was growing he had already gotten to nine feet tall and nearly at ten. Now reality changed in very obvious ways (before they had been subtle, and only Danny himself had noticed). Tom's head was nearly at the ceiling, when it seemed to suddenly grow with him. His previously very messy and full room began to thin out, as most of his furnture seemingly vanished, and soon after was replaced with a much more sparse room. Even then, as he hit his halfway mark of fifty feet, nearly everything in his room was gone. His clothes had grown along with him, but seemed a bit more...worn than they were before. Almost by the time he got to 100 feet tall, Tom heard a \"whoosh\" like sound, and then everything stopped. Tom wasn't sure why, but he knew that he now lived far out in the country to keep away from prying eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well dude, there you go. One hundred feet tall.\" 'said' Danny, though he was actually speaking right into Tom's mind. Tom got down on all fours to see his normal sized demigod-of a friend standing there, looking very pleased with his work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...I can't believe it. I feel so...powerful. It's weird dude. We know that I'd never hurt anyone, but you're just so....so small.\" thought Tom, since talking probably would have hurt Danny's ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, now what do you wanna do?\" asked Danny, though he already knew the answer.</span></div></div>",

Tom didn\u2019t have to do anything in order to gain all those muscles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, how about we just go outside and walk around the street and check up on your neighbors and have some fun with them?\u201d Danny suggested. \u201cAfter all, I gotta train a little bit with using my new Demigod abilities!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah! Maybe you can help that shy little dude across the street\u2026. I think his name is Jake\u2026 I think he\u2019s age 13 already but he\u2019s way small for his age\u2026 I remember him telling me he was a premature baby so he\u2019s skinny and short for his age\u2026 He looks way younger than he really is!\u201d Tom explained to his friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s do it!\u201d Danny grinned as he snapped his fingers, sending the two boys outside in a blink of an eye! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight away, they were standing across the street from Tom\u2019s house where a young boy with a nice, chocolate brown complexion was standing outside while holding a basketball in his hands. The boy was barely 5ft tall and he looked like he was just 11 years old. He had dark brown hair and he was very skinny. Tom and Danny could see everything because he was only wearing shorts. Other than that, he was bare-chested and he had sandals on his feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s him\u2026\u201d Tom whispered in Danny\u2019s ear as the two boys were standing at a distance. \u201cThat\u2019s Jake! He doesn\u2019t look 13 but he just told me he had his birthday the other day!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then\u2026\u201d Danny grinned as he laced his fingers together and cracked his knuckles. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll have to help him out! He could use some muscle!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny then whispered a silent command, ordering Jake\u2019s muscles to grow until he was a young muscle boy.  Tom could just hear him say it. \u201cGrow Jake\u2019s muscles until he\u2019s like a young 13-year-old muscleboy!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake let out a soft moan when suddenly all his muscles started to grow! His calves and quads bulged from his legs, his biceps and his forearms grew thicker and wider with raw muscle, and his stomach was now sporting six-pack abdominal muscles! His pectorals inflated and pushed outwards and sideways all at once, making his shoulders grow much wider than before. In fact, his upper body was much wider than his waist! He was sporting a serious V-taper! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly crap! What\u2019s going on?\u201d Jake gasped as he felt his strength increase everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Tom and Danny walked up to the boy just as he tossed the orange ball through the hoop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Jake! How\u2019s going?\u201d Tom said to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh\u2026. I\u2019m okay\u2026. I was just feeling kinda\u2026 weird\u2026.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re looking great, dude! Have you been working out?\u201d Tom asked the boy, who had bulked up tremendously in one minute. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Tom and Danny just stood there and grinned at the muscle boy, who was still looking down at his massive legs and arms, flexing as he just gawked at his own body in disbelief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh... No! NO! I never worked out in my life!\u201d Jake said honestly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re kidding me, right? You got all that muscle?\u201d Tom giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re stronger than either one of us!\u201d Danny laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, come hang out with us!\u201d Tom suggested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Tom, Danny and Jake just wandered down the street, passing the houses on the familiar road. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny would glance at Jake, the shy muscle boy, and he would add another pound of muscle to Jake\u2019s arms or legs, just for fun. He had decided he was going to grow Jake even more as the day went on\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He loved showing off his muscles with that tight t-shirt, but it was obvious that they needed some more comfortable clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir clothes quickly morphed into high cut wrestling singlets. Daniel had a red singlet, while his best friend had a blue one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! Thank you, Dan!\" Tom said when their singlets were finally ready. They were still a bit tight, but they were giving a better mobility to their bodies. Daniel smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, someone opened Tom's bedroom door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who... Who are you?\" a scared man said as he saw the two wrestlers in his son's bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad!\" Tom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get out off my house NOW!\" Tom's father shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! No! Dad!\" Tom said. \"It's me, Tommy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel had to solve that. He quickly introduced all the information about his demigod powers and their transformations into Tom's father mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tommy... Is that really you?\" Tom's father finally asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Sorry dad. We scared you.\" Tom smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are Daniel, right? And you have magic powers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Sorry, Mr. Grant.\" Daniel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a short silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look amazing, kids!\" Tom's father said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad! Don't call us kids! We're not kids anymore!\" Tom said and all laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom was now taller than his father, and of course he was stronger. He loved his father a lot, his mother died when he was only a baby and his father had to take care of him alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I stay like this, dad?\" Tom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... Let me think...\" he said. \"Daniel, I want to ask you something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, tell me Mr. Grant.\" Daniel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, just call me John!\" he laughed. \"I... I'd like to be transformed too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! Would you like to be a huge wrestler like us?\" he winked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no... I... I want to be a kid again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\" Tom shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When... When I was a kid I never had real friends, because my father had to travel a lot and I never had time to stay a full year on the same school. I'd like to return to my childhood and enjoy now that age. You can do that, Daniel, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, but Tom...\" Daniel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But dad! What about your job?\" an angry Tom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... Daniel can fix that, I suppose. And now that you are an adult you could take care of a kid, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...\" Tom said. His father as a kid? That sounded very fun.</span></div></div>",

Thank you dude!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now...\" Daniel snapped his fingers again in order to make Mr. Grant younger. He was starting to enjoy using his magic that way, he didn't need to snap his fingers, but it looked cooler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom's father felt weird for some seconds and, almost instantly, his body already changed into a kid! He was finally a kid, he looked like a 9 years old. And it seemed that Daniel gave him a muscle power up, because the boy looked like a young version of his supermuscular adult son. Finally, his clothes were also changed into a wrestling singlet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I a kid now?\" he said looking at his body. Everything was smaller now, not only his body, but also his son's room. And his own son was now simply huge!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoah, son! You look AMAZING! You look even more huge now that I'm smaller.\" he said smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... It seems that you will be as huge as me when you turn into a grown up. I don't know any kid of your age that is so muscular, you surely look like a little superhero, dad!\" Tom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Dan!\" Tom's father said.<br>\r\n\"No problem, Mr. Grant!\" Daniel smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't call me Mr. Grant anymore. I'm just John. Mr. Grant is now my son.\" John said as he jumped to hug his big son. He looked very happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I guess we are going to swap our rooms. Dad, you'll be using my old room and I'll use your room. Do you like it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John, open your closet.\" Daniel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn ran to the closed and opened it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's full of toys and videogames! Cool!\" he said. He could not wait to play all of them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tommy, now open your closet.\" Daniel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth men and the kid went to Tom's new room, he opened the closet and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened here!?\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll his father's old clothes were turned into wrestling singlets. Most of them were dark blue like the one he was wearing, but there were also some black and dark red ones. There were some boots too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't stay the rest of my life wearing only wrestling singlets!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't tell me you don't like it!\" Daniel laughed. \"You are a family of wrestlers now. You should be proud of your muscles, why don't you show off them the whole day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes but, people will think I'm a freak!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"People WON'T notice anything strange.\" Daniel said as he snapped his fingers again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Tom already guessed that his friend used his magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. And you can still call your father 'dad', no one will think that's weird even if he is only a little boy.\" Daniel approached to the boy. \"John, you also have your singlets in your closet. You'll love going to school showing off your muscles, little Hercules!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww... Do I have to go to school?\" John said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! You are a kid now!\" Tom said and everyone laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And finally, your basement is now a huge gym just for you.\" Daniel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Dan. We'll never forget what you did to us today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, Mr. Grant!\" Daniel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't call me Mr. Grant! You are my best friend, you can still call me Tommy.\" Tom laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was too late. John went to his bedroom and fell asleep. Both huge wrestlers went downstairs and took some cold beers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dan, what are you going to do now?\" Tom asked to his best friend.</span></div></div>",

Well...

You mean I must wear a cape and briefs like Superman?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha! Not exactly. You could keep your singlet as a uniform, but yes, you would cool with a costume like Superman. Anyway, I was talking about doing favours to other people.<br>\r\nImagine a father that wants to spend more time with his son, you'll be there to turn him into a kid! Imagine a kid that wants to work out with his father at the gym, you'll be there to turn him into an adult!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think it's a good idea?\" Daniel asked his best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then!\" Daniel said. He had to admit it sounded good, it was the best way to help people with his demigod powers. He snapped his fingers and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFLOOOSH! After a white flash that blinded Tommy for some seconds, Daniel was already wearing his new superhero costume. His skin was fully filled by a red tight fabric that covered almost all his body. He was also wearing long blue boots and gloves, and also blue briefs with a golden yellow belt. He had a big golden 'D' on his chest. He kept the same muscles he had some seconds ago, and he really looked like a real superhero!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Tommy also noticed that he was also wearing a similar costume! It was almost the same, but it had blue and red colors swapped, he was wearing a silver belt and his chest showed a big 'T' made of silver too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Why did you change me too?\" Tommy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From now on I'm known as Super Dan, the famous superhero. Everyone in this city knows me.\" Daniel said as he flexed his arms. \"And you are my helper and assistant, Titan Tom. So forget about your father's old job, you are coming with me.\" Daniel winked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really!? Cool! Does that mean I have magical powers too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, sorry, I can't do that. Unfortunately, I'm only allowed to be the only one Demigod on Earth. But I gave you some necessary superpowers like superstrength, flying and teleporting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if I don't have magical powers, how I am going to help you?\" Tommy wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will understand everything tomorrow!\" Daniel grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy knew that he could trust him, so he decided to go to sleep, next day was going to be their first day as superheroes and they had to rest. Daniel created a new room on Tommy's home and slept there. Both slept wearing their new supercostumes, they felt very comfortable with them, it was like a second skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext day, Tommy left John in school. He was ready for his first day as a superhero. He teleported himself to his home again, where Daniel was waiting for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go...!\" Daniel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we going today?\" Tommy asked. </span></div></div>",

Wanna wrestle with me? Tomorrow I'll wake up as a kid, so I want to enjoy my last hours as a supermuscular adult!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" Tommy smiled. Suddenly, the living room started to change. In only some seconds all sofas and furniture merged into a wrestling mat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext day, little John woke up. As he opened his eyes he noticed that a bed that wasn't there last night appeared next to his. A supermuscular kid of his age was sleeping there. And he was wearing exactly the same Speedo as him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Wake up kid! Who are you!? What are you doing on my bedroom!?\" John said a bit scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel opened his eyes slowly... He totally forgot! John didn't know anything about his transformation!

Wait!\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy explained everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and for that reason, Dan turned into a kid. He's going to be your brother, dad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My brother? Cool!\" John said. Tommy smiled, he still could not believe that he had two kids! And he was very proud of them, they were the most muscular 8 years old boys of the world! They were like a little copy of himself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay kids, today is your first day at school and my first day at dad's old job. Come on, let's go to the bathroom, you must have a shower!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kids quickly took off their Speedos and ran naked to the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These kids...\" Tommy smiled as he picked up their Speedos in the ground. The muscular kids were already under the shower, playing with water and laughing like any other kid of their age. Meanwhile, Tom was preparing the breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter having the shower, the kids wore their wrestling singlets (they chose red singlets) and had breakfast.

Dreams about monsters, dark creatures, and the death of the innocent people who happened to cross their path. Danny in all of his life had never experienced dreams as horrible and as frightening before today. Danny quickly ate breakfast, and decided to take a quick walk around the neighborhood to clear his mind, and regain his sense on reality. Good thing it was Saturday, today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, Danny last night you were not visited by a strange hippie wearing a toga with golden Sandals, I am not a demigod, I don\u2019t have god like powers.\u201d Danny said walking down the sidewalk stroking his eyes, which were irritated, and burning for some strange reason. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny\u2019s eyes seemed to burn with every passing second, and as time passed the burning seemed to get worse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hells wrong with my eyes?\u201d Danny asks feeling genuinely concerned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny\u2019s vision was blurred, he could barley see his hand in front of his own face, the pain was just to great, but the burning pain soon disappeared, leaving Dannie\u2019s vision forever changed, altered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat in the world.\u201d Danny said looking around his surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Danny saw blew his mind serval times over. Strange creatures made of light flew through the sky. Gigantic plants covering buildings, the streets were filled with sparkling creatures of different sizes, these creatures were everywhere, crawling on the ground, climbing buildings, sitting on houses, their were even a few creatures on people\u2019s shoulders. It almost looked a little beautiful how these creatures seem to glow, all in different colors. But what was strange, was that people acted like these creatures didn\u2019t exist, it was almost like these creatures were invisible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god what is happening to me?\u201d Danny asked grabbing his head with both hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is it, I\u2019ve cracked. Oh man, oh man, oh man, what am I going to do? I\u2019ve gone crazy.\u201d Danny says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy are you filled with so much woe Daniel Davis?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny turns around and sees the exact same man he saw last night. But the man was dressed differently. The man wore a white shirt, he had on black Nicky shorts and flip flops on his feet. Really the only thing that was the same was the mans curly brown hair and eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s you.\u201d Danny said looking at the man in shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t get your name.\u201d Danny says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh right how rude of me, I was in a rush last night, I am the great god Perseus.\u201d The man says striking a heroic pose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are a god?\u201d Danny asks looking at the man named Perseus with a little doubt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike thee god, you know the Tower of Babel, burning bush, Noah\u2019s ark, god?\u201d Danny asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny wasn\u2019t a believer in the divine, he never really had a reason to believe, and let\u2019s just face it, this man didn\u2019t really look like a god, last night when he was wearing his white toga, golden sandals, and glowed with golden light, sure he looked like a god then, but now Danny was not all that sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no, no, no, I would never claim to be that important, but a god yes. Im Perseus from Greek mythology.\u201d Perseus says with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean the son of Zeus Perseus.\u201d Danny asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep that\u2019s the one.\u201d The man says putting his thumb up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour a god? It never said that you became a god in the myth.\u201d Danny says, trying to think back to when I had red Greek mythology. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYea that part was edited out of the story books. But I am a god, and I\u2019m here to help you Daniel Davis.\u201d Perseus says grabbing my shoulder with his right hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood because I really need your help, I\u2019m seeing things, lights, strange creatures.\u201d Danny says rubbing his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I suppose you are, it\u2019s nothing to be afraid of, it\u2019s just your body adjusting.\u201d Perseus says putting his hands on his hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAdjusting? Adjusting to what?\u201d Danny\u2019s asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo being a demigod, remember I told you last night.\u201d Perseus says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are not a normally made demigod, so your body is still adjusting to the power.\u201d Perseus said walking towards me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat does this mean?\u201d Danny asks a little scared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt means that you have the sight.\u201d Perseus says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe sight what\u2019s the sight?\u201d Danny\u2019s asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIts the power to see the world beyond the world. It\u2019s the power to see through the fog.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the fog?\u201d Danny\u2019s asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s the substance that clouds the sight of mortals hiding anything supernatural from their eyes. Only beings that belong to the supernatural world can see through it.\u201d Perseus says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo those lights, those plants, and creatures....\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre spirits, and spiritual plants.\u201d Perseus says cutting me off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpirits, spiritual plants? What the hell are those.\u201d Danny\u2019s asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell spirits are beings born from nature, and spiritual plants are plants that house spirits, their branches can also be used for different purposes.\u201d Perseus says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry they are mostly harmless, especially these weak spirits, and they are actually very helpful when it comes to preserving nature.\u201d Perseus says with a gentle smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny couldn\u2019t believe this, his whole world seemed to be turning upside down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo I\u2019m really a demigod?\u201d Danny\u2019s asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are really a demigod.\u201d Perseus says nodding his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell actually you are more powerful than a demigod, you are a demigod that can do almost anything.\u201d Perseus says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnything?\u201d Danny asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnything. But just because your power is infinite doesn\u2019t mean that you yourself are infinite. So be careful.\u201d Perseus says with a series tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkkkk.\u201d Danny says not really knowing what Perseus was talking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell don\u2019t worry you shouldn\u2019t get into to much trouble, and as I\u2019ve said before I will be watching over you. Zeus doesn\u2019t like the gods interfering with mortals, especially now a days, but I should be able to help you a little.\u201d Perseus says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I just ask you one more question?\u201d Danny asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShoot.\u201d Perseus says <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy did you pick me for this power?\u201d Danny asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerseus looks at Danny for a few minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell you what, I\u2019ll tell you one day when you are ready.\u201d Perseus says with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThunder roars throughout the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I guess that\u2019s my time to go.\u201d Perseus says glowing with golden light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell thank you for this opportunity. Lord Perseus.\u201d Danny says with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI believe in you Daniel Davis, remember the rules, do not use your powers for evil... Be well child.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerseus soon disappears leaving me alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh man what am I going to do first.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But before he could help others he had to know what he could do first. Surely Perseus wouldn\u2019t have a problem with him testing his power out a little bit, would he? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo I can do anything? Well I want to stop time.\u201d Danny says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny looks around his surroundings and realizes that everything, and everyone has stopped moving completely. Even the spirits were as still as statues. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is amazing!\u201d Danny shouts at the top of his lungs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny running down the street sees a red car parked by the sidewalk. Seeing the car, a smile appears on Danny\u2019s face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want Absolute strength.\u201d Danny\u2019s says. (Absolute strength is infinite strength) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny walks over to the car, kneels down and with great ease picks the car up. Danny felt mighty, he felt powerful. This was life, this was his life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I love you Perseus.\u201d Danny\u2019s says with a little laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny slowly and carefully puts the car down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want time to return to normal.\u201d Danny\u2019s says snapping his fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime resumes like nothing had ever happened. Danny\u2019s fun was not over yet, it was just starting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want absolute speed.\u201d Danny\u2019s says with a little smile. (Absolute speed is Infinite speed) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny starts to jog at incredible speeds. Danny, just jogging with ease broke the sound barrier. Danny jogged all across California in 3 minutes, and he didn\u2019t even break a sweat. Danny lived in the small city of cypress, it only took 5 seconds to explore every nook and cranny of the whole city. Danny started to feel tired so he decided to stop a few blocks away from his home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhew, I\u2019ve never had fun like that.\u201d Danny says wiping the sweat from his forehead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny started to walk home as soon as he realized  that the sun was going down. Apparently he spent the whole day having fun with his powers, well deep down he had no regrets. He had fun, and also worked up a good sweat along the way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny walking down the side walk hears a loud roar a few feet behind him. Danny quickly turns around to see a glowing red spirit standing in the middle of the road.The spirit was around 20 feet tall. Danny knew that this spirit was different from the others he had encountered, it had a foul smell, and it emitted a powerful killing intent as it gazed at Danny. Danny gazed at the spirit with astonishment, it almost looked like a king crab, with the right claw bigger than the other, and it had six legs, each leg had hundreds of spikes protruding from the sides. The spirits shell looked hard and sturdy. The spirit  had four eyes, each eye was fixed on Danny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny started to back up slowly, really how could no body sees this monster, Danny thought as sweat started to run down his forehead. The spirit crab started to inch closer and closer to Danny, Danny could tell that it was getting ready to attack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh man, oh man, oh man what am I going to do?\u201d Danny asked feeling terrified. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought Perseus said that these spirits where harmless.\u201d Danny said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny turns around and begins to sprint down the sidewalk. The spirit crab with a ear shattering roar starts to chase Danny down the sidewalk. To regular people, Danny seemed to be sprinting down the sidewalk for no reason, they just couldn\u2019t see through the fog, and therefore couldn't see the giant spirit crab chasing after Danny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny was feeling tired, he had to do something because the spirit crab was catching up..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh wait, I have infinite power.\u201d Danny says hitting his forehead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright time to take care of this crab.\u201d Danny says feeling more confident. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny stops running and faces the spirit crab, which was coming right towards Danny at great speeds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTime stop!\u201d Danny yells. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spirit crab begins to stop, as time itself begins to come to a halt. Danny felt like it was possible to defeat this monster, but before he started to make his next move, his chest began to hurt, and his body began to burn up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s, what\u2019s happening to me?\u201d Danny asked breathing hard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spirit crab began to move slowly, time seemed to start to move again, even though it was not as fast as before. Danny\u2019s body was aching all over. He could still move, but every movement made his body hurt more. Danny didn\u2019t know why his body was hurting so much, but he soon came to the conclusion that it was his powers doing this to him. Did he some how over load his powers, by using them to much? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time passed the spirit crab began to move even faster, Danny had to do something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSupernatural strength!\u201d Danny yelled. (Supernatural strength is super strength, which is weaker than absolute strength). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny wanted to use his absolute strength, but deep down he knew if he were to us absolute strength again, he would only kill himself. Right know Danny has to be careful, right now Danny\u2019s powers were not on his side. Danny was about to battle a monster, he could hardly believe himself. It was a good thing that nobody was around to see this or to be more precise, to see Danny fighting nothing but air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny had one thing going for him, time was still moving slowly, therefore the spirit crabs movement speed had greatly diminished. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny ran forward ready to attack the crab. The crab seeing this, uses his right gigantic claw to take a swing at Danny. Danny to the spirit crabs surprise was very quick, as he ducked below the claw  dodging it completely, and with a powerful strike of his fist, sends the spirit crab flying 10 feet away. The impact of the spirit crab landing in the ground cracked the pavement, creating a loud explosion, that even normal people could hear. Danny didn\u2019t strike with a hundred percent of his power, but he was still surprise to see the Spirit crab uninjured from his previous attack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spirit crab totally recovered from Danny\u2019s attack runs towards Danny, completely consumed by its wrath. The crab was faster than it was before, which took Danny by surprise. Once again the spirit crab swings at Danny with its right claw. Danny once again dodges by jumping back, but the crab still doesn\u2019t stop attacking, but this time it uses its smaller left claw, which moves at lightning speed compared to the bigger claw. The smaller claw hits Danny\u2019s right in the gut, Danny receiving the powerful attack bends over gasping for air, but unfortunate for him the spirit crab was not done attacking. The spirit crab attacks Danny with its right giant claw, Danny not having enough power to dodge gets hit by the giant claw. Danny goes flying into a telephone pole, completely snapping it in half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny had his back against the wall with blood running down his face. So much for this being the greatest day of his life. He thought as he looked at the spirit crab. The spirit crab raises its right claw and opens it wide, a bright light starts to appear in side the claw. Danny deep down knew what was happening, but deep down he hoped he was wrong. To bad he wasn\u2019t wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light grew bigger with every passing second, until finally a huge beam of Energy shot towards Danny with great speed. Danny knew that the crab was preparing some kind of beam attack, therefore he was ready, ready to jump out of the way, even though it hurt him a lot to do so. \u201cBOOM\u201d, The whole entire wall was blown away, and smoke filled the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny had to end this and he had to end this now. Danny looking at the broken telephone pole got a idea. Danny reverted his eyes back to the crab who looked to be as drained as he was. The crab was quite skilled in Danny\u2019s opinion, it\u2019s small claw it used for quickness and it\u2019s bigger right claw it used for power, the beam was made to finish off its opponent. But now it\u2019s one, two, three combo had failed and it was tired. Danny still had his super strength thank god. Danny walks over towards the broken telephone pole and picks it up with both of his hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk you fricken monster bring it on.\u201d Danny says getting in a fighting stance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spirit crab once again runs forward and takes another swing at Danny with its left claw, which was still fast but not as fast as before. Danny this time was able to dodge the attack, but once again the spirit crab starts to let loose a barge of attacks, Danny was able to dodge every attack with great difficulty. Danny jumps 30 feet in the air with the telephone pole in hand, right above the spirit crab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTAKE THIS!!!!!!!!\u201d Danny yells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny shoves the tip of the broken telephone into the crab, breaking its shell and impaling its body. The spirit crab let\u2019s out a loud painful roar as it falls to the ground dead. Danny landing on the pavement falls down to tired to move. Danny gazed at the now dead monster, and sees it vanish like smoke. The battle was over, he was the victor. Before Danny lost consciousness he saw three people stand right in front of him. Danny couldn\u2019t see what they looked like, but he could tell that it was two men and a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs it him?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes that\u2019s him p, without a doubt.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo think that he would be this powerful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are we going to do with him.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe will take him to the school.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Danny sat on the wet green grass over looking a large lake. The air was cold and covered in a dense fog, that seemed to limit Danny\u2019s vision quite a lot. The fog didn\u2019t bother Danny all that much, no in fact something about this place made him feel comfortable. Was it the water from the lake, the grass he sat on, or maybe the pine cone trees that surrounded the whole area, that seemed to calm his nerves, he did not know, nor did he care, all he wanted to do was stay here in this place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChampion of the gods it is time that you wake up.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny upon hearing a feminine voice quickly turns around to see a beautiful women with long blond hair, staring right at him. The women wore a pure white tunic that covered only her right leg, but completely exposed the other leg. On her arms rested golden bracelets that sparkled with great intensity. The women wore a small crown covered In diamonds, each diamond sparked like a star in the night sky, and on her shoulder rested a little owl, which gave off a strange feeling as it stared at you with its acute gaze. She reminded Danny of Perseus, the first time they had met. Could she be a god, Danny thought as he looked at her. The women\u2019s eyes were vigilant as if she was expecting someone to attack her, but more than anything they were gray like storm clouds. Danny could tell as he stared right into them with astonishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d Danny asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing Danny\u2019s question the women reveals a little smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo not concern yourself with my identity child, for right now you must wake up, with a understanding of the fate you hold in your hands.\u201d The women says <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Danny asks, honestly he was tired of people talking in riddles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou do not understand my words, well at least understand this child.\u201d The women says putting her right hand on Danny\u2019s shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou must act with wisdom before you use your powers, and you must be careful, for many gods above the heavens and many gods under the earth want you to fail in your mission.\u201d The women says growing serious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell i must be on my way.\u201d The women says glowing in a golden light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUntil we meet again champion.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait you didn\u2019t tell me who you......\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Danny could finish his sentence the women had disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre..... great.\u201d Danny says feeling a little angry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dream soon starts to fade and Danny wakes up in a comfortable bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was a dream, only a dream.\u201d Danny says with a little nap it of sweat on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny waking up from his dream feels something on his head. Danny wondering what it was uses his right hand to grab the object stuck to his forehead. Danny soon held a small yellow sticky note in his hands. Danny flips the sticky note over and sees writing on the front. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey kid, good work fighting the spirit, you should be proud of yourself. I saw that you had a little trouble but in the end you figured it out. But remember you need to be careful on how you use your powers. Your<br>\r\npower is infinite but your body is not, use to much of you power and your body will be destroyed \ud83d\ude1f. That\u2019s why I told you to be careful. So I made you a list of the powers you should try to avoid using. Power like absolute, divine, transcendent, meta, almighty, are powers you should try to use a little as possible. Well either way I will be watching over you so keep up the good work. From Perseus. OH and P.S. you have switched schools.\ud83d\ude09\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe letter was from peruses. Danny once said He loved that god, well P Danny wanted to take it back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow you worn me about my powers.\u201d Danny says a little annoyed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd if you were watching why didn\u2019t you help?!\u201d Danny yells. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe gods don\u2019t usually offer their help to people young man.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh God!!\u201d Danny yells, surprised by the sudden voice he heard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny turns his head to the far corner of the room and sees a man sitting in the shadows. The man had light brown hair, and a scare that looked like a lightning bolt surround his right blue eye. The man wore a black jacket that seemed to come down to the mans ankles, the jacket had a small hood in the back, and had white trimmings, the jacket didn\u2019t seem ordinary to Danny, deep down he knew it was not normal. The man also whore black pants and black military strapped boots. On the right side of the mans chest was a silver badge that looked like a star. Danny didn\u2019t know who this man was but he knew he wasn\u2019t someone to mess with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d Danny asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe I\u2019m Paul, Paul Finch. And you are?\u201d The man named Paul asks as he stands up and walks towards me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Daniel Davis, but just call me Danny.\u201d I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDanny it is.\u201d Paul reaches out for a hand shake, and I, not wanting to be rude shake his hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Paul were you watching me sleep?\u201d I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! Well yes, but I was under orders to make sure yo stayed in this room.\u201d Paul says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho ordered you?\u201d I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh don\u2019t worry you will meet him someday. Congratulations by the way for defeating that corruption.\u201d Paul says patting my shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s a corruption.\u201d Danny asks feeling confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know that evil spirit.\u201d Paul says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny automatically thinks back to that moment In time when he almost died. The spirits crab, talk about a miracle. Danny looks at Paul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo that thing was called a corruption?\u201d Danny asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, and you defeated it, all by yourself.\u201d Paul says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is a corruption.\u201d Danny asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know you have a lot of questions Danny but you are going to have to save it for later, we have someone to meet.\u201d Paul says with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait a minute I thought I couldn\u2019t leave this room.\u201d Danny asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you cant, not without me. My orders were to take you took the principle as soon as you woke up.\u201d Paul says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe principle?\u201d Danny asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny thought back to the letter that Perseus sent him, somewhere in the letter Perseus said something about a new school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh great.\u201d Danny says getting out of bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaul leads Danny to the principles office. The journey was filled with a lot of turns and a lot of stairs. Danny soon realized that he was in some kind of dungeon before Paul had come to get him out, Danny couldn\u2019t help but think what kind of school had dungeons under ground. As Paul and Danny walked through the school, Danny was able to see many things, like the boys and girls locker room, the regular lockers, the swimming pool, which had a few beautiful girls swimming in it. Danny also saw a few basket ball courts, a tennis court, and a grassy filled that stretched out for miles and miles with no end in sight. Danny honestly didn\u2019t know how it was possible. Danny then saw a huge dome like building, Danny asked Paul what it the building was for, Paul explained to Danny that the building was for music classes. Danny looked like a child who had visited Disney land for the first time in their lives, shocked excited, overwhelmed etc. Paul even told Danny that he didn\u2019t even see half of the school yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow can your school be this big? I mean it has to be the biggest school in the world.\u201d Danny says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I think I\u2019m going to let the principle explain it to you, he could always explain it better than me. Paul said with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Danny and Paul walked through the school, Danny couldn't help but feel like he was being watched. Danny looking around notices that every student that him and Paul passed was watching Danny with great entrust. Danny could even see some of the students whispering to each other, while staring at him. Danny hated being the center of attention, but their was little he could to help it. Danny could have used his powers to make everyone mind their own business but decided against it, not wanting to put strain on his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy is everyone looking at me?\u201d Danny asks Paul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell word has gotten around of a so called champion of the gods.\u201d Paul says looking at Danny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny remembered the women form his dreams, that is exactly what she Called him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDanny it is also no secret that you killed a corruption all on your own. Their are many students here who haven\u2019t even seen one yet let alone fought one.\u201d Paul says with a little laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny sighs hard. He didn\u2019t know how this New found attention was going to affect his daily life, but all he could hope for was that nothing bad happened because of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaul and Danny soon stand in front of a door with the words principles office branded in the middle. They were on the highest floor to the tallest building that occupied the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaul knocks on the door three times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome in.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaul and Danny hearing the invitation, opens the door and walks into the room<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve brought him principle Leon.\u201d Paul says, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes thank you very much Paul.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny sees a man sitting behind a large wooden desk. The man was well built, and looked like he could be a body builder. The man had dirty blond hair and a small dirty blond beard. The Man wore a suit that looked a little to tight to hold his well built body, and yet he seemed to make it work. Danny looking into the mans eyes saw that the mans eyes were not normal like a humans, but were a little cat like. Another weirdo Danny thought. The man getting up from off his chair smiles and sticks his hands out as if he was about to give someone a hug<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome to Half Blood High school Daniel Davis.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Ever since Danny could remember he had always been shy, he had gotten better over the years but their was still a few times when his shyness would resurface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook principle Leon, what is this about me going to a new school.\u201d Danny asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrinciple Leon smile soon disappears, which alerted Danny that he had touched on a very serious topic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I guess we should just jump into it then should we?\u201d Principal Leon says with a serious tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDaniel Davis starting from this moment on you are now a student of half blood academy.\u201d Principal Leon says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, why? Why must I change schools?\u201d Danny asks feeling a little irritated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease understand Daniel Davis this is for your own protection.\u201d Principle Leon says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy protection? Protection from what?\u201d Danny asks, even though he had a idea as to the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProtection from the monster you had faced earlier.\u201d Principle Leon says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have already killed that thing, it will never hurt anyone ever again.\u201d Danny says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think that was the only one, corruptions are endless, plus their are even greater threats out their you have yet to face.\u201d Principle Leon says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny didn\u2019t want to imagine it, their were more dangers out their, dangers a lot greater than the corruption that he had faced. It scared him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are corruptions?\u201d Danny asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCorruptions are evil spirits, created from a variety of evil acts, and evil thoughts.\u201d Principle Leon says looking a little sad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEvil acts and evil thoughts?\u201d Danny asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, negative emotions from mortals sometime result in a corruption or impurity from being born.\u201d Principle Leon says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cImpurity?\u201d Danny asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnother name for corruption.\u201d Principle Leon says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnother case of a corruption is when a regular spirit, turns into a corruption, because of their negative emotions, that taint their very being.\u201d Principle Leon says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c so spirits can also turn into a corruption?\u201d Danny asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, spirits are beings composed of pure positive energy, when a spirit experiences to much negative energy they fall into corruption.\u201d Principle Leon explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s terrible.\u201d Danny says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes it is, spirits who turn into corruptions are usually the most powerful of the bunch, actually the corruption that you faced, probably uses to be a spirit at one point in time.\u201d Principle Leon says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what does this have to do with me?\u201d Danny asks crossing his arms.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA lot, corruptions are drawn to demigods, like moths to a flame, the more powerful the demigod, the more corruptions are drawn to them.\u201d Principle Leon says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd If what lord Perseus said is true than you are the most powerful demigod, that exists right now.\u201d Principle Leon says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve talked to Perseus?\u201d Danny asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes he appeared to me a few days ago. He was the one who told me about you, and it was his idea that you come here. Oh and he wanted me to tell you something as well.\u201d Principle Leon says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did he want to tell me?\u201d Danny asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomething he forgot to tell you before.\u201d Principle Leon says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course.\u201d Danny says, slapping his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe wanted me to tell you that the more you use your powers the more impurity\u2019s are going to be drawn to you, impurity\u2019s and other more powerful monsters, so be careful, also he wanted to tell you that you should also refrain from using Omni powers.\u201d Principle Leon says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOmni powers?\u201d Danny asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny remembered the list of powers Perseus had told him to watch out for, Omni powers were not on the list.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerseus said that out of all the powers in your arsenal, Omni powers are the most dangerous, and should never be used unless it is absolutely necessary.\u201d Principle Leon says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOmni powers must be very powerful if Perseus was warning him not to use it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn what else is Perseus hiding from me.\u201d Danny thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerseus has also told me of your situation, so I know of your almighty power, me and a few other selected people, as soon as I found out about you I sent three people to collect you, one of them was Paul, the other two you will meet shortly.\u201d Principle Leon says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny looked at Paul and remembered the three people he saw before passing out. Paul simply smiled at Danny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll leave up to you whether or not to keep it a secret.\u201d Principle Leon says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany of Danny\u2019s questions had been answered, but still their was still a few things he just didn\u2019t get. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat makes this place, different from the outside world? Why am I safe here, and not out their?\u201d Danny asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is simple to explain. This whole area is protected by the gods, and lies in another dimension than the regular world.\u201d Principle Leon says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn another dimension?\u201d Danny asks feeling a little light headed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, in another dimension. Monsters will never be bale to find this place because it lies separate from the regular world.\u201d Principle Leon explains. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe can control everything in this infinite space, the size, the weather, even day, and night, everything is under the control of the school.\u201d Principle Leon says with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn here we offer protection to you, and to people like you.\u201d Principle Leon says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPeople like me? What do you mean.\u201d Danny asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, did you think you were the only demigod out their?\u201d Principle Leon asks looking at Danny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTheir are others?\u201d Danny asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon asking this question principle Leon began to laugh, even Paul who Danny forgot was in the room with him, began to giggle a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDaniel Davis, almost every student that goes to this school is a demigod.\u201d Principle Leon says with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny was taken back from this news. Danny had seen a lot of demigods walking throughout the campus, it was hard to believe that all of those people were demigods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEven Paul here is a demigod.\u201d Principle Leon says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny turns towards Paul. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour a demigod?\u201d Danny asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep but I\u2019m not a artificially created demigod like you.\u201d Paul says scratching his forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cArtificially created?\u201d Danny asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cArtificially created demigods are demigods, not born between a mortal and a god. They are being ps that were once human but were transformed into demigods. Like you, yourself.\u201d Principle Leon explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo I\u2019m a artificially created demigod?\u201d Danny asks, not likening the sound of that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, but don\u2019t worry, you are not alone, their are many demigods that are artificially created, you may meet a few in class.\u201d Principle Leon says, seeing the look of anger on Danny\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo If your not a artificially created demigod, than who\u2019s your godly parent?\u201d Danny asks Paul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, well my dad is Thor from Norse mythology.\u201d Paul says with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThor, wait there are other gods that exist, other than the Greek gods.?\u201d Danny asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, their are many pantheons of God\u2019s that exist, and many of their children come here for training.\u201d Principle Leon says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny seems even more confused, their were other gods than the Greek gods now. Plus principle Leon said something about training, what training, Danny thought. Everything seems to be happening to fast, their was to much to comprehend, to much to understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou said their where even more powerful monsters out their, more powerful than corruptions?\u201d Danny asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes a lot more powerful, monsters and demons that seek to throw our world into chaos, it is our job to train you to be prepared to face these threats.\u201d Principle Leon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKnock, knock, knock. Someone was knocking at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome in.\u201d Principle Leon says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA girl walks into the room. The girl had short brown hair that came down to her shoulders, and she had brown eyes. The girl seemed to be around Danny\u2019s age, give or take a few years older. The girl wore the same uniform Paul whore. The only difference being, that the girls jacket didn\u2019t go all the way down to her ankles, but stopped at her waist, the girl wore long black Jean pants, and had on the exact type of boots on her feet as Paul. She also wore a silver badge on her right shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDaniel Davis, this is Abigail Rose, she will be giving you a tour around the campus, she was also the second person I sent to get you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny once again remembered the girl in the three man group. The girl lightly bowed her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you.\u201d She said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe pleasure is all mine.\u201d Danny says <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo shall we get started?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Danny and Abigail walk through the school, both barely uttering a single word. Abigail showed Danny a few of the class rooms he would be joining, she showed him the different activities he could join when ever he wanted to, activities like basketball, tennis, and even swimming in the schools personal pool that even had its own jacuzzi. Honestly Danny had never seen such a beautiful school in his life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbigail soon took Danny inside of the huge dome like building he saw before when he was walking with Paul. Abigail had told Danny that this building was called the Apollon pavilion. Before Danny even walked inside he could hear the sound of music dancing inside both of his ears. Music that kept on getting louder and more beautiful as he drew closer. Soon Danny along with Abigail found their way all the way inside of the music building. Danny had never seen so many students inside one building before. Each student held a musical instrument in their hands, and the few who didn\u2019t where singing, each student with a instrument played it with such mastery and skill that Danny was brought to tears from the beautiful music generated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh god, what\u2019s happening?\u201d Danny asks wiping the tears from his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry it happens to everyone their first time experiencing it.\u201d Abigail says with her hands on your shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExperiencing what?\u201d Danny asks still crying \ud83d\ude2d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe melody of a demigod.\u201d Abigail says with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of watching the music class Danny and Abigail decide to leave. Abigail walked in front of Danny as they both exited the building, as Danny walked behind Abigail he heard the sound of Abigail sniffing, and he could of sworn he saw a small tear run down her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbigail are you ok?\u201d Danny asks concerned \ud83d\ude1f. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbigail quickly wipes her tears and turns to face Danny with a smile on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes I\u2019m ok Danny.\u201d She says sounding all cheerful, but Danny some how knew it was a lie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny and Abigail soon found themselves outside of the Apollon Pavilion. Danny looked at Abigail as she thought of the next place she should take him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Abigail I have a question.\u201d Danny says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbigail breaking out of her train of thought, looks at Danny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah, what\u2019s your question.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve just learned that many gods exist, not just the Greek pantheon, so why his this huge building named after Apollo only?\u201d Danny asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I don\u2019t know all of the details but I heard that Lord Apollo had won a bet with the other gods in charge of music. Apparently lord Apollo won and therefore this whole entire building was named after him.\u201d Abigail explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t the only building though. Their is the thunder palace.\u201d Abigail says pointing towards a  humongous building that stood on a mountain miles away in the distance. The building was so big it almost reached all the way in the clouds \u2601\ufe0f.  Clouds the roared with thunder and shot out lightning that  continuously struck the building. Danny thought it was weird that he didn't notice that building until now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe thunder palace was built in honor of Thor himself. Their are of course other buildings that where built in honor of other gods. In truth Danny you haven\u2019t even seen half of the school yet, you\u2019ve only seen a small portion so far. Danny couldn\u2019t help but be taken back from that statement. Danny had already seen so much, but apparently he still had a lot to see. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbigail and Danny continued their walk around the campus. While walking something caught Dannie\u2019s eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh Abigail what\u2019s happening over their?\u201d Danny asks pointing at a beautiful rainbow \ud83c\udf08 bridge that was miles along in width and had countless people walking on it, all going in different directions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is the Bifrost bridge \ud83c\udf09 that connect the campus to the neighborhood.\u201d Abigail said with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNeighborhood?\u201d Danny asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes the neighborhood. You see some Demigods decide to live here inside the barrier where it is safe. All for different reasons. Some just don\u2019t feel like leaving, and others can\u2019t leave because they are powerful demigods and therefore it is to dangerous to leave the safety of the barrier. So when that happens they can choose to live here, with the condition that they join the order.\u201d Abigail says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the order?\u201d Danny says curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe order is a elite organization that dedicates itself to protecting the world from evil threats. Threats like that corruption you faced.\u201d Abigail says with a series tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Paul are part of the order aren\u2019t you? That\u2019s why you wear those uniforms and badges.\u201d Danny says looking at Abigail <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou would be correct me and Paul are part of the order.\u201d Abigail says with a smile filled with sadness as she looks at Danny with eyes filled with pity, which confused Danny even more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny thought back to the corruption he fought, the corruption he killed. He couldn\u2019t imagine facing any more of those creatures. Danny once again looks at the rainbow bridge. The bridge seems to go on for miles but at the end Danny could see a huge neighborhood filled with houses apartments and mansions that where very beautiful. It didn\u2019t look like a bad place to live.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo that\u2019s the Bifrost bridge from Norse mythology?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh gods no.\u201d Abigail says with a little laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey share the same name yes but this bridge is nothing but a pale imitation of the real Bifrost.\u201d Abigail says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny couldn\u2019t even imagine this beautiful bridge being nothing but a imitation. It was so beautiful and majestic. Danny couldn\u2019t help but wonder what the real Bifrost must look like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dtheir are dozen of these imitations all around the campus, each bridge takes you to a different area in the barrier.\u201d Abigail explains. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbigail and Danny walk towards the grassy fields that went on for miles. Danny saw hundreds of students. Almost every student was wearing battle armor and had a weapon in their hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is were you will come for combat training.\u201d Abigail says as you both watch the students fight and practice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach student was in their own groups, groups filled with hundreds of students. For each group their was one instructor that lead the group. Danny notices that many of the instructors didn\u2019t look that much older than him, and yet each radiated confidence and respect, all of the things Danny Himself didn\u2019t. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Danny and Abigail watched the students train, the ground started to rumble, which made everyone stop what they where doing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you guys usually get earthquakes?\u201d Danny asks curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo we don\u2019t.\u201d Abigail says with a serious tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of a explosion  echoes in the distance. Danny and Abigail as well as every student turn towards the explosion, to see smoke fill the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt came from the school grounds.\u201d Abigail says, and wasting no time sprints towards the campus. Danny along with a myriad of students in battle armor sprint after Abigail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take Danny, Abigail and the other students to make it to the sight of the explosion. What they saw took their breaths away.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground was set a flame \ud83d\udd25 a huge crater rested in the ground and in the middle was a 10 foot monster with a body covered in molten rock and fire,  with two giant horns on top of its head, and two giant swords in both of its fiery hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHERE IS HE???!!!!\u201d The monster shouted with vile in his words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHERE IS THE GOD CHILD!?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Danny deep down knew that this monster what ever it was, was talking about him. Danny noticing Abigail looking at him told him that he wasn\u2019t the only one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh crap.\u201d <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Crimson fire \ud83d\udd25 filled the air devouring everything it came in contact with. Danny had never seen fire like this before, a fire that made him feel nothing but fear and terror. Danny didn\u2019t know if it was just his imagination but as he looked into the Crimson flames he could see every sin he had committed, all the wrong doings, he had done in his life, and without warning a sense of guilt overtook his very soul. All of the Crimson flames came from this one creature that stood 10 feet, covered in molten rock and had two horns on top of his head large enough to impale anyone with ease. Suddenly Danny feels someone grab his shoulder and with fear looks to see that it was Abigail who looked just as frightened as he did, with sweat coming down her face. Abigail looking into Danny\u2019s eyes mutters only one sentience, that Danny could hardly make out from all of the screams the other demigods where making. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t look into the fire!\u201d Abigail yelled as she pulled Danny towards her, as she unsheathes the small golden blade that danny didn\u2019t noticed hung at her side. The blade glowed with dazzling light as the sunlight bathed it in its raze. Abigail assumes a fighting stance as if she was ready at any moment to attack the creature that stood before her. Danny couldn\u2019t help but be amazed as he along with every body else stood behind Abigail, Danny didn\u2019t know how Abigail wasn\u2019t afraid but he hoped it would be enough. With out hesitation Abigail turns her head and looks at A guy that Danny didn\u2019t recognize. The guy in question didn\u2019t seem to be much older than Abigail and had black hair brown eyes and wore a red sleeveless shirt and black Nicky pants along with white running shoes that were covered in grass. Danny soon began to remember were he saw this person . This person was one of the instructors that was leading the training out on the field. Danny watching Abigail have her silent conversation with the instructor sees the instructor nod his head, as if he agreed to something that Abigail had said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEveryone, retreat!\u201d The man yells with a commanding tone. Not needing to be told twice every demigod in the area starts to run towards the Bifrost bridge. Soon the only ones still in the area was Danny Abigail and the instructor who gave the order in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEveryone has evacuated to their respective neighborhoods, backup should be here soon.\u201d The man said as he looked at Abigail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood now take Danny and get to safety now.\u201d Abigail ordered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo Abigail let me stay and help you.\u201d  The man says  not wanting to leave his friend to fight a battle that could cost her, her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo Mathew  it to dangerous.\u201d Abigail said not taking her eyes off of the monster even for a minutes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny after learning the mans name looked towards Mathew who stood next to him, and just like Mathew wanted to stay and fight with Abigail, but found himself asking himself would he be of any help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou guys need to lea.......\u201d Before Abigail could finish her sentience she notices the creature take a small step forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u201dWHERE IS HE?\u201d the creature asked with a voice filled with anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHERE IS THE GODCHILD?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeep down Danny knew that this creature was talking about him, in fact out of the three, the only one who was confused was Mathew himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature with its Firey eyes looks towards the group of Demigods and soon its eyes narrow in on Danny who stood in the middle of the three demigods. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTHEIR YOU ARE.\u201d\u201d The creature stayed with a threatening tone that sent chills down Danny\u2019s back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrimson flame soon starts to gather in side of the creature right hand as. The fire soon forms into a large crimson fire ball that seemed to get bigger and bigger with each passing moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDIE FALSE GOD!!!!\u201d The creature yells throwing the ball of fire towards Danny and the two Demigods beside him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny wanted to panic but with all of his strength managed to keep a calm mind, even in the presence of certain death. Danny closes his eyes and concentrate on the power deep inside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c[ICE MANIPULATION]\u201d Danny says with a deep voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning a huge wall of ice rises from the ground giving the three Demigods protection from the coming attack. Abigail and Mathew with shock evident on their faces look at the ice wall as if it were the most amazing thing in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the! Where did this come from?!\u201d Mathew yells. Mathew takes a glance at Danny and notices something. Mathew noticed that Danny\u2019s hands where covered in ice as if they were frozen. It was at that moment the Mathew understood that Danny himself was behind this phenomenon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ball of crimson fire finally makes contact with the thick wall of ice and a loud explosion echos throughout the entire campus. Dense steam starts to fill the air as the huge fire ball begins, to Danny\u2019s amazement, begins to  break through the large wall of ice with relative ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow the hell did the ice wall not work?\u201d Danny asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRegular ice will not be able to stop that kind of fire.\u201d Abigail said walking besides Danny with her golden sword in hand. Danny soon realized that Abigail wasn\u2019t trying to push him way this time, Danny realized that Abigail came to the conclusion that she was going to need all the help she could get if she was going to take care of this monster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat kind of fire is that?\u201d Danny asks as he looked at the monster before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s called hell fire, one of the most dangerous fires in the world.\u201d Mathew says as he stand in the other side of Danny with two small daggers in his hands. Danny had a bad feeling ever time he looked at the daggers that rested in Mathews hand. Both daggers had a skull \ud83d\udc80 design and each  radiated A ghostly light that seemed to suck away Danny\u2019s will to fight when ever he looked at them. Danny didn\u2019t know much about weapons but something was just telling him that thought daggers where just dangerous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHell what now?\u201d \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83e\udd7a\ud83d\ude23\ud83d\ude31 </span></div></div>",

Danny tried to stand on his feet but soon his body was hit with a sudden dizziness that caused him to begin to fall over slowly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCareful. You used a lot of energy fighting that corruption.\u201d A teenage girl says as she puts her hand around Danny to stop him from falling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny looks up, staring at the girl who had caught him. The girl had long brown hair, and striking blue eyes, she wore a open black jacket \ud83e\udde5 with silver trimmings and sliver buttons. Underneath the girls jacket was a black tank top. On her right shoulder she wore a silver badge that almost looked like a police badge but was bigger and had writing on it, but it was a language that Danny didn\u2019t understand. The girl also wore short shorts and military boots \ud83d\udc62. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d Danny asks fighting through the pain he felt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry we\u2019re friends.\u201d A man says walking towards both Danny and the mystery girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny saw that whoever this man was he was wearing the same black silver jacket as the girl, he also had long black pants and he also wore black military boots. The man had short orange hair and his eyes were a deeper blue than the girls. Looking closer Danny could see a scare that covered the mans left eye, a scare that looked like a thunder bolt. Danny looking down could see two small hammers that hung at his wast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took about five minutes for Danny to be able to stand on his own without falling over, his whole body still felt horrible but he could deal with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny stared at the two strangers, and as he stared at them , he couldn\u2019t help but think about that creature he fought a few hours ago. Danny looked around trying to find its corpse, but as he searched around, he couldn\u2019t find any trace of a dead crab \ud83e\udd80, the only thing that was evident was that their was a battle that had taken place. The ground was ripped apart, walls had been torn down and cars had been flipped over. Danny honestly couldn\u2019t believe that he and that monster had caused all of this damage <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou won\u2019t find a body any were.\u201d The man says with a small smile on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Danny asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou were looking for the dead body of that creature right?\u201d The man asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYea I was.\u201d Danny says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell the bodies of corruptions vanish when they are vanquished, their bodies are made from pure negative energy so, when they die they merge back into the environment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry corruptions? What\u2019s a corruption?\u201d Danny asks, as he stared at the man as if he had two heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook theirs a lot you need to learn, and right now is not the time to teach you.\u201d The girl says with a serous tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Danny looked at the girl he couldn\u2019t help but blush, Danny was never good at talking to girls. The prettier the girl the harder it was for Danny to talk to them, and seeing as how beautiful this girl was, Danny could barely get a word out, even though she gave off a kind of deadly aura that made Dannie\u2019s skin tingle. The girl didn\u2019t carry a weapon like the guy, but Danny could still tell that she was just a dangerous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou need to come with us.\u201d The girl says breaking Danny out of his train of thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome with you to were?\u201d Danny asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo headquarters, you need training, you\u2019ll get that training at the school.\u201d The man says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait a minute I don\u2019t even know who you guys are, I got to get home.\u201d Danny says putting both his hands up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook Danny right?\u201d The guy says stepping forward, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny wasn\u2019t sure how he knew his name but it didn\u2019t make him feel any better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are not safe, home is not safe ok?\u201d The man says putting his right hand on Danny\u2019s shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo not ok I\u2019m leaving.\u201d Danny says with a demanding tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait you can\u2019t just leave.\u201d The girl says stepping forward trying to block Danny\u2019s way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c[Teleport].\u201d Danny says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny thinks about his room and in a bright flash, Danny vanishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWere did he go?\u201d The man says looking around confused and shocked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know but I have a good place to start looking. </span></div></div>",

Danny had teleported to his room, which was pitch black since Danny hadn\u2019t been in his room all day and the lights where turned off. Danny could hardly breath, once again he put himself in a dangerous situation by over using his powers, he knew deep down that he should have never teleported into his room but Danny just needed to leave that area, he just needed to leave those two strangers that gave him the creeps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny slowly opens his bed room door, he could hear his parents talking downstairs, probably about him. Danny knew that he was in big trouble he had broken his curfew, so Danny knew that their would be hell to pay. Danny turns on his bedroom light and sits down on his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDanny Davis get down here young man!\u201d Danny\u2019s mom yells from down stares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh brother.\u201d Danny says breathing hard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(A minute later) <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou coming home this late, unacceptable young man.\u201d Danny\u2019s mom yells as Danny sits down on the living room white couch \ud83d\udecb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYea kiddo you know you have a curfew, you worried me and your mother Half to death.\u201d Danny\u2019s father says standing right beside Danny\u2019s mom, both staring down at their son. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, I know, I just lost track of time.\u2019 Danny says look down at the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny couldn\u2019t tell his parents about what really happened early today, how could he? Danny knew that his parents would never believe him, and would probably sign him up in a mental institution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDanny honey you look pale, are you ok?\u201d Danny\u2019s mom says with a worried look on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god George, our little boy was out taking drugs, I knew it, I just knew it.\u201d Danny\u2019s mom says looking at her husband with small tears in her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHannah, Hannah lets not jump to conclusions, Danny would never do such a thing....... would you Danny?\u201d Danny\u2019s dad says as he looks at Danny hoping for a good answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo... No of course not. I would never do such a thing.\u201d Danny says standing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou see honey our boy would never.....\u201d Danny\u2019s father stops mid sentence as his face grows shocked and concerned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny soon realizes that his father was no longer looking at him but something else, something behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny turns around and stares out of the glass window that rested behind the living room couch. What Danny saw turned his pale face even paler. Something looking like a large fire ball was headed right towards the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no [Forcefield]!\u201d Danny yells as blue energy raps around his whole entire body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBOOM!!!!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole house is engulfed in flames, as wood and glass fly across the whole neighborhood. Danny slowly opens his eyes and sees his house burning, with him standing in the middle of everything covered in a body lengthened forcefield. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom! Dad!!!!\u201d Danny yells looking around his fired infected house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take long for Danny\u2019s to spot his parents, which were both trapped under fallen rubble. Danny could hardly move as he made his way over to his parents. Danny instinctively knew that he could not use another power, if he did he would die. But not even the threat of death would stop him from saving his parents. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny fought through the pain as he pulled both of his parents away from the burning rubble, but as he pulled, something had caught his eye, something that shocked Danny enough to stop pulling his parents out of harms way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked like something was moving in the fire, something big, something covered in flames \ud83d\udd25. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is that?\u201d Danny\u2019s says as he looked at a humanoid monster on fire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monster was 8ft tall and looked like it was made out of molten rock, Danny could not make out its eyes but he knew that it was staring at him. The monster slowly began to walk towards Danny, and it didn\u2019t look like it wanted a hug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny turned to look at his parents, he couldn\u2019t fight that monster, not now, his body was too weak and his parents were still in danger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet down!\u201d Danny hears a voice yell, a voice that sounded familiar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBOOM!!!\u201d Lightning \ud83c\udf29 smashes into the molten monster at high speed causing another explosion that  threw Danny off his feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny was in pain his body was covered in cuts and once again his vision became blurry, but he couldn't pass out not know. Danny looks up to see a man and a women standing in front of him. Danny soon realized that these people where the same people he met early today. The man with orange Hair and the beautiful women with long brown hair, both still wearing a black and silver jacket. Danny soon realized that something was a little different about the two strangers. The man was covered in some kind of lightning aura, as he held both of his hammers in both hands, the girl was holding a golden sword \ud83d\udde1, which confused Danny, who swore that he didn\u2019t see her holding a sword before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny didn\u2019t know who these guys where, heck he didn\u2019t even know their names but deep down he was happy they where here to save him. Danny started to smile but as he turned to look at his parents his smile faded away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom, dad.\u201d Danny calls as he sees both of his parents not moving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny trying to move suddenly feels a sharp pain that runs throughout his whole entire body. His body was losing strength fast. That last thing Danny saw before he lost  consciousness was both of his parents lying on the ground covered in cuts and serious burns. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease... be .. ok.\u201d Danny utters out as he passes out <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny slowly opens his eyes, as he lay in bed \ud83d\udecc. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere am I?\u201d Danny slowly says sitting up slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa, whoa easy cowboy \ud83e\udd20 easy.\u201d A women with long blond hair says as she sits down at the edge of The bed with a smile on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere am I?\u201d Danny asks looking around his surroundings, noticing that he wasn\u2019t in his room anymore. Danny was in a room filled with beds and curtains, it almost looked like a hospital room <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny soon remembers the flaming monster that had caught his house on fire, he also remembers his parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere\u2019s my mom and my dad?\u201d Danny asks grabbing both of the blond women\u2019s shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere are they!!\u201d Danny yells again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease calm down Mr. Davis, you suffered serious injuries, you need rest.\u201d The women says trying to calm Danny down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo I need to know where my parents are, you have to tell me.\u201d Danny says tears starting to fall from his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLacy. I\u2019ll handle this.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny and the girl named Lacy turn to see the same orange haired man that danny had met earlier. The man did not wear a smile, he wore a look of despair as he looked at Danny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well but he needs rest, so please make it quick.\u201d The blond haired women says as she stands up and leaves the room. Danny for a moment saw her look at him with a sorrowful look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny looks at the orange haired man with a look of fear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere are my parents?\u201d Danny asks once again, his voice shaking from the fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour parents are dead.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Danny had not moved from the hospital bed, he did not have the strength nor the will to face the world. Danny did not sleep, he hardly ate, it all but seemed as if Danny was slowly waiting for death. The girl named lacy would check in on Danny everyday to make sure he was ok, but Danny hardly ever spoke to her, What was their to say? Danny didn\u2019t see the orange haired warrior that had saved his life the day his parents died, Danny believed that was for the best. Danny would never admit it but he felt small bits of anger whenever he thought about that man and that girl, after all they didn\u2019t save his parents. Everyday Danny would stare down at his white bed sheets as if he Where expecting them to get up and dance but alas they never did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door to the hospital room slowly opens as the orange haired man walks in. Danny slowly and lifelessly looks over at the man who had saved his life to see that he wasn\u2019t wearing the same uniform he was wearing before. The man wore a light blue shirt as well as black jean shorts, with black flip flops. Danny said nothing as he stared at the man, but his anger started to slowly rise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook who\u2019s up.\u201d The man says with a smile as he walks towards Danny\u2019s bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought I should check on ya.\u201d The man says getting a small stool and sitting down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, how would you feel if your parents had died?\u201d Danny says sarcastically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room goes quite as both Danny and the man stop talking. The mans smile disappeared and he refused to make eye contact with Danny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYea kid, I wanted to say that I was sorry for what happened to your......\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c[Peak Human Strength].\u201d Danny says cutting off the man from his sentence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBOOM!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of a loud explosion echos throughout the whole hospital as the entire floor is filled with dust and small ruble. People fall to the floor in surprise as a shadowy figure stands inside the dust cloud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dust soon fades, and Danny is standing tall as he tightly grips the orange haired mans neck, the wall behind him completely destroyed. Tears are falling down both his cheeks as he stares at the orange haired mans face with eyes filled with rage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou, you should have never mentioned my parents!\u201d Danny yells as his grip grows tighter around the mans neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI, I\u2019m s, sorry.\u201d The man struggles to say as he coughs, struggling to breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy parents are dead, why didn\u2019t you save them!?\u201d Danny yells once again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW, we tried.\u201d The man says once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy!!!\u201d <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cLet him go!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny turns around upon hearing a familiar feminine voice. Standing tall with the same dagger like eyes was the brunette girl that Danny had met before. The girl stared at Danny with anger in her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said let... him... go\u201d The girl says threateningly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s the reason my parents are dead!\u201d Danny yells looking back at the man who\u2019s neck he was still clutching. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d The girl says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny looks at the girl with utter shock and surprise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo?\u201d Danny asked not being able to believe what he had heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.... you are the reason your parents are dead.\u201d The girl said walking towards Danny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Danny asked with anger in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour parents are dead... and you are the one who killed them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny lets go of the mans neck who plummets to the ground holding his throat coughing. Danny slowly walks towards the girl ready to fight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe told you that you were in danger, and yet you ignored our warnings and went off without help or proper training.\u201d The girl continues to speak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny soon stands in front of the girl, both hands clenched into fist \ud83e\udd1c. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour the reason your parents are dead and you know it.\u201d The girl says with utmost certainty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny does nothing but looks into the eyes that scared him a few day ago. Danny doesn\u2019t speak, he doesn\u2019t lash out in anger he only stares into the girls eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour.... your right?\u201d Danny says putting his head down, not being able to look the girl in the eyes anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the anger started to fade away as Danny\u2019s body was overcome with pure sadness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI, I just miss them so much.\u201d Danny cry\u2019s still staring at the ground, tears falling on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl walks forward and puts her arms around Danny, as he cried. Everyone in the building did nothing but stare at the girl and Danny as they embraced, to shocked to do anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orange haired man stands up, after having caught his breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell glad that\u2019s over.\u201d <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
