Yet still, lazy as ever, the teen stumbled into the kitchen and guzzled down the remains of a carton of orange juice. His dad was out, so he waltzed into the living room. When he stepped on the cold, hard, floor, he felt something crunch beneath his bare foot.Thinking nothing of it, he lifted his other foot and stepped forward. Crunch again. Looking at his sole, he saw a small red thing crushed. Thinking nothing of that either, he went to sit down. Crunch yet again. And standing up, the crushed red object was visible on the left side of his tight white boxers. Looking around, he saw an almost miniscule ship. Picking it up, he saw two tiny people inside. The label on the ship said 'swallow me'. George thought it was all a dream but placed it on his tongue and swallowed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did he know the tiny ship and the people inside carried thousands of bacteria sized versions of those pills, which George was supposed to swallow. They were there in case he had enough sense (shockingly he did) to not eat them from the floor. They dumped the ships contents in his stomach, and a tingle ran through his body. He didn't notice the ship fly from his nose, fly out the window and vanish. Such a surreal experience, but all he could think was that the ceiling was moving closer...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYep, it sure was! At a rapid pace too, soon enough he was barely fitting into the room. Grinning at his new found height, George laughed as he smashed through the roof. When the growth stopped, George was 250ft tall, and sitting on the rubble of his house... Taking advantage of his new found height, George stood up and lifted his foot. He moved it, trying to find a crushing target. He found it, a house near his. BOOM! The teen's foot came down, crushing the structure to rubble. And as the people ran out, George grabbed them up and gulped them down his throat. No-one was going to escape this horny, hungry, giant teen...</span></div></div>",

He was pretty lazy and usually lay in bed for a good few hours until his dad eventually made him haul his ass out of bed. But today he oddly didn't feel like doing this, so he got up and went downstairs. Walking into the kitchen, he yawned. Then a small package on the table caught his eyes. It was labelled as to him, his dad must've already been up, saw it and left it out for him.He ripped off the paper and saw it was some sort of toy gun. ''Is this some kind of joke?'' George said, confused. He looked at it from different angles, and then pressed the trigger. At first nothing happen so he set it down and the table and sighed. But then a green light enveloped him, and he passed out....<br>\r\n\tGeorge had no idea how much time had actually passed, but when he awoke he felt extremely weird. Coming to, he stood up and looked around. Everything looked bigger... And not just bigger, everything was GIGANTIC. A nearby crumb was only slightly smaller than George! ''Is this someone's idea of a sick joke? Because I really don't find it funny...'' he moaned. As well as being pissed off, he was totally and utterly confused. Weren't shrink rays kind of scientificaly impossible last time he checked? Yep. So who the hell actually managed to crack that and make one, let alone send it him....? It made absolutely no sense, but right now George knew he had to get off the floor. His dad was a stomp now, ask questions later kind of guy, so if he spotted a speck on the floor, George would be under his foot in less than a second. ''I gotta get up on the table or something...'' he said. But suddenly, a huge earthquake shook his world - it was too late...<br>\r\n\t''Oh. Shit.'' George gulped. He quickly darted around to find a hiding place, but his dad kept the place so damn tidy, only small crumbs (which he probably just couldn't even see!) were around. The quakes that seemingly came from miles away got louder, more intense, until two huge feet stomped into the kitchen. Those two huge feet were so hugely colossal, that George couldn't even see above the muscular thighs of the boxer clad giant. But that was enough of the body for George to see exactly who it was...</span></div></div>",

He couldn't quite see what Tom was up to, but he was moving around a bit and opening cupboards and the refrigerator, so he must be making some food. George ran off to the side, trying to hide by the base of the cupboards to avoid Tom's feet which stomping around. He was stopped in his tracks by something which landed down in front of him.

Then his foot lifted and cast a shadow over George. He ran, but his tiny size meant that he could barely move. The shadowy area was far too big. The foot came down... BOOM!  But wait...

Before his life could even flash before his eyes in an awful cliche way, Matt smashed down with his foot. Rubbing back and forth, he did his best to eradicate the 'bug' from existence. But mere seconds later, it lifted, and left a perfectly live (albeit hurt) George in the spot it stomped on. ''I... I survived...'' George gasped, marvelling at the miracle. His gigantic dad stomped away, leaving him to contemplate what on earth to do. Right now, George really wanted food more than anything. This wasn't unusual for George at all, even when he was small enough to be stepped on in a house of 3 giant males, he had to put food first. He knew that there was cereal up on the kitchen worktop, so he set his sights on that...</span></div></div>",

Without even thinking, George climbed in... ''Yes! Cheerios!'' he whooped. Temporarily forgetting he was smaller than an ant, a feeling of glee took over and he began nibbling at a giant cheerio.

At 18, Tom was 3 years older than George, and they didn't really get on. Tom, much like his siblings and father, was tall (6ft 4) and handsome. His huge brown eyes surveyed his breakfast, but likcing his lips he was unaware his tiny brother was inside his bowl of cereal, and took it into the living room. Meanwhile down in the bowl, George spluttered and coughed, struggling to stay afloat among the sea of milk. Taking gallons of milk and tonnes of cereal in a spoonful, Tom shoved it into his cavernous mouth, and chewed it all effortlessly into a pulp. Swallowing, he pushed it all down his throat. Watching the lump travel down into his seemingly bottomless pit of a stomach, George gulped as he realised his fate. The next spoonful was one that brought that fate around. Despite desperate attempts to swim away, George was scooped up among an ocean of white and huge islands of light brown. Panicking, it seemed as if George's world moved in slow motion as the terrifying gigantic beast lifted the spoon closer to his mouth. The huge mouth slowly opened, and a serpent like tongue licked clean any debris that may be lingering on the lips. As the spoon drew closer to the deathtrap, George what would be his tomb. A huge pink bed anticipated the next offering, below a dangling dripping uvula. Huge white fortresses made sure escape was impossible, and at the back what a black hole, signifying the utter horror and darkness that lay beneath. ''Tom! Don't eat me please, I'm not food!' George screamed, ''It's me, George, please look on your spoon!'' Literally centimeters away from death, George had a brief flicker of hope as he witnessed a sceptical look at the billboard sized face above...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Tom shrugged and proceeded to consume his breakfast again, except now time seemed to move so much faster. George was shoved into the cavern he feared so much with massive force, and he landed on the soft pink bed of Tom's tongue. Clinging onto the bumpy wet flesh for dear life, George panicked like hell as all around him as tonnes of pieces of cereal several times bigger than he was were crushed into one big mushy pulp. Daring to look back, George saw the dangling uvula glistening with saliva, dripping in anticipation for the next load being swallowed. George desperately looked for a way out, and thankfully managed to avoid the chomping teeth but he realised Tom had finshed chewing. His tongue flicked back, and the mush was pushed down his throat, and George followed. In one last act of desperation, George did a feeble jump to try and catch the uvula and buy some time in the dark, wet cavern to escape, but Tom's powerful tongue was in control, and George slid down the pink fleshy throat without a second to even cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge couldn't even begin to process what was happening. He had been eaten by his own brother, like just another piece of cereal, except he was too small for Tom to even feel. Tears blinded George as he fell upon the mush of chewed cereal and he could only wait to die...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Tom burped impolitely and shovelled more cereal into his all consuming cavernous mouth.

Even though he wasn't the sharpest tool in the box, he knew that there was only one reason why anything would be falling through the air from a cereal box, and there was usually one destination... Sure enough, George hit a cold white surface with a painful bump, and was surrounded by huge brown rings - Cheerios. George gulped. Nobody in this housed wasted a single crumb, and now George was essentially food, the only way out of this bowl was going to be a trip inside his dad or brother, and neither of those options were all that appealing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs per breakfast procedure, the bowl was also filled with cold milk. George had to dive under and resurface in the middle of a Cheerio, so he keep hold on and keep himself afloat. Daring to crane his neck up, George felt sick as he saw the giant that would be devouring him. A toned, lightly haired torso, slight belly, white boxers housing a sizable bulge... This was his dad. Narrowly avoiding being squashed under size 15s was bad enough, but George was sure he wouldn't survive being breakfast. Grabbing a spoon, Matt picked up the bowl and took it to the kitchen table, ready to fill his rumbling stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt sat down, and looking up George could just about see the familiar and friendly stubble covered face. \"Dad! Dad! Down here in your bowl! Don't eat me!\" George cried frantically. Of course he was too small for these futile squeaks to even get halfway towards Matt's ears. Besides, the giant was too hungry to focus on anything but his spoon. The silver instrument dove into the bowl, scooping up tonnes of cereal and gallons of milk, but missing the extra protein. George could hear the sickeningly loud crunches seemingly miles above him as Matt chewed his food into paste and swallowed it effortlessly. As the spoon descended again, George shuddered to think that he could be next...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spoon went under the icy sea of milk again and then suddenly George felt like there was an upheaval of his whole world. Adrenaline ran through his body like he was on the world's best rollercoaster, and then his body went cold. The realisation hit him he was on his way to his father's stomach, and there was nothing he could do. The terror that ran through his body paralysed George, and he felt utterly helpless as Matt lifted the spoon closer to his mouth. All could he could do was watch his father's torso pass by as the spoon was lifted closer to the death trap, seemingly in slow motion, in reverse to the way George would be going down. Finally, the spoon was level with the giant's huge face; a handsome carving on a mountainside. The gargantuan set of lips parted, revealing the dark cave of Matt's mouth. A huge pink tongue wriggled with anticipation to taste the next spoonful, and Matt's uvula dangled at the back of the dark cave, signalling doom. George, a 6ft 1 laddish teenager, was reduced to tears as he stared death in the face. Was this his end?</span></div></div>",

The hot air being expelled from Matt's mouth became more and more intense as the spoon was shoved into the cave forcefully. The cereal, milk and George were dumped on the soft pink tongue inside, and the spoon withdrew to fulfil its purpose and gather more food. Matt's lips came together again, and George was sealed in the wet cave with no light. Without warning, the tongue shifted and George was thrown. Perhaps fortunately, perhaps unfortunately, George was thrown to the back of the tongue, away from the teeth. Unable to see anything, George was relying on sound to know what was going on, and deafening crunches signalled the beginning of chewing. His ordeal would have been over by now if he'd been thrown with the cereal, as such huge teeth would have surely ended his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving finished chewing his spoonful of food, Matt's tongue shifted yet again, pushing the cereal mush, and George, to the back of his mouth. With no awareness his son was in his mouth, Matt swallowed and the huge pink muscle forcefully pushed the contents down his throat. Thrown into a futile frantic desperation to survive, George clawed at the throat to irritate it enough to cough, but he was too tiny to even make an impression. Sliding down his dad's throat, George gave up and continued to sob as his fate was sealed. He landed with a plop into a pit of burning stomach acid, and his body instantly began to tingle. It would be slow, it would be painful, but this was his fate, no matter how hard he banged against the walls of his father's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt finished his meal silently and, once done, proceeded to go about his day with optimum energy. \"Let's get that lazy son of mine out of bed, the cereal was untouched so he must still be in bed!\" Matt laughed. But his son had mysteriously vanished, and no amount of search parties, investigation or missing posters could find even a trace of him. After all, there was no way to send a search party inside Matt, and not a single person paid attention to the toy gun on the kitchen table...</span></div></div>",

Jamie had slept over last night, and as practically a member of the family had taken himself to the kitchen to make himself some breakfast. Dressed in only his pants, George couldn't help being drawn to Jamie's perfect ass, even as a straight teenage boy. Jamie was a big lad, at least 6ft 5, hairy and fairly rude and unfriendly. Him and George had never gotten on, making it all the more horrifying for him to be at Jamie's mercy. Another notable thing about Jamie was his hatred bugs.

As he walked closer to the kitchen counter for cereal, his huge bare feet slapped against the floor, each step quaking the entire room. He was a terrifyingly large boy at the best of times, but being the size of an ant magnified an 18 year old human into a merciless, mountainous monster. The sound of his feet on the cold kitchen floor made George shudder to think of what the impact would do to any ants or bug unfortunate enough to stand in his path. Any ant or bug who dared to face Jamie was crushed without mercy, whether he was aware of the cold action or not, and George was to be no exception. The tiny boy darted to reach perceived safety in the shadow the cereal box, but his sudden movement caught the giant's eye. Locking his deep brown eyes onto the minuscule figure, Jamie whispered \"Not on my watch little bug...\"</span></div></div>",

But there Charlie was, and although only 5' 7\", he was like a giant to George. Charlie called out George's name and George remembered his dad mentioning Charlie coming over for the weekend, due to his parents being out of town. \"I guess he's still asleep\", Charlie uttered to himself when George didn't respond, unaware of George being right at his feet. \"Oh well,\" the 14-year old said as he made himself at home. George quickly scurried up a leg of the kitchen table as Charlie made his way over to the pantry. Once they arrived at their destinations, George watched Charlie pull out a piece of wheat bread. Charlie popped it into the toaster, waited four minutes, and then grabbed the fresh toast. He set it on a plate. Charlie preferred to dip his toast in jelly instead of spreading the topping, so he put some strawberry jelly on the side of his plate. Then he brought it with him back to the table. \"Man, I'm so hungry,\" Charlie said to himself as he set his plate down. George was right in the path of the giant dish, barely avoiding getting crushed. \"I gotta get Charlie's attention,\" he thought, \"He almost smashed me!\" George knew that when Charlie ate, he focused on his food intensely. So George had to get on his plate is he wanted any chance of catching his friend's eye. He climbed onto the dish, but before he could get his bearings, he slipped into Charlie's jelly. George was stuck. \"Shit,\" he whispered as Charlie scooped a some jelly up with his toast. George then noticed he was starting to get to a higher altitude. He had his hands and feet planted on the toast, heading right towards his best friend's gaping mouth.</span></div></div>",

His best friend's mouth usually formed a warm and inviting smile, but Charlie's mouth was the exact opposite of that now. Charlie put the toast, George and all, into his mouth. George fell off the toast and landed on the 9th-grader's pink tongue. Charlie had a bad habit of chewing with his mouth open, so light slipped in and let George see his best friend's mouth in full detail. Charlie's long uvula hung over his gaping throat. It reached his soft palate, creating two arches that ominously welcomed George to the teenager's digestive tract. George noticed blue and red veins and arteries criss-crossing the roof of Charlie's mouth and the uneven texture at the back of his throat. Charlie's large white teeth chewed his breakfast, then he swallowed it down, along with George. George screamed and cried in terror as he headed down his best friend's throat. He tried climbing back up, but Charlie's esophagus was too strong. \"I've known Charlie my whole life, how could he do this to me?\" George questioned on his decent down, even though Charlie had no idea he had just swallowed George.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie's sphincter opened, dropping George into his stomach. He couldn't see, but he could smell the repulsive vomit stench. George felt Charlie's slimy, rippling stomach walls. Toast bits continued to fall into the pit, triggering stomach acid and enzymes to start digesting. George's skin stared tingling. As digestion went on, George started screaming in pain as his friend's stomach was breaking him down. He couldn't believe his skin was dissolving off of his bones. George's last moments were spent in agony. Soon, George was completely dissolved by the stomach of his own best friend. Nothing survived, not even his clothes. Charlie burped as George's liquidized remains drained into his intestines, where they were digested completely. Fortunately, Charlie wouldn't have to deal with the guilt that George had met his demise in his digestive tract, as he remained blissfully unaware of the violent death.</span></div></div>",
