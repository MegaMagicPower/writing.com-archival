            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Night had fallen over the commercial district of Gale City, but that only meant that the sun light had been replaced by the dull glare of neon. Gale City never slept. If people weren't working, they were playing - or, of course, getting robbed. Or tricked. Burgled. Barely a night went by without someone losing a year's wages to either one of the multitudinous crime syndicates or, more likely, getting it extorted out of them by an officer of the law. Though, what law exactly it was they enforced changed depending on the officer. It was a long accepted fact, that the police of Gale City only served two entities: The higher ups of InnoLutions and the various criminal organizations of the metropolis' seedy underbelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut tonight would be different. More exciting. No one payed attention to the shady van parked in an equally shady ally. A man, cigarette in his mouth, and clad in a gaudy denim vest, observed the opposing building. A big, red sign gave it the name \"Harley's.\" A motor shop. From the outside, nothing special. But to those in the know, \"Harley's\" had a reputation of being particularly annoying. The owner steadfastly refused to pay his protection money, one of the very few that still had the guts to resist the police, as well as the <b>Tigers</b>, whose turf he had built his shop on.<br>\r\nTonight, that would all change. The man smiled and flicked the glowing stub of his cigarette away and turned, nodding to the others hiding in the van. With big smiles, they poured out, clutching guns and baseball bats. Each and everyone of them was ready to rock. But they were only the backup. Eagerly, the man looked at his newest accomplice, only recruited that day. A young woman, dressed in a sharp business suit, stared back at him without a care in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your entrance, Firefly,\" he chuckled. The woman simply nodded, rolling back her right sleeve as she stepped out of the alley. A moment later, bright fire engulfed her palm, burning brighter with each second, until a towering pillar of flame emerged from her. It happened so fast that the civilians around only noticed the inferno as it already flew through the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe screams were drowned out in the explosion of the motor shop as Firefly's flame powers devastated it in mere seconds. The sheer heat of her flame melted the steel and glass, setting the oil on fire. A second explosion rang out as a gas tank ruptured, spreading the fire to the neighboring building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Going a bit overboard, don't you think?\" the man grunted. He needed to shield himself from the wave of heat that radiated out from the burning motor shop. Firefly merely shrugged, rolling her sleeve back down and turning. Her job was done. Now it was time to collect payment. The rest of the gang followed her as she stepped back towards the van, ready to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Boom!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe earth rumbled as if a bomb had just hit. Firefly only barely kept her footing, the rest of the gang being felled by the sudden earthquake. Was it another explosion? No... this shaking felt different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><b>Boom!</b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother quake followed only a second later, no bringing even the professional gangster to her knees. She looked around, ready to blow whatever the source of these tremors was up. But she saw nothing out of the ordinary. Until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size45\" style=\"\"><b>Boom! Boom! Boom!</b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shadow fell over the entire street as the one responsible for shaking the earth finally revealed herself. Firefly's jaw fell open, staring up at disbelief. With terrifying speed, a gigantic figure sprinted through the street, each footfall devastating the pavement and sending out shock waves strong enough to blast a person away. The closer the figure came, the more detail could be made out.<br>\r\nIt was definitely a woman. Long, brown hair flowed down her back. Her entire figure was clad in bright, yellow spandex, a massive, black '<b>M</b>' proudly emblazoned on her chest. Speaking of which... Firefly couldn't help but blush as she saw just how shapely this gigantic woman was. Her hips were wide, as were her thighs, and her breasts would have been gigantic even at normal size. With every step, they bounced upwards, threatening to tear the form fitting material of her suit to shreds. Still, by some miracle it held, emphasizing every curve of the giantess' enormous body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she was there, at the scene. Her massive boots crushed up the ground beneath, but she didn't care. Instead, she struck a pose, one hand on her hip, the other pointing decisively in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Fear not, citizens! Megagirl is here to save you!\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe power of her voice shook the bones of everyone around, stunning most of Firefly's gang. Only the man in the denim vest managed to shake of the painful ringing in his ears. He slowly got up and reached out to her.<br>\r\n\"Come on! We need to get out of here, before that giant bitch notices us!\"<br>\r\nWithout hesitation, she grabbed his hand. They didn't bother to help the rest of the gang up, simply getting into the van and driving off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the corner of her eye, Megagirl saw the group of thugs still stunned by her declaration, as well as the escape vehicle. She had to make a choice. In front of her was the burning building, a danger to everyone around. But she couldn't just let the one who did this get away. Someone with this much power couldn't be left unchecked, after all...</span></div></div>",

She needed to be careful. Even if she might be powerful enough, her plan ran the danger of only fanning the flames on even more. She had only one chance to blow out the flames, otherwise she might make the situation only worse.<br>\r\nThe orange glare of the fire made her sweat, yet Megagirl managed to collect herself. Then, she inhaled. And inhaled. And inhaled...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCountless tons of air were sucked into her lungs. The tiny people around needed to hold onto anything they could find to avoid flying up the giant heroine's mouth. Even the flames tilted towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with a bellow, Megagirl blasted the air out again, hitting the burning shop directly! The massive wave of oxygen rolled over it, completely blowing the fire away. Instantly, the light, as well as the heat, vanished.<br>\r\nFor a moment, everything was silent as the catastrophe was solved within a second. The tiny people around fell to the ground again as the incredible force of her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, Megagirl couldn't help but be proud of her work. Her debut was going well, already! Only a minute on the scene and she had already solved the most pressing issue.<br>\r\nBut of course, she wasn't done yet. She still had to apprehend the actual criminals. But again, she had to make a choice - the people around were still in danger. She couldn't fight here if it came to that. Maybe she should bring them to safety first.</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Gale City - the shining jewel of the world!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the start, it was just one office building. A new tech company - \"InnoLutions\" - build their headquarters in the middle of nowhere. The reason was simple: without being under the authority of a governemnt, taxes became a non-issue. Soon, they used their advantage to advance into evermore arcane projects. New modes of transportation, medicine, software, space travel - nothing was to ambitious. As their wealth increased, they bought up the competition, slowly encopassing more and more of the worlds market. Now, \"InnoLutions\" is the biggest company on the globe, owning big chunks of the tech- and entertainment industry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally, such an entity attracted people seeking for jobs at the cutting edge of science. After their success, \"InnoLutions\" build a small settlement outside their headquarters - which had been built up into a enormous skyscraper - to accomodate their workers. The bigger they grew, the more houses they built, the more people came.<br>\r\nSoon, people other than the workers followed. Most people working for \"InnoLutions\" were well off, if not outright rich! Other companies opened their stores in the settlement, hoping to make a profit. Small business owners tried their luck. And of course, the workers needed entertainment - bars and casinos shot out of the earth. Small Industries popped up, catering to the exact needs of the wealthy inhabitants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn only a few years, the place could no longer be called a mere settlement. It sprawled out, growing uncontrollably into a gargantuan metropolis. Even if people couldn't work for the tech giant, there were now more than enough ways to make a living. The sprawl was bigger than some nations. In the face of this unprecedented growth, \"InnoLutions\" founder, Antonia Gale, declared the settlement to be a sovereign and free city - and swiftly slapped on her name. Thus, Gale City was born. And with time, it only became more prosperous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there is a dark side to everything, and Gale City is no exception. \"InnoLutions\" wealth and influence makes it impossible for the governments of the world to intervene or regulate the business. Instead, the company created their own law and security firms, to keep some semblance of order. Soon, these insitutions became corrupt, though the managers didn't care. As long as it made money, everything was acceptable. Nowadays it's rare to not get into confrontation with a police officer trying to get a bonus out of innocent people. The various crime syndicates don't make it easier - and sometimes seem more chummy with the law enforcers than with each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crime rate is constantly rising as more and more wealth is horded by the managers of \"InnoLutions\", and once profitable jobs become obsolete. Layoffs are constant. But people rarely leave the city, they just look for other opportunities. And the streets become increasingly unsafe. Today, 40 years after it's founding, the city has decayed into a corrupt mess. The police aren't even pretending to uphold laws anymore, and the courts only exist to protect \"InnoLutions\" wealth. Rumors are going around - apparently the tech department is working on something big. The managers aren't content with 'just' the city. For them, it's time to expand even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there is always someone. Someone who wants to change things, and make Gale City keep the promise it once gave to people - a prospering city, where opportunity lies just around the corner. But for that to happen, it will take force. The ones in control aren't going to relinquish their power - someone needs to make them give it away.<br>\r\nThe people have had enough. In the hub of technology, they will find a way to fight back - even if it takes a power far beyond humanity to do so. Whispers tell of masked figures walking the streets, of scientists developing ways for the average person to strike back. Heroes rise; vigilantes uphold the laws that the city forgot about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd one in particular will change the face of Gale City forever. For the better? For the worse? One can only hope, as the most powerful hero rises and takes up their mask...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is their story - a single person will tackle the crime, the corruption, and Gale City itself. <br>\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Rules:</b><br>\r\n1.
