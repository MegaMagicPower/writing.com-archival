His small spaceship was being pulled in by the powerful gravity of the planet, which was circling around the bright twin suns along with the double moons. The sight from the cockpit was spectacular; however, Ron didn\u2019t have time to enjoy the view. He was becoming increasingly concerned about the inevitable: Crashing on the strange, unknown planet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVoyager 39 to Earth! Voyager 39 to Earth! Losing altitude fast! Traveling at 1100 miles per hour, descending on a small, unknown planet\u2026 It appears to have an atmosphere\u2026 All readings indicate that the planet will sustain human life form\u2026 Presence of water and oxygen have been detected\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ship broke through the outer atmosphere and plunged towards the surface in a raging fireball. Ron saw that, in order to survive, he had to eject quickly, and hope he could land somewhere in a safe spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u201dVoyager 39! I\u2019m going to eject from the craft! Send rescue! Here are final coordinates! Mayday Mayday! Astronaut Ron McGee, Space Administration, ID number 465863. Final coordinates follow this message. Send for rescue! Mayday, Mayday. Altitude 7,000 feet\u2026 6,000 feet\u2026 5,000 feet\u2026 Passing over the ocean\u2026 Coming over what looks like farmland\u2026 swampland, maybe\u2026 3,000 feet\u2026 Location coordinates follow\u2026 Will eject from craft\u2026 Over and out!\u201d was Ron\u2019s last message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spacecraft raced towards the ground, when the canopy popped off and the seat ejected, showing the pilot sitting on it. As the spacecraft came down, it splashed into a small lake, which was surrounded by grass and bushes. In the meantime, Ron pulled a pin, which was just under his seat, and a parachute was released from the back of his suit. He unstrapped himself from the chair, and allowed his body to float to the ground, while the chair crashed into the lake below. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments, Ron landed in a bush. He managed to get himself untangled, but cutting his parachute loose. Then, he tumbled to the ground and lay on the grass, as he turned and saw his space ship, floating to the surface of the lake before him. He considered himself to be very, very lucky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon finally got up and looked around. It was hot and humid. The air was thick and there was a slight breeze. Clearly, there was plenty of water on the planet. There was vegetation. He could live there for awhile. Yes, he could survive. The question is: Where would he live? What would the people on the planet be like?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he started walking, his ankle hurt like crazy, and it caused him to fall down in the grass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhhh!\u201d he cried. He hurt his ankle in the fall, and he needed to let it rest. He looked down at his leg. No, he didn\u2019t think he had sprained it, but it did hurt. He just lay on the grass for a few minutes. He was completely exhausted. What was he going to do now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, suddenly, he looked up. There was a noise in the distance. He heard something, or someone approaching. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, no\u2026\u201d he grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was in no condition to run away right now. What if there was some creature, or some dangerous animal lurking behind a tree? He would be doomed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething moved in the distance! Ron got on his knees and crawled behind a bush to see what it was. He looked up and began to realize that something large was coming his way. This was not good!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was he going to do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ron lurked from behind the thick bushes as he lay on his stomach, trying to do his best not to be seen by the strange, large creature. So far, the creature was walking among the trees, just from the distance. It appeared to be moving towards the lake. This was not good, since that was where the space ship was!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, suddenly, the creature took off! It leaped into the sky like a bird! That was strange, for it didn\u2019t appear to have wings! How was that possible? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon looked up and saw the creature flying over towards the lake. He caught a glimpse of it. Was it a human being? It seemed to have arms and legs. It appeared to be a male figure. Ron had lost sight of it, and didn\u2019t see it for a moment. He had panicked for a moment. Where did it go?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Ron heard a \u201cTHUD\u201d sound behind him, followed by the voice of a young boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOooh, there you are!\u201d the boy said, in his own language.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon turned around and gasped out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhaaaaahh!\u201d he shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding before him was a boy, who appeared to be about nine feet tall. He had golden, tan skin, and black hair with bright, blue eyes and a friendly face. He wore no shirt and no shoes and no socks, but just a pair of shorts which covered his waist and part of his upper legs. Aside from the boy\u2019s remarkable height, the thing most striking about him, were his muscles!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant boy had large, firm pectorals which jutted out from his chest like armor. Thick, round biceps graced his upper arms and three rows of mighty abdominals covered his large torso, just beneath those large pectorals. Truly, the boy looked like a warrior!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSupporting his giant body were two thick, long legs, made up of thick layers of muscles on his thighs and large round calves which were almost as big as soccer balls. Ron took note that this boy wasn\u2019t to be messed around with!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon\u2019s mouth dropped wide open, as he craned his neck, in order to examine the towering boy, who loomed over him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, poor little guy\u2026 You must be hungry!\u201d the boy said, as he motioned with his hands for Ron to follow him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026 Who are you?\u201d Ron asked, as he slowly got back on his feet. He was absolutely amazed by the giant muscle boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome! There is my house!\u201d the boy said, as he pointed to a large structure, which was about half a mile away, on the other side of the lake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOooh\u2026\u201d Ron realized that this is where the boy wanted to take him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Org\u2026\u201d the boy said, as he pointed at his chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOrg?\u201d Ron replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOrg!\u201d the giant boy smiled, as he repeated his name as he pointed his finger at his chest for the second time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Ron\u2026 I came from Earth!\u201d Ron said as he pointed at his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAaaahhh\u2026 Earth!\u201d Org smiled, as he pointed at Ron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no, no!\u201d Ron shook his head. \u201cEarth is up there!\u201d he said as he pointed to the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was no use. Org didn\u2019t understand. He thought his name was earth, and Ron didn\u2019t want to confuse the boy even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, Earth, you poor little guy! You must be hungry and tired!\u201d Org said, as he started to walk towards the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Ron\u2019s ankle was still bothering him, and he couldn\u2019t walk very fast. On the other hand, Org hand long, strong legs, so he was walking much faster than Ron. When Org realized that Ron was having a hard time keeping pace with him, he stopped, turned around, and walked back to where Ron was walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPoor little baby\u2026 Let me carry you!\u201d Org said, as he reached down and easily picked up Ron with his mighty, muscular arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! I can walk on my own, you big lug!\u201d Ron protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me fly you home! That is much faster!\u201d Org said, as he looked down at Ron\u2019s face with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon was about to protest again, when he suddenly felt like he was floating in the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! What\u2026 What the heck?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he turned his head, he saw that Org was no longer walking\u2026 He was flying!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly cow! You can fly!\u201d Ron said to the giant boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant boy gently hovered over to his house, and touched down on the grass, right in front of the door to the house. Ron was absolutely amazed by Org\u2019s size, muscularity, and now his flying ability. This kid was amazing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrg set Ron on the floor and then he opened the door, allowing Ron to walk in first. As soon as they were inside, he closed the door behind him. Now, all Org had to do, was show Ron around, and wait till his father, Ank, got home. He couldn\u2019t wait to show his father his new little friend named Earth!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The astronaut stared nervously at the door, and tentatively seized the doorknob and tried to push it down... with no results, it was very hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh great!\" the man thought \"i'm stuck here with a kid who could crush me like nothing... well, at least he seems gentle....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing, Eath?\" Org's childish yet powerful voice interrupted Ron's thoughts, although he could not understand what his host was saying. \"You mustn't go out, I have to show you my house. You're going to like it!\" The boy smiled widely, taking Ron's hand and pulling him toward the kitchen, while the small man didn't dare to protest, not wanting to displease the powerful kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kitchen alone was larger than Ron't house on Earth, he mused, watching the massive wooden furniture, that made him feel the size of a toddler, and the humongous stove, carved in gray stone. \"What kind of mighty giant could've carved this stove and carried it here?\" Ron wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, Earth\" Org was saying, pointing to the stove. \"We aleays bake our bread here... you should taste it... Oh, by the way\" His face became concerned, \"Are you hungry, poor little guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad Ron understood the question, he would've replied affirmatively, but not knowing Org's language, he just stared at the giant blankly... but just then, they both heard childish voices approaching with loud stomps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrg's face immediately lit up. \"Wow, my friends! They came at the right moment!\" He looked at ROn with a wide smile. \"They'll like you, little Earth!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Org!\" \"Org!\" \"You home?\" the voices called from outside, and Org quickly shouted \"Yeah, come in, I have something to show you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, the door was pushed open and four boys ran in, scaring Ron, because they were huge, though none of them reached Org's size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrmri, a slender redhead, Gurt, a stocky blackhaired boy, Neem, a chubby kid with spiked brown hair and freckles, and Lim, a cute blondie, the youngest of the bunch at age 9, and the smallest at the height of 6' 10'', were Org's best friends, and they all admired him for his strength and kindness, looking at him as a role model.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow they were about to greet Org merrily, when they noticed Ron and they stopped, puzzled, looking at the Earthling curiosly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeem was the first one who spoke:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What could he do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwww\u2026 He looks so cute!\u201d Neem said, as he stepped closer and extended his arms. Before Ron could run away, Neem had lifted Ron below his armpits and was holding him a few inches above the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon was absolutely terrified. In fact, he was in so much shock; he didn\u2019t dare say anything at first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! I want to hold him, too!\u201d Lim said out loud. Neem gently passed Ron to Lim, who grabbed hold of Ron by his arms like he was holding a doll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, Org noticed how the four boys were standing together and had surrounded Ron in the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! Be careful with him!\u201d Org said to the four boys. \u201cHe just came here and his foot got hurt!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGive him to me!\u201d Gurt said, as he impatiently walked up to Lim. \u201cI want to hold him!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, alright!\u201d Lim sighed, handing Ron to his bigger brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGurt grabbed Ron by his wrists and then he quickly started spinning him around in a circle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!

He only listens to you!\" Neem said angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You better believe it!\" Org responded firmly. \"He's mine and I will take care of him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrg gave Ron the second slice and watched Ron eat it, while Org poured a glass of water. Then he gave Ron some water to drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you he was hungry! See?\" Org said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well hurry up so we can go outside and play with him!\" Neem said, losing patience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give him a few minutes to digest his food! I don't want him to get sick! Look, his tummy is getting full!\" Org chuckled, while running his big hand over Ron's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon looked up at Org with a loving gaze. Now he was absolutely certain that Org was his master and his protector. He wasn't going to leave him out of his sight...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Ron became curious to what they were talking about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t trained all week!\u201d Irmri shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine! This will show Earth what Tak-Nak is and how we fight!\u201d Org said, as he gently set Ron against the palm tree. \u201cYou stay here and watch, okay?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrg then removed his robe, revealing his big, muscular torso and his long legs and muscular arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrmri, Gurt, Neem and Lim then also removed their robes, which revealed their muscular bodies since they were now only wearing their shorts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho wants to go first?\u201d Org said calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGurt, the stocky boy with black hair, came forward. Org then raised his fists and let out a loud battle cry!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYAAAAA!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon looked up in shock! The boys engaged in a type of fighting which closely resembled Martial Arts on Earth, a combination of kickboxing and karate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrg just went ballistic as he charged at Gurt, swinging his right foot at him, hitting his chest with one blow after another. When Gurt tried to strike back, Org was as fast as a cheetah, leaping out of the way and evading his blows. Finally, Org charged at him and belted him with two mighty blows, which brought him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNext!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle Lim came out, knowing he didn\u2019t stand a chance against the big, powerful Org. Org knew that, so he went easy on him. In fact, Org was actually coaching him a bit as he moved closer to the boy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMove closer, hold your fists up\u2026 UP\u2026 UP\u2026 Alright, strike with your leg\u2026 Come on\u2026 be quick\u2026 Do it before I hit you\u2026 Very good\u2026\u201d Org was saying to the younger boy, who threw a few kicks and punches at Org. But Org didn\u2019t feel a thing and just laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, enough of that! NEXT!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrmri got up next, who started to swing and throw punches right away. At first, Org allowed him to strike at him, letting his friend give it his all. Then Org went into beastmode and he pounded him, swinging his leg and pounding him with one blow after another, until the bow dropped to the ground!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNEXT!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, it was Neem\u2019s turn. Neem was the big chubby kid with the spiky brown hair. Neem was a big bow so Org knew that it would be harder to take him down and Neem\u2019s punches would be harder as well. Neem came out kicking and punching right away, but Org had the height and the muscle to absorb the blows. Finally, after about a minute, Org retaliated and started firing back, returning Neem\u2019s blows with his own and punching back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two big boys were exchanging blows back and forth and it was a match of endurance. But Org, who was in much better physical condition than the chubby, overweight Neem, held out longer as Neem began to get tired. When Neem started to slow down and lose energy, Org cranked up the power and pounded him with kicks and punches until Neem dropped to his knees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop! Org! STOP!\u201d he cried out when Org ceased his attack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright! Practice is over! Everybody huddle together!\u201d Org ordered as the boys came up to him. They all embraced each other in a huddle and Org led them in a short prayer thanking the Gods for their health and their strength before they broke up and walked over to the palm tree where Ron was sitting, watching the entire competition in complete amazement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon was completely amazed and totally impressed with Org. Now he loved the giant muscle boy even MORE! He was a fighter and a superhero to him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrg sat down and gently lifted Ron on his lap, placing Ron\u2019s legs over his long, muscular legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere! You\u2019re sleeping with me tonight, after I take a shower!\u201d Org whispered to him as he gently pressed Ron against his bulging, muscular chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon couldn\u2019t be happier as the other four boys looked on with envy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Cargo ship in need of assistance!  I'm in the middle of the Indian Ocean and need rescue!  Is there anyone out there?!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe listened on the other end.

In the darkness, beyond the whipping wind and rain, he could make out a wave.  Looking to be nearly 50 feet tall, it was coming straight for his ship.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no time to react, Robb braced himself for impact.  Within a matter of seconds, the wave crashed into the ship, flooding the navigation area where he was at.  The last thing he remembered before he blacked out was the sound of the radio shorting out, his ship beginning to sink..., <br>\r\n<br>\r\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobb awakened a few hours later, a gentle breeze blowing through his hair.  He was lying face down on the sand.  He groaned, glancing up at his surroundings.

Another one stood near a hole in the ship, taking another crate out.  Putting it down, he ripped it open, revealing a supply of the protein bars.  \"Hey, guys, look at this!\"  The other kids gathered around, grabbing as many of the bars as they could.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Robb yelled out, deciding immediately that it probably wasn't the best idea he's ever had.  \"Stay away from that food!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three kids turned, looking at the man.  \"Hey, he's alive!\" one of them said, walking over to him.  \"We thought you had died.  We even poked you with a stick a couple times, just to make sure.\"  The boy approached Robb, and noticed that he barely came up to his knee.  \"What are you going to do about it, shorty?\"  One of his massive fingers came down, poking him hard in the chest, knocking him over.  He then put his foot over his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop it, Dwayne!\" another boy said, running up to the first kid.. \"Don't hurt him!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDwayne removed his foot.  \"Relax, I wasn't going to hurt him.  Just having some fun.\"  He walked off, going back to the wrecked ship, to get more food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" the other child asked, bending down.  He smiled sympathetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah,\" Robb said, standing up.  He looked up at the boy.  He had to be around 15 feet tall.  His frame was massive. The boy's chest was massive, resembling twin barrels, with deep separations.  It had to measure close to 75 or 80\", based on his size.  His arms were 43\" around; his shoulders more closely resembled football goal posts, although that was an exaggeration.  His leg muscles held tremendous power, looking more like sequoias, with all four heads of the quadriceps clearly separated.  His back muscles flared outward, from his massive and thick traps at the top,to the lats at the bottom, giving him an incredibly powerful appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, upon looking over at the other boys, they also had the same body type and physique, too.  Just where was he?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name's Adam,\" the boy said, his typical children's voice seemingly out of place for a body that large.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Robb,\" the man replied, looking up cautiously at the child.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pay no attention to Dwayne,\" he said, sitting down on the ground in front of Robb, causing the ground to shake on impact.  \"He's aways a jerk to everyone.\"  The boy glanced over at Robb's ship.  \"Just where did you get all that food?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was shipping it to some very important people when I ran into a few hurricanes.  I doubt they'd want their stuff now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that,\" Adam said.  We were just so hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's okay,\" Robb said, looking over at the boy's friends.  They were lying on the ground, their stomachs full.  \"I guess you guys have enough food for a while, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A week, at best,\" Adam replied.  \"Besides, there are other kids on the island.  They'll want some of it, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, the other two boys approached.  \"Ready to go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Adam said, standing up.  \"You're coming with me, little guy.\"  He bent down and picked Robb up.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, hey!\" he protested.  \"I can walk!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, it's faster this way.\" Adam replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three boys then started running, picking up incredible speed as they went along.  Suddenly, all three leapt into the air, arching high into the air, before landing a few miles away, deep on the island.  The ground shook violently as they landed, Robb feeling the most from their impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere were they?</span></div></div>",

It was a small village, but it, apparently, was thriving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDwayne and the other kid, Stephen, started spreading the news about the ship that crashed on the island and about all the food inside.  Pretty soon, most of the other giant boys ran off, to bring the food back to the village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam was still carrying Robb, cradled in his arms like a puppy or a baby.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, you can put me down now,\" the man told the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam shrugged his shoulders.  \"Suit yourself.\"  He placed the small man on the ground and continued walking towards his home, forcing Robb to run to keep up with the boy's longer strides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey approached his log cabin and walked inside.  Adam looked down at Robb, who was wheezing and gasping for breath.  \"I told you,\" the child said, walking over to a chair and sitting down.  Robb took a few deep breaths and sat down on the floor, in front of the child.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you thirsty or hungry?\" Adam asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thirsty...yes,\" the man said, in between breaths.  \"Hungry...not so much.\"  Adam walked into the kitchen and poured some water into a glass, returning a few moments later, placing the glass in front of Robb.  The glass was nearly half as tall as the man himself and he was struggling to drink from it.  Adam went back to the kitchen and got a straw.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking a few sips, Robb relaxed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a knock at the door.  Adam opened it to find the remaining boys in the village wanting to see the tiny man he discovered.  Adam looked over at Robb.  The man slowly nodded his head.  Adam let them in and soon, Robb was picked off the ground, being inspected, poked, prodded and otherwise manhandled for the next thirty minutes or so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're coming to the party tonight, right?\" one kid asked Adam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What party?\" Adam responded, holding Robb in his lap, as he sat in his chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A party celebrating all of the food you guys found today.  I mean, there as to be at least 50 or 60 crates tucked inside that ship.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Adam said.  \"I guess I'll be there, then.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going to bring your new pet?\" another kid asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If he wants to come,\" Adam responded.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we have to head back home,\" the first kid said, as all the kids stood up.  \"We have chores to do, food to catch,  stuff like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other kids left, leaving Adam and Robb alone.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, do you want to go to the party?\" Adam asked Robb.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You should be safe here.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe child laid down in his bed, as Robb tried to get comfortable in the oversized chair.  Just then, another boy slammed down from the sky, shaking the earth again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you sleep like this?  With all of the noise outside?\" Robb asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You get used to it,\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next few hours, while Adam slept, Robb tried to ignore the pounding outside, as the boys returned, then took off again.  Eventually, after shifting in his seat and being able to block some of the noise out, he drifted off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was nighttime.  Robb was still sleeping in the recliner, when Adam came in and woke him up.  \"Hey, the party's already started.\"  He jabbed the man lightly in the stomach, driving all the air from his lungs, but also succeeding in waking him up, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobb opened his eyes, stretching.  He looked up at the massive child.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought I'd let you sleep a little bit longer,\" Adam said, picking him up and walking towards the front door.  \"Now come on.  You're the reason we have the party.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two walked outside and the cool night air hit Robb in the face, waking him up a little bit.  As they approached the other boys, the man could see most of them sitting around a bonfire, dancing, playing instruments, some even singing.  As Adam approached them, they all stopped and looked up at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I present to you,\" Adam said, holding Robb above his head with both hands.  \"The man who made this celebration possible:  Adam!\"  He then passed the tiny man to the person on his left, ignoring Robb's cries of protest.  After that person was done with him, that person then passed Robb to another boy.  And so on.  It was like show and tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes something happen to Robb while he's being passed around?</span></div></div>",

He looked down into Robb's face, that same nervous look plastered on his face.

Adam was one of those people and he watched as Dwayne leaped into the air, disappearing into the darkness of the night.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobb was held tightly in Dwayne's hand, to keep him from falling out.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam leaped after him, hoping to see his former friend jump again, or at least to hear his body slam down on the ground.

Dejected, he returned back to his village, not speaking to anyone, but rather, going into his room and crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other end of the island, Dwayne crept silently through the night.  After that first initial jump, he decided to lay low,to keep Adam off of his trail.   The terrified man in his hand tried escaping, but Dwayne just increased the pressure around his body, causing Robb to stop moving around.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe eventually came upon his other home on the island, a hut near the coast, close to where Robb's ship crashed.  He walked inside, plopping down in one of the chairs, making himself comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, here are the rules,\" Dwayne began.  \"If you do what I tell you, then I'll feed you and try to keep you in a warm, dry place at night.

He hands a few pieces of fruit to Robb, who greedily consumes them.  \"Besides, he lives on a tiny fraction of what we eat every day; if he is a pet, he's very cheap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want some protein bars?\" a boy offers Robb.

A large chunk of the vessel had been ripped off, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the ship.  The gargantuan figure had one of the crates sitting next to him, as he dug through it, picking up a handful of food, eating it.  He had his back to the man, giving Robb ample time to stare at the person in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobb tried to take in the overall size of the beast.  He looked to be around 15 feet tall, with wide shoulders, and huge traps that snaked halfway down his back.  His lats, covering the lower half of his back, rose to prominence every time he moved, the massive slabs of muscle holding immense power.  The figure reached for another handful of food, and his biceps and triceps bunched up as he gripped the food, the horseshoe from his triceps clearly visible, even from 20 feet away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man decided to try to get away from this monster as fast as he could, before it turned around and ate him, too.  Robb started walking off silently, the massive creature still with his back to him, busy rummaging through the crate.  Robb pulled back a few huge leaves from a low-lying plant and entered the darkness of the jungle ahead of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked up as he walked, taking in just how big everything was.  Trees stretched for hundreds of feet into the air, each one looking as big as sequoias.  Flowers, which usually were no taller than his ankles, grew to nearly his waist, with huge petals blooming out.  He looked up in one of the trees, to see an orangutan jumping from tree branch to tree branch, in search of food.  Only this one had to be a little than Robb, instead of the usual three and a half feet.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just where am I?\" Robb asked himself,as he made his way across the island.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man walked around the side of a huge stone, only to discover a huge panther waiting for him on the other side.  The giant cat had to be the size of a large horse, with paws roughly the same size of a polar bear's.  He bared his teeth, hissing at the unwanted intruder.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe panther tried swatting Robb, succeeding in knowing him over.  The man screamed, his voice echoing throughout the jungle.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large cat stared stalking his prey, walking closer to the small man.  He was just about to pounce,when a massive figure came slamming down on the ground from the sky above.  The ground shook violently as he landed, causing the birds in a few dozen trees in the area to fly away in fear.  It was the giant who was raiding his ship.  Robb just laid on the ground, too afraid to move.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just get out of here!\" the massive figure said to the panther, his higher voice out of place for a body that big.  \"He's not food for you!\"  The giant took one of his feet and nudged the beast away.  The animal complied, walking back into the cave he lived in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant figure turned around, looking down at Robb.  It was a child.  He couldn't be older than 11.  Twelve at the most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" the massive child asked, kneeling down to get a closer look.  The man backed away a little in fear.  \"Don't worry; I'm not going to hurt you.\"  Robb just stared up in him, eyes wide with fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's your name, little guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Robb,\" he replied, nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just relax,\" the kid said, smiling.  \"My name's Peter.  Come on.  You'll be safer if you stay with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobb and the child stood up almost at the same time, and Robb noticed that he barely reached Peter's knees.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think you can keep up if I start walking?\" the boy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...M-Maybe,\" the man replied, looking up once more at the giant kid.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter started walking, his giant strides causing Robb to run in order to keep up with him.  The child's huge foot slammed down on the earth, shaking the ground.  Robb ran, trying desperately to keep up.  Just as he caught up with Peter, his other foot would leap into the air, slamming down a second later.  After a few minutes of this, the man was doubled over, trying to catch his breath.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it would be better if I carried you the rest of the way.\"  Peter bent down and picked up the small man, resting him in the crook of his arm.  Robb was hyperventilating, trying to catch his breath.  As he was finally calming down, the boy pulled back a tree branch, revealing where he lived.</span></div></div>",

It was much bigger than the two room apartment Robb called home back in America.  Peter put the small man back on the ground and started walking towards the home, when a woman stepped outside.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe appeared to be in her mid thirties and had a pretty trim figure.  Another, more normal sized, child was playing in the front yard.  It was a girl.  She looked to be maybe a few years younger than Peter.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, mom, guess what?\" Peter said, as he neared the front of the house.  \"I found a guy lying on the shore.  That's him walking behind me.\"  He pointed back towards Robb.  \"I also found a huge ship filled with food!  You won't have to cook again for a whole year!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's great, Peter,\" the mom replied, smiling up at her son.  \"Now go inside and wash up.  I'll make sure our guest is taken care of.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobb marvelled at the overall size of the house.  It was the size of a mansion, it seemed.  Yet, it looked like a regular house you would see in suburbia.  The yard itself was probably a full acre or so in length.  As he passed the little girl, who was playing on a swingset, he waved at her.  She smiled and waved back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, I'm Robb,\" the man said, as he approached the mother, extending his hand.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Im Sarah,\" she replied.  \"Please, come inside.\"  She motioned him to walk past the huge doorway and into the large living room on the other side.  His mouth dropped as he tried to take in the sheer size of the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amazing, isn't it?\" Sarah said, after closing the front door.  \"You know, Peter built this entire place by himself a few years ago.  I mean, after his growth spurt was over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Robb said.  \"Just how does a child his age grow to that size anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah chuckled a little.  \"It's the water in this place.  I don't know why, but starting from day one, Peter would grow a little bit every time he took a drink of water from the island.  There's a number of springs and lakes and whatnot scattered throughout the island.  Anyway, by the end of the first six months, he looked like Arnold Schwarzenegger and was nearly as tall as I was.  And, over the past few years, he's kept growing until he reached his current size.  I think the growing's stopped, but I swear, every time he takes a drink of water, he gets a little bit stronger.  Lucky me, he's always been a good kid, otherwise I'd never be able to control him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two looked up as Peter passed from the bathroom to the ktchen, the house seeming to shake with every step he took.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it doesn't work on you or your daughter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,no,\" Sarah replied.  \"If that were the case, I'd be even bigger than Peter, since I drink far more water than he does.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you always lived here?\" Robb asked, intrigued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just the past few years or so,\" Sarah replied.  \"We were thrown overboard after the cruise ship we were on at the time capsized.  The three of us found a small boat and we rowed to shore.  We've been here ever since.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to check this island out,\" Robb thought to himself, as the two walked into the kitchen, revealing a very large table full of food.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hungry?\" Sarah asked Robb, who grinned.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm starving.\"</span></div></div>",

The window was rolled down, but next to it was the world's biggest rodent (no not a capybara).

There was also a closet closed by a boulder with clothes that were big enough to fit Zachary Beaver, if he was muscular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Peter got undressed until he was naked &amp; put Robb on top of his dresser with a little bed. \"I hope you like it.

His frame alone was large enough to block out the sun, as Robb was now sitting completely in the shade.  This person had his back to Robb, busy eating whatever he found inside one of the crates he had pulled out of the ship.  Robb noticed a large hole in the side of his ship and prayed that the two hurricanes had caused that and not the giant standing less than 10 feet from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobb stood up, noticing for the first time how small he really was, when compared to the colossal figure.  He probably reached no higher than the top of the giant's large calf muscles, which were bigger than Robb's entire body.  In fact, after looking him up and down a couple of times, Robb saw just how massive the person was.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis frame was very wide and he had the build of a professional bodybuilder, it seemed.  His back muscles were clearly visible, with the huge slabs of latissimus dorsi muscles figuring most prominently.  His shoulders were incredibly wide, with deltoids larger than cannonballs sitting on either side of his neck.  His leg muscles were bigger than the base of a nearby tree and appeared to be harder than stone.  And while he couldn't see the front of this huge person just yet, he figured he was just as big in his arms and chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobb walked a little bit closer, to get a better look.  The only thing covering the giant's body was a loin cloth that was wrapped around his waist, while a huge bow was lying by his feet.  An equally large quiver was hanging over one shoulder, full of arrows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobb ventured even closer, eventually standing only a few feet away from the hulking figure.  He felt so small standing next to the 20 foot tall behemoth, who was still munching away on his cargo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, the giant took a big step backwards, as he was prepared to toss the now empty crate of food aside.  The giant's foot was headed straight for Robb, who had no time to react.  The heel struck him in the chest and he went flying backwards, hitting a tree 15 feet away, before slumping to the ground.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobb watched from the ground as the giant turned around, to see what he hit.  It was then that Robb noticed that the massive figure was only a boy, probably no older than 12 or so.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's...it's just a kid?\" Robb thought to himself, not believing what he was seeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kid ran towards him, each footstep causing the ground around him to shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Robb was about to lose consciousness, he felt a pair of large hands pick him up and carry him away...</span></div></div>",

He slowly opened his eyes, stinging as they adjusted to the dim light of a burning fire. His back was still aching from crashing against the tree. He groaned slightly as he sat up to examine his surroundings - he was equally shocked to see such a place. He looked to be in a large dome - made of tree-trunks and a straw roof. He saw that he was laying on a large mat of leather and woolen cloth - it had to be at most 30 feet long! And he wasn't truly laying on the mat, but upon the huge pillow at its head. At least it was very soft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked around again - and saw an iron frame with a flat surface, above what to Robb, looked liked a Bonfire. He suddenly noticed a huge figure, squatting near the makeshift stove, its back turned to him. It was prodding the flames with what seemed to be a very large branch. The giant suddenly lifted its head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you're finally awake,\" it said without turning to Robb. Finally it began to stand up and turn. Robb felt his stomach sink when he saw the giant stand at a full height of 20 feet. But when he looked up at its face, he recognized it as the giant boy from the beach. \"Good - you seem to be alright. Sorry about that kick, back there. But to be honest, it could've been a lot worse - I was beginning to think I'd killed you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobb was still in such shock that this hulk was 20 feet tall, but looked only to be 12 years old. His mouth hung agape, unable to form words. The giant raised an eyebrow at him. He slowly sat on the side of the mat, near the pillow. His head was hanging over Robb - he could see his entire body reflected in the giant's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright, tiny one?\" he asked him. \"Or are you not old enough to speak yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat confused Robb - did this 12 year old giant...think that he was a Child?</span></div></div>",

There, seated just in front of him, was the biggest child he'd ever seen! The biggest living creature he'd ever seen! He gasped and quickly scampered back. He looked around for an escape route from this giant boy. However, this was a cave that looked a bit small, even for something as big as the giant in frount of him. The giant practically filled the mouth of the cave, cornering Robb. Now, he got a good look at the giant child. He had shaggy auburn hair, freckles lightly coating his cheeks, shoulders, and arms, big green eyes that gazed at him curiously, thick eyebrows, and even a downy layer of immature body hair on his massive chest, arms, legs, back, and belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you s-s-stay back!\" Robb cried out, pressing his back to the very far cave wall.

He covered his face with his large, sinewy hands and began crying profusely. \"I-I know I-I'm ugly!\" he sobbed. Robb blinked in confusion, but refused to move. He was surprised that such a huge creature could cry and cower like a mouse. This was actually quite ironic. As minutes passed, Robb slowly relaxed. The poor kid... He really seemed sincere. Robb cautiously began approaching the beastly child. Inch by inch, he drew nearer until he stood just before his tree trunk sized calf. With a hesitant hand, he slowly laid it on the boy's slightly hairy leg. It felt soft and dense, like a teddy bear's fur. Robb was fascinated with the boy's excessive body hair. He wondered of his arm and chest hair felt like that. Reaching up, he began stroking the beastly boy's Zeus-like forearm. It was even softer and denser! This kid was going to be a gorilla when he got older! As Robb continued to pet the giant's arm, the boy removed his huge hands fom his face. Robb saw this and flinched, but remained where he was<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, kid. You're not ugly, you're just... Huge...\" he said awkwardly.

How could I be your big brother?\" The smile quickly left Zach's face, his frown returning and his eyes beginning to water once more. Robb felt like he had been punched in the stomach. He couldn't believe that he was going to make this kid cry twice in one hour. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to be my big brother if you don't want to,\" Zach said, his voice quivering as tears threatened to spill from his eyes. \"I just thought that since your older than me, and because you're nice, maybe we could be brothers.\" The tears began rolling down his face as Robb watched. Panicking, he quickly tried to stop the tears of the gargantuan child before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey hey hey!! I never said I didn't want to be your brother! I just... You know... How can I be your big brother since you're so much bigger than me? That's all I meant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe. It doesn't matter if your tiny compared to me,\" Zach laughed shakily as he wiped his tears. \"I'm just gonna keep getting bigger and bigger as I get older, even if I don't want to. And I want you to be my big brother cause I don't ever remember having a family. But if you don't want to, we can just be friends.\" Robb could still here a hint of sadness in the giant's, no, in ZACH'S statements trailed off. He really wanted a family, and having a big brother must be very important to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I don't know how long I'll be on this island, if I can even leave,' Robb thought to himself. 'And Zach will need someone to talk to. It can't be good for him to be lone his entire life...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I don't think I can be your big brother Zach,\" Robb said hesitantly. Zach's body dropped as more tears rolled down his checks. Every huge muscle tensed and shook as he cried. He pressed his palms into his eyes , furiously trying to wipe his tears away. Zach sobbed into his hands, only peeling them away when he felt a small hand pressed against his though. Looking down he saw the face of the smiling Robb. \" you're just too huge for ME to be the big brother. But I can  be your older brother. That seems more.. Appropriate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing, Zach swept Robb into his arms, nearly crushing Robb into his dense pecs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh big brother, I said it wouldn't matter how tiny you are!! You still made me happy! Now we can do everything together! We can play games, I can show you where I sleep, we can talk all day-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can do all those things Zach! Just let me breathe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops!\" Zach panicked, loosening his grip on his new big brother Robb, dropping him onto the damp soft rock of the cave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm not tiny. I'm six feet five inches tall. It's you who's huge, you big goofball!\" Robb laughed at how excited, yet nervous, Zach seemed to be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry big brother! I won't drop you or hurt you ever again,\" Zach promises enthusiastically, his boyish face smiling, showing his true age despite having such a hugely muscles body. \"To make it up to you...</span></div></div>",

Here he was trying to set a record as the youngest pilot ever to circumnavigate the globe solo (at 21), and now he found himself completely lost.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had started in his hometown of St. Louis, and made it to New York, and then across the Atlantic with little trouble.  Likewise, Europe had proved a piece of cake.  He started heading south at that point, and had just started to cross over the Indian subcontinent when, seemingly out of nowhere, he flew right into a monster of a storm, the remnants of a typhoon.  He was able to manage for a while, hoping to fly out of it sooner rather than later, but the storm just kept getting worse.  And to top it off, he had flown a hundred miles off course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot knowing what else to do, Peter grabbed the radio.  \"This is Redhawk 32!  Is anyone there? Over!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing but static greeted him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I repeat, this is Redhawk 32!  I am a solo pilot needing assistance! Over!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter wiped the sweat from his brow, and started to talk to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, all I have to do is just keep flying.  This storm can't go on forever, and I'll make it out as a stronger pilot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a huge bolt of lightning came flying to the sky and struck his left engine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CRAP!\" Peter yelled, as he jumped in his seat.  He looked out the window, and saw the propeller sputter, then stop.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter swore to himself.  The plane started losing altitude fast, and started to enter into a nosedive.  Peter grabbed on to his stick, and tried to remember what they taught him in flight school.  He couldn't think clearly, all his training was useless.  He just pulled back on the controls and prayed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter woke up, breathing heavily.  He sat up with a start, and grimaced in pain.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was alive.  Somehow, he had survived the crash.  But where was he.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, he came to his feet.  He looked around.  He was in a clearing in the middle of a jungle of some sort, that much was obvious.  A few hundred yards away, he saw the smoldering remains of his plane, crashed into a tree.  The force of impact must have knocked him from the cockpit.  He had several cuts and scrapes on his face, and his ankle was sprained, but, miraculously, he was still alive.  And not too much worse for the wear.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he stood there, shocked, wondering what to do next, he became aware of a loud noise in the distance.  At first he thought it was the thunder, but the storm had diminished and was going away, and this noise was getting closer.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe whirled around, trying to figure out exactly what was going on.  He looked to the north, and saw trees rustling.  Something was coming.  Something BIG.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter immediately started limping away, trying to find a place to hide.  After a few seconds, he saw a tree with a hollow trunk, and he ran towards that, and hid inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked out through the cracks, and was stunned when, out into the clearing stepped a...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Peter was stunned.  In front of him stood what looked like a thirteen year-old boy carrying a spear, but he was huge!  He stood level with the bottom of the tree canopy.  He had brown skin and dark hair that covered his ears and came down to where his shirt collar would be -- that is, if he had worn a shirt.  Right now, he was only wearing a loin cloth that came down about halfway between his waist and his knees, covering only what needed to be covered.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other thing Peter noticed immediately was how muscular the boy was!  His calves looked like tree trunks, and he had the pecs and abs of a pro basketball player.  He stood there, looking around, with his hand to his eyes, which were deep and brooding, and gave Peter a strange sense of calm, that maybe this boy wasn't actually so scary.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the boy spotted the wreckage of Peter's plane hanging in the tree, and ran over to it, looking inside.  Shockingly, he picked it up, even though it was probably twice his size!  \"Man,\" Peter thought to himself, \"I guess those muscles aren't just for show!\"  The boy sat the plane on the ground, only a few dozen feet from where Peter was hiding, and extinguished the lingering flames with a bit of water from a small leather canteen he was carrying around his waist.  He then got down on his hands and knees, and searched through the plane wreckage.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter tried to be as quiet as possible while he assessed the situation.  Should he make himself known to this boy?  He didn't know what would happen, but he didn't have many other options at the moment.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He stayed hidden, and watched as the giant boy turned around with a stern look on his face, like he was afraid.  \"What could make a twenty-foot tall muscle boy get afraid like that?\" Peter thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a huge black panther leaped from the trees and jumped on the boy, knocking his spear away.  Peter was stunned; the panther was even bigger than the boy, at least twenty-five feet long and twelve feet tall at the shoulder.  It had beautiful silky dark fur, and razor sharp teeth and claws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe panther pinned the boy to the ground, and gave a loud growl.  The boy growled right back and quickly slipped from underneath the panther's grasp.  He jumped to his feet and turned to face the panther, with a wide stance as if to try and tackle him.  The panther circled around, and they had a stare down for a few seconds.  Then, the panther leaped at the boy, but the boy quickly dodged him, throwing the panther off balance.  The boy then jumped on the panther's back.  Peter could see the boy's large muscles straining as he wrestled the panther to the ground, pinning it down.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point Peter had enough, and he decided he didn't want to stay around to see the finish.  He tried sneaking out of the tree trunk, but he accidentally stepped on a branch.  The panther turned its head towards Peter and spotted him, then leapt to its feet and rushed over towards Peter.  Peter saw his life flash before his eyes, cowered and covered his head as the Panther bore down on him, until the boy yelled, \"Kalima! Thaharana!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe panther immediately came to a stop, and Peter looked up to see it sitting mere feet in front of him, with a fierce but noble look on its face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, the boy ran over to the two of them, shaking the ground with his giant feet as he did so.  Peter wanted to run away, but was to terrified to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy stopped next to the panther, and crouched down, examining Peter.  Peter was amazed to see this huge face, with eyes as big as basketballs and a mouth that could swallow him whole, in front of him.  But something about that face calmed him a little; even though it was tough, it had a smoothness and a gentleness to it that seemed comforting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy reached out his hand to Peter, and said something in a language he didn't understand; he guessed it was Hindi.  Shaking, Peter leaned away, instinctively trying to escape the boy's grasp.  \"Wh-wh-who are you?\" Peter asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small smile crept across the boy's face, and he stopped his hand a couple of feet in front of Peter.  \"My name is Nikhil,\" the boy said, with surprisingly little accent.  \"I saw your plane as it crashed into the jungle, and I came to rescue you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter looked at Nikhil incredulously.  \"Rescue me?  From what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a loud bomb filled the air.  Peter spun around to see trees crashing down behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From that,\" Nikhil said, pointing at...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Three Humvees were racing towards them through the jungle.  Each vehicle had three or four men hanging off of them, wearing camouflage outfits.  Several of the men were carrying AK-47s, a couple had shotguns, and one was aiming a large machine gun mounted to the top of the truck.  They were about 1000 feet away and closing fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?!\" Peter exclaimed.  \"Who are they?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter turned around, but Nikhil was nowhere to be seen.  He looked to either side, trying to find him.  'How could I lose track of a twenty-foot tall thirteen year old?' he thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he saw a black flash dart out of the woods right in front of him.  It was the panther, and Nikhil was riding on top of it.  They were coming towards him, and Nikhil leaned over to the side, his arm outstretched.  \"Grab on!\" he shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstinctively, Peter reached out for the large arm coming towards him, which was almost the same size as Peter himself, and grabbed on to it as they raced by.  Peter was surprised by how thick the arm he was holding onto was; he could barely get his own arms around the rippling muscles.  Even though he was afraid for his life, he was slightly comforted by its strength and warmth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith virtually no effort, Nikhil pulled Peter up onto the back of the panther.  \"Hold on to her fur!\" he said.  Peter did as he was told, lying down right in between the shoulder blades and taking a fistful of fur in each hand.  The panther\u2019s fur was smooth, with just the right amount of coarseness so that Peter could keep a tight hold on it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Peter got situated and a little comfortable, he looked back to see what was going on.  The Humvees had caught up, and were now only a few dozen feet away.  The men were now firing at them, wildly.  Luckily, they were not great shots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikhil was hanging on with on arm behind Peter, turning around and taking aim at  the vehicles with what looked like a blow gun.  WHOOSH! WHOOSH!  A couple of darts flew out and struck the front tires of two of the vehicles, causing them to blowout.  The men screamed and jumped to the ground as the vehicles crashed into a couple of trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter was impressed.  \u201cNice shot!\u201d he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikhil turned to face back forwards.  \u201cDon\u2019t celebrate yet; I\u2019m out of darts.  Kalima! Shighra!\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe panther, who Peter guessed was named Kalima, started running faster, dashing around trees.  Peter looked back, and saw that the remaining Humvee was still on their tail, and it was the one with the mounted machine gun.  The merc aiming the gun let of a few rounds, and the bullets spread wildly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of bullets struck Kalima in her backside, and she let out a yelp of pain with a little leap that knocked Peter off balance.  He lost his grip on the fur, and began to fall off to the ground, crying out \u201cWhooaa!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he flew through the air, he felt a hand wrap around him and pull him back.  He looked up at Nikhil, who gave him a quick smile.  \u201cYou got to hold on a little tighter than that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter chuckled, but another burst of gunfire from behind them caused the levity to stop. He looked back at the pursuing Humvee.  \u201cHow are we gonna lose those guys?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Nikhil responded, \u201cI\u2019ve got one last surprise for them. Look,\u201d he said as he pointed forwards.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter leaned up and saw what Nikhil was pointing at: they were approaching a large gorge, at least two hundred feet wide, stretching out on either side into the distance.  He could hear the sound of a rushing river below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre--are you gonna--\u201d Peter struggled to form the correct words; he was hoping his eyes were deceiving him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes!\u201d Nikhil replied.  \u201cDon\u2019t look down!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one powerful motion, Kalima leapt into the air, and everything seemed to go in slow motion for Peter.  Majestically, they flew in a perfect arc over the gorge.  Though he had his eyes closed, Peter couldn\u2019t help but take a peak at the raging rapids five hundred feet below them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed like an eternity, they landed on the other side, clearing the gorge by five feet.  Kalima stopped and turned around, and Peter saw the Humvee screech to a stop on the other side of the river, nearly plunging down to the waters below.  The men looked at them furiously, aimlessly shooting their weapons, to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikhil sat straight up and put his hands next to his face, sticking out his tongue as he did so.  \u201cHa ha!\u201d he shouted in a taunting manner.  \u201cJanma k\u0101 p\u0101gala!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mercs made obscene gestures at them, but Nikhil simply laughed, and slapped Kalima on her side, signaling it was time to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they moved on, Peter said, \u201cWho were those guys?  Why were they trying to kill us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikhil simply answered, \u201cThey\u2019re the bad guys.  And they weren\u2019t trying to kill us.  They were trying to capture me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Peter asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikhil brought his finger up to his mouth, saying, \u201cShhh!  It\u2019s not safe to talk here.  I\u2019ll explain when we get home.  Kalima! Ghara!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKalima quickly but silently moved on through the jungle.  For ten minutes, neither Nikhil nor Peter said anything.  Finally, Kalima stopped, and Nikhil jumped off of her back.  He reached out his hand for Peter to stand on, and said, \u201cWe\u2019re here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter crawled over to Nikhil\u2019s hand, which was large enough for him to stand on comfortably.  Slowly, Nikhil lowered Peter to the ground, and Peter stepped off.  He looked around him, and saw that they were at what appeared to be a village in the middle of the jungle, with several huts forty feet tall made out of mud and logs, all at the base of very large trees stretching much taller than the trees in the rest of the jungle.  But what surprised Peter most about it all was that ...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Peter was confused.  The relative development in the area made it seem like there would be at least a small group of people living here, but Peter didn\u2019t see anyone else.  He scratched his head, then asked, \u201cWhere\u2019s everyone else?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikhil simply looked down at him, with a somber expression on his face.  \u201cCome inside,\u201d he said, as he slid open the door to the closest hut, and motioned for Peter to enter.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter walked in.  The hut had only one room, large to Peter, but a relatively small living space for Nikhil, he figured, only being about fifty feet wide and forty feet long.  It was sparsely furnished, with only a twenty-foot long bed on one wall and a twelve-foot long desk and matching chair on the other.  The bed was made of bamboo poles, with a mattress that looked like dozens of seat cushions sown together.  The chair looked to be carved out of solid wood; it had a very rough quality to it, though it looked sturdy enough to support Nikhil\u2019s massive frame.  The desk was the most interesting to Peter, as it appeared to be made from sheet metal folded enough to approximate the shape.  Peter couldn\u2019t see what was on top of the desk, as it stood higher than his plane of vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikhil and Kalima followed behind Peter.  Kalima went over to an empty side of the hut and lied down, her face looking at Peter with a fierce, but noble, look.  Nikhil sat his spear and blow gun on the desk, and sat down on the bed.  He sighed, running his hands through his hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you like to sit up here on the bed, or on the desk...?\u201d Nikhil asked, his voice trailing off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm,\u201d Peter said, \u201cI guess the desk will be fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs it okay if pick you up then?\u201d Nikhil said as he crouched down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, sure,\u201d Peter said, hesitantly.  Though he was beginning to feel comfortable around this giant boy, he still was uneasy about the size difference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Nikhil was very careful, gently picking Peter up by the arms and slowly moving him over to the desk, where he sat him down.  The feeling of getting picked up by another person triggered a nostalgic memory in Peter\u2019s head of when he was a little kid, and his father would pick him up and carry him on his shoulders.  It brought a smile to Peter\u2019s face, if only for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter felt the metal of the desk beneath his feet as he sat down on the edge.  It was smooth to the touch, if a little warped, from being forced into a desk shape, he presumed.  As he sat down, Nikhil sat back down on the bed.  Even with Peter\u2019s advantage of being on the higher surface of the desk, he still had to look up to talk to Nikhil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo...\u201d Nikhil said, \u201cI suppose you want to know how this all happened.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d Peter said, shrugging, \u201cthat would be helpful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Nikhil said.  \u201cBear with me here.  It all starts about fifteen years ago.  I was a normal boy then, only about five feet tall, and was a student at a school in Delhi.  It was one of the wealthiest schools in the city; all the rich people sent their kids there.  I played on the cricket team, and we had just won the regional championship and were going to compete in the big national tournament in Bombay.  Do you understand me so far?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think so,\u201d Peter responded, \u201cthough I\u2019m a little confused on how this could be fifteen years ago, but I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll explain that.  By the way, Bombay\u2019s now called Mumbai.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see,\u201d Nikhil said, nodding.  \u201cWell, our school had chartered a flight, and, in short, we ran into a very intense storm, not unlike the one you had trouble with last night.  Our plane crashed into a field a few kilometers east of here,\u201d he said, pointing.  \u201cThe pilot, our coaches and parents, all the adults on the flight were severely injured, and either had already died in the crash or would do so soon.  But, amazingly, all twelve of the boys on the team survived with hardly a scratch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe first few days were chaotic; it seemed like each boy had a different idea of what to do.  We eventually all followed Harjeet, who was the oldest among us, nearly 15, and the team leader.  He split us up into two groups, one that would search for shelter, and the other that would try to rescue what we could from the wreckage.  I was on the team searching for shelter, and a few miles away from the crash, we found a cave that would work for shelter.  It\u2019s only about a kilometer from here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo we all moved to the cave.  The other group of boys tried to salvage the radio from the plane, but they could never get it to pick up or transmit a signal; there seemed to be a large interference coming from somewhere.  We settled in, having enough food for about a week.  But after the first four or five days, we noticed that we were all changing.  All of us were developing muscle at a rapid rate, and began to grow in height.  It started slow at first: a few inches here, ten pounds of muscle there, but by the end of the second week, we had grown into becoming, well, what I am now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow,\u201d Peter said, \u201cso there were eleven other boys as big as you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually,\u201d Nikhil said, \u201cmost of the others were bigger.  We all seemed to be affected differently; one boy, Kumar, who was the youngest on the team at twelve years old, ended up being the biggest among us all, at thirty feet tall with muscles like a body builder.  Another, my close friend Shariq, only grew to be about twelve feet tall and stayed relatively skinny.  But all of us were changed, and we loved it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAmazing,\u201d Peter said.  \u201cDo you know why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, after realizing that the plant and wildlife in the area were also much bigger than normal, we guessed it had something to do with some force in the area.  We didn\u2019t discover exactly why until we explored the cave further, and we found something amazing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Peter asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI...I can\u2019t really explain it,\u201d Nikhil said, shaking his head.  \u201cIt\u2019s something you\u2019ll have to see for yourself.  I\u2019ll take you there tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Peter said.  Though he really wanted to know more about what was in the cave, he trusted Nikhil to show him when the time was right.  \u201cThere\u2019s one thing you haven\u2019t told me though.  Where are all your friends now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikhil\u2019s shoulder\u2019s slumped, and he dropped his face.  After a short silence, he looked up, with a sad expression on his face, and told Peter what had happened:</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cDead!\u201d Peter exclaimed.  \u201cHow in the world did that happen?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikhil sighed.  \u201cIt was about three months after the crash.  We had built this village you see here, and had become excellent hunters and gatherers.  Though the thought of rescue or discovery hadn\u2019t left our minds, we were happy and content with our little civilization.  And then, the Hunters came.\u201d\u2028<br>\r\n\u201cThe Hunters?\u201d Peter asked.  \u201cYou mean those guys who were chasing us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, they\u2019re few of many.\u201d Nikhil said.  \u201cThere\u2019s probably about three dozen of them total.  They\u2019re men-for-hire, some of them from the surrounding area, some of them flown in from elsewhere.  All of them are doing this for only one thing: money.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut,\u201d Peter thought for a moment, \u201c where is the money coming from, then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikhil reached under the bed and pulled out a sheet of paper.  \u201cFrom him,\u201d he said, as he slid it over to Peter.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter quickly recognized the sheet as the front page of an Indian newspaper, and, though it was in Hindi, he understood what Nikhil was referring to.  A large picture of a white man with a mustache and dark glasses covered the sheet.  Peter guessed he was a general of some sort.  \u201cWho is this?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDemidov,\u201d Nikhil responded.  \u201cHe\u2019s an old Soviet general, who hated capitalism and detested the new Russian government, and left the country after the fall of communism, taking with him about a hundred soldiers as followers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see,\u201d Peter said, \u201cbut why is he here now, trying to kill you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikhil looked out the window, off into the distance.  \u201cBecause, once all the guardians are dead, there\u2019s nothing stopping him from getting to the one thing he wants most.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what is that?\u201d Peter asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome,\u201d Nikhil said as he stood up.  As if on cue, Kalima also quickly stood up and walked over next to him.  \u201cYou need to see it with your own eyes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikhil reached out his hand, motioning Peter to step on.  Peter did so, and Nikhil placed him on his shoulder.  Quietly, he left the hut, and walked slowly through the rest of the village.  Peter looked around, a knot forming in the pit of his stomach.  The deserted village reminded him of ghost towns he visited while vacationing in Colorado as a kid, just at a scale of three to four times larger.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they neared the other end of the village, Peter saw they were approaching a cave.  \u201cIs this...?\u201d he asked.  Nikhil simply nodded.  <br>\r\nThey entered the cave, Kalima going first with Nikhil a few yards behind her.  Peter suddenly felt a chill, partly from the drop in temperature, and partly from the dark.  Nikhil didn\u2019t have a torch or lantern, but seemed to be able to navigate the passageways in the dark with ease.  Peter\u2019s breathing began to quicken.  Sensing his fright, Nikhil gave him a soft pat on the pack, and whispered, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, we\u2019re almost there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few quiet minutes, they arrived at a giant cavern, with a ceiling stretching, at Peter\u2019s best estimate, about 100 feet high.  The cavern was filled with an eerie blue glow; Peter was happy just to have some light, though it did look to be a light source unlike any he had seen before.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKalima was whimpering somewhat, making sure she stayed close to Nikhil\u2019s feet.  Nikhil stopped, and turned around to face Peter.  \u201cWe\u2019re here,\u201d he said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere\u2019s here?\u201d Peter asked.  \u201cWhat is this place?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s the... well, how do I describe it,\u201d Nikhil said, thinking.  \u201cIt\u2019s the heart and soul of this area of the jungle.  It\u2019s the whole reason we\u2019re in this mess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut why?!\u201d Peter exclaimed, his face getting red.  \u201cWhat makes this cavern so special.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikhil stuck out his hand and pointed a long finer towards the center of the cavern.  \u201cThat,\u201d he said, simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter turned towards what Nikhil was pointing at, and it nearly knocked his socks off to see the source of the light, and that it was...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Peter fell backwards a bit in shock when he saw the large, blue crystal at the center of the cavern. It seemed to be fixed in the middle of a rock formation, and had to be nearly ten feet from top to bottom, tapering to a point at both ends. There was an almost unearthly glow to it, and it pulsated at an irregular rhythm, as if trying to slowly signal something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What--what the hell is that?\" Peter shouted, \u00a0turning his head up to Nikhil, who was stoned-faced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know exactly what it is or where it came from.\" The large Indian boy sat down next to Peter, his eyes fixed on the crystal. \"I just know it's what has caused everything within twenty or thirty miles of here to become overgrown. It's what made me the way I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter couldn't believe his ears. \"But how-- how could it do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm no expert,\" Nikhil leaned back, \"but I'm guessing that there's something in that crystal that changes the cellular structure of organic life. I mean, it affects every kind of creature living around here: me and my friends, Kalima, the plants and trees...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you all touch it or something?\"\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikhil shook his head. \"Touching it doesn't do anything unusual. But if you go straight up through the rock formation,\" he drew a line with his finger from the top of the crystal up through the entire stalactite above it, \"you'll end up at the bottom of a large lake, the main source of water for this area of the jungle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter nodded a little, beginning to comprehend, and ran his fingers through his hair. \"I guess that would explain why everything grew, even things that had never been down here to the caves. But wait!\" His nose scrunched up as Nikhil looked down at him. \"If the water has the properties to make you grow, why doesn't Demidov just drink from the lake, and have all his men drink too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikhil stood up again, starting to pace around the cavern. \"He tried that. But apparently, when dissolved in water, the crystal's powers only work on creatures that are still growing, basically children, \u00a0teens, cubs, saplings -- that kinda thing. And though it caused us to grow huge and muscular, it stopped our development in other ways -- slowing down our aging process, or at least the appearance of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah,\" Peter realized something, \"so that's how you could've come here fifteen years ago and still look like a young teenager. So how old would that make you then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikhil thought for a second. \"I stopped keeping track of that long ago when it looked like it would no longer matter, but I guess I'd be about twenty-eight. I still look and feel like a thirteen-year old though. You know, except for these.\" He smiled and gave a little flex of the arms, his thick biceps bulging out and his chest muscles swelling slightly.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tch,\" Peter said, smiling at the impressive display of boy in front of him. \"Well at least you're modest about it.\" He winked at Nikhil, who chuckled and blushed slightly, then turned his attention back to the matter at hand. \"So what does Demidov want with the crystal then, if it doesn't make him grow when he touches it or when he drinks from its water?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikhil shrugged. \"I don't know. He must have found some other way to tap into its power, maybe even some way that'd be even more effective, possibly turning him into a god. But I do know this: he's an evil man, he wants it, and he'll kill for it. That combination is never good.\"\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding in agreement, Peter started to look around the cavern, able to just barely make out something on the opposite wall that looked intriguing. Curious, he made his way over to that side, examining the wall closely. It appeared to be markings of some kind, apparently burned onto the wall in an unusual pattern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are these marks?\" he called out to Nikhil, who made his way over to look as well. \"Did you and your friends make these?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Nikhil said, shaking his head, \"they were he long before we arrived. By the looks of them, I'd say they're ancient, maybe thousands or millions of years old.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh,\" Peter studied them closer. There were two basic sections to the markings. The first was a large outline of an unusual, almost amorphous shape, longer than it was wide, with six large burn spots inside the lines. The second was a pattern of eight mostly concentric circles surrounding a small dot in the middle. There were two large burn spots on the lines of the third and fifth circles.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know what they mean?\" Peter asked the larger boy, who had bent over to look at them closer. \"Maybe they tell us something about the crystal, or how to defend it.\" \u00a0\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikhil rubbed his chin as he stared at the markings for a bit longer, finally giving up. \"No, I don't think they mean anything. Probably just a caveman playing with a burning stick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe,\" Peter mused. Both patterns looked familiar, as if he'd seen them before, but he couldn't quite place what they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could think about it any more, a loud blast sounded behind them. Both boys whirled around, shocked to see the crystal pulsating wildly, blinking off and on rapidly, getting brighter and brighter. After ten or fifteen seconds, the cavern was filled with another loud blasting sound, and a circle of light and wind spread out from the crystal. The wave swept through the cavern, sending Peter flying against the wall when it hit him and even knocking the formidable Nikhil on his butt.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs both boys recovered and resumed staring in wonder at the crystal, they could make out the silhouette of a figure emerging from the other side of the its glow. Peter brought his hand up to cover his eyes and tried to make out who - or what it was. He was shocked to see -- \u00a0</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Peter walked through the jungle, feeling scared, lonely and tired. He was in an unknown place, where he didn\u2019t know the territory or the language. He wasn\u2019t even sure which country he was in. All he knew that he was flying over Africa somewhere when the plane went down. To make matters even worse, the storm was really picking up and the rain was coming down heavier with every passing moment. He was drenched beyond belief as he tried to crawl out of the wreckage of the plane. As he looked on, it was just a miracle that he survived the crash! The trees had stopped the crash, the wings had ripped apart, and luckily he was able to walk away with just a few scrapes and bruises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he saw something move in the distance. As Peter started to move, his ankle reminded him of the injury. He couldn\u2019t walk. Peter fell down to the floor, and he lay on his back. It was hopeless; he couldn\u2019t move. All he could do now was pray for the best. He was in God\u2019s hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere it was. Out of the bushes, a huge figure appeared. It was a man. Or, at least, it was a human being. And it was absolutely humongous! The figure was towering over Peter as it looked down on him. It had a loin cloth over its midsection, but, other than that, its long, muscular legs were very imposing. A thick, wide torso, accentuated by mighty abdominals and bulging pectorals, and then those thick, muscular arms\u2026 Peter felt like he was looking up to a large, tanned bodybuilder. Still, the face on top of the large body looked like that of a young boy, and not like that of a grown man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy spoke up in a high-pitch voice, confirming what Peter had thought. He spoke in a strange language, which he didn\u2019t understand. Still, the boy looked to be much taller and bigger than an average adult. He was certainly twice as big as an adult, standing more than a dozen feet tall, and with all that muscle on him, Peter knew that the boy was incredibly strong for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant boy looked down on Peter and then, with a smile on his face, he reached down with his huge hands, and he picked Peter up and held him in his arms like he was holding a little infant. Peter felt the powerful, muscular arms and the huge fingers of the mighty hands hold his body in his grip. Still, the giant boy held him in an incredibly lovingly way. The boy somehow looked at him like he was caring for a little baby or a wounded animal, as he slowly started taking Peter away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy then headed deeper and deeper into the jungle, until he came closer to a lake which was surrounded by trees. There, he climbed up a crude ladder, which led up to a tree-house. There, he set Peter down on a large bed made of leaves, before running down again and collecting more leaves from the trees. He quickly returned again, and placed more leaves in order to expand the bed, making it big enough for the two of them. Then he lay down, with Peter next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPeter!\u201d Peter said, pointing at his chest. \u201cPeter!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaui!\u201d the giant boy replied, while he pointed his giant finger at his huge, bulging chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay\u2026 Maui\u2026\u201d Peter grinned. At least now he knew what the big boy\u2019s name was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe huge boy had an oriental expression on his face. He looked like a Pacific Islander with a golden tan and deep, brown eyes. It would be curious to know how this boy ended up over here in Africa? Also, how did the boy end up so big?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Peter looked down, he noticed that the boy was at least twice as tall and twice as big as him, even more! Peter guessed that the boy was nearly fifteen feet tall and he had a great amount of muscle on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut for now, Peter just closed his eyes and drifted off in a deep sleep, as Maui lay right next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The huge, towering, muscular figure of...a twelve year old boy. Or at least, he looked twelve. If twelve-year-old boys had growth-spurts that sent them up to ten feet in height. The boy wore a simple tunic and robes, and he looked a bit like an ancient Roman. He stared carefully around, as if looking for something. Then he started looking down. Leaves crunched as he got slowly to his knees and brought his head right down to the ground. His hair glowed golden in the sunlight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wheeeere aaaaare you...?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite his gigantic size, Peter guessed the boy was no older than about twelve. Thirteen at the most. He probably wasn't very dangerous, but Pete could tell the boy was built. His arms were thick and firm and he looked like he lifted boulders the size of houses every day! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaah hah!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree fingers the size of sausages reached into the hole in the tree-trunk and grabbed Peter around the waist.

Fortunately, the grass and leaves broke his fall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow you can talk!\" the boy said. <br>\r\n\"Well duh!\" Peter said, \"Who are you!?\" <br>\r\n\"WHO ARE YOU!?\" <br>\r\n\"I'm Peter,\" said Peter. <br>\r\n\"Derek!\" said the enormous buff boy. <br>\r\n\"Where...where am I?\" said Peter. <br>\r\n\"It's a jungle! What do you think?\" Derek said, \"You sure are small for your age\".<br>\r\n\"You sure are big for yours!\" said Peter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy laughed, \"I like you, you're funny!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Derek grabbed Peter and hoisted the young man up onto his shoulders as if he was a baby. Holding onto the boy's thick neck, Peter sat himself as comfortable as he could on his massive, broad shoulders and held on for the ride! </span></div></div>",

The individual was a giant about 20 feet tall and very muscular. Shoulders as big as beach balls, biceps bigger than tree trunks, a broad, thick torso, with huge pecs that looked more like two thick granite plates, a powerful 8-pack, legs bigger than anything he had ever seen, but the even more surprising was that his face looked like that of a child, perhaps younger than Tommy himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" asked the young giant in a tone of voice that, at the same time, showed youth and power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-my name is To-Tommy, T-t-Tommy H-Hughes.\" Tommy replied with a mixture of dread and surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Matthew Fairbanks, but you can call me Matt.\" The gigantic boy replied, \"You should be in bed, the Doctor said you still haven't recovered from the accident.\" He continued in a critical tone \"Come on, I'll take you back.\" With that, Matt took Tommy, who felt the giant hand wrap his whole body with a certain pressure. Within seconds they reached the room and the giant deposited him on the bed. \"Wait here, I'll call the doctor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wait, where am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are at Elysium.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes after Matt left, he returned with an older man, in his sixties who was a more normal size, about 6ft2.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello my young Tommy, I am Dr. Yanna, I was the one who took care of you when your plane crashed. Mattie warned me of your attempt to escape, that was unwise to do, since you have not yet fully recovered from your accident.\" Said the man in a tone similar to what a father would use on a disobedient son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, sir, but I was, I am, scared.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is understandable that you are like this, after all you just woke up in a totally new environment and, I might add, very strange for you.\" Said the doctor in an understandable tone. \"Now, I need to examine you, to see how you are, all right?\" Tommy just nodded and the doctor did the necessary checks. \"Now, I assume you would have a question, am I right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I want to know how the others are doing, the ones on the plane with me, are they okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must inform you that, unfortunately, only you and another young man survived the fall and the subsequent fire. He is still unconscious due to a blow to the head, but otherwise he appears to be in perfect health.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that only someone else on the flight survived was sad for Tommy to hear, he liked those who were with him. \"I can see you?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can see him later. Anything else you want to know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is everyone here so big?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha ha! No child, most of those who live here are of normal size, only a few are taller, although I should point out that none are as big as Mattie, even the older ones than him. Now the most important thing is that you rest child, so you can recover your strength more quickly. \"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He could feel the water rushing beneath him, the wind in his hair, the salt on his face. Ramone was tall for his age. He was only seventeen, but he was already about six and a half feet tall. His body was chiseled perfection, thick and beefy with a natural tan. His hair was shaggy brown and his eyes were brown too. His girlfriend adored him and...reckoned he had a cute butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the wave bottomed out, Ramone paddled and then walked, back to shore. He put his surfboard away on the porch of his parents house, and then dragged out his canoe. Ramone loved canoeing. Sometimes he went with friends, other times, alone. Today was an alone day. He just wanted to enjoy the surf and the sun and to relax. He pushed the canoe into the surf and jumped in. Wearing just sandals and boxer-shorts, he could feel the warmth of the sun on his body. Yeah this was good. He picked up one of the oars and started paddling out to sea. Ramone was a machine. His arms powered tirelessly through the waves, digging the paddle deep into the water, left, right, left, right, going faster and faster. Ramone, Ramone, the Metronome. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah...\" Ramone said, as the waves started getting larger and larger. Then, he saw the clouds darken. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh crap...\" he said. Paddling, he tried to turn the boat around, but already the waves and the wind was getting too strong. Ramone pulled out oarlocks and clipped them to the side of his canoe and then put in the other oar and tried to row back to land, but the waves were now far too powerful! Now it started to rain. Just a drizzle at first, but then a full, monsoonal downpour! In thirty seconds, Ramone was soaking wet! His canoe wasn't easily sunk or capsized however, so he kept on rowing. The skies grew darker until there wasn't any sunlight at all. It was getting really cold now, and Ramone was shivering. This was crazy! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHUNK! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA huge wave hit the side of the canoe and Ramone was thrown off-balance, he hit the side of his boat and groaned. That freakin' hurt! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhunk! Whunk! More waves started pounding his canoe. Then, an especially large one gave the boat a full broadside, slamming into the canoe with the force of a speeding car! Ramone was thrown back! His head slammed into the side of the canoe and everything went black... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- --- --- --- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uuuuugggh....Eeeugh!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRamone groaned. Where was he!? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhereever he was, he was lying on sand. Bright sunlight was shining down on him and he noticed his clothes were dry. His brown hair was messy and full of sand. He groaned and tried to scratch as much sand out of his hair as he could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you're awake!\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Ramone said. He looked hazily around, and then got up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HOLY JESUS!!\" he screamed. He'd turned around to see a collossal figure TOWERING over him, big enough to block out the sun!...or so it seemed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you!?\" Ramone screamed. </span></div></div>",

He barely came up to the kid's waist.  The kid had tree trunk-sized leg muscles, with calves that had to be around 40\" in circumference.  Jake's shoulders were incredibly wide, casting a huge shadow on the much smaller man below. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake's arms were nearly 45\" around, it seemed.  His traps flared outward and halfway down his back, giving the boy an incredibly intimidating appearance.  If it weren't for the sweet, innocent face perched atop the massive body, Ramone would have taken off in the opposite direction, fearing for his life.  Not that he would have gotten very far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to you?\" the child asked, pointing to the wrecked canoe that had washed on shore.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, rough winds, strong waves.  Mother nature can be mean sometimes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Jake replied.  \"Are you hungry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Ramone replied.  \"I can always eat.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, follow me.\"  And with that, Jake bent down and lifted Ramone off the ground again.  He placed him over one massive shoulder head, holding him by the legs to keep him in place.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, hey!\"  Ramone protested, as the boy started walking.  \"I can walk, you know.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay.  I don't mind.\"  Ramone tried on a few occasions to pry his body loose, but every time he would struggle, Jake would just apply a bit more pressure to keep him in place.  Ramone eventually just gave up.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Jake arrived at his home.  He set Ramone down again and the smaller man stumbled back a few steps.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be right back,\" the giant kid said, as he walked toward the kitchen area, his footsteps booming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to get out of here,\" Ramone thought to himself, as he quietly made his way towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, just as he began to open it, he felt a large hand grab him by the shoulder.</span></div></div>",

The small man barely came up to Bob's knees.  He also had the same musculature and build as his son, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what brings you here?\" the kindly man asked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jake saw me wash up on the beach, so he brought me here, I guess.\"  Ramone looked around the house.  Everything was exactly what one would expect in a modern suburban house.  Except that everything was at least three times the normal size.  The walls themselves rose nearly 50 feet in the air.  Chairs could seat five people of Ramone's size.  The TV looked like a movie screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's Jake,\" the man replied.  \"Always trying to help people out.\"  The giant man walked back to his chair and sat down, picking up the newspaper he was reading before.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is it, Bob?\" a feminine voice called out from the kitchen.  A few seconds later, a woman's frame nearly filled the kitchen doorway.  It was apparently Jake's mother.  She was as large and as muscular as both Jake and Bob.  Her shoulders and arms were phenomenal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I see Jake has a guest.  Just make yourself comfortable\"  She smiled sweetly and went back into the kitchen.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where the hell am I?\" Ramone asked himself.  \"It's like these people are the living embodiment of The Incredible Hulk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake then reappeared from the kitchen, a big smile on his face.  He was carrying a few sandwiches in one hand.  \"Come on.  I want to show you my room.\"  Without warning, he bent down and slung the tiny man over his massive shoulder again, practically skipping away as he walked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe entered his bedroom and dropped Ramone down on his bed.  Ramone bounced up and down a few times before coming to a stop.  \"Jake, why do you do that?  I can walk, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because it's fun.\" the child smiled down at him.   He handed Ramone a sandwich.  The man reluctantly took it and bit into it.  It had been hours since he had last eaten.  He was starving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRamone looked around Jake's room.  His bed must have been around 15 feet in length.  His toys lying on the floor were nearly as big as he was, and a few surpassed him in height.  Everything was gigantic.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what did you want to show me?\" the man said, taking another bite from his sandwich. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, really.  I just wanted to spend some time with you.  You want to play?\"  Ramone nodded his head.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd over the next hour or so, the two played.  First with a few action figures, then hide and seek.  The man had to admit, it was fun playng with this child, despite his hulking size.  Still, at every opportunity he got, Ramone looked for a way to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jake!  Dinner!\"  his mother yelled.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm busy playing with Ramone!\"  the child responded.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No!\"  Ramone said quickly, grabbing Jake by the hand.  \"I'm actually getting hungry again.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake shrugged, looking down at him.  \"Okay, then.\"  He then picked Ramone up once more, depositing him only when he got to the dinner table.  There was even a detour to the bathroom, where Jake went to relieve himself.  All the while, Ramone dangled over Jake's back, shifting a few times when he got uncomfortable.  In the back of his mind, Ramone thought the child was doing this to somehow impress him or something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was nighttime.  Jake and Ramone had been in the child's bedroom for the past two hours, the only breaks coming when one of them had to go to the bathroom.  Ramone was propped up against the wall, fighting to stay awake.  They had been playing ever since dinner was over.  The man was exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, then,\" Jake said, finishing up a story.  \"The man at the store laughed so hard when dad fell down, he peed his pants!\"  Jake laughed a boisterous laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRamone, eyes half-open, gave a complimentary smile.  \"Jake?\" he asked.  \"Can we please go to bed?  I'm exhausted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake sighed, picking his new friend up and depositing him on the bed once more.  The child got dressed in his pajamas.  When he turned around, Ramone was already asleep.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe child climbed into bed, being careful not to hurt Ramone.  In a few minutes, Jake himself was asleep, too.</span></div></div>",

(It was about a five foot drop.)  He opened the door and made his way towards the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe living room was shrouded in darkness, the only light coming from a lamp in the other room.  Ramone made his way to the front door, making sure no one was watching him.    He jumped up, grabbing hold of the knob.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Going somewhere?\" the mother asked from behind.

Yeah, I know.\"  The mother smiled.  \"Come here,\" she offered, patting the cushion next to her.  Ramone made his way over to the couch, climbing the massive piece of furniture.

Scary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's there to be scared of?  We're humans, just like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you're gigantic,\" Ramone replied.  \"I mean, to me, you're like 25 or 30 feet tall.  I come up to the waist on Jake, but  that's hardly any consolation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two sat in silence for a moment.  \"How did you get so big?\" the man asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There was this spring here on the island,\" the mother began.  \"We had been stranded here when our cruise ship had been overrun by pirates and the three of us snuck off on a life raft.  One day, we come across this spring.  So, we all take a drink, because, at that point, we're parched, you know?  It had been a few days since he had had an clean water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, we each take a cup and drink from the spring.  And when we wake up the next morning, we're...this big.\"  She motions up and down her body with her hand.  \"And we just decided to make this place our home, since if we were ever able to return to America, we'd be locked up by the government and/or used in experiments.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to the spring?\" Ramone asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bob went back the next day and destroyed it.  He said the water had too much power in it and that if it ever fell into the wrong hands, say, a group of terrorists, or a shipload of pirates, they would be unstoppable.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRamone shook his head.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, you're kind of cute,\" the mother said, looking down at him, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I know you think Jake is this big chore or whatever,\" Margaret said, changing the subject.  \"But believe me, he's worth the trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the two could hear thudding footsteps coming down the hallway.  \"Mom?\" Jake asked, standing in the doorway.  \"Have you seen Ramone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down at the man sitting next to her, his eyes going wide.  \"No, dear,\" she replied.  \"Maybe he's sleeping somewhere else.  We'll look for him in the morning.  Okay, sweetie?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe child nodded his head and returned to his room.  Ramone looked up at Margaret and mouthed the words \"Thank you.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled, looking down at him.  \"Sometimes, we all need a break from Jake.\"  She stood up.  \"Well, I'm going to bed.  You want to sleep here tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, please,\" Ramone replied, glancing back towards Jake's bedroom.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mother brought in a blanket and an extra pillow.  Ramone laid down, watching as Margaret turned and walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Ramone woke up to see __________'s face staring back at him.</span></div></div>",

He put a hand over his face, to block the sun out for a few more minutes.  As time passed, he could feel a presence watching him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened his eyes to find Jake's giant head staring down at him.  \"Morning, Ramone,\" he said, smiling.  \"Ready for breakfast?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only if you don't carry me this time,\" he replied, a slight grin on his tired face.  Ramone sat up on the couch, as he  tried to get as awake as possible before putting his feet on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked into the kitchen, Jake following close behind.  He sat down and looked at what was being served.  Breakfast consisted of a few dozen fish, some fruit picked from somewhere on the island, and a loaf of bread, made from scratch.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter everyone had eaten, Jake practically dragged Ramone outside, anxious to play with his new friend.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Jake,\" the man protested.  \"Can't I go back to bed for a few more hours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" the child responded, not slowing down.  \"It's a beautiful day; we're going to play today.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey stopped roughly in the middle of the island.  \"So, what do you want to play?\" Jake asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRamone thought for a moment, an idea forming.  \"What about hide and seek?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay!\" the kid said cheerily.  \"You go hide.\"  Jake then turned around and covered his eyes, as he began counting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRamone ran off, hiding behind a cluster of large trees.  He didn't really care if he was found or not; he only cared about being \"it\" in a few minutes so  he could try to make it to his canoe and hopefully escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One-hundred!\"  he heard Jake call out.  \"Ready or not, here I come!\"  Ramone could feel the tremors being set off with Jake's every step.  As time passed, he could feel the tremors becoming louder and the ground shaking more and more as the child approached.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOff in the distance, Jake could see Ramone's head sticking out from behind the trees.  He rushed over, bending a few of the trees over with his bare hands.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Found you!\"  Jake said triumphantly.  \"Okay, your turn.\" Jake turned and ran off, as Ramone started counting.  As soon as Jake was out of sight, Ramone started heading towards the shore, in the hopes that his boat was salvageable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalfway there, however, he could hear a rustling in the foliage on either side of him.  He stopped, waiting for whatever it was to show itself, but it never showed.  Ramone continued walking, and the sound returned, along with a low growl from whatever was following him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRamone started getting nervous, looking side to side, in hopes of seeing whichever creature had thoughts of making him into breakfast.  Suddenly, it emerged:  a pack of hyenas, three in all, circling slowly around him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey bared their teeth, ready to lunge.  Ramone picked up a piece of wood of some kind off the ground, ready to defend himself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the creatures lunged at him and Ramone caught the animals teeth on the piece of wood.  The hyena bit down hard, trying to shake the wood from the prey's hands, but it was no use; he let go and walked back over to his pack, ready to strike again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, all three hyenas lunged into the air and Ramone knew he had no way of defending against all of them.  He closed his eyes, ready to accept his fate.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Jake appears from behind a large tree.  He shoves Ramone out of the way, as the hyenas latch onto him.  Their bites cause nothing more than superficial wounds however and the massive child easily plucks them from his body, like someone removing leeches after swimming in leech-infested waters.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake removes the animals and tosses them safely, but forcefully enough, into the brush ahead of him.  All three slink back into the darkness of the jungle-like island, defeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRamone walks over to his giant protector.  \"Thank you,\" he says.  \"Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Flesh wounds,\" the child responds simply, inspecting himself.  \"I'll be okay.\"  He takes a deep breath.  \"We should head back home.\" </span></div></div>",

The sight of having a 10 foot child angry at him had the teen a little afraid.  \"Yeah, that's what I thought.\"  He began walking away again, leaving Ramone behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least let me explain!\"  he said, running up to Jake again.  The boy stopped, turning around, folding his massive arms in front of his chest.  He glared down at Ramone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Ramone said.  \"I know you're mad at me.  But, you have to understand, I have a family and friends where I'm from.  I even have a girlfriend.  Those people probably miss me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you couldn't just ask me to help you?

Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just leave me alone,\" Jake said, storming off.  \"I don't care if you leave now.  I really don't.  If you DO go back to my house, tell mom I'll be back in a few hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jake wait a minute,\" Ramone said, running up to him once more.  \"Just tell me what--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I SAID LEAVE ME ALONE!'!\"  Jake turns around and shoves Ramone, sending him flying into the air, landing about 50 yards away on the shore.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There!\" the child yelled at him, pointing a little to Ramone's right.  \"There's your stupid boat!  Now go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRamone groaned as he looked and saw his canoe lying in the sand a little ways from him.  He then saw Jake run and leap into the air, arching high in the sky, before hurdling back to the earth a few miles away.  Ramone felt the rumble caused by the giant child when he landed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked over to his canoe to inspect it, his chest sore where he had been shoved, a large welt forming, along with a bruise.  Ramone winced as he bent down to look at the damage.  Even if he wanted to try to get away, he still had to repair the large hole in the side of his boat.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started walking, clutching his chest as he walked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis destination:</span></div></div>",

No one was around, so he quietly opened the door and started walking towards the shore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the darkness outside, Ramone was finding it difficult to make it to the other end of the island.  He stumbled, tripping over tree stumps and falling into small ditches as he made it to his canoe.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he approached the shore, the moonlight shining off the surface of the island, his eyes finally adjusted.  Ramone started to inspect his canoe, when he heard a low growl coming from the shadows.  He turned around, the green eyes of a pair of animals shining off the moonlight.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRamone worked more quickly, trying to lift his boat off the sand it was embedded in.  The animals walked slowly toward him, their sleek bodies sizing up their prey.  They were panthers.  They hissed and Ramone started shaking.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe animals advanced on him and Ramone took off in the opposite direction, running for his life.  He made his way through the island, the leaves from low-lying trees whipping him in the face as he ran.  He saw a tree that he could easily climb. roughly 30 feet tall, and began climbing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was about halfway up the tree, when he looked down, to see the panthers jumping futilely up at him.  They stalked the bottom of the tree, waiting patiently for Ramone to stumble.  However, once he made it to the top, he situated himself comfortably in a tree branch, his back resting against the body of the tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down to see the panthers, curling up next to the tree, drifting off to sleep, making escape, at least for tonight, impossible.  He was stranded in the middle of the island.  Probably a few miles away from Jake and his family.  Escape, at least for tonight, was impossible.  Ramone eventually drifted off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***********************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRamone was awakened by a series of rumblings off in the distance.  \"Ramone!\" a voice called out, \"Ramone!  Can you hear me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man, looked over his shoulder, to see both Jake and his mother looking for him, their hulking frames being silhouetted by the morning sunrise.  The rumblings Ramone heard were the giant's footsteps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ramone, where are you?\" the mother yelled out.  The two were making their way slowly towards him.  Ramone looked down to see the panthers had run off, probably scared by the giants footsteps.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to move slowly down the tree, but with the tremors caused by Jake and Margaret's footsteps, he had a hard time getting a grip.  Suddenly, his foot slipped <br>\r\nand Ramone grasped for the closest branch he could get ahold of.  Thankfully, he grabbed it in time, but it also caught the attention of Jake's mother.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tree shook and a few leaves fell to the ground, not to mention a flock of birds flew away, all thanks to Ramone.  \"Shit!\" he muttered under his breath, as he tried to climb back onto the branch.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe succeeded, but not before a pair of eyes were staring at him.  The hulking frame of whoever it was obviously knew Ramone was hiding in the tree.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was it?</span></div></div>",

Okay, I was trying to escape.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Jake asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you're a little intimidating.  I'm afraid of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not going to hurt you,\" Jake replies.  \"Now come on, let's eat.\"  He guides Ramone over to the large table he had in the middle of the room.  Ramone sits down in one of the chairs.  His feet barely reach the edge of the seat, the chair is so large.  Jake puts some food in a plate and hands it to Ramone.  He does the same for himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, why did you really try to run?\" Jake asked, taking a bite of his food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it wouldn't be the first time somebody ran away from me,\" the boy explains.  \"Eventually, everyone succeeds in getting away from me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happens to the people that do?\" Ramone asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Half of them are killed by the wild animals that roam this island.  They usually leave at night, so I can't stop them.  A few days later, I find their bodies.  Or what's left of them, anyway.\"  Ramone gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And for the few that DO successfully escape, well, I guess they find their way home or crashed on another island or something.  I don't really care.\"   Jake took another bite of food, obviously irritated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you so big?\" Ramone asked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the water here,\" the boy explained.  \"When me and my family first arrived here, I drank a little bit of it and over the next month or so, I grew into my current size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did your parents have any of the water?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Jake replied.  \"But my dad later found out, that it only affects people that haven't gone through puberty yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are your parents?\" Ramone asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake paused.  \"They're dead.  We had been here for a few months and we had all gone to sleep for the night.  Then, my dad hears a noise outside and he goes to find out what it is.  Suddenly, one of the animals tackles him to the ground and starts attacking him.  By the time I got outside, he was dead.  My mom died of food poisoning a few months after that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was two years ago,\" Jake replies.  \"It's okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've been here alone for the past two years?!\" Ramone says in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I've had a few pets here on the island, but that's about it.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two sat in silence for a few minutes, eating their food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry I tried to run,\" Ramone apologized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry I picked you up earlier,\" Jake followed.  \"It's just been so long since I've seen another human.  I was just excited.  I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRamone looked around the house he was in.  It looked pretty good, considering it was handmade.  It was roughly made like a log cabin, with Jake probably ripping the trees out of the ground with his bare hands and his dad, at the time, keeping the trees together with...mud, or something.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were various pieces of furniture around the house:  a couch in the corner, a few chairs dotting the room.  A few tables.  Obviously, there wasn't a TV or a computer, but all in all, it wasn't half bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was nighttime.  The food had long been eaten and Jake and Ramone had whittled the past few hours away by talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ready for bed?\" Jake asked.  Ramone nodded.  Jake led his guest back into the sleeping quarters.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, there is a guest bedroom here,\" the child said, pointing to one room.  \"But, well...would you mind sleeping in my bed for tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRamone smiled.  \"Sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The kid's just lonely,\" Ramone thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two walked into Jake's room and laid down on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night,\" Jake said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night,\" Ramone replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Ramone do during the night?\"</span></div></div>",

Jake had already left the room by the time Ramone rolled over, leaving him alone in the bedroom.  He rubbed his eyes for a moment, then got up and walked into the kitchen.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he got there, Jake already had the food out.  There was a big pile of fish on one plate, a pile of fruit on another and something that looked like bread in another plate. Also, there was a pitcher of what appeared to be freshly squeezed orange juice on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ramone sat down, Jake grabbed a big handful of fish and popped them into his mouth.  The teen was handed a plate and grabbed a few fish, chewing small bites.  He watched as Jake reached for the fruit, taking about half  of the pile and ate them in one gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how did you get this food, Jake?\" Ramone asked, taking another bite of his food.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hunt for fish every morning, plus I have a garden not far from here, where I grow the fruit.\"  He poured some of the OJ out into a large glass and took a few sips, as he reached for the bread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And sometimes, I'll hunt for an animal, but it takes a lot of them to satisfy me.  Plus, there are more fish around here than wild animals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRamone nodded, as he reached for the fruit and bread.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With a body this big, it takes a lot of food to keep me full,\" Jake added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know,\" the teen said.  \"This is probably all that I can eat, so you can have the rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thanks,\" the child replied, as he grabbed the fish plate and stuffed the rest into his mouth.  He followed that by finishing off the fruit, then eating the rest of the bread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRamone watched the young boy eat his food in amazement.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, do we have any plans for today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Jake replied, swallowing the food in his mouth.  \"I have to pull up more fruit and maybe catch a few animals for lunch.  I could show you around the island, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'd be nice,\" Ramone replied, finishing off his breakfast.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ready to go?\" the young boy asked, standing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do they do?</span></div></div>",

I'm getting hungry again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey continued walking, trying to make it to the shore, so they could fish, when they both saw leaves rustling up ahead.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay here,\" Jake said, placing a huge arm across Ramone's body.  \"I'd better take care of this.\"  The child walked quietly towards the noise, ready to fight, if necessary.  He pulled back a few tree branches, to find a few hyenas.  They had been following the two for the past 15 minutes, just waiting for the perfect opportunity to strike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were three of them, all of them baring their teeth at Jake.  The animals leapt into the air, each one of them latching onto the boy.  One bit into Jake's upper thigh, another his midsection and the final one, bit down hard on his forearm.  Ramone just stood there, watching the fight take place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake took his massive thumb and forefinger and grabbed the one hyena that was latched onto his forearm, squeezing his neck in one swift motion, killing him.  He broke the animal's neck, his lifeless body falling helplessly to the ground.  He did the same to the other two hyenas, pulling them off of his body first.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe child looked down at the creatures that laid at his feet.  He picked one of them up, observing it.  \"Want some?\" he offered to Ramone, extending his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I want some?!\" the teen replied.  \"Jake, you're not going to eat that animal raw, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've done it before.  I do whatever I have to do to survive.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, go ahead.\"  Ramone watched over the next several minutes, as the child ate every carcass, stripping all the meat off the bones before moving on to the next one.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn less than five minutes he was done, wiping the excess blood from his chin.  He grabbed a handful of fruit from a tree overhead, tossing the items into his mouth, to wash it all down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'm ready,\" Jake said afterward, walking back over to Ramone.  The teen stared up at the child, amazed that someone could go through three dead hyenas that fast, but also a little bit disgusted that he had eaten them raw in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Jake asked, noticing the look on Ramone's face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-nothing,\" he replied, trying to shake the image he had just seen from his mind.  \"Just forget it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, then.  I guess it's on to the shore to do some fishing.\"  He grabbed the fishing nets from the ground and slung them back over his shoulder again, as the two started walking once more.</span></div></div>",

The windows had curtains made of the finest silk hanging from them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLargo approached the royal court.  \"I wish to speak with the Prince, please,\" he said to the guard at the door.

Grabbing him by the waist, Largo brought Ramone up to his face.  \"Yeah.  I believe you'll make a fine toy for my brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please,\" Ramone pleaded.  \"I'm not a toy; I'm a human being.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure look like one,\" Largo responded.  \"Plus, you weigh about the same as one of my brother's toys.\"  He paused a moment, contemplating.  \"Yep.  It' official:  You're gonna be a toy.\"  He gripped Ramone a little tighter as he started walking towards his home, his basketful of fish easily held against his hip as he walked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRamone watched as they approached Largo's house.  Actually, after looking around, it was more of a burgeoning community.  Averaged-sized homes dotted the area, with every other home lined with a white-picket fence.  Various animals, each giant to little Ramone, sat or played in their respective yards, as children as large, if not larger, than Largo, played baseball in the middle of the street.  There were no adults that Ramone could see, only giant, muscular children playing or reading a book or doing something else to occupy their time.  It was just like \"Lord of the Flies.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...You know, if the characters in \"Lord of the Flies\" had the resources to develop their own functional cul-de-sec neighborhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we are,\" Largo said, as he opened the front door of his house.  He walked in the kitchen and placed the fish on the counter.  \"Tommy!  I got somthing for you!\"  Largo yelled to his brother upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds later, Ramone could hear a loud rumbling coming from one of the rooms upstairs.  Someone was running down the stairs, everything in the house seeming to shake as he ran.  Soon, a figure emerged, walking up to Largo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, what is it,Largo?\" the younger child asked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found this lying on the shore.\"  He extended his hand and Ramone looked up at the boy.  He had to be around 13 or so.  He was roughly the same size as Largo, give or take five feet or so.  Well, five feet to Ramone, just a couple of inches to the two boys.  He was wearing a Gap t-shirt, the fabric stretched to its limit.  The shirt hid the wide and dense musculature of the kid's shoulders.  His chest jutted outward, hiding a pair of pectorals that would put any professional bodybuilder to shame.  His arms were massive, though, thanks to the shirt, only a small portion was visible.  Still, thick forearm muscles, roughly the same size as Lee Priest's, snaked up to his wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool!\"  the boy said, plucking the small teen from his older brother.  \"Who is he?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just some guy who washed up on shore today, I guess.  I decided you can have him.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy smiled, as he walked back to his room, looking down at his new toy, smiling.  \"You and me are going to have o much fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRamone froze in fear, not knowing what was in store for him.</span></div></div>",

It rose about 25 feet into the air, to Ramone anyway, glistening like an orange, transparent dollhouse.  \"I guess hamsters here are as big as horses,\" Ramone mused to himself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, here you go,\" the kid said, motioning for Ramone to go inside.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, can I stay out for a while?\" the man asked.  \"I have a little problem with enclosed spaces.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, okay,\" Tommy said, putting the hamster cage back on the floor.  \"I didn't want you to go to sleep yet, anyway.\"  He picked Ramone up and walked over to his computer desk.  He sat down, turning the computer on.  Ramone watched as the Microsoft logo came on, followed by the chime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kid then went to a half dozen websites in the next half-hour, while Ramone sat patiently on the desk, next to the mouse pad.  \"You wanna check your e-mail?\" Tommy asked.  \"I'm going to go to a friend's house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Ramone answered, walking over to the computer.

The smaller guy, still dizzy, wobbled and would've fallen down, if a huge hand hadn't quickly seized his shoulder to keep him standing. \"Ahem, sorry.\" said Largo, while putting down his basket. \"I should've realized that carrying you could be a bit uncomfortable to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-Don't worry.\" replied Ramone, who felt that the giant was actually symphatetic.... Besides, he didn't want to get on his colossal host's bad side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small dude looked around. The room had not a lot of furniture, just a table, a bench and a cupboard, all made of wood of course; there was a stone fireplace and a ladder leading to the upper floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a nice house.\" Ramone said. \"Do you live here alone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Largo nodded with a sad tone. \"My parents both died two years ago...

Largo asked: \"Do you have any experience at cleaning fish?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRamone nodded. \"Sure, I use to fish a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\" the giant said, and placed two bowls on the floor, beside the basket. \"Put the cleaned stuff in the bowl on the right, and the rubbish in the left one.\" he said in a calm yet commanding voice, that made Ramone feel REALLY tiny and helpless for a moment. But then, the fisher teen smiled, adding: \"While you work, I'll prepare lunch. I hope you like vegetable soup.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting cross-legged beside the basket and the bowls, Ramone said: \"It's perfectly fine. Thanks, Largo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLargo smiled, and went to the cupboard to pick up some vegetables.</span></div></div>",

This benevolent boy takes the lost person to his home, and decides to take care of him from that point forward. Escape becomes impossible, although the protagonist does try it. After all, he is on an island, in the desert, on a planet or in the jungle. But the boys are too big, too fast, and too strong. Also, the protagonist might get in trouble, or get attacked by other creatures, and then the muscle boys will come to his rescue... again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe protagonist may be another teen or an adult. The giant muscle boys are always bigger and stronger than the protagonist, but they don't necessarily need to be older. In fact, it would be fun if most of the giant boys were younger. That way, the protagonist could end up becoming an instructor and a teacher further in the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant boys can be farmers, hunters, or fishermen. They may or may not have parents living with them. The point is, they are all bigger and stronger than the protagonist. The protagonist may become a servant or assistant to the boy, who has rescued him at first. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens to the person, when he is found by a group or tribe of giant muscle boys? How does he fit in? How will he adopt? How will he be treated? What happens, when he tries to escape? Usually, the protagonist will grow very close to one muscle boy in particular, and it would be fun to see that friendship grow between a normal-sized human being and a giant 12ft muscle boy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStory Rules and Requirement:<br>\r\nNO one-line chapters... they will get deleted right away!<br>\r\nNO sex between minors.<br>\r\nGP's awarded for chapters of 500 words or longer which follow the story arc and are well written.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</td>",
