Down in the town a few people would occassionally look nervously towards where her cave was wondering if she was watching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl sighed and went to get a drink of water from the berral that she had filled with rain water. Rain water was the only water source she could trust, several times the town had tried to kill her by posioning a nearby lake and stream. The girl's claws clicked as she walked across the cave and she dipped her clawed hands into the water to scoop out some to drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl looked at her reflection in the water and sighed looking at the black scales that coated her entire body. She looked at her face that was almost human aside from the fact  it was unusually long, had two small horns poking out of her long white hair. and coated with scales. Looking at her reflection mad her frill-like ears droop and made her draconic eyes fill with sadness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe splashed the water with the back of her clawed hand to disrupt her reflection and wrapped her wings and tail around herself as she cried. She didn't know why the town hated and feared her, she had never hurt anyone in anything other than self defense. She had tried walking into the town once but people had run from her screeming and men wearing blue uniforms had shot things at her that had hurt her a lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had tried stealing clothes to see if that made them more comfertable around her but they still just ran from her. The girl sighed and walked out of her cave to go hunt, she still needed to eat, despite the risk of people constantly trying to attack her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she wondered carefully through the forest she soon came upon...</span></div></div>",

She chased after them and managed to catch four of them after a short chase and she smiled knowing that she wasn't going to starve at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flinched as she heard something moving towards her through the woods and saw a human boy climbing up the hill. She quickly hid behind a tree and peaked at the boy from around it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy didn't seem to have noticed her as she watched him he continued forward stumbling over almost everything in front of him. He was holding a white cane which he kept tapping the ground in front of him with it before he'd take a step. The girl had never seen anything like this before and found it somewhat comic and chuckled softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's there?\" the boy shouted his head turning to look right at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl shrieked and started to run when she heard the boy shout again, \"Wait please don't go! I'm lost and can't find my way home!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon girl stopped and blinked turning back to look at the boy who seemed to be chasing after her the best he could. She was confused and asked, \"You aren't afraid of me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" the boy said still staggering forward, \"Why should I be? You probably could have killed me by now if you felt like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your right I mean you no harm,\" the girl said before saying sadly, \"It's just that everyone else has run from me as soon as they saw me, your the first not to have run or attacked me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that might be in part because I can't see you,\" the boy said now just a feet from the girl, \"I have no idea how anything looks unless I feel it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon girl took a step away from the boy as he reached out to her and said, \"Please don't touch me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" the boy asked sounding confused, \"Are you a leper?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so,\" the dragon girl said, \"I don't know what a leper is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why don't you want me touching you?\" the boy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because if you have any idea how I look you might run from me just like all the others do,\" the dragon girl said sobbing a bit, \"You're the only one so far who hasn't run from me and I'd like it to stay like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you at least lead me back to the town so I can go home?\" the boy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon girl debated for a bit before saying, \"...</span></div></div>",

She thought about taking his body to town so that his family would know what had happened to him, but dismissed the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she took Brandon's body to town they would think that she had killed him, which she had but not meant to. But the town would think she had done so on perpous and would never see her as anything but a monster and might even begin to truily hunt her. So she sadly used her tail to push the dirt over Brandon's body as it started to rain just as she had predicted it would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a large rock from nearby and forced it into the ground at the head of Brandon's grave and used her claws to write out, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                                          Brandon<br>\r\n                                                 The Closest Thing to <br>\r\n                                                  a Friend I Ever Had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                                May he Rest in Peace <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara sobbed over the grave as she continued to whisper, \"Brandon, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara got up and began to walk back to her cave as the storm began to get worse and worse and soon got so bad that she would have been hopelessly lost if she didn't know the hill like she did her claws.

She looked at her claws making deep rends in the smooth surface, scarring it permanently. Was that all they were good for? Bringing destruction to the land around her, and killing even when unintended. She climbed on, and the storm raged around her, threatening to throw her off the rock at any moment. She shivered as the cold rain hit her scales. They were strong, and protected her, but they were as cold as the rocks beneath her. Sara wished that instead, she could be a human, wrapped in warm clothing fit for such weather, but she knew she would never get her wish. She was doomed to remain as she was for her whole life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she reached the cliff top, where the outlining of a dark cave could be seen. Quickly, Sara pulled herself up to the ledge and ran into the entrance. The rain no longer pounded on her back, but she still shivered in the cold. She uprooted a small tree using her strong arms, and used her fiery breath to set it aflame. she gathered herself into a small bundle and sat by the fire, warming herself, and thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fire was useful to warm herself, but it had also frightened Brendan away, and if the flames ever found their way to any of the wooden houses below... she could not bear to think of what would happen then. Was that really what her breath was meant for? She gathered herself closer to the fire, tears streaming in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a monster, just as the people told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing she could do, no love she might have had, and no gentleness in her personality had prevented her from killing the only human who had ever come anywhere near her. Her claws were stained with his blood not because of her choice, but simply because of who she was. She knew why people ran from her now. If anyone ever decided to become her friend, they would always be in danger. if they let her into the town, even one mistake could set the entire village aflame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a beast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer claws could do nothing but destroy. her fire could do nothing but destroy. Is that all she was? just a symbol of pain and destruction?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara knew what she had to do. Tears streamed down her face as she looked into the swaying tongues of fire. She had to do something. She was a monster, and she must help the people in the village by doing the one thing that she could do to help them.</span></div></div>",
