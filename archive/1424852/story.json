Pok\u00e9mon, the majority, tend to know not their location, (i.e., Kanto, Any towns, reservations), but they do know what it <i>feels</i> like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are many places that Lucario reside. Where would this Lucario be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\">Will this Lucario's adventure take place in the cold, hardcore mountains? Where it snows nearly every day yet the landscape is gorgeous? A Lucario could find many dangers in this tundra. One could find Ice types, Water types, and Dragon types, these three are the dominant types in these tough, tough hills. A fire or shelter can make the cold melt away.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">Or will our Lucario travel in the forest? The place of greenery, the bunches of trees, and ever growing grasses? Here one could find Bug types, Grass types, and Poison types, which are the most common residents. This place is so insanely large anyone can get lost, but a smart Lucario will always look about for landmarks.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">Maybe our hero got lost in a cave? They may try to get out, but our solo survivor will surely find trouble. In these deep, dark tunnels are Ground types, Rock types, and Dark types that will normally stop at nothing until they get their hands on this blue creature of ours. It would be quite useful to carry a torch or be bioluminescent... </span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">What if our protagonist was in the flower plains? With such a vast, pretty, flat landscape how could anything go wrong? Typically Psychic types, Fairy types, and Electric types hang out here. Finding a small hill to relax on and doze off can get rid of all your fears! All these flowers make amazing scenery!</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrey\">Ever since the tyrannical humans disappeared, their large cities were left abandoned, strewn about all over the world. No one knows what happened. Frankly, the wild Pok\u00e9mon could care less. In this certain city, the many miscellaneous Pok\u00e9mon left behind or abandoned here seemed to take after and live in the ruins of their mysteriously missing human friends. Here you'll find Fighting types, Fire types, and Steel types as the most frequent locals, since others went to join better suited places, but who knows? It seems that all Pok\u00e9mon can be found here. It would be smart to have a friend to watch your back, as here these Pok\u00e9mon tend to group up in their old teams, or form new and stronger ones.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne common trait our hero will find is that, no matter where they are, they'll always find Flying types, Normal types, and Ghost types strewn about randomly. Maybe, just maybe, our Lucario will stumble across a Legendary Pok\u00e9mon, which can also be found in their respective places. It's not impossible to find any type anywhere, but it's very, very hard. If, our protagonist happens to move about to different places, then so be it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Everything is attached to the Forest, and to avoid too many choices, let's just say that this Lucario is male to go along with FT2k4's preference/guidelines. :)    )<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere will this Lucario's journey start?</span></div></div>",

The fighter base was much larger than the previous tournament, with many newcomers that stretched as far as the eye could see. One such newcomer was a blue and yellow canine-looking Pokemon with bright red eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario studied the crowd, using his aura to read the minds of ones he found interesting. The original roster only called for 35 competitors, but those waiting to get in for a long time protested and the tournament was opened for all. The possibilities for matches were endless, so Lucario took his time, studying each and every competitor for their strengths and weaknesses. A thing he took notice was that many were thinking of food, and a few had even been glancing around at various competitors and thought to themselves if they'd make a good meal or not. This excited the aura Pokemon, making sure to stay as close to these fighters as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario didn't know what he was, but to others, he was a vorarephile. He had strange thoughts and dreams about being devoured, some of which he found very exciting. He was a bit nervous when the thought of actually being eaten came into his head, but he knew deep down, he would not say no if someone offered to swallow him. And there were quite a few that were looking at him as if he was a roasted steak with all the fixings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose thoughts were pushed out of everyone's head as the announcer read off the names of who each fighter would be brawling with first.</span></div></div>",

Lucario tried to push the thoughts of becoming a bulge in Fox's belly and focused hard on what he had to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox looked up and down the skinny Pokemon and gave his chops a quick slurp. To observers, they would put it off as to Fox just preparing to battle, but to Fox and Lucario, he was licking his lips in hunger. &lt;You want to eat me don't you?&gt; Lucario's voice said in Fox's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox blinked and tilted his head at the Pokemon. &lt;I'm telepathic. Just think your response and I'll pick it up.&gt; He replied, causing Fox to nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;The thought has crossed my mind. There are other things I want to do to you too.&gt; Fox thought, giving his belly a pat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario smiled and took a fighting stance. &lt;How about this? If you get the Smash Ball, you can eat me. If you win, you can eat me. If I win, I'll let you eat me in private. How does that sound?&gt; Lucario said in Fox's mind, which surprised the vulpine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox chuckled and took his stance, wondering just what kind of Pokemon he was dealing with here. &lt;Alright, you strange thing. Sounds good to me. I'm not used to willing meals, but someone happy to become dinner is a nice change than someone I end up losing because they fight like hell to break free.&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario smiled and let his aura guide his attacks as the battle began, trying his best to dodge Fox's attacks, not having to worry about winning or losing, because either way, he was Fox chow.</span></div></div>",

The two met within the fighting arena and shook paws, Lucario congratulating Fox on his win and Fox commenting on what a good fighter Lucario was. The two bowed at each other and walked their separate ways before the next batch arrived to fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, Lucario sat outside the main hall of the Smash Resort where the fighters retired to after a day of fighting. The Pokemon checked around for Fox's aura and finally spotted him coming from the dining hall. Lucario hopped towards the dining area and met Fox there, who had just been snacking on some potato chips. &lt;Why are you eating those when you could be eating me?&gt; Lucario asked, pointing at the chips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox smirked and put the empty bag in the garbage bucket. \"You weren't around. Can't eat what's not here.\" He said, his nose twitching as he sniffed at the Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario smiled and wagged his short tail slowly. &lt;Well, I'm here now. If you're still hungry, I'm always up to feed you. You did beat me.&gt; He said, fighting the urge to rub Fox's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vulpine licked his lips and nodded. \"Alright, so let's do this!\"</span></div></div>",

I'm eating you feet first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario did as he was told and lay down on his back, sticking his feet high into the air. Fox grinned and licked over each pad slowly, working his tongue in between his black toes, causing the Pokemon to giggle as the tongue tickled his sensitive pads. Fox moaned and grabbed the Pokemon's ankles and pulled his feet together. Fox's tongue snaked up the pads one last time before his jaws opened wide and took both feet into his maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario watched with interested as Fox's cheeks bulged out with his feet, the tongue still licking between his toes and absorbing the flavor with his taste buds. Fox's lips slowly pressed over his ankles and began to work on his fluffy legs. &lt;You know, I always wondered if these were pants, or your legs&gt; Fox said mentally as his tongue tasted fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario blushed and wiggled his toes as he felt Fox's throat cushioning them. &lt;They're my legs. They're just very fluffy.&gt; Lucario replied, giving a little chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;Fluffy's always good&gt; Fox smirked, closing his eyes in bliss from the taste of Lucario's fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe aura Pokemon felt his legs becoming heavy as the fur soaked up Fox's saliva, watching Fox's jaws slowly snake down over his lower half, which began to appear as a bulge in Fox's neck. Lucario let out a soft purring noise as Fox swallowed him up, the Pokemon being dragged across the floor as Fox swallowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario felt Fox's teeth poking his rear and blushed softly, his fur being pulled towards Fox's nostrils as the vulpine sniffed his meal. &lt;You smell as good as you taste, Lucario.&gt; Fox said lovingly, enjoying his wonderful meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe blushed heavily and gave Fox's head a pat, moaning from the next swallow that brought his waist into Fox's jaws. &lt;Thank you.&gt; He replied, placing his arms at his sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox swallowed again and took Lucario's paws into his mouth. &lt;I thought those spikes would hurt.&gt; He said in his mind, Lucario grinning as more of him disappeared into McCloud's jaws. &lt;They're mostly to make me look tougher.&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox chuckled around his morsel and swallowed again, his nose poking Lucario's chest as his belly slowly slipped down his gullet. Fox looked up as Lucario kissed his forehead and lay back, letting the vulpine swallow him whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kiss took him by surprise, but he figured it was just Lucario showing his thanks to Fox for eating him. Fox gulped and his throat muscles pushed more of the tasty Pokemon down his gullet and towards his stomach. Fox opened his mouth more and Lucario's head came to rest on his tongue. The aura Pokemon took his final look outside Fox's jaws, his image framed with glistening teeth that slowly snapped together as Fox closed his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario gave Fox's throat a little hump from the site and felt the tongue push his head into his throat, now sealed within Fox's body. McCloud tilted his head up and swallowed hard, finishing his meal as his throat muscles pushed Lucario into his belly, both paws rubbing the series of bulges as they traveled down his neck. His paws came to rest on his now rounded stomach as Lucario slipped inside and was forced to curl up within the depths of Fox's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario purred as he felt Fox's paws rubbing his belly, stroking over the Pokemon from the outside. Lucario squirmed playfully, enjoying the comfortable embrace of Fox's stomach walls, slowly stroking over his thighs and over his sheath as Fox smacked his chops and let out a hearty belch. \"Mmmm...best meal I had in ages.\" Fox replied, giving his stomach a pat as he lay against the wall, lounging after his dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario blushed heavily and rubbed Fox's stomach walls. &lt;Thank you, sweet Fox. I love it in here, but I am wondering. What happens to me now?&gt;</span></div></div>",

(What's this?) he mentally asked. Fox sighed deeply in enjoyment. \"It's a reformation pill, good once, but guaranteed to let you regenerate upon digestion.\" Lucario smiled and swallowed the pill, relaxing more. (Thanks Fox.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Vulpine chuckled and rubbed his gut slowly. \"no problem Lucario.\" after some time, soft gurgles emanated from Fox's stomach walls, liquids slowly filled his stomach, the sizzle told Lucario it was Fox's acids, beginning the digestive process, he layed back and closed his eyes, wincing slightly and purrs. (This feels... Nice...)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox softly murred as he listened to his meal digest. \"You're welcome, see you in a bit, heh..\" With that, Fox relaxed more, letting his acids and stomach do all the work, a while later, Lucario was only mush in his stomach, being broken down, and Lucario soon slowly reformed sitting beside McCloud. (Well.. This was a nice experience, thanks.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox smiled at him \"No problem, anytime really.\" He leaned over and gave Lucario's cheek a lick, which caused him to blush, as he got up.

Real freaky but -I'm- not gonna cry.&gt; The dragon then grinned a sinister grin showing all his teeth and got in stance.<br>\r\nLucario chuckled softly and got into stace soon after. &lt;So here's how it works; If You win, You can eat me and if I win we'll go somewhere secret and fill that \"Other\" thought of yours.

Bowser imagined what it would feel like having Lucario just willingly slide into his craving gut, filling it up and adding to his belly, or as he called it, his 'trophy case'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was due to Bowser's fantasies that he suffered, for Lucario was too quick for the reptile, and swiftly jabbed and punched him until he was left disoriented and tired. His attacks were slow, but powerful. His blows would occasionally hit Lucario, sending him flying almost over the edge!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut down to each of the last life, Bowser's attacks proved to be too clumsy as he tripped in a mid-dash while Lucario delivered a brisk kick to Bowser, forcing him out of the arena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Lucario was declared the winner, the two shook paws, complimenting one another and Lucario headed into the break-room, where fighters stayed after fighting in recent matches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, the pokemon anthro heard the large heavy footsteps of the massive koopa, slightly shaking the ground beneath his weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario stood up from the cushioned bench he was meditating on, wagging his tail, his anticipated partner stumbled into the break-room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;You finally made it back!&gt; Lucario thought gratefully.

Lucario's ears folded back, but he still continued to smile.<br>\r\n&lt;Sorry about that.&gt; He leaned in and pecked a small kiss on the hardly visible bruise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser flushed a deep red, and he stuttered for the right words to say as Lucario stepped even closer to Bowser.

They set on a walk in the Poke` fields to discover new things, or maybe fox could hunt a bit, never know what that greedy vulpine might do! after a while of walking, they came across some small houses, about the hieght that would go up to Lucarios thiegh. Lucario stared at the house and looked in the window, inside he saw 2 Marill's eating at a dinning table, and a large Italian flag on the wall. Lucario smiled, and put his head up to Fox again. &lt;hardly even a snack, well for you...&gt; he thought to Fox as he patted him on the head. &lt;yeah, i know&gt; Fox thought smileling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Lucario looked further up to see a hole town of homes. Lucarios mouth droped wide in amazement. Then out of nowhere: \"ahem! ciao! large 'e urg, Bumbinos! what would you 'a be doin' in a place 'e like this!\" A Marill was just standing infront of Fox's toes. \"we come in peace, well, for now!\" Fox said honerly. \"well, eh', ok 'a then 'a. you want to 'a come in 'a and 'e, have 'a some Pasta napoli? It is very vegaterian, as we mighty Marills are!\" the Marill said with a glad smile on it's face. \"Hey, could you, maybe show us around this place?\" Lucario said looking left and right. \"well 'a sure! Our days of 'a life is 'e, quite simple!\" \"Do you have any entertainment around here?\" Fox said smileling again. \"why, 'a yes! but you might not fit in 'a if you where looking forward to it 'a!\" \"yeah, they would be preety scared!\" The vulpine said scratching his head whes honesty. \"no no no! I ment 'a you going in the dorr 'a! don't be afriad!\" Marill said smiling and shaking his little hands in comfort. then he called Lucario to bend over. \"put ya ear 'a near m mouth! OK 'a?\" Lucario bent down and listened. \"keep and eye on him, we've been attacked before by the same type of pokemon! oh and 'a, would he planning to wipe out an existance?\" Lucario thought, and then replyed: \"yeah, his mentioned that before.\" The marill took a step back and sweated a bit from being nervous. \"oh eh', ok then! that is it for the tour! please, eh', go go go! Vite`!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario turned around to start walking home just when. \"GURGLE\" Fox's stomach let out a huge rumble. \"oh, eh, sorry dude, excuse me!\" Fox said rubbing his tummy. every Marill came out of there house when they heard the sound. Lucario rolled his eyes and thought to Fox; &lt;well, just great! you just sent us into an attack! a VORE attack!&gt; &lt;sorry, i could'ent fight the urge to hold it in that long!&gt; Fox thought holding his belly up. The Marill went in his house and got out a doctor kit, and a wierd refrence book. the book had 5 sieries, it seemed to be a \"vore monitor\". the first was, \"a little hungry\" 2nd was, \"hungry\" 3rd, \"very hungry\" 4th, \"EXTREMLEY hungry\" and 5th was, \"over charted, STARVING ALERT!!!\". The Marill asked Fox to kneel down so he could listen to his stomach gurgle and sloosh. then he copyed the sound and looked for it in the book. he flicked through the pages, getting nervouser each one. until he reached the highest level of hunger. Then he cried, \"CODE 5!\" and then hopped of Fox's belly and said, \"hoho! thats a new record 'e! congratulations! be bacl in a second 'e!\" The Marill ran to a Bomb ware house. \"what do you think's happening?\" Lucario sked Vulpine, Fox shrugged, and rubbed his tummy again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the wear house, The Marill became very frieghtend and asked the bomb operator, \"have 'a we got any 'a necleur weapons 'a left 'e?\" \"No 'a, sorry 'a Boss 'a!\" Marill shrugged, and thought of what he should use as ammo.</span></div></div>",

The Marill shook the flag rapidly, and then hugged it. then he called all the other Marills out. \"here's a challenge, eat all of us, you get our currency. a large bag of, pure gold! think you can do it?\" \"I can do anything that evolves vore in it! just watch me!\" Fox said seriously. his stomach churned again, \"BLOORB!\" \"well, gotta start eating now, whos first? anyone?\" The Marills pushed forward one child Marill. The Marill leader, \"the one we have seen all this time\" saw this child and looked at him frieghtend, then he said. \"PIERRE!\" Pierre took a large breath like he was about to sing the song pierre. and, before the leader could stop him, he began. *I don't care! yes I don't care! ...* Fox didn't add on to the song because he was confused and didn't actually know what the song, 'pierre' was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Fox picked him up, and threw him into his mouth. \"But i didn't sing the chourusssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss!\" he said as he fell down Fox's throught. Everyone gasped, and sent the next Marill out for bait. Once again, there was no chewing, just a small swallow. By the time Fox ate 5 marills, you could see a small lump coming out of his belly. each Marill eaten was either a gasp, or a \"eww!\" at half way, there was a clear bump that stuck out off Fox, Lucario became disgusted like he had never been before. he loved to watch this stuff, but it was to much for him. Fox was now eating them like popcorn. Lucario bent over behind a tree, and let out a vomit. Fox stopped and turned around to Lucario, \"you ok mmmmmh?\" Fox said with a stuffed mouth. \"yeah, i'm... BLUEGH! fine.\" \"oh, ok then, sure?\" \"YES, just, just, just shut up! OK\" Lucario said hiding behind a tree. \"wow, what's up with him?\" Fox said scratching his head. \"oh, his just disgusted by you eating us. sad!\" Fox stopped and looked back at Lucario. he was holding his gut tight, coughing and splutering. Fox shrugged, and continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen there was one more left, \"the leader\" he said, \"well 'a done 'e! you wiped out our. 'sniffle' race. here's your gold 'e! Aravadetchi!\" The leader began walking back to his cabin when... \"where do you think your goin'?\" Lucario said standing on his tail. \"I, I, I, JUST SPARE ME!!! 'e please!\" Lucario smiled and picked him up, the frieghtend, 'and crying' Marill coverd it's eyes. Lucario held him just ontop of his wide - open mouth when... \"ha! thought I would eat you?\" Lucario said grinning still with his mouth open. \"you where... AGHHHH!\" The Marill said as he opened his eyes, and as Lucario lowered him into his mouth, and pulled him back up again. The marill held on to Lucario's hand, preventing falling in. then Lucario stared at him. and then did a bit of sign language: he pointed to the Marill, then to Fox who was licking his lips again, then showed him rubbing his belly. The Marill slapped it's forehead and crosed it's arms in ignorance. \"go on 'a, feed me to em'. i'm tough enough!\" Lucario nodded and once again, lowered and pulled him back up again in Fox's mouth. The Marill, 'not suprised this time' Bit Lucario's paw. causing Lucario to drop him in. The Marill fell down Fox's throught and landed ontop of all the other Marill's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox let out a very, hearty and very, loud burp. \"URPPPPP!\" \"oh that was a meal! BAD!\" Fox said gobsmacking his mouth. he rubbed his stomach as he felt all the Marill's squerm for comfort. \"i'm as fat as i was when i ate you, remember Lucario?\" Fox said grinning. \"why do you talk about these things. I'm outta vore from now on, what you did just then was horrible and disgusting! I can't belive you actually did it!\" Lucario said angrily waving his paws in the air. \"maybe there will be room for one more?\" Fox said licking his lips and rubbing his large bulging belly. \"yeah, obviously! you eat everyone you meet! hah!\" Fox moved closer to Lucario, \"you're not goin' to.. well, you are. what can i say. oh! i know! that was the empresion of ya mum! HAHAH!\" Lucario said smiling and laughing like he had said a joke.Fox grabbed Lucario's feet and pulled them into his jaw. \"well, it's what you get for bein' carcastic, right Fox?\" \"exacly, now, be my dessert, would you?\" \"sure!\" Lucario said happily becoming blush and wagging his small, tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nafter 5 minutes, Lucario was fully inside Fox, squerming and pushing the dead 'sophocated to death' Marill's. Lucario hugged the stomach walls, as fox cuddled himself. \"i haven't felt like this since i ate Joe!\" Fox said Rubbing his tummy. \"can you give me some entertainment, Fox?\" Lucario said looking at the sun from inside him, the stomach wall just glowed red. Fox began to do finger puppets, Lucario cheered. and smiled.</span></div></div>",

The grand hall featured several television displays, multiple staircases leading to a magnitude of doors, and a viewing area for the audience unable to find seats in the various stadiums to watch the fights live. It was a new tournament, and characters all across the Nintendoverse were bouncing around the hall, some were veteran fighters such as Mario an Samus, some were the newcomers from the latest \"Brawl\" tournament like Lucario himself and Wolf O'Donnell. Hundreds were lined up at the registration zone, hoping to get into what was being called the biggest tournament to date. The word \"Royal\" was plastered on the banners hanging from every wall. This fight was going to be huge!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pokemon had registered like other previous fighters months in advance and ignored the line up. As he walked past, a blue vixen excitedly walked away from the front of the line, Lucario could only assume she had just been accepted into their ranks. He watched for a little while and thought about congratulating her until she walked up to Fox McCloud. Lucario had a little beef with the vulpine, he was close to winning the tournament in Brawl, but Fox beat him with what he considered a cheap move when Fox was so close to defeat. His stomach growled louder at the sight of the vulpine, and Lucario was unsure if it was from the hunger or the anger, but he knew that if he faced Fox this year, things would be different. Lucario had been practicing a new ability with his trainer. Thanks to the help from his trainer's Sviper and Ekans, Lucario inherited the trait of being able to swallow opponents whole and alive, and Lucario was very much looking forward to devouring Fox and putting him in his place, but he couldn't eat him yet, he'd have to wait until he got onto the battlefield with Fox. He just hoped their match would be quick, or he might end up stuffing himself with other fighters by the time he got to Fox! He ignored them for now and continued on down the main hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA commotion had started around the area where battle rules and chosen fighting styles like multi-man melee and Metal Combat were chosen and Lucario's curiosity had gotten the best of him. There were new rule sets to the roster to go along with all the new faces! The standard tournament circuit was filling up fast, but everyone had a choice if they wanted to battle there, or try their hands at the Challenge Circuit. There was the multi-man melee as always, an extended \"Boss Battle\" mode, and a few new ones, such as Capture the Flag, and one that caught Lucario's eye rather quickly called \"Humiliation Mode\". Lucario read the description to himself. &lt;Humiliation mode...Ever want Wario to clean your socks? Samus to do your dishes? Challenge your fighter to Humilation! The ultimate test of wills and honor! The winner will \"enslave\" the loser, who will have to suffer the humiliation of doing your house work! Disclaimer: Winner may choose to do with the loser what ever they desire. Do not accept the challenge if you are not prepared to meet the demands if you end up losing. Choose opponents carefully&gt; Lucario smirked to himself, this sounded like his kind of thing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now he had a decision to make....</span></div></div>",

There was no other choice in his mind better than this. The thought of forcing Fox to do as he wished, to torture him and gobble him up over and over again, three meals a day, caused drool to pool at his feet. Thankfully Fox was nearby, this would be easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario held his stomach and turned back to where he saw Fox and his crew and smiled when his eyes saw they were still there. The aura surrounding Fox looked so sweet and appetizing, his legs quivered and shook at the idea of turning the proud vulpine into pudge. As he approached, Fox looked over and saw him coming. \"Hey Lucario, it's been a while. I hope you're not mad about that whole thing last tournament, I saw an opportunity and I took it. It's how we fighter pilots work.\" He explained, smiling at the Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario's blank look remained unchanged, keeping his true intentions hidden perfectly. &lt;Hello, Fox. I do not care for what happened in the past, but I need to talk to you alone, if your friends do not mind.&gt; He communicated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crew nodded and left Fox to talk to the Pokemon, who studied Fox carefully. Fox was a hothead at times, not as much as Falco, but when challenged, he was always up for a fight to prove himself. Lucario knew Fox wouldn't turn it down. &lt;The standard tournament, it's almost full.&gt; He started to explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox nodded and folded his arms, looking towards the Rule Set Stage. \"I know, I couldn't get in, neither could Mario nor Link. We've done three, they want to give the newcomers a chance. Krystal got in because she registered for it at the front desk, but I heard Samus saying she probably wouldn't get in either.\" Fox flicked his tail a little as he spoke, sighing softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario nodded in return and looked up and down the vulpine. \"Yes, well...I signed up for the Challenge Circuit...there's a type there called \"Humiliation\"...&gt; Again, Fox cut him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I read that one. I still haven't decided on what to do, but that one is calling to me because I could beat a weaker fighter and get them to do maintenance on the Great Fox for us, hehe.\" Fox chuckled, brushing his arm a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario gave a friendly smile, while inside his mind he was just picturing Fox all tied up on a dinner platter with an apple in that smug mouth. &lt;Well, I signed up for it...and I couldn't think of anyone other than yourself. I don't want an easy win, and I don't want an easy loss. Do you accept?&gt; Lucario asked frankly, eager for Fox's response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox thought about it for a moment, rubbing his chin. \"What happens if I lose?\" Fox asked, his ears twitching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario wanted to come right out and say Fox would spend the rest of his life being Pokemon food, but he knew that would get an instant refusal. &lt;Well...I can't really tell you that. I want you to accept because there is no one else. I am afraid if I tell you, you will decline and I will have to pick an easy fight.&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox bought it, he nodded and shook the Lucario's paw. \"Alright, I'm always up for a surprise. I kinda want to see how Krystal does anyway, so one fight will give me lots of time! Do you mind if we wait until she finishes?\" Fox asked, giving a small smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario thought about it for a moment... </span></div></div>",

He was just too much for the fox to handle and even after a tough fight, Lucario had gotten the best of him. The Pokemon extended his paw and helped Fox up, still sweating and panting from such a long fight. Lucario was ecstatic, he had just beaten Fox and now he owned Fox, to be his own personal snack to devour any time he liked because of the character's ability to reform after being defeated, something Dr. Mario called \"The Extra Life Syndrome\". He couldn't wait to devour Fox, but he was in a little worse for the wear. Lucario wanted him to be presentable for dinner, not beaten up and bloody. &lt;Go clean yourself up and report to my room when you are ready, Fox.&gt; Lucario ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox nodded slowly and gave a little bow and went off to heal up, while Lucario excitedly ran back to his room. The Smash tournament expects fighters to spend weeks in the provided rooms, so they are quite large, with a fully functional kitchen and dining area! Lucario hummed quietly to himself as he set the table, placing a large platter he found that seemed big enough to fit Fox, rubbing his belly as he pictured Fox on the plate and eagerly awaited the real thing! It came soon enough when a knock on his door pulled Lucario away from his fantasy. Opening it up, Fox was standing there, good as new. The orange-yellow vulpine was clad in his standard sleeveless vest and green flight suit (A/N: StarFox Adventures Fox) and looked very nervous. Lucario invited him in and locked the door, using his abilities to make sure it would stay locked should Fox try to escape. \"So...what do you have planned? I see you have the table set, do you want me to make you dinner?\" Fox asked, feeling a little unnerved by some thought telling him to run away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario slurped his chops and leaned in close to Fox, wrapping one of his arms around his waist. &lt;No Fox....&gt; he began, and Fox's eyes went wide as he felt and heard Lucario take a deep sniff from his back up to his ears. &lt;I want you...for dinner!&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox yelped as Lucario pushed him onto the floor, planting his black footpaw on Fox's back. He looked around for something to restrain Fox and found some turkey string on the counter in the kitchen. Grabbing it, he tied Fox's wrists behind his back and picked Fox off the ground, forcing him over to the dinner table. \"What are you doing?! Untie me!\" Fox cried out, trying to fight against Lucario.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pokemon smirked and pushed Fox down onto the table, forcing him to climb up and onto the plate. &lt;No Fox, I will not untie you. I told you, I want you for dinner. Your humiliation is that you will now live as my personal little meal.&gt; Lucario said, licking his chops in front of Fox's green eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox's eyes widened and he began to beg, but Lucario simply smirked and silenced his cries by shoving a bright red apple into Fox's mouth. He studied Fox and drooled at the sight of him on the platter, but he could do more...<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

There was nothing he could do now, he was contractually obliged to obey whatever order Lucario gave!

You will do as I tell you, understand?&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox sighed softly and let out a little whimper. He knew he would have to obey the Pokemon, he agreed to this. He shuddered and nodded slowly, knowing this sealed his fate to be Pokemon food. Lucario went behind Fox and untied his arms, the Pokemon taking a deep sniff of Fox from behind. &lt;Now my delicious Fox, take off those clothes. You won't need them in my stomach.&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox sighed and stood on the table, putting on a strip show for Lucario as he removed all of his clothing until he was sitting naked on a dinner plate. Lucario's eyes feasted upon him, taking in his natural form, and all of his deliciousness. Lucario couldn't stop slurping his chops, and his stomach drowned out all of Fox's whimpering. Fox watched Lucario paw at his belly and stare into Fox's eyes. &lt;This is your new home, right here...inside my belly.&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox shuddered and Lucario picked up a fork and knife, solely for the purpose of putting the \"food\" idea more into Fox's mind. However, Lucario couldn't decide if he wanted to...</span></div></div>",

He could have fun with him any time he wanted, his stomach needed food now! The Pokemon climbed onto the table and pressed himself against Fox, his nose twitching as he sniffed at Fox's fur, dragging his pink tongue along Fox's front up to his neck. Lucario couldn't believe how delicious Fox tasted! He imagined he would taste good, and was hoping for it, but this was more than he thought, he was a perfect meal for a Pokemon like him! Lucario slowly slurped over Fox's head, enjoying his taste test, grinding his body against Fox's, holding onto him with his black furred paws. &lt;Now Fox, my meal...it's time for you to go home.&gt; Lucario taunted, grabbing Fox's head and pulling it against his soft, growling stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;Listen to your home, Fox...listen to how it calls for you....&gt; Lucario groaned, feeling Fox squirm already in his grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox whimpered, forced to listen to Lucario's stomach gurggle and glorp, demanding food to fill it...demanding Fox to fill it...he closed his eyes and shuddered, but was forced by Lucario to look up into that opening maw, at those glistening white teeth and the pink innards closing in on him. Fox's world became a world of darkness as Lucario engulfed his head without warning, the Lucario's grip was getting rather tight, Fox could barely even squirm. He let out muffled cries of protest out of instinct but knew deep down he had this coming, he agreed to be Lucario's meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario himself was overjoyed. The taste of revenge and humiliation was absolutely delicious, there were no words Lucario could find to describe Fox's flavor, his tongue danced as if at a thousand parties at once at every inch it tasted. His tail swished happily behind him and his eyes closed in delight, paws shoveling more of the delicious vulpine into his gullet. Fox's squirms were almost non-existent from Lucario's grip, his stomach took over and his swallows increased, Fox slowly disappeared into Lucario. Fox's legs kicked and banged off the table and plate while Lucario kept leaning back, dragging more of McCloud into him. Fox found himself slowly being wedged down Lucario's throat, the ring to the stomach growing ever closer. The muscles pushed and throbbed against Fox, forcing him against his will down into Lucario's depths. Lucario's swallows became longer and more loud, and his paws smacked teasingly at Fox's big rump. Lucario's jaws snapped back and that big fuzzy rump disappeared into Lucario's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox found himself in Lucario's stomach, slowly curling up within, while his legs dangled from Lucario's mouth, slowly and surely the Pokemon gulped them down. With a thick, wet swallow, Lucario sealed Fox into his stomach, rubbing the bulges traveling down his neck as he took his last swallows of Fox, feeling those slender legs sliding down his gullet to join the rest of Fox in his expanded belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox curled up into a tight ball inside Lucario's stomach, wiggling to see how much room he had to move around and squirm inside Lucario. The Pokemon sat back on the table and patted his engorged belly, feeling Fox's movements inside. With a lick of the lips and a belch from his mouth, his meal was done. &lt;Mmmm, Fox....you were so delicious...just a perfect meal.&gt; Lucario teased, patting his belly, still tasting Fox on his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that he had eaten Fox...he had to decide what to do with him!</span></div></div>",

A title match, no matter what type of fight it was, was always fought on the Final Destination field. He felt a slight tingling and with a flash of light, appeared in the field with a blaze of aura.

As soon as yoshi was a few steps away, Lucario put both his palms together ahead of him and a flash of aura shot out, striking Yoshi with a successful Force Palm. Yoshi shrugged the hit off and leapt into the air. Lucario zipped through the air a bit and away from Yoshi with Extremespeed as Yoshi slammed downward. With that successful dodge, Lucario ran forward again much close this time and repeated Force Palm. this time he got ahold of Yoshi and began whacking him a bit before blasting him away from him. He began charging up and Aura Sphere but had to stop when Yoshi began rolling at him inside a massive egg.

Obviosly Lucario thought, and got an idea. &lt;cafe = a lot of money, and joes, a cheep food store, 'not take away for some reason' super cheep. the bear turned around to reveal the other side of the sign that said, 'FREE, for the week, come fast!' Lucario smiled and licked his lips and thought, &lt;how bad could the food be?&gt; <br>\r\n<br>\r\nhe walked to the bear and asked him; \"do you know where i could find, Joes?\" the bear grinned and pionted to a small, old and broken cafe. Lucario said pleased to the bear, \"thankyou sir!\" and walked there. The bear pokemon looked around to see no one else on the street, so he followed Lucario. the bear said to Lucario; \"you must be hungry to eat at a place like this, aren't you? Lucario smiled and looked up at the bears face and said gladly, \"you know, come to think of it, i'm more hungry now!\" Lucario laughed and walked in the shop. the bear licked his lips and picked up Lucario. \"come with me, kid\" he said holding Lucario by the neck. Lucario looked at him confused and scratched his scalp. &lt;what is this guy doin' anyway. at first his OK and natrual, now whats up with the ol' guy?&gt;. Lucario got shoved with a croud of Pokemon that where just as confused as him, He asked one of them; \"do you know whats happening?\" \"no, it's wierd. i'm starving and i've been here for like an hour!\" \"maybe the foods getting made!\" said another. \"yeah, me too!\" Lucario replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bear pokemon came up to Lucario and put a blind-fold on him, then another, and another. until every Pokemon in the old cafe was blinded-up. the bear licked his lips and sighed happily, almost with a gasp of hunger. Lucario could hear people being draged into a room, and then a metal door closing. as nobody could see what was happening, all he heard from there mouth's was questions like; \"where the hell am I!\" and, \"what that touching my feet!\" Lucario could suspect somthing was going on. After a while, the bear pokemon came in and picked up Lucario. the bear counted as he walked, trying to retrace his steps for somthing; \"25, no, i think it was 31, nope 12, nah, musta been 29, yep!\" the bear sat on a large chair in a dark room, Lucario heard the metal door shut with a bang. and then he felt breathing on his toes. his fur lifted, and he jolted a bit. the bear sat, holding his ear with a grasp. Then Lucario felt water, he new what was happening, as nobody else did. he yelled; \"AGHHHHH, OH NOOOO, AGHHHH!\" the bear smacked him and Lucario stopped screaming. everyone outside thought he had been stabed or somthing. until Lucario felt the bears teeth. He new if he yelled, he would die, so he covered his mouth with his paws. Lucario was now soaked, and felt the bears throught and then felt and heard many Pokemon yelling and questioning again. as many had been able to take of there blind-fold, and many other Pokemon where able to take of other Pkemon's blind-folds off. the bear heard them and smacked his belly. everything was quiet people sat in rows on the stomace floor. all where squished. Lucario looked around to see many Pokemon, some children, and some adults. many of the kids where sobbing quietly. Lucario patted one of the youngsters and the child looked up to him and smiled a little. The mother of this child smiled at Lucario and asked him some questions as more Pokemon fell into the bears stomace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe bear looked around after 15 minutes after swallowing Lucario, he let out a huge Burp that somehow let the Pokemon inside of him notice that the job was done. he sat on the large chair, extremly plump as well. and started to talk to the Pokemon inside of him. he asked the wierdest questions someone could ask, and after a bit, he told them who he was. It turned out that he was Joe. the Pokemon inside him became angry and started to argue with the bear Pokemon. The bear wacked his belly again and swore that they would die if they did it again. the children became even more nervouse and many cried loud enough for the bear to hear them. Lucario sighed and sobbed a bit. but then he got an idea. \"I've got a plan guys, it may not work, but it will help!\" then after 2 minutes, they began to put there arms against the bears stomace walls. they all cried softly, as then Lucario recaped himself and felt abused. \"oh no, it won't work, where just mourning!\" \"and, i think it's a good way to end our lives!\" said a Pokemon, \"yeah!\" \"ok!\" Lucario said looking at the bears stomace wall. The bear smiled and thought to himself, &lt;they know it's the end, hah! thought it would never happen, how genourous!&gt; The bear rubbed it's tummy and every Pokemon felt his hand move across. all religious Pokemon prayed for freedom, while other cried and sobbed on the wall. Lucario stood up and frowend at the bear Pokemon's stomace wall. \"let us out, now. You will regret this! OI! We are getting out, WE NEED TO YA BIG FAT MEANY!\" \"Oi, who told you to swear too the mighty, me! and yeah, i'll let you out. but how will I? i don't know!\" The bear said grinning happily, and once again, rubbed his tummy. Lucario frowned again and stoomped on the stomac floor. then he sat. and thought, &lt;is this the end, it isn't like I imagened it would be like. what could happen next?&gt;.</span></div></div>",

He holds a child and ducks as many people drown in this liquid. they scream and burn up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario crys and hears a large gurgle. it shakes everything in sight. he falls over and screams out to the bear; \"this is it! you've killed us! hope you enjoyed it you, you, you! Just lemme out! PLEASE! your my only hope!\" \"No way kiddo, your my lunch, you are my lunch!\" the bear said actually non mooded like he was concerend. Lucario drowend in this acidic juice, and once again, the bear burped loudly. The bear pokemon got sadder each time his stomach gurgled, as each time it did, was another life gone. at the 35th time it gurgled, he bursterd into tears. \"What have I done! 'sniffle' I caused pokemons life to be gone! I murderd! WAGHHHHH!\" there was a 36th time it gurgled. it was the loudest of them all. and again, that was to let him know that the job was done.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lucario sat and Pondered hard. then he got an idea. he huddled up with everyone else in the bear Pokemon's stomach. \"guys, i gotta plan, if we can re-do 'red riding hood', we would survive! first we will wait for this, \"monster\" to go to sleep so we can continue with our plan!\" \"i've gotta a swiss army knife right here!\" said a Pokemon, \"great, we'll use that to get out.\" after 5 hours of desperate waiting the bear Pokemon walked home to go to bed. as normally, he thought that everyone was dead. but he was wrong. as he closed his eyes, they went on with the mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, cut just here, below the rib cage.\" Lucario said as he pionted to the bears abdomen. The Pokemon began to cut his stomach open. the bear groaned and wiggled a bit. everyone slid out and ran off. apart from Lucario who stitched him up again. Lucario then pushed the bears stomach hard so the bear Pokemon would wake up. and of course think that they where still inside of him alive. he opened his eyes and looked at his stomach, it was flat and normal. then the bear looked up to see Lucario on his bed-side. \"told ya we'd get out of you! what are you now, oh i know! A LOSER! HAHAHAHAHA!\" and with that, Lucario ran away. The bear Pokemon became angry and chased after Lucario. he hid behind an old shak and got out his phone to call fox, \"hi fox, i need ya help, again!\" \"what, your on the run again!\" \"yeah, sorry dude!\" \"ok, i'll be right over, to umm, do my job!\". Lucario ran into the bears house again and hid in the cupboard. the bear saw him and followed after him. Lucario saw fox and told him what to do when he came in his house. fox noded and hid. Lucario waved in the door way and the bear saw him again, \"I'm gonna eat you so bad, it's gonna hurt me! RAWR!\" the bear ran and then dived right into, umm, fox's mouth? fox began to swallow the bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the Pokemon cheered and clapped for this wonderful moment. fox chocked for a bit and then swallowed more, fox became very fat every second, as the bear was much bigger than him. fox sweated and cried from the horrible pain in his throught. The Pokemon pushed the bears back paws of the bear into fox's mouth. at last, fox swallowed his toes and gave out a really, loud gulp. as this was. the bear Pokemon, also known as \"Joe\", was eaten alive and was geting what he deserves for what he did to Lucario and the other Pokemon. Joe sobbed, and thought about what he had done. while fox, well let's just say he had the dinner of a life-time.</span></div></div>",
