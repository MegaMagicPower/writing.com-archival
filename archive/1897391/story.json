Time for him to be the star of the football team, and have one last year of fun with his friends before heading off to college away from his parents and his eleven-year-old kid brother Cooper, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that's how it was supposed to work. But that wasn't in the cards this year for Blake, as he would have to deal with Cooper and all the other boys his age becoming bigger and dominating over the town. Stuff like that has a habit of overshadowing anything (and anyone) else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut I'm getting ahead of myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet's start on Day One of Pearson Town's Growth Event. A Wednesday in August, the week before school started. Blake was coming home from football practice, pumped from having been named this year's starting quarterback for Pearson High's Fighting JungleCats. Cooper and his friend Julian were downstairs playing video games in the basement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked in the door, Blake called down the stairs to his brother. \"Hey, dweeb, I'm home. Get ready to give up the TV.\" He didn't mean anything hurtful by his remarks, but after all, Cooper was his dorky little brother, and it was his right as oldest to have the TV to himself when he got home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the only response he heard was the sound of the video games getting louder, Blake shook his head and started downstairs. \"Did you hear me? It's my turn. Save your game or whatever and scram.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he got to the bottom step, however, he stopped dead in his tracks, staring at...</span></div></div>",

No, he didn't want to admit it, he wanted to believe that his eyes were playing tricks on him or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Blake, didn't hear you come home.\" Cooper grinned, even though they both knew that there was no possible way he didn't hear him yelling down the stairs earlier. As Blake watched Cooper stood up and walked up to him, and only then was Blake dead sure that he was really seeing what his eyes were telling him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCooper was as tall as he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-Cooper, how did you two grow so big!?\" Blake asked, staring wide eyed at his former little brother. Looking over at Julian sitting on the couch, he saw that he too had grown bigger as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, we just did!\" He shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were just sitting here and then all of a sudden we started growing bigger!\" Julian said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake rubbed his eyes and looked his brother over. It was as if someone had taken Cooper's head and placed it on another body. Cooper's clothes, which had been baggy on him before, were now skin tight and ill fitting. The bottom of his pants now hugged the middle of his calves, and the shirt was tight everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then, you said you were going to take the TV, but me and Julian aren't done with it yet.\" Cooper crossed his arms over his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat statement snapped Blake out of his stunned state. \"What, you think that now that you're as tall as me you can boss me around? I can still whoop your skinny little butt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Cooper grinned. \"We'll just have to see about that...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Seeing Cooper's mischievous grin caused Blake to think twice about taking on Cooper, especially since he was feeling rather fatigued from practice. \"Listen,\" he said, hoping he looked and sounded more confident than he felt, \"I'm gonna go over to Alex's house right now, so you two can keep the TV for all I care. But, tomorrow, when I get home, that couch is mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCooper's smile just widened as he chuckled. \"Sure, whatever you say, Blake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake didn't actually have plans to go to his friend's house, but he didn't want to lose face in front of his little dweeb of a brother (although the term \"little\" wasn't exactly appropriate anymore). So he headed out for a light jog around the neighborhood, reasoning that it was a good way to keep his conditioning up for football.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, he turned down a side street and passed by a small park with a playground, where many of the neighborhood kids would come and play. It was a place that he usually paid little notice too, but as he passed, he thought for sure that he saw something peculiar out of the corner of his eye. Turning his head, he saw what he thought were five or six teenaged boys running around, with several girls much younger than them on the playground with them. As he looked closer, however, he realized that these boys' faces looked much younger than their bodies. Just like Cooper and Julian, they were all between five and a half and six and a half feet tall, with clothes clinging skin-tight to their bodies, but they couldn't have been any older than twelve. It was a bizarre sight, and Blake couldn't help but stop and gawk for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Blake got home, he went directly to his room and made sure he avoided Cooper for the rest of the night. In the morning, he woke up and left the house before Cooper even got out of bed, as his high school started nearly two hours earlier than the middle school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt school, he noticed that a few of the freshmen boys appeared to be a few inches taller than they had been the previous day, but nothing as dramatic as what Blake had witnessed yesterday, and none of the upperclassmen seemed to have changed one bit. By the end of the day, Blake had nearly forgotten about the changes Cooper and his friend had gone through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is, until he arrived back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't even have to go inside, as Cooper and two of his friends were hanging out in the front yard -- and they were huge! Julian was there, nearly eight feet tall, still wearing a school uniform that had been stretched and ripped beyond any reasonable use. Another friend the same size, whom Blake didn't recognize, was also there, shirtless but still wearing the remains of the school shorts that barely extended a third of the way down his thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the biggest of all was definitely Cooper. The other two boys didn't even come up to his shoulders! And Blake, poor Blake -- as he slowly made his way up to his beaming brother, he realized that he was eye level with Cooper's belly button. Cooper had by far outgrown his school uniform, only having what looked to be a half-ripped beach towel wrapped around his waist like a loincloth that was failing at its primary purpose. The site of his brother being so big was almost too much for Blake, and he was speechless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCooper, however, could barely contain his glee. \"Don't worry, Blake,\" he said, \"the couch and the TV are too small for us now, so they're are all yours. That is, if you can get past us into the house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a moment before Blake could respond. \"W-what?! You're not going to let me into the house?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCooper shrugged. \"Maybe, but you'll have to do something first:\"</span></div></div>",

We used to do it all the time when I was still half your size. It'll be exactly the same, except this time, YOU'RE the one who will be half MY size!\" Cooper grinned down at his former big brother, obviously enjoying this moment of payback. Before Blake could react, Cooper suddenly charged at him and tackled him to the ground!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof!\" Blake felt the wind knocked out of him as his now larger brother landed on top of him. He could feel Cooper's arms try to wrap around him to pin him, but his countless wrestling experience helped him to somehow break free for the moment. The two of them wrestled around on the grass in a jumble of arms and legs. Cooper had a definite size and weight advantage, but Blake had much more experience than Cooper did. Finally, one of them gained the upper hand!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Cooper stands up to rub his eyes, and he was now about 5' 3\" ! Blake steps back, and Cooper's shoelaces start to pop, his feet being fifteen inches long! Blake tries to run, but trips over the remote. Cooper's legs start to stretch, almost as in invisible forces were pulling him, making him grow, and grow, and grow! Cooper was now about 6' 11\" , and Julian tried to run, but he was now getting too big for the room. Tch! Cooper's  baggy, loose long sleeved shirt was now to his Upper arms, and his  sweatpants were to his thighs. Cooper grew another foot, and he was so shocked at his sudden transformation. He was starting to feel cramped, and then his head crashed through the ceiling. His shoulders broadened, destroying the sleeves, making the shirt look like a tank top. Then, Cooper was at least 17 feet tall. Blake was pushed to the wall by Cooper's now enormous hands, spanning at least 36 inches. Cooper crushed through the house, and footprints getting increasingly bigger were running towards Julian's street. Probably left by Julian during the pursuit.

This was strange since normally Cooper would play this most of the time.  Blake wasn\u2019t sure what to think of it, and he had to wonder where his dorky little brother went?  But he looked around and shrugged it off, as if he might\u2019ve scared him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh well!  I\u2019ve must\u2019ve thought that dork knew I was coming and ran off, I guess?\u201d  Blake shrugged again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when he would approach the TV, and switches off the games console.  He turns on his favourite channel and sits back down on the couch to have some rest for a bit.  It\u2019s his time since he\u2019s the oldest of the two, and gets some kind of a VIP treatment whenever he wants to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, nothing more than just sitting there, without having that little shrimp to fight me over the TV.\u201d<br>\r\n Blake says in a happy expression and sighs of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat maybe for the moment since Blake was getting too comfortable and too cocky in his regard, but it would only take some moments later, when he can feel the ground had shook slightly, followed by those loud booms from further away.  Blake seems to be more alert and felt shaken as it happens again.  There were only a small window which is higher than the other ones, since it is the basement, and so he takes a look and see what\u2019s going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?  I don\u2019t believe any earthquakes at all, bur where did it came from?\u201d  Blake asked in great concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose quakes and booms came closer and it wouldn\u2019t take long until Blake had found the answers he was looking for, but in a surprisingly shocking way.  He can see giant sneakers slamming onto the streets, two pairs in fact!  Blake\u2019s heartbeat came running and had to get up the stairs and take a look outside from this commotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he reached outside, he was in deep shock and dropped dead at this point, when he see\u2019s two giants standing right in front of him, and he can hear those giggles from those high pitched voices echoing the entire streets.  Blake knee it sounded like kids and he looks up realising who they were, and that\u2019s when his jaw dropped and couldn\u2019t believe what he just saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC...C...Cooper....J...J...Julian?  I...I...Is that you?\u201d  Blake asked in a very shaken tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd they surely are!  It was two 11 year old boys who have suddenly grown into giants, standing like 50 feet tall in the process.  This is very much surprising and Blake had absolute no idea how did these two boys had gotten so huge, and still shaken at the prospect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Hello little tweeb!  I guess being this big is kinda cool!  Maybe we should take care of you while we\u2019ll love being so big.\u201d  That was Cooper, looking down to his now \u2018little\u2019 brother and crouches down to try and pick Blake up from the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that giant hand coming down to grab him, Blake looked so frightened and isn\u2019t sure what to do with these two giant boys.  He knew he\u2019s gonna get caught by any means, but he would be destined to run as much as he can, if that\u2019s the only way forward.

But even more so when he can hear and feel his stomach started to growl in hunger.  That could hear a thundering sound if it was a normal-sized person\u2019s point of view.  Cooler looked down and gives his fat belly a slap, causing it to wobble like a jelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBoy, I never think I can get that hungry when I\u2019m this big.  Now I need to go and find somewhere to eat.  I\u2019m starving!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCooler says to himself with that thundering booming voice, and which at point, he would makes his first steps and slammed onto the ground, causing it to shake rapidly and loud booms that echoes all around the town.  That\u2019s when he starts to waddle and headed through the streets from his house.  The scenery he looked from his point of view is so real, even the people are so smaller than him, that they looked in shock and screams as they ran away from a fat giant superhero when headed through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite he really wants no harm to the people, he wouldn\u2019t realised that he just stomped onto the vehicles, lamp posts or anything he waddled back with his huge feet.  He\u2019ll may had to get used to it, if he would stay this big longer though.  But a giant fat kid is getting hungry and continued headed down until he reached towards where?</span></div></div>",

Given the fact that the boys on the team were still only 12 years old and from different backgrounds, it was amazing to see them work together to play the best game they could. Since the average height of each boy on the team was only about 5' even meant that they had to run a little faster, jumping a little higher, and swing a little harder to score in an average game. However, today everyone would find out - teammates and parents included - that this would be no 'average' game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the boys took the field and the umpire called out \"Play Ball\", everyone from team catcher Joey, to pitcher Ryan and all of the outfielders expected this game to be just another shut-out going up against their cross-town rivals the Hampton Hooligans. While each member of the opposing team was around the same age as the Giants, they were actually about 4 to 5\" taller than them, and a lot more muscular. This always seemed to guarantee the Giants would get the short end of the stick as they were outrun, outhit, and generally outmatched by their bigger opponents. That is until a strange phenomenon began to occur in the dugout. </span></div></div>",

Their fear is to be outdone, and they would think because of the size of The Hooligans\u2019 players, The Giants would think it will be straight forward of humiliation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before beginning with the first inning though, the boys receive the energy drinks from the coach.  But for some reason, it looked quite new and they\u2019ve all never seen such a brand quite like this before.

I hope!\u201d  Joey shrugged and hoping for the best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing it could be used from now on, both Joey, Ryan, and the rest of the boys drank their energy juice, before it was time to start the game.

Anthony, the \u201cleader\u201d, was hurrying the boys to get their stuff as he was anxious to get to the lake. He was 4\u20196\u2019 with a built of a normal boy at his age as he charmed the pants offf off of any second grade girl. Timmy was taking his time as he wanted to make sure he had everything before they left. He was 4\u20196\u2019 and sort of scrawny but had a tough spirit. Carl was sort of nervous to actually get in the lake as he considered himself weak and puny to all the other boys. He was 4\u20192\u2019, a late bloomer, as his voice was very faint and soft as he is always scared to take risks. Gabe was telling all the boys all the crazy stuff he is going to do at the lake while he was packing as he is the \u201cdaredevil\u201d of the group. He was 4\u20196\u2019 with a sort of athletic built as he is involved In numerous sports like baseball, basketball, and soccer. So after the long preparation, the boys are off. \u201cThe lake is that way\u201d says Anthony as the boys follow the point of their leader. \u201cDamn this is going to be fun\u201d says Gabe, \u201cdon\u2019t say damn, the counselors will hear you\u201d says Carl, \u201cShut up Carl, geez\u201d says Timmy. \u201cWe\u2019re here\u201d as the boys look around to see the glistening lake reflect the sun beams to captivate what camp can\u2019t truly offer. The boys all take of their shirts, excluding Carl, as Anthony and Timmy run to the edge while Gabe goes straight to the tire swing. Anthony and Timmy pause at the edge touching the water with their toes to check the temperature as Anthony declares \u201cI can\u2019t get my hair wet\u201d. Then, Timmy just pushes him in as he goes in the cold but amazing water as all the boys follow suit. They went in as young boys as when they will get out; it would be a whole new life. \u201c I\u2019m staying out here guys I need to read this amazing book\u201d, \u201cCome on Carl!\u201d The boys in the water say as Carl puts down his book and says \u201c Do you know how contaminated lake water is, Huh?!, it has greywater and you know what that is! POOP!\u201d, the boys in the water just look at each other while they continue to play. Once out after a couple of minutes, they all dry off as Carl packs up reading and his towel. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you get into the water, PANZIE!\u201d Gabe asks Carl, \u201c I\u2019m not a pansie, I just don\u2019t want to get hepatitis A at the age of 8\u201d \u201c Well if you\u2019re not a pansie; prove it!\u201d Gabe points to the tire swing as Carl takes off his shirt to reveal his very scrawny/bones body as he goes to the tire swing but chickens out when the pressure of the boys gets to him. \u201cI can\u2019t do it\u201d he exclaims \u201c YES YOU CAN\u201d says Anthony, Gabe, and Timmy collectively. Carl looks at the height he will get if he does actually do it but for the sake of his reputation he gets in, takes a deep breath, and gets forcefully pushed by Gabe into the water as he comes up from it saying \u201cGABE YOU JERK\u201d but they just laugh as Carl laughs too because of the adrenaline pumped in him. That night after s\u2019mores and a campfire hangout, the boys get to bed with stomachs full of Hershey goodness. \u201cToday was the best\u201d exclaims Anthony as the boys agree, \u201cI bet tomorrow will be even better\u201d says Timmy, and Gabe budges in by saying \u201clet\u2019s go catch frogs and put in counselor\u2019s Jim\u2019s office\u201d \u201cewww\u201d follows Carl as they all laugh and rest the starry night away. While in bed, Anthony starts to toss and turn as he feels as if he\u2019s burning up, the molecules in his body start to multiply as he\u2019s starting to change. His legs start to grow longer and longer as his pjs strat to get shorter on him revealing lengthy legs with hair starting to show. Then, his feet spurt out of his sock showing that they are strong and being with hair coming out of the toes. The legs start to build muscle as they begin contracting showing and impressive form as you can see every msucke start to rip through the pj pants. Anthony continues to groan as the growth moves up to his body as his flat stomach start to move around his white t-shirt due to his waistline contracting a v shape to start showing a thick v-line on his bottom abs as those begin to contract. It starts off in the lower portion as his flat body starts to rise with mounds of abs that start to show through his shirt revealing a very muscular body as his pecs start to inflate with muscle as it starts to shadow his abs. They continue to rise as it starts to tear through his shirt, considering it\u2019s made for an 8 year old boy, as the pecs start to shove through the shirt and rips it to reveal beads of sweat trailing down Anthony\u2019s body  as it starts to drip down to his lower region as a happy trail starts to form at Anthony\u2019s belly button. His arms were inflating as well his triceps and biceps start to form huge round mounds oh his arms as the vein that links the hand to his arms starts to get thicker to reveal a glossy and perfect muscular arm that it round and firm. The growth comes to its last part as his neck start to get thicker with veins surrounding it as hair starts to grow on his chin as the baby fat begins to get sucked up to show an impressive jawline that is sharper than a knife which complements his beard very nice. Anthony wakes up and starts to moan even louder as his voice drops down an octave as his voice doesn\u2019t sound like an 8 year old boy, but a sexy male adult. Anthony wakes up with no rememberance of last night, he feels really cold so he opens his eyes to get a blanket but he sees his shirt  and socks are gone traveling his impressive abs. He runs to the bathroom as he is scared and when he looks in the mirror he\u2019s shocked but amazed. He starts to touch his arms confirming the firmness and how hard they are as he flexes them to show of the veins running down his biceps which then he starts to look at his 8 pack as he traversed his fingers down every ab all the way down to touch his v line as it seemed to amuse him with beads of sweat starting to cool off on his abdomen. He then touches his chin feeling how sharp it is and how his stubble really completes it  in which he follows his eyes down to his shoulders which also packed in some muscle as they broaden to make room for his arms. Anthony was impressed as he looked like a Greek god and he couldn\u2019t wait to show his friends as he ran back to the cabin as his muscles were jumping with him as he had no shirt on while running back. \u201cGuys I\u2019m so hot!!!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Matthew and Michael were as close as two twin brothers could be. They were both 11 year old boys who were born identical with dirty blond hair and blue eyes. However, as the years went by, the differences between the two changed them. Mike was an athletic boy, who loved to play outside and participate in sports, developing a strong body. Matt on the other hand was lazier, preffering to spend his time playing video games and watching TV. Their parents mistakenly tried to treat the boys the same way, so they fed them both the same amount of food and snacks and so on. However, where Mike easily burned it off every day, the extra calories began to build up in poor little Matt, giving him a slightly chubby appearence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite knowing it was his own fault, Matt was slightly jealous of Mike. Mike was always stronger and better and more popular than him, even though they were the same height, yet different weight. Sometimes, Matt wished he could know what it was like to be strong like his brother...</span></div></div>",

Make sure you take care of your brothers while we're gone for the weekend, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked up at his dad, fought the urge to roll his eyes, and nodded. \"Yes, Dad, I will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And remember, there's no cellular service up in the mountains, so make sure to call the lodge if you need anything. We'll be in room 206.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it.\" Ben waved goodbye to his parents, and as they got in the car, he slammed the door and turned around. Being eighteen wasn't all it was cracked up to be. Sure he had the house parents-free for three whole days, but what he also had was his two younger brothers to watch out for. He desperately wanted to have a party on Saturday night and invite half of the senior class, but he wasn't quite sure what to do with the two little dweebs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked into the living room, where Dweeb 1, Jason, and Dweeb 2, Sean, were watching TV. They weren't so bad, he realized, as far as younger brothers go, but he just wish he could have some time alone from them, some time to be an adult. He'd get that in a few months when he went of to college, but for now, it drove him a little crazy. Sighing, he ran his hands through his medium-length blonde hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Ben,\" Jason, the nine-year-old, asked, \"did Mom and Dad just leave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, they did,\" Ben said. \"They were just in here a few minutes ago saying good-bye, remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh\u2026\" Jason shrugged, his big blue eyes beaming from below his short-cut blonde hair. \"I guess I was too absorbed in this show.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Turn the TV off, anyways,\" Ben ordered. \"You guys need to finish up your homework.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it's Friday!\" Sean, the 13-year-old, protested. \"We got all weekend!\" Turning back to the TV, the shaggy-haired brunette flipped the channel to something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I was watching that!\" Jason protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a commercial, I'll flip it back in a minute,\" Sean countered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you don't have all weekend,\" Ben shook his head, stepping over to the TV and hitting the power button. \"I've got plans for tomorrow, and you guys are going to need to be out of the house. So that means you need to do your homework tonight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Plans?\" Jason asked, a curious look on his face. \"What plans?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean snorted, \"He's probably gonna sit alone waiting for nobody to call and invite him out.\" Sticking out the remote, he hit the button and turned the TV back on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen glared at Sean, walking up and grabbing the remote out of his hands. \"Look, Mom and Dad left me in charge while they were gone, which means you two have to do what I say. And I say you're doing homework. Now, I'm going to go upstairs to change; when I'm back down here in ten minutes, you two better have your books open and your pencils and paper out, understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason slowly nodded, while Sean just rolled his eyes. Taking this in as much of an affirmation as he could get, Ben headed upstairs, leaving the two younger brothers behind for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a dick,\" Sean muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Jason shrugged, \"at least if we get it done tonight, we'll have all day tomorrow and Sunday to do something fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't you hear him, Jason?\" Sean sat up, turning to his brother. \"He's planning on having some sort of party tomorrow night here. Which means <i>we</i> will be the ones cleaning up all day Sunday. It's not going to be a fun weekend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" Jason's smile faded, and he slouched back down on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments of silence, the TV flipped back on, although the only thing that it displayed was a static background.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I thought Ben took the remote!\" Jason exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He did!\" Sean sat up, looking at the TV. \"He must've turned it back on accidentally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From upstairs?\" Jason asked doubtfully. \"I don't think the remote travels that--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jason! Sean! Can you hear me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth boys' ears perked up at this, and they looked around. \"Was that coming from--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes, I'm inside the TV. Listen, do you two have a minute?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean stood up, walking closer to the set. \"W-who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about my name; that's not important right now. I'm what you humans call a 'demigod', specifically, a demigod of size. And I'm using your town as a little, shall we say, experiment of sorts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason now stood up, looking between the TV and his brother with a confused stare. \"A Demigod? What's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Basically, I can use my powers to do pretty much anything I want. And right now, I'm going to use them to let all the boys in your town have some fun. For the next three days, all the boys between seven and fourteen in your town can cause themselves to grow anytime they want! I just got here, and I'm going to let everyone else know, but you two are the first on my list. Does that sound like fun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fun? Grow?\" Sean's mouth had dropped open in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason, however, was much more enthusiastic. \"Wow, really? Yeah, that sounds like a lot of fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! Then listen closely, and I'll tell you what you need to do in order to grow. The first thing is\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp in his bedroom, Ben had just changed out of his school polo and khakis and into a much more comfortable set of jeans. Standing shirtless before his full-length mirror, he flexed a little, impressed with how good his body looked right now. He wasn't a muscle-freak, or anything, but he did have a six-pack for abs and two firm and pronounced pecs, along with well-defined biceps and triceps. He had a body that wouldn't have a hard time getting any girl he wanted, and he knew it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he slipped on his favorite t-shirt, he suddenly heard something from downstairs, what sounded like\u2026 the TV being turned on. Ben shook his head in disgust. \"Sean! Jason! You'd better be starting on that homework!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, he heard...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As he started heading down them, however, he felt the house began to shake. He lost his balance, stumbling to the landing halfway down and hitting his head against the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OW! Son of a b--\" He stopped, the sound of wood splintering growing louder, and as turned his head, he could see debris start to fall into the den area, and a large flesh-toned object seemed to be filling up the entire room. An object that seemed to be getting bigger, and that looked like... a foot...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBooming laughter suddenly filled the air, and Ben realized it was not just one voice, but two. After a few seconds, he realized that the laughter sounded an awful lot like his brothers' voices, just incredibly magnified and deeper versions of them. He didn't have much time to think about it though, as the foot had finished filling up the den and was now pushing its way towards him. The toes were now taller than he was, and before he knew it, he was being pinned in between them and the wall behind him. The pressure hurt but didn't last long, as the foot still was growing and soon pushed its way through the wall like a bully on the beach knocking down a sand castle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore dust and debris rained down around Ben. He coughed, gasping for breath, and he started to feel a little light-headed. He had no idea what was going on; he began to think that maybe the blow to his head from falling down the stairs had thrown his senses all out of whack. Whatever was happening, it was all beyond belief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dust settled, and Ben realized that he was no longer moving; the foot had stopped growing, for the moment at least. Maybe now he could get a good sense of what was going on, he thought. But as he looked up from the foot and the leg that rose from it, what he saw only made him more confused. Towering above him was his nine-year-old brother Jason, naked and with some bits of the house still stuck to his skin, and by now over a hundred feet tall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen took a moment to try and comprehend what he was seeing, but before he could even begin to wrap his mind around it, he was stunned to see that standing behind Jason was his other brother Sean, equally as nude and equally as large, if not a bit larger. Both giants had huge smiles on their faces, and seemed to be catching their breath, still caught up in the excitement of what had just happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing his eyes, Ben tried his best to wake himself up, praying that this was somehow all a bizarre dream. But nothing he could do worked, and as he opened his eyes again, he looked up and saw...</span></div></div>",

Ben was completely caught off guard and before he could even think about escaping, Jason grabbed Ben and picked him up. Ben felt himself ascending into the air at a terrifying rate as his brother lifted him up. His little brother's fingers were clamped tightly around his body, preventing him from getting away, even if he wasn't already eighty something feet into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lookie at what I found!\" Jason said, holding Ben out. Ben found himself staring into the gigantic face of his now much larger little brother Sean, whose wide toothy grin scared the shit out of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if it isn't our 'big' brother Ben.\" Sean said, smirking at the tiny figure trapped in the palm of the other giant. \"Well it looks like our books aren't open and we're not going to be doing our homework. What are you going to do about it now? Spank us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He can't even reach that high.\" Jason laughed, a loud, deafening boom that made Ben's eardrums feel like they were going to burst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're the big brothers now Ben, and you gotta listen to what WE say.\" Sean said. \"Otherwise...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason tightened his grip slightly, crushing Ben and causing him to cry out. \"OK, OK!\" He screamed, and immediately the pressure slacked off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then, what shall we do now?\" Jason asked Sean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we can...\"</span></div></div>",

Maybe we can do more than just get taller, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...\" Jason thought for a moment, wondering just what his brother could mean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean smiled. \"Just watch, and make sure the little pipsqueak can see too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason complied, turning his hand over so Ben had a clear view of the giant 13 year old. He watched as Sean closed his eyes and took a deep breath, then suddenly started to appear as if he was intently concentrating on something. It took a moment for both Ben and Jason to realize that he was flexing. And, as he did so, his muscles appeared to be getting larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was slight at first, as the skinny teen's pecs and biceps started to push out a little, but as he held the pose, the growth seemed to accelerate. Within forty seconds, Sean had gone from no definition at all to a strong, athletic physique, having a visible six-pack and a pecs that would've taken over a year solid in the gym to obtain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening his eyes with a shiver of pleasure, Sean grinned at his two brothers. \"...Something like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that was cool!\" Jason exclaimed, impressed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom his hand, Ben watched, both amazed and terrified at the muscular teen his younger brother had just turned into. \"How--what--?\" He could only stutter, still speechless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, my turn!\" Jason beamed, ready to have some fun,</span></div></div>",

Sean chuckled, folding his arms across his new, bigger chest, unable to resist giving himself a little grope as he stood there. The feeling made him shiver a little, the power flowing through him incredibly addicting. He was already eager to start growing again, to really give Ben a show, but Jason still hadn't had his fun yet and he had to admit to himself he WAS curious what the little guy would come up with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen, meanwhile, could feel his heart begin to race even faster as he felt Jason's hand heat up, his skin feeling slightly moist as he grunted slightly, focusing even more intensely. Ben had an increasingly bad feeling about this, his mind attempting desperately to process what was going on and failing miserably. It was all just...too much! Too weird! Like something out of a science fiction movie! Before he could dwell on that fact for too long though, Jason started to grow! Within seconds he had reached Sean's height and was quickly surpassing it, his youthful body rising higher and higher, his already enormous feet stretching across the grassy ground. Sean was standing perfectly in front of his little brother, head tilting back as he watched the young colossus swell ever taller, his fit chest passing him by, followed by his flat stomach, a thin layer of baby fat still pinchably visible on him. Sean blushed slightly as he saw his brother's dick rise above him as well, as long as the older brother's arm and still growing, surpassing anything he had ever seen before. He quickly turned his gaze skyward, his arms slowly unfolding and hanging by his sides. Jason was still growing, and growing faster! His eyes were screwed tight with concentration, his fist clenching harder. Ben would have been obliterated, turning into a messy red stain if he hadn't gotten so small in comparison that he was able to squeeze free, sitting on top of Jason's clenched fist, watching in horror as the ground continued to fall away, Sean's shocked face receding into the distance. Jason's grunts became thunderous as he pushed himself harder, his toes sliding off the grass and onto the street, the asphalt immediately cracking as the tremendous weight was forced onto it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey! Jason! Slow down! What are you doing?!\" Sean shouted, trying to get his little brother's attention, stumbling back slightly as Jason shifted his position, making the ground quake alarmingly, car alarms suddenly blasting the night air, the side of Jason's pinky toe uprooting a fire hydrant, adding to the chaos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hold on...\" Jason said with a slight moan, his growth slowing slightly as he lost his concentration. \"I just....I just want to see how BIG I can get!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCRASH! His big toe bulldozed the neighbor's house that lived across the street, water pipes bursting up through the street now, starting to flood the area slightly, people rousing from their slumber at tall the noise and chaos. Jason was swiftly becoming a spectacle that the entire neighborhood was seeing! Onward and upward, his expanded, Sean standing no taller than a toe now, Ben insignificant on his brother's hand! The slightest twitch could send him falling to his doom, a fact that he was painfully aware of and utterly incapable of changing. He was at his brother's mercy entirely now. Jason was starting to sink into the ground slightly, his weight too much for it to handle, cracks radiating out from where he was standing. More crashes were heard as his feet continued to take up and more and more space, obliterating houses left and right. \"OOoooh man...this feels so good!\" Jason's voice boomed from above, childish still but carrying a deeper tone that carried through the entire area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Jason stopped growing, standing at a staggering thousand feet tall, his body visible to most in the city, his eyes slowly opening, then widening. \"Woah...Look at me! I'm HUGE! This is so cool! I'm the biggest kid EVER!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe giggled as he lifted his foot up, bringing it down with a crash to the ground, watching as it smashed through, ripping up even more pipes, his toes crunching the metal as easily as if they were made of paper! He looked down at the ground, waving at Sean with the hand that wasn't holding Ben. \"Hey LITTLE bro! Guess what? This isn't even as big as I can get! I just decided to stop for now for some fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSean was stricken dumb for a moment, just looking up at this young titan. He quickly shook his head and shouted, \"Don't start growing again! Let me catch up first at least!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was about to start concentrating when his attention was drawn to something else.</span></div></div>",

Even though Ben had escaped that crushing palm, he was still several stories high in the air with no way down. \"Enjoying the view 'puny' brother?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me down!\" Ben yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't say please.\" Jason grinned wickedly. \"And for that, I'll have to hang on to you a little while longer. But because I might need both hands later, you can hang out in my hair until you've learned some manners!\" With that he plucked Ben off his hand like a bug and dropped him into his hair. Ben gave a cry and clung to several armfuls of hair for life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, let's go!\" Jason and Sean started to move towards the city. Jason's much larger legs allowed him to move through the neighborhood quickly, his giant feet cracking the asphalt. Sean however had to hurry a bit to keep up, his (comparitively) shorter legs not covering as much distance. So, in order to entertain himself while waiting for Sean to catch up, Jason decided to do what giants do best. He went to a car that had been parked out on the street and slowly placed his foot on top of it. Just from resting his foot on top of it caused the roof to cave in, the glass shattering. Then, with deliberate slowness he pressed down, the car screeching and alarm going off as the steel was being compressed under several tons of preteen boy. With a satisfying CRUNCH the alarm cut off as he thoroughly flattened the vehicle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit, that was awesome!\" Jason said as he lifted his foot and surveyed the damage. \"I can't wait to get downtown and see what kind of stuff I can do there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen shook violently from the thought. Just what kind of monsters did his two brothers become?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Jason and Sean reached the city. Although the two boys were much bigger, the buildings still loomed above them. The looks on their faces obviously told Ben that they didn't like that idea, but before they could do anything about it, another booming noise caught their attention. The two giants plus Ben rounded the corner and were surprised to see the boy's 10 year old friend Adrian, only...</span></div></div>",

Most of Mr. Bower's 6th grade class was a little more than just bored at this point, trudging along while pretending to care about the place they were in. Some kids might've saw this field trip as an exciting adventure, but in this small town there wasn't a lot of places to go, and most have already gone to Medi-Labs for a field trip before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they were walking through, one scientist on the side was working on a male super growth formula that would increase not only muscle mass, but overall height and health as well. However, the formula was somewhat in the unstable so far, and it vexed him. He had been so preoccupied with trying to get this formula to work that he began taking shortcuts, skipping procedures, and so on. He was actually testing it on a weak strain of bacteria in an open lab where he should have been testing it in an enclosed, sterile environment, but he wanted to work on it right away and not go through the tedious procedures. Besides, the bacteria was extremely weak, and any adult immune system would immediately destroy it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a few drops of his formula, he dropped it into a beaker full of the bacteria culture. Immediately the culture turned blue, then evaporated into a billow of smoke. The scientist swore under his breath as his work disappeared on him, but little did he know that the bacteria was still there, and now airborne. The bacteria would die within moments without proper hosts with underdeveloped immune system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, as fate would have it, it had plenty of host bodies to inhabit. Fourteen of them in fact. The young boys of Mr. Bower's class moved onto the next room, oblivious to what was in store for them...</span></div></div>",

It had been so subtle that no one noticed it at all, and the source of it would probably never be revealed. However, the fact of the matter was that now all these 10-11 year old boys would now be experiencing extreme growth spurts in the near future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the bacteria didn't cause them to grow right away. For the first few days it was slowly adapting to their new hosts body, multiplying steadily, changing them from the inside out. It wasn't until five days after the field trip that each boy woke up and discovered that something felt amiss, that their clothes were just slightly tighter, that the world looked a centimeter lower. It was so minute and small that they paid it no attention, but that was just the first step to their growing journey.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While the bacteria was causing all of the boys to grow, each one was affected by it in a slightly different way. While they could all tell something was different as they went through their day on the fifth day after the field trip, the changes began to become noticeable the morning after that when they woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam, the most popular boy in the class, woke up first. He was blonde haired with a handsome smile and athletic, already having developed some muscles before the changes had even occurred. When he woke up and went to the bathroom, ready to take his shower, he was stunned to see in his reflection that the t-shirt he slept in was now form-fitting all around his torso, and he was a good three or four inches taller than the day before. \u201cWow! I must\u2019ve gained forty pounds of muscle overnight!\u201d He took off his shirt and kept checking himself out. \u201cI look like a high schooler!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few streets away, Ian, a lanky, red-haired boy, had woken up to an uncomfortable tightness in his pajama pants. Looking down at himself, his jaw dropped when he saw how big his bulge had become, the outline of his boyhood clearly visible beneath the fabric. As he tried to get ready for the day, he realized that no matter what underwear or pants he put on, his large junk would clearly be noticeable. Not that he minded, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo of the boys in the class, Caleb and Calvin, were twin brothers who shared a bedroom. When the alarm went off, they both sat up, cleared the sleep from their eyes, and looked at each other, as their eyes both lit up. Calvin was the first to speak. \u201cDude, you\u2019re way taller!\u201d \u201cSo are you!\u201d Caleb replied. They both stood up, marveling at how much smaller their room seemed, as each had grown nearly a foot taller in their sleep, their boxers they had slept in both about to rip off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross the town, the rest of the boys in the class woke up this way: one stunned that his feet were now twice as big as before; another that he had the strength of a bodybuilder, able to lift his older brother without even trying. The boys all excitedly talked to each other on the bus and in the classroom before school started, each comparing themselves and the changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll except for one. Kamran, a small, dark-skinned boy whose family had moved from India just the year before. He was the shortest, skinniest boy in class before the field trip at just barely over four feet tall and fifty pounds, and this morning he was... just an inch taller and a pound heavier. Already a quiet, shy boy, the fact that he was the only boy in class who hadn\u2019t experienced a significant change made him feel all the more ostracized and embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut fate is a funny thing, and Kamran\u2019s and the rest of the boy\u2019s changes had barely even begun...</span></div></div>",
