Over one hundred human recruits are busy doing their drills. Each of them hopes that they will get done before the person next to them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on ladies, move it,\u201d shouts a loud voice. \u201cI\u2019m getting hungry and the last one of you still doing pushups in ten minutes will be my supper.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe owner of the voice steps forward into the rain, revealing him to be a werewolf. The man was Drill Sergeant Bloodtooth, and he was the worst person that the recruits had yet to meet. The place seemed to be run by cruel and sadistic werewolves, who loved nothing more than to rape and torture the recruits at every given moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the humans always seemed to get around them. If someone was locked up, someone would sneak him some food, which had the consistency of paste, and water, which tasted more like piss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, as if to torture some of them, they would even read their mail out loud to the rest, especially things about that recruit\u2019s loved ones, especially painful things, like if one man\u2019s sister got eaten, or raped, if his wife or girlfriend had been unfaithful, all the while saying lurid things about the recruits and their family members. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, with the support of each other, they got through it. That seemed to change the moment that Sergeant Bloodtooth showed up. The previous six weeks were nothing compared to what he was putting them through. The only good thing about the situation was, other than the recruits, it seemed that he was the only person there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, one recruit stood up and said, \u201cSergeant! I have something that I\u2019d like to say to you Sir!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, and what would that be, Private Jenkins?\u201d Sergeant Bloodtooth asked, loudly, as he walked up to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked into the man\u2019s eyes, which showed no fear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpeak Private!\u201d he said, loud enough to deafen the ears of the other recruits that were still doing their drills. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man looked at him and said, \u201cSir, you and the whole military can go to Hell. I\u2019m through with you, and your men.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPrivate Jenkins, by insulting this fine country\u2019s armed forces, you have committed treason. The punishment of the crime is death. So, any last words before I execute you?\u201d Bloodtooth asked, as he extended his claws and placed them over the spot where the condemned man\u2019s heart was and pulled back, so he could have enough power to drive his hand through the traitor\u2019s chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah,\u201d Jenkins said. \u201cDo your worst.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I plan to,\u201d Bloodtooth said, as he drove his hand through the man\u2019s chest. When he pulled it out, he was clutching the man\u2019s heart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, and by the way,\u201d he said, softly, as the man\u2019s vision faded. \u201cYou passed the entrance test.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he crushed the heart, causing the man to fall over, dead.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>*Note, (X) indicates who is speaking)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenkins found himself waking up somewhere. The room was white, and he was wearing what looked like a hospital\u2019s toga, and it looked like he was on an examination table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he tried to sit up, he felt someone put a hand on him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa boy, not so fast,\u201d said a familiar voice. \u201cYou need to wait until the sedative wears off.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere am I?\u201d Jenkins asked. \u201cAm I alive or dead?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell boy, you are alive. As for where you are, you\u2019re at boot camp.\u201d (Familiar voice)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut the sergeant, he pulled my heart out and killed me.\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure about that, Private Jenkins?\u201d (F. voice)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Jenkins carefully turned his head and saw, standing beside him, was the very man that killed him. Then, he felt for his heart, and was amazed to find his chest intact. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry kid,\u201d the man said. \u201cIf you think finding your heart in your chest is amazing, imagine what it is like to find yourself alive after you\u2019ve been burnt to ashes.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe werewolf then placed some fatigues on the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll help you get dressed if you feel that you need some help,\u201d he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I\u2019ll wait before getting dressed, um, sir,\u201d Jenkins said, placing his head on a pillow. \u201cBut, I do want to know, what was that that I experienced, and why did what you did seem, and feel, so real?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt seemed real because you thought it was. As for what it was, it was a bit of magic.\u201d (Werewolf officer)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMagic, what do you mean by that sir?\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe moment that you entered, you were knocked out and carried to this room. The medic-mage found out that the race that you feared the most were werewolves. That was why all the instructors you saw were werewolves. As for me kid, you and me have quite a bit in common.\u201d (Werewolf officer)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike what Sir?\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I know what it is like to lose a loved one, especially a sister.\u201d (Werewolf officer)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean by that, sir?\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy father was a werewolf, my mother, she was human. I was the firstborn child, and I was born in my werewolf form. My sister was born seven years later, and she was human, with no werewolf form at all. Well, I was seventeen when it happened. We were walking home from school when I stopped to chat with a friend of mine. I had told her to wait, but she always had a slight hearing problem. By the time I was done talking to my friend, she was long gone. I rushed to find her, tracking her down with my nose. But, when I finally found her, well, it wasn\u2019t pretty. Her clothes were torn and covered in blood, and then I saw him, a rich, fat, bastard, who had my sister\u2019s blood on his lips, licking them clean. When I confronted him, he just laughed, so I killed him, in anger and hatred. I pulled my sister\u2019s remains from his stomach, and buried them, stole a blank tombstone, and carved her name into it.\u201d (Werewolf officer)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, the werewolf started to sob. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI should have never stopped to talk to my friend. It was about this girl he had slept with anyways,\u201d he said. \u201cAnyways, the authorities found me huddled over my sister\u2019s grave. They arrested me and dragged me before the judge, who sentenced me to be executed within the month. However, my father had a friend in the military and went to him for help. Well it turns out, that if one is owned by a member of the military, or is part of it, they are exempt from having to follow civilian law. Of course, as I said before, I was seventeen, and you need to be eighteen to enlist. So, I had to choose between being my father\u2019s friend\u2019s slave, and being executed. Now, I\u2019ll be honest, I didn\u2019t want to join the military, or have any part of it. However, I wanted to live, so I took his offer. However, like the judge and the man who had ate my sister, he was a dragon, and while I could deal with the man, I could not deal with the dragon. But, that\u2019s enough about that sort of stuff, for now. What you saw from the moment you entered the barracks until now was, in simple terms, a very realistic dream.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, if the whole thing was a dream, how long have I been asleep?\u201d (Jenkins) <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot even an hour, the record, previously, was twelve.\u201d (Werewolf officer)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what was with all of the deception?\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe military wants soldiers that care about their squad mates for who they are, and not what they are. Most of those other recruits you saw in your dream are not even human, not even those with magic in them. Now, tell me. Why were you willing to throw your life away like that?\u201d (Werewolf officer)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell the guy next to me seemed to be getting tired and was several dozen pushups behind me, and I cared about him.\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that recruit next to you, the one that you gave your \u2018life\u2019 for, is actually a dragon.\u201d (Werewolf officer)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean that, I did that for a dragon. I thought that he was a human like me.\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, that\u2019s the beauty of the magic, the instructors are the race you fear the most, and the other recruits are of your race. Also, it is safer than if we just put you all out on the grounds and expected you all to behave yourselves, because by the time the instructors got there, half of the recruits would have been eaten, and Uncle Sam doesn\u2019t like to lose potential soldiers like that. With this, you learn to feel sympathetic towards the others, and willing to do whatever it takes to help them out, including giving your life for another.\u201d (Werewolf officer)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, where are the others?\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, they are fine, each in their own rooms, with someone watching them for safety reasons.\u201d (Werewolf officer)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the man started to cough, which lasted a few seconds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry about that,\u201d he said. \u201cMy throat\u2019s a little sore. It makes it so that I end up sounding like my father, instead of my mother.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Jenkins took a closer look at the man and was that he was really a she. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGosh,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought that you were a guy.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou won\u2019t when you see my human form,\u201d the werewolf said, hunching over, as the tail, fur, claws, and muzzle began to recede into his, no, her, body, and she became somewhat shorter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you tell now?\u201d she asked, with her voice still rough, and her uniform threatening to fall off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah,\u201d Jenkins said, as he looked her over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, the woman just smiled, as she shifted back into her werewolf form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI noticed that you liked what you saw,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe if you make it through training, you and I can go out to dinner. But for now, I am your superior officer, and, while Uncle Sam doesn\u2019t mind relationships between one soldier and another one, he frowns upon those between those of different ranks, especially when they are part of the same unit. After all, sometimes superior officers have to issue orders, that could get those of the lower ranks killed, and it would be an emotional difficulty for them to issue an order that could result in the death of a loved one, which is why that sort of relationship, while not against the regulations, is highly discouraged.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cSo, what happens now?\u201d Jenkins asked, as he sat up, and, with the werewolf\u2019s help, started to get dressed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell first off,\u201d the werewolf said. \u201cYou will be taken to the Mess Hall, where you will get some real food in you, and meet up with a few of the real instructors. Once the rest of the recruits wake up, and are briefed, then your real training will begin.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy the way, is Bloodtooth really your name?\u201d Jenkins asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah,\u201d Bloodtooth said. \u201cAlthough I will tell you this, I don\u2019t like to get blood on my teeth or claws for that matter. Then again, father was a vegetarian. He taught me to not take another person\u2019s life, to eat them as if they were food, unless there was absolutely no other choice. Of course, believe it or not, the military is the safest job one can get.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean? Don\u2019t soldiers have to fight wars that could get them killed?\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue, but, even the worst human soldier, who gets the worst scores in marksmanship, hand-to-hand combat, stealth tactics, fails written tests, and everything else, is not to be harmed by any civilian. Also, any family they have is under the military\u2019s protection as well. Also, if you get an honorable discharge, you are still protected, even as a civilian.\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy is that?\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSimple, to do something that may prevent a soldier, especially one that volunteered, from doing his duty, is considered an act of treason. After all, if you heard that a loved one of yours was raped or murdered, you would be more fixated on revenge than doing your job. Also, if a civilian kills, or eats you, they will be treated as a traitor of the highest order, even if you were not a soldier anymore, as long as you had been given an honorable discharge. Of course, there are rules that have to be followed.\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike what?\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, for instance, a soldier that rapes another person, even a civilian, is drummed out of the military, and will no longer be under the military\u2019s protection. In fact, should he be accused of committing a crime in the vicinity of a soldier, that man will find himself dragged here, or the nearest barracks, tried, and if found guilty, executed. Though, if he is found innocent, he still won\u2019t be released into the civilian population. Instead, he will end up as one of those who help grow the food for the base.\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, what do you mean by that?\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have recruiters that go to the prisons and buy prisoners that are being held there. Now mind you, these recruiters are the most scary looking, and acting, of all recruiters. However, if you are a prisoner, they are your best chance at freedom. They will go through your record, and if you didn\u2019t commit rape, or murder someone, unless it was for a very good reason, he will say, \u2018Do you choose to be food, or, a soldier, meat?\u2019 Well, most of the prisoners elect to be soldiers, although those who decide otherwise, for whatever reason, end up as, well, as farmers, in a sense. However, if you just raped or murdered someone, he will say, \u2018Do you want to be turned into food, or grow the food, scumbag?\u2019 Needless to say, most of those guys choose to grow the food. As for the very few who don\u2019t, well, you don\u2019t want to know, though we try to make their deaths quick, and only the officers, not the enlisted men, are allowed to even eat those people.\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, you guys don\u2019t really eat other people?\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cYah, however we do eat others, on occasion. Traitors are usually those that non-human soldiers are allowed to eat. Also, if a soldier kills another soldier, he will be eaten by that soldier\u2019s squad mates. However, there is an exception to this, should a soldier take the life of someone under the age of eighteen, even by eating them as part of a meal, should another soldier see him, or her, do this, that soldier is authorized to kill that person, as that person is not a soldier anymore, and the body is to be marked as such.\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Bloodtooth made a fist and hit her left shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll soldiers are given a mark on their left shoulder,\u201d she said. \u201cIt means that you are in the military, in any branch, Army, Navy, Marines, Air Force, or Coast Guard. When you choose the branch you want to join, an additional mark is put on, followed by any promotions you get. If you get an honorable discharge, you will be marked as such. However, if you get a dishonorable discharge, every soldier in the squad will, with a claw, talon, or knife, cut into your shoulder, giving you an \u2018X\u2019. Kill an underage civilian though, after the other soldier kills you, and gets the kid out of your stomach if you ate it alive, he will carve an \u2018X\u2019 through the whole mark, and effectively erase your records and achievements.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, this mark, it basically shows that you are a member of the military?\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right kid, and mind you, when they put it on you, you will think that every thing else was nothing compared to the pain that you get when they put it on.\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Bloodtooth pulled up the sleeve on her left shoulder, exposing what looked like a cattle brand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey heat an iron to one thousand degrees Celsius, strap you down to a table, press the iron to your shoulder, and hold it there for thirty seconds, and you won\u2019t be given any anesthetics or painkillers,\" she said. \"Also, no medic is to do more than to cover it with gauze to prevent infection. You will have to deal with the pain on your own. Also, the same thing occurs when you choose the branch you want to serve, and with each promotion that you earn.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I doubt I\u2019ll get many of those,\u201d Jenkins said, dejectedly and lowering his head slightly. \u201cAfter all, I\u2019m just a human.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually,\u201d Bloodtooth said, holding Jenkins\u2019s head up. \u201cUnlike most militaries in which, to them, might equals rank, in our military, a human could end up leading a platoon consisting of mostly giants, and they are expected to obey him, or her, as if he, or she, was another giant, and an even bigger one at that. In this country\u2019s military, in any branch of the service, merit equals rank. In fact, rumor has it, at least one of the branches is ultimately, at the highest level, is lead by a normal human, and one with absolutely no magic at that.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you serious?\u201d Jenkins asked, with amazement in his voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t know,\u201d Bloodtooth said, lowering the sleeve on her shoulder. \u201cMy clearance is not high enough to give me more than names, ranks, combat information, branch of service and birthdates. Then again, unless they tell me, I don\u2019t even know the ranks of my squad mates. Here on the barracks, or in combat, the only difference between uniforms is if they are worn by a member of another branch, and even then, only the emblem on the hat is what\u2019s different, at least that\u2019s the way it is in the barracks. In combat, you wear the clothes that fit the environment. Out there in public, or on parade, though, full uniforms are what the rules state. However, while medals can be worn, rank is never to be shown, not to anyone outside of the military, not even your family. Then again, people would take offence if a lieutenant, who was a human, stole their meal, a human child, from them. Of course, the anger that the man was human would be second to the fact that the man is a soldier, which would be second to the fact that he was a lieutenant. That is why; if you are off base, stick with others from the barracks. Should you see something that infuriates you, like someone trying to eat a child, let the others know. At that moment, ranks are told, and the one with the highest rank will lead the group over, and \u2018confiscate\u2019 the child. However, if your rank is the highest, the man next in rank will use it, and your name, as you are the real leader in that situation, and he, or she, is just a stand in, a decoy if you would. This is for your protection, because out there, most non-humans will not respect the requests of a human, yet alone an order from one. Also, if that civilian comes here looking for you, everyone, and their squad mate, will claim to be you, in name and rank. Then again, they won\u2019t even bother asking a human who they are, or their rank. It\u2019s a very useful tactic. As for the child, we will keep it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy would you keep the child?\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell first off, if that child was sold to a restaurant, or some such place, it\u2019s dead to the rest of the world anyways. Second, the streets are no place for children. Third, the kid deserves the best care that they can be given, even if it is that of being raised by a bunch of soldiers that the rest of the world hates. Fourth, the kid could make an excellent soldier, and can officially join up when he or she turns eighteen. After all, that kid may not have much fear of others, just because of their race, at any rate. Of course, we\u2019d have to send him or her to a different barracks, so that the instructors here won\u2019t be tempted to go easy on the kid during training. After all, we don\u2019t want the other recruits to get jealous of any of the others. Now, can you stand up?\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think so,\u201d Jenkins said, as he placed his feet on the floor and tried to stand up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Bloodtooth said. \u201cNow, walk up to that black brick on the wall, in a straight line, place your hand on it, and walk back.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenkins looked at the wall that she pointed at. There was a single black brick on the entire white wall, at the very top of the wall in fact. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you serious about me touching it?\u201d he asked. \u201cThis ceiling must be at least sixteen feet high.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, everyone has to do something like this,\u201d Bloodtooth said. \u201cThe military wants soldiers who can think about ways to handle things that, at first, seems impossible. Of course, if you can\u2019t do it, well, maybe you don\u2019t belong here.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Bloodtooth got out a stopwatch and said, \u201cOn the count of three, start. One, two\u2026. Three!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Bloodtooth pushed a button and Jenkins started walking, and found out that he was walking very slowly, as if his feet were encased in cement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he looked down, he saw the floor was really a strip of paper that covered a thick layer of mud that reached halfway up to his knee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI forgot to mention that the floor was really mud,\u201d Bloodtooth said, covering up a bit of laughter with a coughing fit. \u201cHowever, I will warn you, the mud will get a lot deeper the further you get.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re serious?\u201d Jenkins asked, looking back at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBloodtooth just nodded her head, showing little emotion, though privately, she was a little bit amused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Jenkins looked back at the wall and started rubbing his chin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know this much,\u201d he said. \u201cI probably won\u2019t be able to reach that spot on my own, so what is there that I can use here to help me.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have every thing that you need already in the room,\u201d Bloodtooth said, watching him, barely looking at the time on the stopwatch. \u201cYou can use anything you want to help you reach it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s see what I have to work with,\u201d Jenkins said, looking around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, he saw an old ladder which had a length of ten feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat might help,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, it is still too short, especially with the mud.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, besides the ladder, the medical table, which was attached to the floor, and himself, there was only one other thing there, and that was Bloodtooth herself. In her current form, she was easily eight feet tall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure that I can use anything in this room?\u201d he asked, with the beginnings of a plan in his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you suggesting?\u201d she asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I know that I can\u2019t do it alone,\u201d he said. \u201cThat ladder might help, but even without the mud, it would still be too short. That table is bolted to the floor, which means; the only other thing that I could possibly use\u2026. would be you, madam.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Bloodtooth smiled and said, putting the stopwatch into her pocket, \u201cThat is correct Private. I am the only other thing that you could possibly use, and you can. Now, what is it that you need me to do so that your goal can be reached?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell first of, could you get that ladder? I\u2019ll need it for my plan to have a chance of working,\u201d Jenkins said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, anything else?\u201d Bloodtooth asked, as she grabbed the ladder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I need to see if I can get to the wall on my own first,\u201d Jenkins said. \u201cIf not, you will need to carry me. When we get to the wall, you will climb up, with me on your back, and maybe I can reach it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot a bad idea Private,\u201d Bloodtooth said, with a smile, as she walked into the mud, carrying the ladder. \u201cMost people don\u2019t think to ask for the instructor to give them some assistance with the challenge, until about two hours, or so, into the challenge.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that some other record that I broke?\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll say so, usually it is when one has about given up hope that they ask for help.\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Bloodtooth stood next to Jenkins and said, with a smile, \u201cLead on, commander.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the pair walked forward, the mud kept on getting higher and higher, until it got to the point that Jenkins could not put another step forward, without eating some of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\u201d he said. \u201cNow that I know that I can\u2019t go any further on my own, I need to get on your back.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Bloodtooth said, as she stood in front of him, with her back facing him. \u201cLet me know when you are ready.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he got on, Jenkins gave Bloodtooth the go-ahead to walk further. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time that Bloodtooth got close enough to place the ladder down, so that she could climb it, the mud was up to her chin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Jenkins said. \u201cLet\u2019s see just how far it is that you can climb up.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she got as far as she could safely climb, Jenkins saw that there was eleven feet between him and the brick he had to reach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis might be tricky,\u201d he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy is that?\u201d Bloodtooth asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to have to stand on your shoulders, at the very least, so that I even have a chance,\" Jenkis said. \"Can you hold still that long?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll try, but be careful,\" Bloodtooth said. \"Sudden impacts hurt, and it would be difficult for me to get you out of this mud if you fell and sank into it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI kind of figured that,\u201d Jenkins said, as he started his climb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, when Jenkins stood on Bloodtooth\u2019s shoulders, and reached as far as he could, he found himself two feet short. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know standing on her head and jumping up might work,\u201d he thought. \u201cBut the sudden shift in weight could break the ladder, causing her to fall and be buried in that mud, which would also be my fate afterwards. However, the other way would give me plenty of reach, without jumping, but it would be risky in its own ways.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then looked down, and thought about the two plans in his head, and decided that the second would be safer, for Bloodtooth at any rate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey,\u201d he asked carefully. \u201cCould you tilt your head up and open up your mouth?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do you ask for me to do that?\u201d Bloodtooth asked, with a bit of amazement going through her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d Jenkins said, slowly. \u201cIf I were to do my one idea, both of us would be buried in that mud. With this, well, at least you might make it if I fell.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand,\u201d Bloodtooth said, tilting her head up and opening her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jenkins looked down into that dark and saliva dripping cavern, he gulped nervously, as he slowly put a foot on the top of both Bloodtooth\u2019s upper and lower jaws. He then slowly reached up, and just as he touched the brick, a part of the ladder broke, causing him to slip and fall halfway down Bloodtooth\u2019s throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold on kid,\u201d he heard Bloodtooth say, in a muffled voice. \u201cI\u2019ll help you get out. Just stay calm and don\u2019t move.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then saw, as his head and arms were still outside of Bloodtooth\u2019s jaws, as well as felt, her beginning to slowly, and carefully, climb down the broken ladder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen there was a rung that he could reach, and hold onto, Bloodtooth said, \u201cGrab onto the rung. I don\u2019t know how much longer I can hold you like this before either you fall or my swallowing instincts take over.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Jenkins grabbed the rung, with both hands, and waited as Bloodtooth climbed down the ladder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen his feet were out of her mouth, they both breathed a sigh of relief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was close,\u201d Jenkins said. \u201cMaybe too close.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll say,\u201d Bloodtooth said. \u201cIt took me all of my control not to gulp you down.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me guess, the skin on my bare feet was tasty.\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah, very tasty,\u201d Bloodtooth said, as she gave a nervous chuckle, as Jenkins climbed back onto her back.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cI think we best get a shower and change our clothes,\u201d Bloodtooth said, as she walked out of the mud, setting Jenkins down when it got shallow enough for him to walk. \u201cAfter all, soldiers should appear, somewhat, presentable, especially for the commander of the base. Now that guy is a real hard-ass.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, could you get away with that if he heard you say that?\u201d asked Jenkins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHell, I could take a page from your speech and say the whole damn military could go to hell and I wouldn\u2019t get punished for it,\u201d Bloodtooth said, with a chuckle. \u201cHell, even a human like you would get away with it, if you felt it was true. In fact, you could say that I was a good for nothing, hot headed, goddamned bitch, and you would be fine, though I might feel offended by that. After all, you need to learn not to respond to those sorts of things.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow come I\u2019d have to learn not to respond to that?\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s just say that sometimes, while in peacekeeping operations, people will hurl worse things than insults about your family and garbage, though if they grab one of your squad mates, so that they can tear him to pieces and throw them at you, go and try to get him back, alive and in one piece as it were. Of course, a few of your other squad mates would help you out if that occurs.\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHas that ever happened to you?\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, while I wasn\u2019t grabbed myself, a human under my command was, over in Transylvania. I had to bust a couple of vampires\u2019 heads before they decided it was best to let him go. Thankfully, aside from a few scratches, bruises, and a broken nose, the kid was okay. Of course, the locals started calling me something that loosely translates into, \u2018She who bloodies her claws for humans\u2019, because I tore the head off of the vampire that had originally grabbed him, with my own two bare hands.\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy did you do that?\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSimple, your squad mates are like your brothers and sisters, and they have to look out for one another. After all, didn\u2019t you feel terrible when your sister was raped and murdered by the monster that did it?\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah, I wanted to kill him, but I never found him.\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it would be the same thing for your squad mates. In fact, there is a standing rule that states, \u2018No one, dead, alive, or otherwise, is to be left in the hands of the enemy.\u2019 It would be your squad\u2019s job to get you, or your corpse, and get you back to the base. If you are dead, the medics will try to revive you, which just so happens to have a seventy percent chance of bringing one back to full life, for humans anyways, especially if all of your organs are there.\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, what about the other thirty percent?\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cForty-nine percent chance that you end up a zombie, forty-nine percent you will turn out to be a vampire.\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, what about the remainder of that?\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s just say that the demons in the military will not exorcise your spirit, as long as you still follow the rules of the military.\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, in other words, I\u2019d turn up completely dead, and not even become an undead person.\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah, that\u2019s right.\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what would happen to my body if that happens?\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell first of, you\u2019d have a military funeral, with everyone in the barracks marching through town, with your squad mates carrying the casket containing your body, and then they would march back to the barracks, where one of three things will occur. The first option would be to burry your body on what we call \u2018Hero\u2019s Hill\u2019, where no one would be allowed to disturb your body\u2019s resting spot, on pain of being eaten by your squad mates. The second option would be to cremate you and scatter the ashes on the grounds.\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, what about the third option?\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow that is something really special,\u201d Bloodtooth said, with a smile. \u201cIf you gave them permission to do so, your squad mates are allowed to eat your remains. That way, in a sense, you would still be with them, long after your soul decides to cross over.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy is that?\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt shows that you care about them, for who they are. Also, they are to eat your body with respect, especially if your spirit is there, watching them.\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, if I end up dead, and come back as a spirit, what would I be able to do then?\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere are at least three things that you could do. The first is to help recruits get used to shooting live rounds at \u2018live\u2019 targets, as anyone can shoot a paper target, but things are different when the target is rushing at you and you have to shoot it before it reaches you. The second is to scout for your squad mates, and search for things like booby traps, ambushes, and see if an area is safe in general. The third and sometimes most risky job though, would be to spy upon the enemy, especially if they have a demon in their group.\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAren\u2019t demons generally only in Hell, and don\u2019t they have a single ruler that they owe allegiance to?\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue, but as long as they obey the rules of Hell, and drag the occasional evil soul, or person, there to burn, they are free to do as they please. In fact, the chaplain on the base is a demon. It makes service interesting when you think about it, considering that the guy who is blessing your soul is someone who would ordinarily want to make it suffer in the eternal flames of Hell. Of course, mind you, don\u2019t say the word \u2018saint\u2019 and his name in the same sentence, and especially don\u2019t say \u2018saint\u2019 and follow it with his name. The guy nearly took the head off of a recruit that did that, a few years back mind you. Thankfully, the recruit was all right, but when the commander of the base asked why the chaplain reacted in such a manner, the guy said that the recruit was trying to kill him by saying \u2018saint\u2019 before he said his name. Well, the guy was right, because if you say \u2018saint\u2019 followed by the name of a demon, that demon will die, so it was considered an understandable action of self-defense. So, to make sure that that didn\u2019t happen again, the chaplain was asked to use a nickname, so that he would be alright. He agreed, and let the commander say saint followed by the nickname, as a test. Well, he was alright, which means that the guy is still our chaplain.\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Bloodtooth lead Jenkins to a room and opened a closet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat size clothes and shoes do you wear?\u201d she asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, that would be an extra large shirt, 40by30 pants, and a size ten and a half E-wide shoes, all in human shape and form.\u201d Jenkins said, as he looked into the closet, which was full of clothes that had a basic camouflage pattern. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you like a pair of underwear and socks to go with that?\u201d Bloodtooth asked, holding the articles of clothing that Jenkins had forgotten to mention, which were also in a camouflage pattern. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I would, madam,\u201d Jenkins said, a blush forming on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Bloodtooth started to cough, to cover for a fit of the giggles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s an understandable mistake that we all do, from time to time, myself included, especially during the first couple of weeks of training, especially in the presence of others, and especially when one, or more, of the others is of the opposite gender, especially when that person is your superior, like I am to you,\u201d she said, getting the clothes that he had asked for, as well as those for herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, I should warn you,\u201d she said. \u201cThe showers are unisex, which means that soldiers of all sexes, male, female, hermaphroditic, or even those with absolutely no gender at all, can bathe in them. However, unless you give them permission to, they will keep to themselves, and won\u2019t try to have sex with you, here or any other place. Of course, they may ask you to help them out, from time to time, with getting washed. If you accept, they may have you wash some more, intimate, parts of their bodies. However, unless you give them permission to, like I said before, they won\u2019t try to do anything related to sexual behavior, though you may have to clean yourself off afterwards.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, in that case,\u201d Jenkins said. \u201cI hope that the ones that ask are female.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me guess, straight.\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah, I had a bad experience with a male teacher in high school.\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWas sexual education class going on during it?\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah, the teacher used me for demonstration purposes for males who like to, well, place it up someone\u2019s ass, as it were.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me guess, the guy was a werewolf.\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah, I couldn\u2019t sit for a week afterwards.\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBe lucky that you were not a were-creature who was placed under a curse that made you, well, human, when a female teacher shoved you up her vagina to demonstrate for those who wanted to do that option with someone.\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid that happen to you?\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah, father nearly ate her when I told him what happened. Yet, just like what happened later, the person who did it was a dragon.\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, what about your father\u2019s friend? You said that he was a dragon.\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTechnically, he was a were-dragon, with a split-person disorder.\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you mean split-personality?\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(The following is Bloodtooth speaking))<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I meant what I said, a split-person. The guy is basically two people in one, a human and a dragon. During the day, he is a human like you, but at night, he turns into a dragon. Thankfully, they share the same eyes, in which, if you are a friend to the human side, the dragon won\u2019t harm you, too much. However, if you harm the human, you signed your death warrant, because the dragon will kill and eat you. Unfortunately, the dragon likes to have sex, a lot, and while I was with him, the dragon had sex with me, every other night. However, the human side was sorry about what the other did to me, and honestly tried to make up for it, like making me breakfast after those nights, and taking me out to places, so that I could relax, and temporarily forget about the previous night, though the dragon was nice enough to let me get some sleep every other night, as there were plenty of female soldiers that wanted to be in his bed, or, if they were quite large, wanted him in their bed. Now, while he had sex with me, he didn\u2019t try to force me to, as long as I was up and walking around. But once I had sat down, or was laid out on the floor, so I could rest my legs, it was as if I had said, \u2018Okay, you have my permission. You can have sex with me now.\u2019 Although, there was something that set him apart from that one teacher of mine, he would be careful, and try to be gentle with me. Then again, with a beauty like mine, he would have looked like a fool, to not be gentle, otherwise.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, do you hate him for what he did to you?\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n\u201cWell, he did save my life, so I can thank him for that, on two separate occasions. The first of course, was buying me from prison, while he was in his human form. The second time though, happened off base, shortly after I had passed basic training. I was at home, telling my family the news when it happened. Some friends of that dragon that I had killed tossed a fire bomb into the place, and set it ablaze. I managed to get my mother, father, and my step-sister, as mother and father had adopted a girl a year after I was born, out, when they stepped from the shadows, four large and powerful dragons. Well, my priority was to protect my family from further injury, so I tried to keep them from them. I had to fight those four dragons to protect the people that I cared about. My entire left arm was shattered, my right leg crushed, and my right arm was torn off. However, I fought on, hopping on one leg and snapping at them, as well as biting them. When they finally managed to pin me down, he showed up, in his entire draconic splendor, with the guys that had been chosen to be my squad mates, the guys that I had spent the most time with. Those guys fought and killed those four dragons, which were severally injured by the time that they showed up. Well, needless to say, the barracks had plenty of dragon stew for the next couple of days, quite tasty to, come to think of it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, here\u2019s a question,\u201d Jenkins said. \u201cWith all of those injuries, including you arm being ripped off, why does it look like that didn\u2019t happen to you?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA very damn good medic-mage patched me right up,\u201d Bloodtooth replied. \u201cThat guy could take someone, whose head had been severed from their body, get the parts back into position, and fully restore them to full life, without even a scar to be seen. A guy like that is very handy, especially in an area of combat, and that\u2019s even better when there are, at least, two of them nearby. Of course, the one you may have with your squad may not be that skilled, but he, or she, will be able to keep you, and the others, alive until you are back at the base, where more skilled ones will take over from there. Now I will tell you, when it comes to the wounded, their word is law, and their rank is, in a sense, above the commander of the base in those matters. Also, they are the last guys that you want to mess with, because there is one spell that they can, and will use, if you try to harm their patients, de-heal, as I call it. Basically, every cut you ever got, every bone you ever broke, as well as every other injury, will all reoccur the moment that that spell is cast, which will leave the person, very dead. So, if you see one working on someone, as accidents do occur and the occasional recruit is killed during some mishap, do not bother them, unless you want to spend some time helping the medical instructor teach the potential medics. Knew a guy who spent more time as a corpse, or in pieces, than alive and intact, because he bumped into the chief medic on the base, when the medic was trying to pick up the pieces of another recruit, because the grenade that he was trying to throw got stuck to his hand, so he had to quickly get on the ground, with the grenade under his stomach, to protect the others from the shrapnel. Thankfully, they both turned out to be alright when it came time to graduate.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, don\u2019t mess with the medics.\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah, don\u2019t mess with the medics.\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Bloodtooth opened the door to the showers and the pair entered.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Jenkins walked in, he saw, on at least three of the sides, showerheads between six and thirty feet above the floor, hundreds of them at that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn,\u201d he said. \u201cHow many people can take a shower in this one room?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if all of them are the heights for the different showerheads, two thousand people total, at once. Of course, as people normally don\u2019t want others looming over them, also taking a shower, you may only, on normal occasions, see about a third of that using this room at the same time. Of course, even then, you best be careful, this floor can be very slippery when you have a lot of soap, shampoo, conditioner, and water, as well as a few other things, on it,\u201d Bloodtooth said, as she placed the clean, and dry, outfits on a shelf, and placed a couple of cards on them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlways mark your clothes kid,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause when this place gets full of steam, even those with the best of sight have trouble seeing clearly, and could take someone else\u2019s clothes by accident. Each race has a different color, orange for humans, blue for werewolves, and so on. Also, there is a sign for gender on them, a simple stick figure for males, and a stick figure with a dress for females, and so on. That way, even if you somehow managed to grab the wrong set of clothes, at least it was those of another male human, and not that of a female werewolf.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, where does one undress, and place the dirty clothes?\u201d Jenkins asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBloodtooth pointed at a hole in the wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou will toss the previous day\u2019s outfit into that hole, so it will be sent to the laundry room and cleaned for use the next day,\u201d she said. \u201cAs for getting undress, well, the moment that you set the current day\u2019s clothes on the shelf and mark them, start stripping.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she pulled off her shirt, which she had already unbuttoned, and tossed it into the hole, which was quickly followed by her pants, shoes, socks, and her unmentionables. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she turned around to face him, Jenkins felt his jaw drop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see that you like what you see,\u201d Bloodtooth said, as she walked over to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh ha,\u201d Jenkins said, lowly, as he nodded his head up and down, slowly, as if he was a school boy back in high school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, in that case, hurry up and get undressed and get your dirty clothes tossed into the chute,\u201d she said, walking towards the far side. \u201cAnd maybe I\u2019ll let you see more.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Bloodtooth turned a knob, which turned all the shower heads on, causing the room to quickly fill with steam, and started to shift into her human form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Jenkins undressed as fast as he could, and tossed the mud, and saliva, covered outfit into the chute and ran into the steam, with some hope of seeing Bloodtooth in her human form, and naked at that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as he got to her, Bloodtooth was already shifting back to her werewolf form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a little slow,\u201d she said. \u201cBut don\u2019t worry, you will have plenty of chances to catch me naked while I\u2019m in my human form, and you will get faster with training.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she started to walk towards him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course,\u201d she said. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t a bad time for a fifty meter dash.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Jenkins asked. \u201cI was being timed?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes and no,\u201d Bloodtooth said, tapping her head. \u201cI can easily keep very accurate timing in my head, and the distance between the shelves and here is fifty meters. Of course, times for running in the showers do not count on the recruit\u2019s records. But it will help you get the best spots when it comes to taking a shower. Now, would you hurry up and get cleaned up. I want to introduce you to your other teachers. You will find soap, shampoo and conditioner at arm level at every showerhead.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, where are these best spots that you were telling me about?\u201d Jenkins asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe ones without someone using a higher showerhead,\u201d Bloodtooth said, pointing up. \u201cAnd they are much safer too, less of a chance that someone will fall on you when they slip on the floor, because at one point or another, everyone slips in the showers. Of course, like I said kid, we do have a damn good medic-mage on the base, though you may find yourself seeing a bunch of potential medics taking notes, after you are revived, because that guy will use any incident, that requires him, as a teaching experience for the others, in case they have to deal with something like that. I should know, although, if you are conscious, he will ask you if you wouldn\u2019t mind him letting his students watch him heal you, so they will know what to do in a similar situation. My best advice to you on that is this; allow them to watch, because one of them could get attached to your squad and the more that he or she knows about healing wounds, the better off you and your squad will be.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, if the medic is needed, I\u2019d best let his students watch.\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah, one of them might save your life in the future. Now hurry up. I don\u2019t want to make my one friend, Tiny, impatient waiting for us to show up.\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho\u2019s Tiny?\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly the best damn chef outside of a culinary arts school. That guy could take rotten deer meat and make it taste like the finest venison that is only served in the most expensive of restaurants.\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Bloodtooth smiled and walked towards the front of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be waiting outside the room for you,\u201d she said, as her figure disappeared into the steam. \u201cMake sure that you turn the showers off before you leave. The commander gets a little uptight if they are kept running when the room is empty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout ten minutes later, Jenkins and Bloodtooth are walking towards a room, which has mouth watering smells coming from it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, All-You-Can-Eat Buffet,\u201d Bloodtooth said. \u201cName a dish, within reason of course, and if it is not there, Tiny will make it himself. The guy is a master of cooking up good tasting meals.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two walked in, Jenkins found his nose being assaulted with dozens of wondrous scents. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSmells good,\u201d he said, with wonder and amazement in his voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cImagine what it is like for me,\u201d Bloodtooth said, tapping the side of her nose. \u201cAfter all, a werewolf\u2019s sense of smell is a hundred times sharper than that of a human\u2019s, at the very least.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess it must smell like heaven to you then.\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah, if they don\u2019t serve sentient beings there.\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, um, what about here? You\u2019ve said that people on the base do eat others on occasion.\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah, but it isn\u2019t often that we execute someone for treason in the military. You\u2019d have to go off base for that, but you would have to follow the rules, spare the children, and basically put them someplace where they would be safe, when no one is watching, and offer the others the choice to serve in the military, and should they take the offer, stash them someplace safe, pay the bill, and leave without saying a word, and drop the kid, or new recruit, off before the second-in-command of the base, explain the situation, and eat at the mess hall. At least, that is what the regulations say.\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean by having the soldiers offering their perspective meals the chance in the military?\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of drilled into their heads that it is disrespectful to eat a defenseless person, even those of the \u2018lowly\u2019 human race. Besides, bringing in new recruits is an easy way to make a slight bonus in one\u2019s paycheck, with an addition of two percent, per new recruit, and an addition of one percent, per child confiscated.\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds like the military frowns upon what most of society sees is just the norm.\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue, but those of us in the business of dishing out death to others, also knows that each life is important. After all, anyone can take life, which even a human could do, but it takes something else to spare someone and offer them a new chance at life.\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you know of any other place that does something like that?\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I heard through the rumor mill that there is this town, where a wealthy size-changing werewolf lives, that there is a no-predation law in effect, due to this werewolf, who, from what I heard, is the principal at the local school, and he is a strict vegetarian.\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow strict are we talking about?\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe guy hasn\u2019t eaten a human as part of a meal since he was seven, which was well over twenty years ago. Well, at least, that\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard. I\u2019ve also heard that he has adopted a human girl, married a human woman, who was his late boss\u2019s daughter, taken control of the three most influential families there, and, in addition to being a one man army, he tries to save everyone that he can. Now, this law that the town supposedly has, while it doesn\u2019t make predation illegal, it makes it so predation is, at the very least, frowned upon, thanks to his efforts.\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds like a guy I\u2019d like to meet,\u201d Jenkins said, as he picked up a plate and started looking at the food being offered on the buffet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan, so many things to choose, but where to start,\u201d Jenkins said, muttering under his breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI heard that,\u201d Bloodtooth said, giving him a gentle slap on the back. \u201cPersonally, I like to start off with a sandwich. Aren\u2019t I correct, Tiny?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, a deep voice says, \u201cWhy if it isn\u2019t my good friend Bloody Teeth. I was wondering when you\u2019d show up. Hey, is that the recruit that broke the commanding officer\u2019s personal record?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah,\u201d Bloodtooth said, looking at no one in particular. \u201cHey, do you know if Doc\u2019s got that lozenge for my throat made yet? I heard that he borrowed some mint from you this morning.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019d have to ask him. He\u2019s sitting at his usual spot.\u201d (Tiny's voice)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Tiny.\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell do you want something to eat first?\u201d (Tiny's voice)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll have just a light meat soup for now. I\u2019ll be at my spot when you get done with it.\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay Bloody Teeth. I\u2019ll get it ready in a jiffy, once this guy tells me what it is he wants.\u201d (Tiny's voice)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell in that case,\u201d Jenkins said, looking around for this mysterious Tiny. \u201cI\u2019ll have a ham and cheese sandwich, with American cheese and white bread.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have one coming down right now, buddy.\u201d (Tiny's voice)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Jenkins heard something creaking, and saw a large hand come down to his level, facing palm side up, with a, relatively, small ham and cheese sandwich, on a plate, on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere yah go,\u201d said the voice. \u201cI hope that you like it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jenkins carefully got the plate, he looked up to see the owner of the hand. Looking down upon him, with a friendly smile, was a two hundred foot tall giant, with three eyes, two being in the same relative places as those of a human, and one above them, in the center of his forehead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, thanks,\u201d Jenkins said, as he carefully walked away from the three eyed giant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d the giant said, as it placed something to cover the obvious hole in the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jenkins walked towards where Bloodtooth had sat down, he could feel everyone\u2019s eyes looking at him, as the room, which was previously busy with light chatter, was now as silent as the preverbal septic system that many humans found themselves being flushed into on a daily basis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow long did Doc say that he was under?\u201d asked one voice, quietly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI heard him say, \u2018Forty-three minutes, fifty-three and seven one hundredths of a second\u2019,\u201d said another voice, also as quiet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell what about the intelligence test?\u201d (First voice)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, given the fact that he and Bloodtooth are here now, I\u2019d say that, if anything, he could, at the very least, make a good squad leader, maybe even higher.\u201d (Second voice)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow high do you think that he could get?\u201d (First voice)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHell, for all I know, all the way to the top.\u201d (Second voice)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn, you can\u2019t be serious?\u201d (First voice)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve checked the footage from both the kid\u2019s dream spell, and the room after he woke up. The kid\u2019s got courage, and the willingness to risk his life for the sake of others. You really should see how, with Bloodtooth\u2019s help, he touched the brick, as well as what happened afterwards. Personally, I know that I would have been terrified if I was put in that situation, but he managed to stay calm throughout the whole thing.\u201d (Second voice)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy, what happened?\u201d (First voice)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee the footage buddy. I\u2019ve got it on me now.\u201d (Second voice)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn,\u201d the first person says, a minute later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn is right,\u201d says the second person. \u201cThe kid took the lesser evil, which put him at risk at being Bloodtooth\u2019s meal, instead of the one that would have killed both of them.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, do you think he\u2019s anything like, you know, him?\u201d (First voice)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCould be, the kid is his great-grandson. Also, if you look in his eyes, that same spark is there, a willingness to do whatever is right for the wellbeing of others.\u201d (Second voice)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust like him?\u201d (First voice)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he made general before he died. Now, that\u2019s enough about him. Let\u2019s get back to our game; I believe it to be your move Jethro.\u201d (Second voice)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn that case, it looks like my dragon Knight just ate your human Pawn, and now, your king is in check.\u201d (First voice, Jethro)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah, but you just left yours wide open, I win.\u201d (Second voice)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn, why do I always seem to beat everyone but you?\u201d (Jethro)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI had to know plenty of strategies if I wanted to survive the Chess tournaments when I was in high school and in the Chess Club.\u201d (Second voice)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me guess, the losers of each game were eaten.\u201d (Jethro)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah, by the opposing team\u2019s coach.\u201d (Second voice)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds like yours must have loved you then.\u201d (Jethro)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, in fact, he had us so well trained, that even those who had just joined each year were not eaten. Needless to say, we always brought home the trophy.\u201d (Second voice)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, who was the best player of your club?\u201d (Jethro)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d have to say that the coach was. After the big tournament one year, the club had a friendly competition amongst itself, with the losers having to be the winner of that game\u2019s servant for a week, and the ultimate winner having to face off against the coach. Well, I was the ultimate winner, so I had to face him. We played for eleven straight hours, non-stop, before he gave me a smile and said, \u2018Game\u2019s yours kid,\u2019 and stood up, and walked away. However, as my club mates were cheering at my apparent victory, I looked at the board and saw that I would have lost in three more moves.\u201d (Second voice)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn, he just got up and walked away when he could have beaten you.\u201d (Jethro)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, taught me to learn how to fight offensively, with a defensive mindset.\u201d (Second voice)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo wonder the Brass likes to talk to you. I bet that they used some of your chess tactics to deal with that one insurgent group last month.\u201d (Jethro)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe, but while they may ask me for advice from time to time, I am not privy to their discussions.\u201d (Second voice)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah, well, on to the next round, and this time I\u2019ll be black, and you can be white.\u201d (Jethro)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s fine with me Jethro, fine with me.\u201d (Second voice)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Jenkins was still feeling the gaze of everyone upon him, and saw several of the others looking at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy does it feel like everyone is watching me?\u201d he asked himself, while talking out loud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s because they expect great things from you,\u201d Bloodtooth said, as she slowly ate/sipped away at her soup. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Jenkins asked. \u201cThe only person in my family that was a soldier was my great-grandfather and he died a month before my grandfather was born. All anyone ever said about him was that he assaulted his commanding officer, but was killed in the line of duty before he could be executed for it, and somehow saved the life of the officer that he had assaulted while doing so.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat would be the truth,\u201d Bloodtooth said. \u201cHowever, what he did, it started something that affected how this country\u2019s military ran from then on, and still runs under.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(The following is being spoken by Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n\u201cBack then, an ordinary human like you would be sent to the front lines, with little to no training. You\u2019d be nothing more than food, or cannon fodder. However, when he stepped foot onto the base that he was assigned; he started a social revolution of the military. He more or less made the others realize that their time would be better spent if they went out and killed enemy soldiers for their meals than it would be to eat the others on the base. Well one day, while they were in the trenches, the commanding officer, a werewolf, told the other soldiers to get a human for him to eat. Well, there were no prisoners being held for that purpose, which meant that they\u2019d have to give him one of the humans, of their own military, for him to eat. They went to your relative for help. He told them to take him before the commanding officer, and leave the two of them alone. They did that, and just as they left, he broke the officer\u2019s nose, causing the man to chase him into a set of woods. Now mind you, these woods were full of landmines that could blow a giant\u2019s leg off. Well, according to military folklore, the officer had to stop moving, because he had stepped on one. Your ancestor, who was just in front of him, saw what was wrong, and asked if the officer wanted to live. The officer said, \u2018Yah, I want to live, so I can see my wife and children.\u2019 At this, your ancestor allegedly said, \u2018Tell mine that I love them.\u2019 And he stepped on the mine and told the officer, \u2018Now run Sir, and don\u2019t let my death be in vain.\u2019 With that, he saluted the man, and pushed him off of the mine. A moment later, as the officer was running out of the woods, there was an explosion. It was in that moment that the officer realized just how close to death that he had been and it was, only, because of the sacrifice of a lowly human, that he was still alive. After that, as if to honor your ancestor\u2019s sacrifice, he, and the other soldiers of that unit, worked tirelessly to change the regulations, in all services, so that all soldiers are treated the same, and that no soldier could take the life of another without just cause, and so on.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, my great-grandfather was a war hero? Why was my family never told?\u201d Jenkins asked, shaking his head in disbelief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Bloodtooth smiled and said, \u201cWell, truth be told, they were. However, the officer was still having nightmares about the event. In them, he was alone in the woods, stuck standing on that landmine, until your grandfather showed up and say, \u2018I\u2019ll take your place sir. Now go and live the life that I gave to you.\u2019 Given how he felt about what happened that day, the officer just gave your family the bare minimal truth, that your ancestor had assaulted his superior officer, but, when they were in a life or death moment, due to the efforts of the enemy, your ancestor gave his life to save his. Of course, back then, and now even, no one could, or would, have believed that a human would willingly give his life to save that of another, who had tried to kill, or eat, him beforehand. Also, the day after he had died, the officer and some of the other soldiers went into the woods to collect his remains, when one of the soldiers, a rakshasa, stepped on a mine himself. Well, he told the others to get away from him, immediately. The other soldiers said that they wouldn\u2019t leave him. It was at that moment that a dragon, wearing the uniform of the enemy, showed up, stepped on the mine, and pushed him off. He then said something that only your ancestor would say, \u2018Hello, my brother.\u2019 It is said that your ancestor would always call the other soldiers his brothers or sisters, as if they were family to him. Well, this caused everyone to look at him in shock, because the guy had become a ghost and found the enemy soldier scouting the woods, and setting more landmines, so he possessed him. He then told the other soldiers that they were his family, and that he would always watch out for them. He then told them to leave the woods, while he did what he had to do. After the soldiers left, there was a series of explosions, followed by one last, and relatively, soft one. The guy had destroyed every landmine in those woods, because the one he had possessed had plenty of ordnance to do the job. Even today, if you ever get stationed in that country and check the place out, you will see a large crater where the woods once stood. Needless to say, most people won\u2019t believe the true story, until they see the ghost of your ancestor themselves.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, my great-grandfather really did all that.\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, saw the crater myself and your ancestor\u2019s spirit as well. In fact, when I saw you on the medical table in that room, I thought, for a split second, that you were him. The resemblance is uncanny, especially your eyes, they got that same spark, that same willingness to give your life for another.\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn,\u201d Jenkins said, running a hand through his hair, which had been trimmed to that of a crew cut. \u201cAnd here I had signed up because I was a few grand in debt and was in danger of being claimed by the county. I never would have thought that I\u2019d be hearing about a relative that I barely knew.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, be glad you did,\u201d Bloodtooth said, with a smile. \u201cIt was because of your ancestor that that officer had a daughter, who had a son, who had a daughter, who joined the military to escape being executed for avenging her sister.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Jenkins\u2019s eyes bulged, as he pushed his seat away from the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re the great-granddaughter of that officer that my great-grandfather gave his life for.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Bloodtooth just chuckled and said, \u201cYah, small world isn\u2019t it?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It\u2019s about your niece.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid that principal try to do something with her again?\u201d Bloodtooth asked, with a low growl in her throat as she stood up. \u201cI told him that I would kill him if he-\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not school related, and it\u2019s even worse than that,\u201d the naga said, drinking a glass of water that Tiny had placed next to him. \u201cShe was kidnapped and sold to that place on the corner of Forth Street and Harpy Drive.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShit!\u201d Bloodtooth said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then looked a centaur and said, \u201cMaster at Arms. Permission to-\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPermission granted,\u201d the centaur said, tossing her a set of keys. \u201cJust don\u2019t blow the whole place up this time. You remember what you did at the Dragon\u2019s Den last week.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat bastard was lucky,\u201d Bloodtooth said, with a deeper growl. \u201cHe should have known better than to call me a human lover, and eat the woman that I was talking with. He ought to be glad that it was his place of business that I blew up, and not him himself like I was thinking about.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah, but two hundred pounds was a little excessive, don\u2019t you think?\u201d (Master at Arms)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope, it was an equivalent weight to that of the woman he ate.\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell in that case, I\u2019m limiting you to eighty pounds.\u201d (Master at Arms)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMore than enough to cover my niece\u2019s current weight thanks.\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah, and take as much guns and ammunition as you need. I hear that the place is owned by a lizard with a very thick skin.\u201d (Master at Arms)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd probably a thick head to. Hope you don\u2019t mind me using some of those special bullets that you make.\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust don\u2019t try to use all of them.\u201d (Master at Arms)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn that case, thanks,\u201d Bloodtooth said, as she quickly rushed through the door, pushing it, causing it to become eschewed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenkins then turned to the man next to him and asked, \u201cWhere is she going?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo the armory,\u201d the man, a vampire, said, sipping away at a cup of blood. \u201cAfter that, she\u2019ll go to the address, get her niece, as well as every other person owned by the place, pressgang a few of the patrons, threatening to kill those who don\u2019t follow her orders, and injuring a few of them to make sure they get the message, and then, destroy the kitchen.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat niece of hers is all the family that she has left. Her parents, and stepsister, got killed in a car crash, a few years back. That girl was the only survivor of the event, and Bloodtooth will do anything to keep her safe from harm, and I mean anything.\u201d (Vampire officer)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell in that case,\u201d Jenkins said. \u201cI best go and help her, and make sure she doesn\u2019t lose her head.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m with you on that, Uniter,\u201d the other man said, getting up. \u201cYou best come with me, because I don\u2019t think that she\u2019s going to wait up for us.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, thanks,\u201d Jenkins said, as he followed the man out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, by the time the two had gotten to the armory, Bloodtooth was long gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn,\u201d the vampire said, as he picked up an open, and empty, box. \u201cThe Master at Arms will not be happy to see this.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Jenkins asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBloodtooth got eighty pounds of explosives alright. HIGH explosives that is, Uniter. And if I know her, she has her K-bar, her Desert Eagle automatic pistol, her modified Colt revolver, and plenty of ammo for both of them. And if I know her still, she\u2019ll shoot first, shoot second, shoot third, and then ask questions, and shoot some more, and then blow the place up.\u201d (Vampire officer)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(The following is by the vampire officer)<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s her instincts, Uniter. If you are a member of her pack, as it were, it\u2019s in her blood to protect you at all costs, including her own life. Trust me on that Uniter; we were once stranded in the desert, with no previsions, just me and her. Well, after a day without blood, a vampire will start to dry up, and shut down to hibernate until a live animal shows up, that they could feed off of. Well, she was in her human form, as black fur and desert do not mix too well, and she was also becoming dehydrated herself. Well, I had learned some vital information that command needed, before I\u2019d been captured by this one group of insurgents, and she, all by herself, as she was the only person available, rescued me. She told me that I, at least, had to make it to base, and she ordered me to drink her dry. At first, I tried to refuse, but she insisted that it would be alright, and that she had no ill will towards me doing what was necessary. Well, when I refused still, she used my one instinct to make sure that I would, and using her claw, cut her neck. It was a small cut, no bigger than that of a paper cut, but it was enough to trigger the instinct for me to feed. Well, when a thirsty vampire smells blood, it will seek out the source of the blood and drain it dry. By the time that I was done, you would not have believed that that frail dried up corpse was the one people call \u2018She Who Bloodies Her Teeth and Claws for Humans\u2019, which was what the locals nicknamed her after she fought off a bunch of desert marauders, to save some nomadic humans that were camping near the base that we\u2019d been stationed at, prior to my capture and subsequent rescue. Well, I couldn\u2019t leave her there, so I carried her body, until I collapsed in sight of a patrol from our military. Well, when I woke up, I had an I.V. dripping blood into me, and I was soaking in a tub of blood as well. Now mind you, everyone on the base, from the guy that cleans the toilets, to a visiting general, each donated a portion to help me to become rehydrated. However, my concern was only for Bloodtooth, after all, I had drained her drier than a twig. Well obviously, the medic-mage was able to revive her, though she looked like someone who hadn\u2019t eaten in a long time, when the medics put us in the same room, at first, but she soon filled out. After that, everyone on base called me, and still calls me, Wolfblood, because I have the blood of a wolf running through my veins.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell speaking of calling people names, why is it that you keep calling me Uniter?\u201d Jenkins asked. \u201cMy birth name is William Henry Jenkins the Forth.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, the vampire, Wolfblood, looked at him and said, \u201cBecause you are of the blood of the one who united us, Uniter. Because of him, our country has the strongest fighting force in the world, because, \u2018United and Working Together in Harmony, We\u2019ll Stand; Divided and Eating Each Other, We\u2019ll Fail,\u2019 as he said to me when I saw him last year.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Wolfblood looked at the weapons left on the shelves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you a good shot?\u201d he asked, picking up an M-16 and some magazines, putting one into a slot on the rifle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot really,\u201d Jenkins said. \u201cI\u2019ve never even used a slingshot before.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn that case,\u201d Wolfblood said, slinging his weapon on his shoulder. \u201cA shotgun is your best friend right now.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man pulled a different looking gun off of the rack, and said, \u201cThis is a Mossberg 500, pump-action 12-gauge. It can have one shell in the chamber, and up to seven in the tube. After you pull the trigger, pull this part down to eject the empty shell, and push it back up to get a fresh one in the chamber.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man then pulled out three boxes, and set them on the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow watch how I load it. You put one here, and pull the slide up. Then you load the rest from the bottom. Now, let\u2019s talk about your ammo. Your standard shotgun shell has what\u2019s called birdshot, a bunch of small pellets that can scatter over a wide area. It will blow a hole through a dragon\u2019s skin at three feet, but at a hundred feet, it won\u2019t even make a human flinch. Next up is what\u2019s known as buckshot, bigger pellets for bigger targets, but it won\u2019t scatter as far. Its effective range is about three hundred feet. Finally, we have what is called a slug, which works the same way as a rifle bullet. This thing can put a hole through a dragon\u2019s skull at four hundred yards, or one thousand two hundred feet. Now, I\u2019m going to load this bad boy so it will fire three rounds of birdshot first, followed by three of the buckshot, and two slugs last. Now remember, the first shell you put in the tube is the last shell you shoot, with the last shell that you put into the tube being the second one that you shoot.\u201d (Wolfblood)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the man loaded the gun, and handed the leftover shells to Jenkins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPut these in your pockets Uniter,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s better to have too much ammo and not need it, than to need it and not have any. Trust me, that just so happens to be why I became a vampire. Ran out of ammo and got killed a few years back. Became one of the approximately fifteen percent that ends up turning into a vampire, when the medic-mage, who was tired, after a long day of his own, tried to revive me. I nearly drained him until another managed to immobilize me. After a few months of rehab and training, I was good to go back to fighting. Of course, my wife and kids were a little shocked when I drank a packet of blood for my meals, when I had my chance to get some leave as it were. Of course, they still care about me, much as I do them.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, are there any benefits to being one of the undead?\u201d Jenkins asked, as Wolfblood handed him the shotgun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot really,\u201d he said. \u201cThe improved strength, speed, sight, hearing, those are all defiantly benefits for a soldier of my skill and caliber. However, I can\u2019t feel the warmth of the sun on my face, too much light bothers my eyes and gives me a headache, I feel the thirst for blood all the time, and my wife still has difficulty sharing the same bed as me when I am home, because I am as cold as a corpse. Seriously, touch my face, Uniter. It\u2019s as cold as ice if not colder.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Jenkins touched the man\u2019s cheek, and he had to agree, it was indeed cold, and ones face was usually the warmest part of ones body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHell,\u201d the man said. \u201cRight now I can feel your hand on my face, but I can\u2019t tell how warm you are, like if you have a fever or something like that. Also, you might want to get your hand off now. The vein in your wrist is kind of looking, well, attractive, and I don\u2019t mean the kind that gets one a girl or some such thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jenkins took his hand away from the man\u2019s face, the man quickly moved over to his left side and said, lifting up the sleeve near his shoulder, \u201cStand still, I have to mark you as government property.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Jenkins asked, as he stood still. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s just say it is an act of treason to knowingly, and willfully, destroy, or somehow damage, government property, especially that of the military,\u201d Wolfblood said, as he finished what he was doing. \u201cNow, I\u2019m going to have to carry you if we are to catch up to Bloodtooth. The woman has a head start of five minutes on us, so we need to move and move fast. The woman happens to be one very loose cannon when it comes to protecting her niece. Why, last month, she stole a tank, and drove through the wall of the base, and into the school that the girl goes to, when she heard that the principal had been planning to make the girl his personal pet, and pointed that gun turret right at his head and told him, in no uncertain words, that if he, or anyone else tried to do anything like that to her niece, she\u2019d come back and do more than crash a tank into his office.\u201d (Wolfblood)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn,\u201d Jenkins said, as Wolfblood picked him up and started running. \u201cI guess it is a good thing that she\u2019s on our side.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll say. She personally killed fifty people when she rescued me. When her blood gets riled up, she is an unstoppable force of death and destruction.\u201d (Wolfblood)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen why is it that she told me that she doesn\u2019t like blood on her teeth and claws?\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is an emotional thing for her. Pulling ones sibling\u2019s remains from someone\u2019s stomach will do that. She always takes a minimal of three showers a day and the rules only allow for one in the morning and one at night. Ah, there she is, now to get her to stop before she gets herself killed.\u201d (Wolfblood)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She is the only surviving family member I have left you know.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Jenkins placed a hand on her shoulder and said, \u201cHey, I\u2019m also, in a sense, a part of your family. After all, our families have that history together. Also, Wolfblood here is more than willing to help you and I get her back.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI take it that you have a plan, commander.\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, this place has to have a back entrance, in case of fires and such. Wolfblood uses that entrance while you and I go through the front, distracting everyone there. Well, you do what you would normally do, but with a twist, you claim that the owner has bought stolen government property. You order them to look at the mark on my shoulder for an entire minute, and then look at those on their tables, and if they have the same mark, to leave immediately or risk being executed for destroying government property.\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut, only my niece has the mark. How will anyone else suddenly have the same mark?\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey won\u2019t, but when you look at something, like a mark, long enough, you will see it everywhere that you look for, at least, the next ten minutes.\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure about that?\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about a little bet, if it works, and the majority of the patrons clear out, I get to see you in your human form, naked, for a full thirty seconds, at least.\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHell, I might have a little bit of; fun, with you, if this idea of yours works.\u201d Bloodtooth said, giving him a quick kiss on the cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the three began to work out a plan to save Bloodtooth\u2019s niece, as well as, anyone else owned by the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, the patrons in the place, many about to start eating their meals, mostly young adults or children, who have been bound and gagged in one form or another, are startled to see the doors burst open, admitting two heavily armed soldiers, with serious looks on their faces. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen up, you ungrateful wretches,\u201d the werewolf said, walking down the areas between the tables, looking at those bound and gagged upon them, with his hand upon the handle of a very powerful looking handgun. \u201cFort Williams has received word that this place has bought government property that was stolen beforehand. Given the seriousness of this crime, it would be in your best interests to cooperate. After all, stealing, and then buying, and destroying government property is considered an act of treason, which is punishable by death, at the hands of the soldiers that it was stolen from.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is outrageous,\u201d said the owner of the place. \u201cI bought these meals from very reputable dealers of human livestock.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI doubt that,\u201d the werewolf said, stopping at a table that had a bound and gagged ten year old girl, struggling to get to the end close to the werewolf. \u201cI know this one. In fact, she is mine.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen where is its mark of ownership at?\u201d the owner said, with a bit of sarcasm in his voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProbably covered up by whoever stole and sold it to you,\u201d the werewolf said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned to the other armed soldier and said, in a booming voice, \u201cHuman, fetch me some water and a washcloth.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, sir,\u201d the human said, giving a sharp salute. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then walked into the bathroom, and forced two people out of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute later, he stepped out, with a wet washcloth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere you are sir,\u201d the human said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy in the hell is it wet?\u201d the werewolf asked, with some irritation in his voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought that-\u201d (The human, Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe military didn\u2019t purchase you to think meat,\u201d the werewolf said, slapping the human, causing it to step back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes sir,\u201d the human said, in a neutral voice, not even touching the red mark on its face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe werewolf then took the wet washcloth and started to rub at the left shoulder of the human girl, muttering a few things under his breath. Slowly, but surely, a black mark appeared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe werewolf looked at the lizard that owned and ran the place, and said, \u201cA reputable dealer of human livestock knows better than to steal and sell government property.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you know how many humans that I purchase a day?\u201d the lizard said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I can wash all of them to check and see if they had prior owners that sold them instead of eating them.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d the werewolf said, pulling his pistol from its holster. \u201cBuying stolen government property is still punishable by death.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the werewolf cocked the hammer on the handgun and pointed it at the lizard\u2019s head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHowever, I\u2019m sure that we can come to a very, reasonable, compromise,\u201d the werewolf said, as a vampire came out of the back of the place, with blood on his lips, dragging a female rakshasa, that seemed to be unconscious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did you do to my wife?\u201d the lizard asked, looking at the cat-like woman, which had a couple of bloody puncture marks on her neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh she\u2019s fine,\u201d the vampire, who was also heavily armed, said, licking his lips. \u201cThe bitch is lucky that I hate cat blood. Personally, I find that lizard blood is very delicious.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vampire tossed the cat-creature at the lizard and said, \u201cThe next time she tries to attack a soldier though, she\u2019s dead meat.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFind anything while you were back there mate?\u201d the werewolf asked, still holding his gun to the lizard\u2019s head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes sir,\u201d the vampire said, saluting the werewolf. \u201cThree hundred, and very fine looking, young men and women, all of enlisting age, as well as over four hundred below the age of eighteen. Oh, and would you believe it, these bastards had, at least, one hundred that were under the age of three years.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you do anything with them?\u201d (the werewolf, Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d the vampire said, lifting a smallish black bag. \u201cI did what the regulations state, if government property if stolen, confiscate everything that the thief owns. Of course, the thief could prefer to be executed for treason.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the vampire looked at the owner, with a certain smile, that showed off his large canines. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn that case,\u201d the lizard said, with a forced smile, as he held onto his still unconscious wife. \u201cTake whatever you want.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh we plan to,\u201d the werewolf said, still holding his weapon. \u201cTake those on the tables, comrade, and if those sitting there have children with them, take those to.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t do that,\u201d said a dridder at the table that the werewolf was standing next to, holding onto her daughter. \u201cMy daughter hasn\u2019t done anything wrong.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, that\u2019s funny,\u201d the werewolf said, as he pulled out a revolver and pointed it at the woman. \u201cNeither has the girl that you and your daughter tried to eat. In fact, before the woman died, her mother asked me to take care of her. Then again, this girl\u2019s my niece. Also, a younger sister of mine was murdered, the same way that you were about to murder my niece bitch. However, I ripped that bastard\u2019s throat out, and got my sister\u2019s remains out of him and gave them a decent burial. After that, I joined the military and I\u2019ve been making good on my name. After all, there is a reason people call me \u2018Bloody Teeth\u2019, in one form or another, in over twelve countries. Then again, my name is Bloodtooth, and there is nothing like the taste of blood to wet one\u2019s throat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, the owner said, \u201cYou\u2019re that crazy werewolf bitch that blew up the Dragon\u2019s Den last week.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually,\u201d Bloodtooth said. \u201cAccording to my last physiological evaluation, I\u2019m psychotically insane. Hey mate, you put the employees someplace safe?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes sir!\u201d said the vampire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd where are the explosives?\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI put them everyplace but the meat locker that I put the employees in.\u201d (The vampire, Wolfblood)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood,\u201d Bloodtooth said, with an evil smile, as she pulled out a detonator. \u201cNow, unless anyone wants to see what it is like to watch eighty pounds worth of high grade explosives blow up in their faces, I suggest that you listen up and follow orders. After all, as I know from personal experience, shrapnel is very unpredictable and can be worse than the explosion itself.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa!\u201d said a dragon, which had stood up. \u201cYou\u2019re just doing this because you are a weak human lover.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m a human lover alright,\u201d Bloodtooth said. \u201cBut then again, I\u2019m a lover of dragons to, especially when they are served with clam chowder. Hmm, very tasty, don\u2019t you agree, Wolfblood?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes, very tasty indeed,\u201d Wolfblood, the vampire, said, as he placed the confiscated humans, and the patrons\u2019 children, into the black bag, which would shrink them the moment that the bag was over their head, turning them into the size of a grain of rice. \u201cOf course, given how I can\u2019t eat solid foods much anymore, all I have to go on is the taste of their blood, and given how much I like lizard blood, I absolutely LOVE dragon blood.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, he looked at the dragon, and licked his lips, as if he was thinking about sinking his teeth into him and drinking him dry. The look in Wolfblood\u2019s eyes forced the dragon to sit down, without saying another word, as the vampire walked by and confiscated his meal, a young woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, the three started to walk out, Bloodtooth holding her niece with one hand, and the detonator in the other, Wolfblood holding the shrinking bag, and the human holding his gun, keeping it pointed at the patrons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the mother dridder rushed them, running on her eight spider-like legs, with her human-like arms ready to grab something, and her spider-like fangs ready to bite someone and pump them full of venom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human, scared to death, fired his weapon, putting a huge hole in her stomach. In the silence that followed, the only things that could be heard were the human\u2019s nervous breathing, as well as the ragged, and pain filled breathing of the dridder herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn Uniter,\u201d said the vampire. \u201cYou weren\u2019t kidding when you told me that you never fired a gun before. You\u2019re supposed to hold the butt of the gun tight against your shoulder, not below it, like in those old gangster movies when they use Tommy guns, or some such thing.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWolfblood, do you still have a healing barrier on you?\u201d Bloodtooth asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNever leave the base without less than a dozen,\u201d the vampire said, tossing a blue cube near the dridder, who was lying on the floor, bleeding heavily. As the cube touched her, a blue barrier sprang up and enveloped her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood,\u201d Bloodtooth said. \u201cThat will help stabilize her, and help her start to heal.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she faced the rest of the patrons, and said, \u201cI told you what would happen if you refused to cooperate.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then looked at the owner, who had a pleading look on his face, shaking his head, as if to say, \u201cNo, don\u2019t do it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope you have a good insurance company, and have good coverage,\u201d she said, as she pressed the button on the detonator, causing the kitchen to blow up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, when everyone else was taking cover from the explosion, with Bloodtooth turning around to shield her niece from it, the human, Jenkins, just stood there, in total shock, as if he was sacred at what it was that he had done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI killed her,\u201d he thought, as he was thinking about the dridder that he had shot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn\u2019t see Wolfblood toss the healing barrier, or see Bloodtooth press the button on the detonator. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blood pooling on the floor reminded him of the night that his sister was murdered. He remembered the face of the monster that did it very clearly, a werewolf, a male one, one that was probably blind in his left eye, because he had, using a kitchen knife that he had grabbed to protect himself, slashed his face, cutting that eye, which had caused the werewolf to howl in pain and run away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t until he felt someone grab him and hold him to their chest that he came back to reality. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold still Uniter,\u201d said Wolfblood\u2019s voice. \u201cEven with proper placement, detonating explosives is very dangerous. At the moment, I\u2019m all that\u2019s standing between you and what could be your first time getting killed, while in the line of duty.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, all that Jenkins could say was, \u201cI killed her,\u201d before he collapsed in Wolfblood\u2019s arms.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After the debris settled, Wolfblood picked up Jenkins\u2019s limp body and said to Bloodtooth, \u201cWe best get back to base before the police and fire department, and the ambulances, show up and people start to ask too many questions.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah,\u201d Bloodtooth said. \u201cIs the recruit alright? I saw him collapse into your arms.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPhysically, he\u2019s fine, though I\u2019m not sure about emotionally,\u201d Wolfblood said, as he looked at Jenkins, resisting the urge to gorge himself on the young man\u2019s blood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we best put these two in the bag,\u201d said Bloodtooth. \u201cPeople would be more than suspicious if they saw me, a werewolf, holding onto a human child, and you, a vampire, holding onto a grown human, as if these two were something we care about, and not potential meals.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI understand madam,\u201d Wolfblood said, as he placed the top of the bag over Jenkins\u2019s head, shrinking him, as well as pulling him in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then handed the bag to Bloodtooth, who kissed her niece, saying, before she put her in the bag, \u201cI\u2019ll see you when you are let out.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then pulled the string on the bag, closing it tight. Then, she placed the bag in her mouth, and after making sure that a certain string was secure on one of her back teeth, swallowed it. In the magic that was used in the making of shrink bags, also included, in addition to shrinking what was placed in it, a protection spell, which kept the objects, or people, inside of it safe from damage, including that of the most powerful of stomach acids. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s get moving,\u201d she said, as she started to walk casually, as if nothing had happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight behind you,\u201d Wolfblood said, as he unloaded Jenkins\u2019s shotgun, placing the shells in his pocket, and slung the weapon on his shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, although he had the safety on it on, he still kept the M-16 loaded, and in a ready-rest position, and followed behind Bloodtooth, as if she was his superior officer, which she was, as if escorting her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, a block or two away from the base, a police car pulled over and the officer in it told them to stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere you anywhere near Fourth Street and Harpy Drive when the restaurant there blew up?\u201d he asked, stepping out, revealing him self to be a fox-like kitsune. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah, we were near there,\u201d Bloodtooth said, as she knew the drill, admit if you were there if you were, but don\u2019t say that you did something if you did do something. \u201cWe went there to retrieve some property of the base that was stolen. However, it wasn\u2019t there, so, we left. We did hear the explosion though.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you had had to guess, what would you say that the perpetrators used?\u201d (Kitsune police officer)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d have to say that it would have to have been, at least two hundred pounds worth of dynamite.\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBloodtooth then looked at Wolfblood and asked, with a wink, \u201cHey didn\u2019t the Master at Arms say that someone had stolen a few hundred pounds of explosives last week?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy, yes madam. Some male werewolf knocked him out and took more than six hundred pounds of the stuff. Why, the commander is thinking about putting out a reward for information leading to the capture of the culprit, and to think that we could have caught him, if we weren\u2019t looking for his pet instead,\u201d Wolfblood said, as if he was so frustrated with being someone\u2019s personal pet catcher. \u201cI mean, we should be out there looking for him, instead of some weak, scrawny, and pathetic human girl, all because we were placed on pet patrol.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then looked at the officer and said, \u201cPersonally, I\u2019d rather be fighting overseas right now. After all, there are plenty of interesting things to enjoy, if you know what I mean.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know what you mean,\u201d the police officer said, getting back into his vehicle. \u201cI always seemed to get stuck pulling parking meter duty, instead of patrolling and catching criminals.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the officer waved his hand and took off.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cPet patrol, now that is a new one,\u201d said the second in command, when Bloodtooth and Wolfblood were being debriefed. \u201cMaybe I should assign it to you and make it true. After all, we can\u2019t have pets running off.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he burst out in laughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you imagine it?\u201d he said, trying to stifle it. \u201cThat some private was searching for some officer\u2019s personal pet? I can see it now, the poor guy whistling and saying, \u2018Here boy/girl. I have a treat for you if you come to Private Whoever.\u2019 It would be so funny.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, he looked at Bloodtooth and said, with a very serious voice, \u201cHowever, while I understand that this stunt, as well as the stunt last month, had to deal with keeping your niece safe, and was within regulations to do so, I will not tolerate you going out and blowing up businesses and buildings whenever you feel like it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually sir,\u201d Wolfblood said. \u201cThis time, there was justifiable cause to do so.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d (Second-in Command)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe one recruit, William Jenkins, came with me, when I went to try and deal with Bloodtooth, and try to calm her down, and may have been injured, somehow, by one of the patrons.\u201d (Wolfblood)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn what manner was he injured?\u201d (S-in C.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure sir. A dridder had tried to attack us, when we were leaving, peacefully, and he shot her. Well, that caused Bloodtooth to press the button, because we had warned them to not try anything foolish, when we confiscated those there, and took the children of the patrons that had them there, including the dridder\u2019s daughter. However, he stood there, as if in a trance, not even trying to go under a table for protection. I had to stand in front of him, to protect him from shrapnel, and he just collapsed into my arms.\u201d (Wolfblood)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid he say anything before he fell unconscious?\u201d (S-in C.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes sir, he said, \u2018I killed her.\u2019 I think he may have been talking about the dridder, though, if it\u2019s any consolation, the woman should be alright, because I put a healing barrier on her.\u201d (Wolfblood)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that is understandable, as is what he said.\u201d (S-in C.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean sir?\u201d Wolfblood asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Second in Command stood up, and looked out the window, and looked at a statue of a human soldier wearing an older style of military clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe boy,\u201d he said, \u201cMay all that happens to be all that remains to be left of that man\u2019s surviving family. The rest, it is believed that most, if not all, were murdered a few years ago, by a deserter, a werewolf named James Ripjaws. The man found out that they were of THE Uniter\u2019s blood, so, to prevent another person, like him, from showing up, which is somewhat implausible, he decided to kill them, as part of his vengeance, after we found out what he\u2019d been doing. The boy though, managed to injure him, by slashing his eye, which caused the deserter to run like the coward he is.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was it that this man do that was so horrible sir?\u201d Wolfblood asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe was a good for nothing traitor,\u201d Bloodtooth said, with a low growl. \u201cHe tried to sell certain secrets to the wrong side, like why our military is so powerful.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThankfully, we were able to stop him before that secret was revealed,\u201d the Second in Command said. \u201cHowever, the monster swore that he\u2019d get his revenge, in one form or another.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then, where is he?\u201d Wolfblood asked, with a bit of anger, and hatred in his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would like to know that myself,\u201d the Second in Command said, lowering his head into the light, revealing himself to be a kitsune. \u201cThe military has every ghost spy that can be spared, out looking for him, even now. Somehow though, he has eluded our efforts so far. I wouldn\u2019t be too surprised if the brass decides to tell our allies overseas that the man knows many of their own secrets, and is planning to sell them to certain groups, so that they will help out in the search for him as well, if only to make sure that their secrets are not sold as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man then looked at Bloodtooth and said, sitting back down, \u201cSo, how, and what, did the boy do on this little, excursion, of yours?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(The following is Bloodtooth speaking)<br>\r\n\u201cWell sir, he did come up with a very good plan sir. Other than a few things that needed to be made up on the spot, the kid had it all mapped out, and for the most part it worked. Wolfblood snuck in the back, knocked out the kitchen workers, rescued those being held there, planted the explosives, in a manner that would appear to be somewhat rushed, and, somewhat, expertly well placed. Jenkins and I entered the front door, with me saying that the owner of the place had bought stolen government property, and that they\u2019d all best cooperate. Had to do a bit of acting with Jenkins, as if he was some piece of worthless trash, including giving him a, relatively, light slap on the face, when he brought me a wet washcloth instead of water and a washcloth like I had told him. After that little scene, I proceeded to wash the skin-toned make-up that I have on my niece\u2019s mark, so that she can go about her day as a normal little girl, who has no connections to the military, and revealed the mark to everyone in the place. Had to do some improvising when a few people started complaining about us taking their meals, as well as their children, including having to handle a dragon that called me a human lover, though Wolfblood managed to make him saying that he, loves, to, drink, the blood of dragons.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I do love the taste of dragon blood you know, though I seriously doubt that I could drink a whole dragon dry in one go. Then again, some of those kitchen workers put up a bit of a fight, so I took the liberty to remove enough blood from each of them, so that they couldn\u2019t fight me any more, and that they would be safe with each other, until they were rescued, so I was a little full at the time. Of course, you know the rest of what happened there.\u201d (Wolfblood)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, the boy\u2019s plan actually worked out?\u201d (S-in C.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, his plan worked out, for the most part sir.\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, how many potential recruits did his plan get us?\u201d (S-in C.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt least three hundred are of age right now sir. As for the rest, they were below that, including at least, one hundred that are barely able to walk, due to the fact that they are under the age of three years of age, sir.\u201d (Wolfblood)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCivilians,\u201d the kitsune said, with a slight growl in his voice. \u201cThey should realize that children are sacred, and should not be harmed by another person\u2019s stomach acids. In fact, no one should be, not until they are at least thirty, at least that way the person would have had the chance to have children of their own, to carry on the family line, at any rate. You should know that some in the military wish that we could declare martial law, so that we would be able to protect, at the very least, those under the age of recruitment.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, what about that city next to Fort Splittooth sir?\u201d Bloodtooth asked. \u201cI hear that there is a no-predation law in effect there.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is true,\u201d the Second in Command said. \u201cA friend of mine stationed there told me about it. He said that while predation of others is not prohibited, it is discouraged and that those who don\u2019t eat others enjoy financial benefits.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat sort of benefits sir?\u201d Wolfblood asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(The following is the kitsune officer speaking)<br>\r\n\u201cBonuses added to one\u2019s paycheck, lighter taxes than those who prey on others, that sort of stuff. I tell you, if this guy, who did all of this, a Mr. John Wolfstone, who happens to be a size-changing werewolf, ran for office; he could find everyone in the military supporting him. Also, according to the chaplain, his one stepsister, one of over eight hundred step-siblings actually, is married to the Prince of Hell, and I mean The Prince of Hell. Then again, those two went to the same university, Harmony U., together. Also, his step-daughter, Julia, is the niece of one of the most powerful dark wizards out there, who also went to the same place as him. Also, when you throw in everything else, like his personal and financial connections, his personal wealth, his physical, and some slight magical, abilities, all could make him the most powerful person out there, and yet, his humbleness, as well as the fact that he is a vegetarian, all tell me that he sees everyone as equals. Of course, much like some of us non-humans in the military know, he\u2019s got the urge, although, he seems to be able to keep it under control. Of course, there have been instances were the wizard, or the Prince of Hell, have made a stop at the base and asked for help with dealing with him, for when he has lost control of himself, which is usually somewhere on or near his land, as the wizard has a spell placed on him to teleport, and keep him, there during those times, so that he doesn\u2019t destroy the city. After all, while there is that part of him that wants to cause destruction and mayhem, and all that, he doesn\u2019t want to, in his own words, \u2018Be seen as a monster to those that I care about\u2019. That tells me that he genuinely cares about others, for who they are and not what they are. Now, that\u2019s enough about him,\u201d the Second in Command said. \u201cLet\u2019s get back to Private Jenkins. I want to know where he is right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Bloodtooth said, \u201cHe\u2019s in the shrink bag now sir, which I have on me sir, or rather, in me sir.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease tell me that you secured the bag first, and made sure that the top was closed,\u201d the kitsune said, shaking his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t I always do that Sir,\u201d Bloodtooth said, with a grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know that,\u201d the kitsune said. \u201cI just remember that time in Sana Barbra, when you had me in one of those things, and swallowed it, without securing the string to your tooth.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, you were the one who was in the bed of the wrong man\u2019s wife. Then again, we were supposed to be undercover on that operation. Claiming that you had gone out the window after you entered the room was the only reason that that dridder left. Besides, I got you out all right.\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah, when you went to use the bathroom. I mean, do you know how much shit stinks when all that\u2019s between you and it is a strip of cloth.\u201d (kitsune officer)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, what about you and that dragon wife of yours? I hear that you like to spend plenty of time in her at night.\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere is a difference between those two things. Now, if you don\u2019t mind, cough the bag up.\u201d (kitsune officer)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is not a problem sir.\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As for him doing something that not only restructured the military, but changed the way it ran, that sounds like some sort of pipe dream at best. My family was nothing special, and I am just some human that will probably be picked up for debt and-\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSent to prison where someone will buy you for some dark reason?\u201d (Mysterious voice)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah, who was it that just said that, because this can\u2019t be real?\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook to your right kid.\u201d (M. Voice)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jenkins looked, he saw a kitsune, wearing a military uniform, sitting in a chair, reading some files. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d he asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, that depends,\u201d the kitsune said, as he turned a page, \u201cOn whether or not I am real or a figment of your imagination. If I am a figment of your mind, you could banish me with relative ease. But, what if I am real? What if I were to tell you that your great-grandfather really did start something the day he gave his life to save his commanding officer? What if there was something more to the murder of your family than what meets the eye even?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking about? A Goddamn Fucking Werewolf murdered them for no fucking reason,\u201d Jenkins said, as he stood up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, I knew the man who did it, or, at least, I thought that I did,\u201d the kitsune said, with a sigh, as he set the file down, next to Jenkins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenkins saw a picture on it, with a face that looked familiar. Rotating it, he saw that the man in the picture was the person who had murdered his family. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d he said, with anger in his voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see there are several questions in that single word,\u201d the kitsune said, as he closed his eyes. \u201cOne, why was he in the military records? That is because he was in the army, like me. Two, why do I know him? He was in the same squad as me. Three, why did he kill your family? The man is a traitor who tried to sell the military\u2019s greatest secret, to tell the wrong people why we are so strong. He killed your family for some sick and twisted way of getting revenge, because the ghost of your great-grandfather found out what he was up to, and warned us. Four, why didn\u2019t we protect your family as well as we should have? The truth about your ancestor\u2019s deeds was considered to be our most highly guarded secret, though there were those, who were of soldiers that fought alongside of your ancestor, who wanted to protect your family, even if it meant giving up their military careers, Lieutenant Bloodtooth being one. However, by the time they got there, the police and ambulance were picking up the remains of your family, and you disappeared from the grid for a few years, probably because you were searching for him. Fifth, why am I telling you this? Well to answer that question, you must answer this question, do you want to find him?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHell yah,\u201d Jenkins said. \u201cI want him to suffer for what he took from me. That bastard took the lives of my mother, father, and my older sister. I was fifteen then, young and inexperienced. I\u2019m twenty now, older, a bit more experienced, but now, as then, I\u2019ve got no one to turn to for help.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, you may have what you need, if you do one thing.\u201d (Kitsune officer)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat would that be?\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStick with the military kid. We\u2019ll take care of the rest, and when we find him, you can have your revenge, as will the rest of the military.\u201d (Kitsune officer)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the man stood up and said, \u201cShe does appreciate what you did to help rescue her niece, kid. Besides, she may want to do something to thank you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor what reason would she want to thank me?\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor telling her that you and she are family, after all, werewolves don\u2019t live long without them. They also become suicidal when they are alone. For the last three years kid, the military and her niece have been the only family she\u2019s had. With you though, well, the commander of the base may have to bend some rules, and get her as your squad leader, or something.\u201d (Kitsune officer)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n With that, the kitsune started leaving, when he said, \u201cIf you ever need me, Uniter, ask for Second in Command, Army, Lieutenant Colonel Jethro Seventails, and before you ask, no, I have nine tails, not seven as my name would suggest.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I heard that you were baptized with one of Bloody Tooth\u2019s explosions or something.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t really recall,\u201d Jenkins said, as he picked up a plate, and started looking around, and found that, besides Tiny and himself, there was no one in the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey\u2019re in the briefing room if you are wondering,\u201d Tiny said. \u201cMost of the time, the recruits start to wake up the day after being put under the dream spell.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about you? How did you join up?\u201d Jenkins asked, as he began loading his plate up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell Uniter, to be honest, after culinary school, I tried to open my own restaurant, but I didn\u2019t have the money to keep it running, as there are not many vegetarian giants around here, and instead of serving those that were given to me as cooking supplies, I ended up hiring them. Well, one day, Bloody Teeth, as most people seem to call her, showed up, and asked me to make a simple sandwich, with no people being part of it. Well, while I never learned about the reason the she was in the giant section of town, she brightened my hopes up, and the next day, I closed the place down, and me and my helpers came here and we\u2019ve been working here ever since then, for the six years at any rate. Isn\u2019t that right guys?\u201d (Tiny)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, a mixture of \u201cyep\u201ds, \u201csure\u201ds, and \u201cbest job I\u2019ve ever had\u201ds and other similar things are heard from up above. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow many people you got helping you up there?\u201d Jenkins asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo be honest,\u201d Tiny said. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I think I have at least fifty helpers that rotate with a pervious group of fifty every two hours or so. After all, it does get a little warm up here and I don\u2019t want my help to wear them selves out with being overworked. Besides, while I am strong enough to put things like cattle and oxen in the oven, it is a little hard for me to pick up plates and dishes for people of your stature on my own.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, why is it that you care for people like me, you know, humans?\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m a bit of an outcast.\u201d (Tiny)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy would you say that?\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(The following is Tiny speaking)<br>\r\n\u201cI got three eyes, those are the reason why. Father was a human looking giant, and mother was a Cyclops of a similar height. Their parent\u2019s hated the idea of their children marrying, so they moved, and got married. They had me a year or so later. Well, throughout school, elementary, middle, and high, people would say things like, \u2018look at the three-eyed freak\u2019 or, \u2018can you close your middle eye, or you side ones, so that you look normal\u2019 or \u2018can you even close your middle eye\u2019, and other such things. Well one day, some of the older neighborhood kids were flinging pebbles at something, and I managed to scare them off, by saying that my third eye grants me special powers over other giants, like turning them into the size of insects, or something. When I looked at what it was that they had been bothering, I saw something that had a similar shape as me, but smaller, with two eyes, and female as well. Well, I knew that those bigger kids wouldn\u2019t be gone long when they would realize that I had told them a huge fib, so I picked the little thing up and ran home. Well, my parents were vegetarians, so I had never seen a human before. When my parents told me what it was, they told me that her parents would miss her, if I kept her. Of course, seeing how it was late at night, before she woke up, because she had fainted when she had seen me, it was decided that we would take her home in the morning. Well, before she went to sleep, on the desk by my bed, I told her that, if she was ever in trouble, and if I was there, that I would help her out. Of course, I was eight, and she was seven, at the time, and it was, I guess, something of a pinky swear, you know, a child\u2019s promise between another, and to call me Tiny, because that was my nickname at the time. Well, almost ten years later, I was in the school cafeteria, eating the lunch that my mom had packed me, things like cattle, oxen, sheep, goats, that sort of stuff, as my parents had taught me to not take life needlessly, in fact they told me to, basically, steal any sentient being that the other students brought in for their lunch, if I was able to do so, when I smelled a vaguely familiar scent, and heard someone scream \u2018Help me Tiny!\u2019 Now, I\u2019ll be honest, I had forgotten about her, somewhat, but no one could forget someone like me, well not completely anyways. However, when I saw her about to be dropped down the throat of the school\u2019s biggest star athlete, it all came back to me, and I rushed over and saved her, by breaking the guy\u2019s jaw. Well, he was pissed, especially since I was holding onto what was supposed to be his lunch. So, as I was checking to make sure that the girl, who was now a young woman, was alright, I saw, out of the corner of my third eye, that he was coming for me. Well, I was never one for fighting, but I drove my fist into his face, and caused his head to snap back, and cracked one of his neck vertebras, paralyzing him from the neck down. Needless to say, no one ever called me \u2018Three Eyes\u2019 after that. Heck, the various coaches wanted me to join their sports teams, but my heart was already set on becoming a chef, and cooking for others like me, well, vegetarians anyways, even if none of them were giants.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what happened to the young woman? Do you ever see her?\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Once again, Tiny is speaking)<br>\r\n\u201cOh we keep in touch. She lives in the city near Fort Splittooth. Nice place I tell you, been there before. It is a very safe place for a human to live, thanks to a no-predation law that the place has. It may not be a one hundred percent guarantee, in protecting humans from being eaten, but, unless someone wants to pay higher taxes, to replace the ones that the human would have paid, it does a good job at keeping them safe from being eaten. Rape though, well, there is someone there that prevents a good deal of it, a size-changing giant-werewolf hybrid, named John Wolfstone. Nice guy to, I met him by chance when I was visiting my friend, the woman, because she rents a house on his property. He likes to talk about philosophy a lot though, though he is one hell of a cook, almost puts my cooking to shame. Then again, if I had over a thousand relatives, because I had visited my friend when the guy was having a family reunion, or some such thing, I\u2019d have to be an amazing chef to make all of them happy myself. Of course, the amazing thing is, while this guy could turn into a one hundred foot tall werewolf, he prefers to be a seven and a half foot tall human. However, don\u2019t let that apparently weak form fool you buddy, when he found out that I was a professional chef, he asked me if I wanted to help cook for his family and I told him that I\u2019d be delighted to do so. He told me that I\u2019d have to wrestle with him first, and he promised that he wouldn\u2019t change his form in any way. Well, when I said that it would be an unfair match, he just gave a cocky grin, as if to say, \u2018I know that.\u2019 Now, I had picked up a few fighting moves from watching the recruits, and I had practiced with the other giants on the base, but this guy, he was fast, and by, basically, punching several of the pressure points on my body, he had, literally, brought me to my knees, before he said, with an understandable look on his face, \u2018Not a bad match, but I best stop before I strain my leg too much,\u2019 because his leg had been broken some months before then, and it had only recently healed up. I tell you this though; I think that, even though he was only in his human form, if his leg was fully healed up, he would have beaten me. However, to my surprise, he did let me help him cook for his family. It was while we were cooking that he told me about himself, like why he was a vegetarian, his previous dream of being a professional chef, and what caused him to not fulfill that dream, the lose of his girlfriend, the reason that he became a teacher, and what it was that he was doing then. Then, he introduced me to his then pregnant wife, nice woman by the way, didn\u2019t stare at me like I was some freak like most people do, along with everyone else there, considering that John was even weirder than I was, met his step-daughter, and her uncle, a dark wizard, nice guy, don\u2019t make him angry though, his wife, a shape-shifter, trust me, she\u2019s good, turned herself into a female version of me, very attractive actually, too bad I can\u2019t find a giant woman with three eyes myself, they tend to be a little creped out when they see me, especially when they see me cooking with my help instead of cooking them. Anyways, here\u2019s something that you won\u2019t believe, the guy also introduced me to Stevenlongchangenry, The High and Mighty Prince of Hell and Demons, himself. I mean, the chaplain talks about him every so often, like how he tries to make fair deals with others when they call for his help, how he has a human for a wife, and a few other things, but it is not often that one gets to meet up with someone of royal blood, as well as cook for them. In fact, after he tried some of my cooking, the guy said that if my soul gets sent to Hell, when I die, to look him up, because he might have an opening for me. Now, while I don\u2019t plan on going there when I die, I think that he meant it to be a compliment when he said it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, he chuckled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he said, \u201cWell, I\u2019ve got another hour before I have to shut the Mess Hall down for the night, and get things ready for tomorrow. Just remember, Mess Hall is open from five in the morning to midnight, though we do make some exceptions for those who are nocturnal, if they let us know ahead of time, so if you ever need a bite to eat, or want to talk to someone that isn\u2019t talking to you in military jargon, just come on in, preferable when you are not being drilled on something. Trust me on that the Commander is one scary guy when he is upset.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what is he like?\u201d Jenkins asked; as he sat down to eat his late supper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, where to begin. The man\u2019s a career officer, been in the armed forces at least thirty years, has a wife, four children, six grandkids, with a seventh on the way, unless it was already born, in which case it\u2019s seven, everyone on base respects him, including me and my helpers, he\u2019s a very good chess player, as he is the only one who can beat Lieutenant Colonel Seventails at it. As for what he looks like, well, you will have to meet him for yourself, although I will say that he has already seen you. From what it was that I could hear him say to the Lieutenant Colonel, I think he said that you could, somehow, end up becoming a general, due to your leadership abilities. Of course, that\u2019s just his guess, as you may or may not want to be in the military for that long. Now, tomorrow Uniter, I may be unable to chat with you one on one. That is because I\u2019d have to feed, at least, two to three hundred other recruits, who will be very hungry after sleeping for at least a day, including seventeen giants. Man, you\u2019d think they hadn\u2019t eaten for weeks from the way those kids will pig out on the food.\u201d (Tiny)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, Tiny, given how you can\u2019t fit in here yourself, how will seventeen other giants fit into this room?\u201d Jenkins asked, with a bit of concern in his voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEasy really,\u201d Tiny said. \u201cThe part of the base those less than six or so times your size is like if there was a mouse, or rat, colony in your house, for those of my stature. Given the size variations amongst giants themselves, the military tries to make sure that the smaller soldiers, people close to your height or so, are not stepped on too often, especially on purpose, by building two barracks in one, with the smaller one being part of the larger one. To be honest, about the only times you\u2019ll really see those of my height, or so, is when you are outside on the grounds. I\u2019d advise you to be careful though, not every recruit has the same level of control as the officers over their various urges. Also, given how you were the first one killed, as it were, and the fact that they won\u2019t recognize you anyways, unless they were human, including those with magic in them, they may find themselves very confused as to who you, and the others, are. So, for the first few days, until they get used to how things are actually run here, watch your step.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for the advice Tiny.\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem, Uniter.\u201d (Tiny)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, why is it that it seems that Wolfblood, and now you, seem to like to call me that?\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet used to it; everyone on base has a nickname. Besides, you are of The Uniter\u2019s blood anyways, so don\u2019t be too surprised if the offices treat you like you are some sort of celebrity. It\u2019s actually quite rare that the Uniter is seen by any one, or even leaves the place that he died. That blown-up forest is considered sacred ground to the military, and on the anniversary of his death, the recruits that pass muster are taken there, so that they learn of him, and his sacrifice. Well, I hope that you make it through the training. The military could use a man of your leadership capabilities.\u201d (Tiny)<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Besides, it is time for you to get up anyways.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I just fell asleep.\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, considering that you fell asleep before lunch, had supper at twenty-three hundred, that\u2019s eleven P.M. for civilians, fell asleep at zero hundred, or midnight, and got up just now, I\u2019d say that you\u2019ve had more sleep than me, because I went to bed at two hundred, or two o\u2019clock, and woke up at four hundred thirty, that\u2019s four thirty in civilian time. That\u2019s two and a half hours worth of sleep for me kid. You had well over ten hours worth, so I don\u2019t want to hear you complaining about being tired when you\u2019ve had four times as much sleep as me, and I\u2019m ready to fight a platoon of giants. Now, get up, get some clothes, take a shower, get dressed, and get some breakfast in you. Today will be the longest day of your life.\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd here I thought yesterday was the longest day of my life,\u201d Jenkins said, with a groan, as he got up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah, but yesterday you didn\u2019t really do a thing. Now hurry up, I\u2019ll be at the Mess Hall when you are done showering and dressed,\u201d Bloodtooth said, as she left, with a strange smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLess then thirty minutes later, Jenkins was in the Mess Hall, getting his breakfast, when he noticed that every officer had a sidearm, of some strange design, on their waist, and a gas mask next to them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d he asked, when he sat between Bloodtooth and Wolfblood to eat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSometimes the recruits are a little impatient when it comes to getting their breakfast during the first few days,\u201d Wolfblood said, sipping away at a cup of blood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is why every officer carries a tranquilizer pistol, to handle things if there is only a few who try to disrupt things. If the majority of them are disruptive, we have knockout gas that takes care of all of them. Either way, the person will either be extremely drowsy, or fall asleep, preventing them from causing much trouble for a few hours. When they wake up, or recover from the effects, they will suffer a long dressing down from their guiding officer, much like I am to you kid,\u201d Bloodtooth said, as she looked at Jenkins, as she cut at a, relatively, lightly cooked piece of meat, that had some blood on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI noticed that your voice sounds much better today,\u201d Jenkins said, as he ate some scrambled eggs, trying not to be squeamish at the sight of blood on the officer\u2019s plate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is much better,\u201d she said, as she noticed his reaction to the blood on her meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, you don\u2019t have to sit next to me if you feel uncomfortable,\u201d she said, placing a hand on his shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just that, given what happened yesterday at that restaurant, it reminded me of the day that my family was murdered, all of that blood, it brought back memories that I\u2019d rather keep buried.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEvery soldier goes through something like that,\u201d Wolfblood said, as he finished his cup of blood, \u201cEspecially if they were a human who was brought back as a zombie or, in my case, a vampire. I remember when I had to feed from my first living, and willing, meal, as it were, and not a pouch or a cup. It was a human officer, a female, who was helping out newly turned vampires, so that they could control their urge, to drink only as much blood as they needed. Well, as much as I knew that I needed to feed, as I hadn\u2019t been given any blood to drink, I couldn\u2019t bring myself to do it, because she looked a lot like my daughter could potentially look like, when she becomes an adult. Her hair, her eyes, even her voice, they were all similar to her. However, there was something about the way that she reassured me, in how her own brother had gone through it, that gave me the confidence to drink some of her blood, from her wrist mind you, not the neck, as I was not sure how to drink at that vein without causing someone to potentially bleed to death, until later during my training. Well, unlike most vampires with their first living meal, I showed a decent level of control over myself, and only drank, at most, three cups of blood from her. Others would have gone for the neck and drank her dry. However, given how I knew what it was like to die, and be brought back, as I had died a few times prior to being brought back as a vampire, I didn\u2019t want her to go through that, so, I drank enough to satisfy my thirst, and no more. After a while, I became comfortable with what I had become, and I had no problems drinking from every vein in the body, without causing the other to bleed to death, including the neck, though I try to drink only from the wrist unless otherwise, like when I had to drink the blood of those people yesterday, so they wouldn\u2019t fight me when I was in that kitchen.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, I\u2019ve been meaning to ask, what happened after the explosion? I can\u2019t remember a thing besides falling into your arms.\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, after you fell unconscious, we put you into the shrink bag,\u201d Bloodtooth said, as she finished up her first plate and got up to get another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShrink bag?\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a mage\u2019s pouch,\u201d Wolfblood said, as he got one out of his pocket. \u201cWhatever you put in it will shrink to the size of a grain of rice, whether it is weapons, food, medical supplies, or even, wounded soldiers and prisoners, both those you free from the enemy, and those enemy soldiers that you have captured. The bag protects anything in it from harm, in any shape or form, including stomach acids even. Of course, if you decide to swallow the bag for safekeeping, you best secure this string here to one of your back teeth, otherwise your stomach will have to be purged, in one manner or another, unless of course you decide to wait it out, and have it come out when you go use the latrine. Although, any way that you look at it, being inside of a bag, even when it is not inside of someone, is not a fun way to travel, because, even though you can\u2019t see or hear anything, just in case the person is going someplace classified, and has to use a password to enter the place, you still have your sense of smell to give you information, like if you are near the ocean, in a wetland forest, a dry desert, or in someone\u2019s stomach, or bowels. Trust me when I say that while I prefer to not travel in that fashion, it is still the safest way to travel in hostile territory.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Jenkins asked, \u201cSo, what happened to the rest, those bought by that place, and the children that we took from those patrons?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(The following is Wolfblood speaking)<br>\r\n\u201cWell, much like you, they too were placed under a dream spell, only instead of having to deal with sick and twisted instructors, those of enlisting age are basically taking a peaceful vacation, until they recover enough to be allowed to wake up, where they can choose to go back to being a civilian, or join the military. Those under the recruitment age are basically going through school, and their normal daily lives, only everyone is the same race as them, until they also recover enough to wake up, where we find a good home for them, preferable one under the protection of the military, or one of the officers themselves will take care of them. As for the really young ones, well, if they are still being breastfeed, some of the younger female officers will volunteer to be mothers, as it were, and the medic-mages, wizards, witches, or whatever they are called, will cast some spell on them that will cause them to lactate and produce milk for the child. When they don\u2019t need to be breastfeed anymore, the medics will remove the spell from them, as it can last for about three years at least, and at that point, the officer may adopt the child as their own, or let one of their family members care for it. As for those we took from those patrons, we make their parents sign a contract, if they want to have their child back. Basically, if they, or their child, eat someone under the age of recruitment, they will have to choose between being drafted into the service, or having their child being claimed as military property.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you serious about that?\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery, even if the civilian population disregards the potential ramifications of the taking of the life of others, claiming it as a necessity for survival, the military sees all life as important, no matter what. You could be a homeless bum, a runaway slave, a powerful politician, or the leader of the country, your life still holds some sort of value, if only to yourself. That is why the military does what it can to recruit those who have no real choices in life, like the homeless, people in prison, or those about to become someone\u2019s meal, especially those who are humans. The rest range from school or collage dropouts, those who honestly want a career in the military, the lesser offspring of the wealthy, people seeking a challenge and adventure, those who are society\u2019s outcasts, like those born of two different non-humans, much like what Tiny is, and those who really don\u2019t see any other alternatives, for whatever reason. We take all of them, help them finish school or collage if need be, and train them to look out for each other, and help others out when the need arises, and, if need be, to fight for what is right for others.\u201d (Wolfblood)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThose of us in the military don\u2019t just fight for the Constitution, you should know. We fight for the day that a giant will see a human trying to cross a very busy street and will pick him up, not to eat him, but to set him on the other side so that he can continue on his way. We fight for the day that a wizard, a mage, or whatever, will look at their human brethren, and embrace them as family. We fight for the day that a child can go to school, and his parents won\u2019t have to worry that he may get eaten, or that he won\u2019t have parents when he comes home. We fight for the day that stockyards are replaced with orphanages and fostering houses. We fight for the day that one person of one race will see a person of another, and see them as equals, instead of as potential prey or a potential predator. That, my dear Uniter, is what we in the military fight for.\u201d (Wolfblood)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll of that, just because of what my great-grandfather did nearly a century ago.\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, all of it, and we won\u2019t stop until his dream becomes true for everyone.\u201d (Wolfblood)<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A few hours later, while Bloodtooth was introducing Jenkins to her niece, a ten year old girl named Denise, who had some slight magical skills, which she had inherited from her father, who was a medic-mage, who had truly died while protecting his patients, a year before the crash that took the lives of the rest of her family, except for Aunty Cindy, Bloodtooth\u2019s given name, who asked one of the other officers\u2019 family to take care of her when she was unable to herself, when the rest of the recruits started to trickle in, slowly. Each of them was escorted by an officer, whom the recruit looked at with a mixture of hope and fear in their eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe guiding officer is always of the race one fears the most,\u201d Bloodtooth whispered when Jenkins asked her about the officers that escorted the recruits. \u201cIf it isn\u2019t a real race, or is one that is quite rare, a shape-shifter will change his or her shape into what it is that the recruit fears. If that race won\u2019t fit in the part of the barracks that they are to use, like if a human is afraid of giants for instance, an illusion is place on the recruit\u2019s eyes, so that he or she sees their guiding officer as a giant or whatever it is that they fear. As the person gets over their remaining fear of that race, real or imaginary, that person is told the truth told the reason for the deception, like if the officer is really a fellow human and not a giant, or some such thing, and the shape-shifters reveal themselves for what they are, and the deception is dropped.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, what if a giant is afraid of something like a mage?\u201d Jenkins asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Bloodtooth shook her head, chuckled, and said, \u201cWell, while I\u2019ve never known one to come in here with a fear of mages, one did have a fear of rats, because, as a child, the pet rat of a human friend of his bit his finger quite hard and caused him a lot of pain, and he had a fear of rats ever since then. Well, a shape-shifting officer turned herself into a human-sized, humanoid rat-like creature, so that his fear had a physical form, as it were. Given how the recruit had to be in the giant section of the barracks, she more or less ordered him to carry her everywhere they went, from the showers, to the Mess Hall, to the grounds, to the sleeping quarters, everywhere, so, I guess that, if a giant had a fear of mages, or something human sized, they\u2019d have to do something similar to that.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, here is a question, how does one part of the barracks communicate with the other?\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean between those in the giant section and those in our section?\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, how does that work?\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we tend to use cameras and microphones. In fact, Tiny has a monitor in his kitchen that lets him know what is going on in here, like if the buffet needs more food, if there is an emergency, such as a fire, or if some of the recruits are causing some sort of ruckus, whether it is because they honestly don\u2019t like each other or if they are impatient to get a meal, so he can either activate the water sprinkler or the knockout gas, or some such thing. Also, there are similar things in the other parts of the giants\u2019 section of the barracks, just in case of trouble. In turn, we have to let them know of faulty plumbing, like in the bathrooms or the showers, as theirs shares the same relative space as ours, if there is a leak somewhere, or, during the winter, if the cold is getting in, as that raises the heating bill, and other such things. Basically, they depend on us to do our part, and we depend on them to do their part, which how the whole military works, we depend on each other. The Air Force fights in the air, the Navy fights in the water, the Coast Guard patrols the waterways, the Army fights on the land, and the Marines fight anyplace that is connected to both land and sea. We all work together, and we\u2019ll keep fighting until the day that the proverbial battle ax is used to cut down trees for housing, the sword is bent into a plowshare, and, above all else, that ones teeth and claws are not used to rend the flesh off of another so it can be eaten.\u201d \u201cDamn, is that what the military really fights for?\u201d \u201cYep, in fact, stunts like the one that I pulled yesterday are actually allowed, especially when we know without a doubt that those under recruitment age are being served as meals there. In fact, it was a set-up from the get go, because once the owner buys what is considered military property without a proper license to do so, we can roll in and claim everyone that they have, pressgang the patrons, take their children, whatever.\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut what if someone went to the law to report it?\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell let me say this, the weakest human soldier can take on the strongest civilian police officer. By the time we are through training you, you will be able to take down a civilian giant without moving a muscle.\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, how will I be able to do that?\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou look them dead in the eyes, with a look that says, \u2018Don\u2019t even try buddy. You\u2019ll be dead before you ever flatten me.\u2019 Do that little trick, and ninety-nine percent of the time, the guy will back off. Of course, if that doesn\u2019t work, you will know their weaknesses, little things that civilians try to keep secret from others, especially those they hunt, and you will be able to beat them using those.\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes the military really know the weaknesses of every race?\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey have to, both to take on those who are our enemies, and to help those who are our comrades. After all, if you are fighting a giant, that is an enemy, you want to kill him as quickly as possible, so that you can help out your injured ally, who is also a giant. Also, you may want to use a weapon that is currently hurting an ally, so you can use it on an enemy that is of the same race as your ally.\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike what?\u201d Jenkins asked, curiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike what it is that you need to protect me from, so that you can use it on the traitor that killed your family,\u201d Bloodtooth said, as she stroked her niece\u2019s hair, as she kept an eye on the new recruits walking into the Mess Hall, with a mixture of amazement and confusion on their faces, as they came in, got their breakfasts, and sat down near their guiding officers, much like what Jenkins had done the previous day.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They were told to shut up, sit down, and eat the food that their guiding officers gave them, and that they were lucky that she hadn\u2019t torn their heads off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they were finished eating, the recruits, including Jenkins, as well as those who were giants, whose guiding officers were about the same size as them, were lead out onto the grounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in front of them was a two headed giant, who was easily five hundred feet tall, looking at them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man\u2019s right head looked like that of a human, except that it had a large horn growing from the top of it. His left head was like that of a Cyclops, with one large eye right above his nose, and he also had, what looked to be like the tusks of an elephant, coming out of his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am called Connery,\u201d said the right head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I am called Shaun,\u201d said the left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u201dHowever, you will address us as Drill Sergeant Shaun-Connery,\u201d\u201d the two heads said together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, a few of the recruits began to chuckle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u201dDo you find something funny about Our Name?!?\u201d\u201d the two heads asked, loudly, looking at the culprits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo sir,\u201d said a giant recruit that was looking at the head called Connery. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSame with me sir,\u201d said a neko that found itself in the Drill Sergeants\u2019 hand, looking into the eye of the head called Shaun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u201dGood,\u201d\u201d the heads said, as the neko was placed on the shoulder of the giant recruit. \u201c\u201dOur mother like the actor by that name, so much so, she decided to name our heads after him.\u201d\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Drill Sergeant began to walk around the recruits, checking each and every single one of them out, even to the point of picking up the smaller ones, and examining every part of their bodies that the two heads could, without removing their clothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u201dThe military expects us to train you, you lousy, lazy, unfit, and ungrateful wretches,\u201d\u201d the heads said. \u201c\u201cWe say that none of you will even make it to graduation, because you lack discipline, control, teamwork, respect, and many other things necessary for this military to run smoothly.\u201d\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, when they stopped to look at Jenkins, their three eyes bulged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy, my,\u201d the right head said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt looks like we have a bit of a celebrity within our midst,\u201d the left head said, as they picked Jenkins up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe heard of you from Chef,\u201d the right head said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe tells us that you beat out the commander\u2019s personal test records of fifteen total hours, in less than two hours, total.\u201d the left said, with both of them giving him quick smiles on their faces, as if they expected great things to come from him, which vanished almost as quickly as they appeared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u201dHowever,\u201d\u201d they said, as they set him down on the ground, just like they did with the other recruits that they picked up. \u201c\u201dSuch things do not impress us. We do not care if you were the star player on the football team in high school. We do not care if you scored in the top ten percent on your SATS. We do not care if your father runs the oil company, or the local general store. We do not care if your family is rich, or some homeless bum that made the choice to serve in the military instead of starving on the streets. We care about none of the lives you had before you signed up. All that WE care about is what YOU do from here on out. By the time you graduate, if you even make it that far, you will find yourselves doing things you never thought possible. You will find yourselves doing things you never even thought of doing. You will find yourselves seeing things you\u2019ve never seen before, even in places that you thought you knew about. You will see what others don\u2019t, hear what others don\u2019t, smell what others don\u2019t, and you will also taste and feel what others do not. Also, should you make it to graduation; you will find yourselves amongst the best of the best of the world\u2019s military forces. Everywhere that you go from then on, you will be representing our nation\u2019s military, and you will be expected to uphold our rules, and follow our codes of honor. If you think you can\u2019t do that, you have twenty-four hours to decide whether or not to stay in the military, or to go back to your previous lives. You are all dismissed until tomorrow at seven hundred hours, that\u2019s seven o\u2019clock in the morning, you civilians. Until then, feel free to enjoy the comforts of the Mess Hall, the showers, and your sleeping quarters, and talk to your guides about what it is that you want to do. That is all.\u201d\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the Drill Sergeants nodded their heads, turned about on one foot, leaving a large circle of dirt and torn grass roots, and walked off to a large building.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cThat was Sergeant TwoHeads, as we call them,\u201d Bloodtooth said, as she was playing a game of chess with Jenkins sometime later. \u201cThey were a recruit that I picked up, about seven years back. (Bloodtooth\u2019s close to thirty years of age, which sort of explains any details that Jenkins had been wondering about, like her niece.) I found them in an alley on the wrong side of the giant section of a city in the Midwest. At the time, they had been in a fight with a gang of ruffians, which had stolen, or destroyed, something which had great value to them, and had left the two of them to die, as they were pretty injured. Given how I knew that they would not have survived without immediate assistance, I called for a squad of giants to come transport them to the base, so they could be given medical attention. Of course, I knew that it would take the squad a while to get there so, as the first one on the scene, it was my job to give them first aid, which included splinting a broken thigh bone, not an easy task, not even for giants. Thankfully, by the time the squad got there, Shaun had woken up, which was a bit of a relief for me, because both heads had been knocked out, with him being more seriously injured than Connery. Of course, given a Cyclops\u2019s lack of depth perception, he only saw the squad of giants; as they kneeled down to ask if he and his brother were alright. It was at that moment that I decided to take my leave, when Connery woke up, and saw me. He asked me to stop and tell him who I was, which got the other one\u2019s attention. I just smiled and told them to ask the squad for that information, after all, I had some other business to take care of at the time, like tracking down those ruffians and taking care of them, which I did, just don\u2019t ask how. Anyways, even before they got up on their feet, they asked the doctors taking care of them if they could see me. Well, seeing as to how I had something to give them, a gold chain necklace, with an actual diamond pendant, and not one of those barbaric things, which has a person dangling from it or some such thing, that I thought belonged to them, I told the doctors that I wouldn\u2019t mind visiting them. Well, we got to talking; when I asked them if the ruffians had stolen anything of value from them. At this, the two seemed to cry, telling me about how those men had stolen a gold necklace, with a diamond pendant, from them, and that they had bought it for their mother for her birthday. At that moment, I had told the officer that had brought me in to see them, to show them what I had found. I tell you, you could not have imagine two happier faces when the officer brought that necklace out of his pocket and put it on the stand next to their bed. One month later, imagine my surprise when I saw them enter the barrack, and asking if they could sign up, as part of their gratitude to me for recovering their mother\u2019s present. I tell you, you would not have found a recruit more willing to try new things than those two were. The pair graduated at the top of their class.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Bloodtooth smiled, as she moved a piece and said, \u201cCheckmate kid, I win.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh come on, you still owe me for yesterday,\u201d Jenkins said, as Bloodtooth used her werewolf queen to take out his vampire king. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh really,\u201d Bloodtooth said, raising an eyebrow. \u201cI thought that the bet was that you see me in my human form, naked, if the patrons left. Well, from what I saw, they didn\u2019t.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, but still-\u201d As Jenkins tried to speak, Bloodtooth put a finger over his mouth and said, \u201cBut, of course, you are correct that I do owe you for something. However, before we discuss that, I need you to do something for me.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what would that be?\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet naked, and I\u2019ll do the same. After all, I did say that I\u2019d have some fun with you if your plan worked, and for the most part it did.\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, what sort of fun are you planning on?\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s for me to know, and for you to find out. Now, unless you don\u2019t want to have any fun, start stripping, Uniter.\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa,\u201d Jenkins said, a few hours later. \u201cHow often did you say that you did with one of the others?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot too often,\u201d Bloodtooth said, as she let out a sigh of happiness. \u201cI tend to do it, maybe a few times a month at the most.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, however many times you do it, that was, incredible,\u201d Jenkins said, as he looked at Bloodtooth, who was naked, like he was, and in her human form at that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad that you liked it,\u201d Bloodtooth said, gently kissing him. \u201cHowever, you should know that I can\u2019t do it too often with just you. After all, I shouldn\u2019t, get too attached to you, as it were. After all, if we get sent into a combat zone, I may have to, issue an order that could get you killed, permanently, or worse, captured and tortured by the enemy. I should know about that stuff, as I\u2019ve seen plenty of men and women get killed, captured, and tortured, and a host of other things. That scene yesterday, when you shot that dridder, and when you froze up like that, I\u2019ve seen it before. It is one thing for a recruit to kill another by accident while in training, after all, we have medics on the base, but out there, death can be permanent, and you are faced with those who plan to take your life, or those of your squad mates, permanently, so you have to take their life to protect, not only yourself, but your squad mates. However, if you froze up in a combat situation, both you, and your squad, could be killed, especially if the others can\u2019t run, and you medic is trying to do what he can to heal the others. You can\u2019t stop fighting, no matter what. It doesn\u2019t matter if you are tired, hungry, or even on Death\u2019s Door yourself, you fight with every breath you take, and when you run out of ammunition for your firearm, you fix that bayonet, and you get to stabbing and slashing with that blade, and when that or your gun is broken or taken away, you fight tooth and nail, even if your teeth were not evolved for tearing out the throats of prey, and your claws can\u2019t do more than scratch your rival\u2019s hide, you do every bit of damage that you can until either you or they lay dead in the dust when it settles.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Jenkins sees a strange look in Bloodtooth\u2019s eyes, as if she was actually seeing what it was that she had told him. \u201cHas that ever happened to you?\u201d he asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah, dozens of times,\u201d Bloodtooth said, as she sat on the edge of the bed that they had been on, and started shifting back into her werewolf form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(The following is about Bloodtooth's first battle, and how she got her nick name.)<br>\r\n\u201cThe first time it happened about eleven years ago, outside of a small village in one of the Pacific Islands. It was supposed to be a simple two day recon mission, one day to the village, spend the night there, try to find out the location of this one terrorist group, and head back to base. When we got there though, everyone, from the village elder, on down to a newborn baby, had been slaughtered. The sight of a young girl, with blood pooling around her body, caused me to freeze up. It reminded me of when my younger sister had been murdered, that same look of fear and terror in her eyes. The squad leader issued a single order, police and take care of the dead, because it is against the code of conduct to just eat another person\u2019s body, even if your belly is hungry for food. Then again, the medic we had was able to revive those who were, mostly, intact. As for those he couldn\u2019t revive, we took care of the bodies in accordance to the customs of the natives, and burned them. That night, as the survivors that we had revived told us what happened, they came back. Our commanding officer had gone to use a tree to take care of some needs, and when he didn\u2019t come back within ten minutes, I knew that something was wrong. Another soldier and I went to look for him, but, all we found was his head, and even that was in pieces. I could only identify him by a gold tooth on the right part of a lower jaw that we found, as well as the scent of his blood. When my comrade and I got back to the village, it was under attack. Well, I carved a path of death and destruction, so my comrade, a human, and I could rejoin the others, most of which were critically injured, including the medic, as well as many of the villagers, most of which only had tribal weapons, like clubs, blowpipes, bows and arrows, and the like, while this group had more modern weapons, like steel blades, automatic rifles, grenades, and a few had rocket launchers even. Well, I looked at my comrade and told him to call for reinforcements, as he was our radioman. While he did that, I fought, first using my rifle, then my shotgun, followed by my Desert Eagle and Colt revolver, followed by those of my comrades. When the ammunition for those weapons ran out, I took some from an enemy body, and used that, and when that was spent, I discarded it, pulled out my K-bar, and grabbed a machete from a dead villager, and I became a whirlwind of blood, death, destruction, and mayhem, using blade, teeth, and claws to kill the enemy. By the time the sun rose, the last enemy fighter was dead, and I was covered in blood, some of it mine, but, the rest of it was the blood of the enemy. The river nearby ran red with it, and I sat under a waterfall, in an attempt to wash it out. As I sat under it, I saw the village shaman, or witch doctor, or whatever, standing on the edge of the river, chanting something, looking up at the sky, looking at the blood filled river, and pointing towards me on occasion. At first, I thought that he was praying for the river to return to normal. However, as I listened to him, I heard him say my name, or at least, the translation of it in his language. Also, I saw a smile on his face, whenever he looked at me. It was then I realized that he was blessing me, as if I was some sort of hero to his people, which I was, in a sense. When reinforcements arrived, a day or two later, to take care of the wounded, just before I was about to leave, he gave me a flat blue and green stone that had a hole drilled through it, that was on a string. One of the villages, who could speak our language well enough, told me that it was to ensure that the spirits of the forest and the river would be at my side when I needed help.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you serious? Some primitive tribe\u2019s shaman, basically, gave you a good luck charm?\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, and it wasn\u2019t just him that gave me one. Let\u2019s get dressed and I\u2019ll show you them.\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin ten minutes Jenkins was once again amazed, but this time, it wasn\u2019t because of Bloodtooth\u2019s naked body laying next to him and doing incredible things with his, but because of the wide variation of gifts that those she had helped had given her. There were stones of amazing colorations, teeth and claws of dangerous beasts, like big cats, bears and the like, pouches with pebbles and dried seeds, ornate weapons with intricate shapes and designs, and many, many more things than what one could describe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow,\u201d he said, as he looked them over, seeing the description of each item, what it stood for, where she had been given it, why she\u2019d been given it, and some other things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre all of these yours?\u201d he asked, as he picked up the flat blue and green stone that she had told him about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep,\u201d she said, as she carefully removed the stone from his hand, and gently set it back into place. \u201cHowever, I would appreciate it if you just looked, and didn\u2019t touch them. I may not be superstitious about such things, but these are gifts, objects of great importance to those who gave then to me. That stone, for instance, is said to have been created by the gods of the water and earth of those villagers that I save on that Pacific island, making it a sacred item amongst their tribe. For someone to be given one, they must posses a great deal of strength and rightness, and to be willing to give their life to protect others, even if they know nothing about them. In fact, all of these things share a similar meaning to the people who gave them to me.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you take them everywhere?\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, that way the magic of the objects will stay with me, and that the spirits that they are said to represent are not offended with me leaving them where they will do me no good. Besides, they do seem to posses some sort of magic within them. In fact, if you listen closely, I\u2019m sure that a human like you can hear what they are trying to say.\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Jenkins lowered his ear to the objects, and tried to listen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute, he said, \u201cI can\u2019t hear a thing.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re trying too hard,\u201d Bloodtooth said, as she sat down on the bed. \u201cYou must sit down, close your eyes, and relax.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jenkins did that, he still couldn\u2019t hear a thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou must relax your mind,\u201d Bloodtooth said. \u201cThe magic will not talk to you if you are busy thinking about other things.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a while, Jenkins still couldn\u2019t hear a thing, until he began to think about the others. He saw their looks of praise, of hope, and then he heard it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard what sounded like a multitude of voices, all saying the same thing, just in a wide variety of languages. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think that I heard it,\u201d he said, as he opened his eyes. \u201cIt was amazing.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounded like a large number of people saying the same thing in a wide variety of languages, am I right?\u201d Bloodtooth asked, as she opened her eyes as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah, do you know what it is that is being said?\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah, my name,\u201d Bloodtooth said, with a bit of a grin. \u201cThey are all saying my name in their native languages, telling me to protect others like I protected them.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that what is really being said?\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo be honest, I wouldn\u2019t know about the rest of what is being said, but they all are saying my name first. The rest of it is an educated guess, based on what those who gave them to me told me. They would say things like, \u2018Thank you for saving our village/tribe/group,\u2019 or, \u2018Thank you for saving our village elder/chieftain/shaman/whatever,\u2019 or, and this is my personal favorite, \u2018Thank you for saving our children.\u2019 After that, they would tell me what the talismans meant to them, like if it had belonged to a great warrior that once lived in the village, if it was a sacred religious symbol, if they, or some relative of theirs, had gotten it for some great deed that they had done, or anything else that made the token important to them. In fact, sometimes the children would try to give me their favorite toys, as a thank you for saving them. However, while I did accept the others, I wouldn\u2019t take the toys, because I told them that I wouldn\u2019t know what to do with them, but I would give them something that appeased them.\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what was that?\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA lock of my hair, and I\u2019m not talking about my werewolf fur kid. I would shift into my human form, get out my knife, cut a few strands of the hair on my head, and braid it into a thin cord, and give that to them, saying that it would be as if my spirit was with them should they ever encounter danger again. For some reason, this always seemed to please everyone, and not just the children. Then again, the lives that those people tend to lead are full of dangers, so they need all the help, and hope, that they can get.\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou really do that?\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yah, I do that kid. That is the real job of a soldier, to give hope where once there was none.\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once again, the next day, Jenkins found himself waking up to the sound of Reverie being played off-key, and this time, he wasn\u2019t grumbling, at least not like most of the other recruits, who fell silent when they saw Bloodtooth walking around and tossing recruits out of their beds, telling them to get some clothes, take their showers, get dressed, and report to the Mess Hall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see that you\u2019re up recruit,\u201d she said to him, as she tossed a vampire out of his bed, when he tried to complain that he hadn\u2019t had enough sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI noticed that,\u201d Jenkins said, as he stood up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI heard that you had a chat with the Quartermaster, and you listened to him as he played a few tunes that he liked to play,\u201d Bloodtooth said, as she punched a demon that threaten to light her on fire, telling him that the last guy that did that found himself carrying his head to the medic. \u201cDid you like any of them?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know if I liked them, per say, but they weren\u2019t that bad. By the way, are you always this hard on the recruits? I see that you seem to hit those that complain about things.\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGlad you noticed,\u201d she said, as she grabbed the snout of a lizard-like creature, and hauled him out of bed. \u201cHowever, I\u2019m not the only one that does this part of the job. If anything, I\u2019m the one you\u2019d want to drag you out of bed, and waking you up. In fact, Wolfblood is the last person you\u2019d want to wake you up. Those who don\u2019t wake up, when he tells them to, often find themselves short a cup or two of blood, and a bite mark on their neck.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo where does someone like him get blood to drink?\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSimple really, every living person on the base, including those not actually part of the military, like Tiny, and his helpers, and the food growers, donates a unit of blood a month. The fresh blood is used in case someone needs a blood transfusion, and the older, or spoiled, blood is given to the vampires, or others who need blood, as part of their diet, to use. Of course, if we run out, or if you and him, or some other vampire, are stuck someplace, and don\u2019t have any blood, he has to ask for permission from you if he can drink some of your blood, especially if your traps for catching animals are empty. In such cases, it might be best if you give him permission; so that he won\u2019t try to drink you dry if you cut something, which will trigger the urge for him to feed, and cause him to drain you dry.\u201d(Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cAnd you would know about that, right?\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me guess, Wolfblood told you about that incident in that desert?\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah it was how I learned his name.\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, just for you to know, that little stunt probably saved both of our lives. Even in my human body, I couldn\u2019t take the heat, and I was bleeding internally anyways. I knew that I was dead anyways, so, I did what I had to do, so that he could get the information that he had to base. To be honest, while we had met in passing, it wasn\u2019t until after I had rescued him that we started to get to know each other. After all, if you had a good deal of another person\u2019s blood in you, wouldn\u2019t you want to get to know them?\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t know about that. I\u2019ve never needed something like a blood transfusion.\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I hope that you don\u2019t ever need one, however, all living recruits are still required to give blood, in case it is ever needed. After all, the blood that you give today may save the person next to you tomorrow. Now, get going, the Drill Sergeant/s still expect you, and every other recruit that decides to stay, to show up on the grounds by seven hundred hours, and I suggest that you get used to military time kid, because I don\u2019t plan on using anymore civilian names for the hours of the day, though I will give you a hint. If the time is more than twelve hundred, take that number, subtract twelve hundred from it, put a P.M. on it, and you will know when to show up, though you best get used to thinking in military time.\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks then,\u201d Jenkins said, as he left the room, heading to the showers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice kid,\u201d Bloodtooth thought, as she grabbed the ears of a young kitsune/werewolf hybrid, and tossed him from his bed. \u201cI hope he makes it, and gets to meet him.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>At precisely seven o\u2019clock, or, as he had been told to think of and call it, seven hundred hours, Jenkins was on the grounds, with every other recruit that had decided to stay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he heard the Quartermaster say his name for roll call, he gave out a loud \u201cHere Sir!\u201d that put many of the giants\u2019 shouts, when they said the same thing, to shame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds like we have some very enthusiastic recruits, brother,\u201d said the head called Shaun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d have to agree,\u201d said the head called Connery, as the pair looked down at Jenkins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter giving him a slight smile, which caused Jenkins to be somewhat embarrassed, the two head Drill Sergeant told the Quartermaster to continue with the roll call. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another ten, or so, minutes, the two heads look at the recruits, and then at each other, and smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, looks like we lost that bet, brother,\u201d Connery said, with a grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is always one bet that I don\u2019t mind losing,\u201d Shaun said, with a chuckle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u201dEspecially since the commander always keeps an eye out and gives wavering recruits the encouragement that they need to stay in boot camp,\u201d\u201d they both said, as they looked back at the recruits, especially those who had been on the fence on whether or not to stay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou see recruits,\u201d Connery said. \u201cMy brother and I have a running bet with the commander. If he wins, we have to take it, relatively, easy on you. If we win, you recruits have to do things that we know would really be embarrassing, like having all of you do everything naked, from target practice, marching in the mud and rain, everything.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, seeing as to how we lost the bet, which was on how many of you left, which was none this year, we have to go easy on you,\u201d Shaun said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe recruits looked at each other in amazement. Military training was going to be easy for them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHowever, by easy we do not mean that you will be doing what ever you want,\u201d Shaun said. \u201cIt only means that, instead of carrying a weight five or more times your own, on your back, you will start by carrying a weight one fifth of your own. For those of you who can\u2019t do fractions, if your weight is say, one hundred pounds, you will have to carry twenty pounds, and those who are heavier will carry still heavier weights. Of course, this weight is because of a gravitational spell that will be placed on you, that way if your body can\u2019t take the pressure, it will be decreased until your body can take it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfter all, Uncle Sam wants soldiers who are fit and strong, not flattened to death,\u201d Connery said, as the pair walked around, observing the recruits\u2019 reactions to the news. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey then looked at Jenkins and asked, \u201c\u201dIs our little celebrity worried about a little bit of weight training?\u201d\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo Sirs,\u201d Jenkins said. \u201cAlthough, I will admit that I am a little bit nervous about it, Sirs.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is good to be nervous about things,\u201d Shaun said, as he and his brother looked at the recruits. \u201cIt shows you what you have to work on.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlso, it is also acceptable to be afraid of things,\u201d Connery said. \u201cFear can motivate one to do great things, especially when the fear of one thing is worse than the fear of another thing. In fact, even my brother and I have our fears. For one thing, we are afraid of being trapped in a burning building.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHowever, we would be more afraid if someone we cared about was trapped in a burning building.\u201d (Shaun)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis would mean that we would have to face that one fear, so that we would not have to worry about the other.\u201d (Connery)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u201dHere you will learn to recognize what you thought was your worse fear was nothing compared to what you will find that you really fear.\u201d\u201d (Both)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Drill Sergeants then looked down at an older looking human, who had a white patch with a red cross on his outfit, and said, \u201c\u201dThey are yours, Doc.\u201d\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, they stepped back, indicating that the human was in charge now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello recruits,\u201d the man said, in a ragged, and wheezy, sounding voice. \u201cI am Doctor Charles, but you can call me Doc. I am here to take care of any medical needs that arise during your training, such as broken bones, gashes, as well as the occasional gun shot wound, and other injuries that you may get.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, one of the giant recruits whispered, \u201cThe old human looks like he couldn\u2019t put a band-aid on a paper cut on his own finger.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caused the other recruits around him, except for Jenkins, to start chuckling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, I see we have one who doubts my abilities. Well, there is a saying about old bones, they never forget an injury done to them,\u201d the old man said, as he snapped his finger, which caused an audible crack to be heard, and the giant started to scream in pain, as he grabbed his left upper arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMY ARM,\u201d he shouted. \u201cWhat did you do to my arm?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, but it wasn\u2019t me who broke it,\u201d the old man said, as he looked at the young giant, who was clenching at his arm still. \u201cYou broke it during football practice when you were in the tenth grade. However, if you would report to the medical tent, I will see about fixing it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant nodded, his face twisted in pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay Sergeant, you two can take him there, and call up my students. After all, fixing bones is something that they must learn about, whether they are a combat medic, or a civilian doctor,\u201d the old man said, as he turned to the Sergeants, who, using their whole right arm, saluted him, and escorted the young man to a large building, with a large white circle that had a large red cross on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat must have been the de-heal spell that Bloodtooth told me about,\u201d Jenkins thought. \u201cNote to self, don\u2019t get on his bad side.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, there were more that a few magic users that were amazed at what the old man did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm sir,\u201d said one, who seemed to be speaking for the rest of the magic users. \u201cHow did you do that sir?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhich thing are you talking about? How I knew about his football injury, or how I re-broke his bone?\u201d (Doc)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, that would be both sir.\u201d (magic wielding recruit)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, the answer as to how I knew of his injury is because of the fact that we do complete, and thorough, physical examination of each recruit when they are first put under the dream spell, which all of you have experienced, though there were some that I was disappointed with after the point that you met the drill sergeant, which is based off of our most decorated officer, Lieutenant Bloodtooth, whom I see that many of you have meet up with. To be honest, the only one that really scares her is the base commander, and he is the last person that any of you want to mess with, though he has seen each and every single one of you. However, the people that I am really disappointed in are you magic users,\u201d the old man said, as he stepped in front of the magic user that had spoken up, who was right next to Jenkins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell me recruit,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you think that, as a wizard, that you are superior to this human standing next to you, despite the fact that he made it through the dream spell, and your intelligence quiz, before you?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes sir,\u201d the wizard said. \u201cI know that I am sir.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWrong answer!\u201d the Doc said, as he punched the young wizard in the face, busting his nose. \u201cYou are just a HUMAN, one with \u2018magic\u2019.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he looked at each of the recruits, his eyes as black as coal, showing just how powerful he was, as the more solid and darker a magic user\u2019s eyes were, the more powerful he, or she, was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEach of you, look at the others around you. Right now!\u201d the old man said, in a very powerful, and commanding, voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe recruits felt compelled to look at each other, as to not anger the man, and suffer an injury by his strange powers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEach of you is no better, and no worse, than that of any other recruit. I don\u2019t know what people have told you about the military, but know this, if an officer tells you to do some thing, you will not look at them and say, \u2018Hah, you are a human. I don\u2019t have to listen to you, because I am a giant, or some such thing.\u2019 YOU will be EXPECTED to FOLLOW that person\u2019s orders. We do not care if you think that you can beat that officer, because even the strongest of you is no match for the weakest human officer that we have on the base.  If you want a demonstration, would the biggest of you giants step forward?\u201d (Doc)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, a four hundred foot tall giant, who looked completely human except for his size, stepped over the rest, and got a fireball shot at him, right at his chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRecruit,\u201d the old man said, holding up another fireball in his hands, \u201cthe next time that you try to step over someone, especially an officer, it had better be because there wasn\u2019t another way around them. Let this be a warning to the rest of you. Now, once Samual catches his breath, he will find himself facing the weakest human officer that we have on the base, my granddaughter, Jenifer.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, a young woman, who was busy reading a romance novel said, as she blew some bubble gum, \u201cDo I have to grandfather? It wouldn\u2019t be fair to them to face me.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s either you or your uncle, and you know how he is.\u201d (Doc)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, I still say it won\u2019t be fair though.\u201d (Jenifer)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, just try to take it easy on the boy.\u201d (Doc)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, the young male giant was looking down at the young female human officer, who was busy blowing a bubble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you trying to insult me or something?\u201d he asked, as he rolled his eyes at the sight of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, before he looked back down at her, he found himself flat on the ground, looking up at the sky, groaning in pain, which was all over his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI took it easy on him grandfather,\u201d the woman said, as she stood on the other side of him, popping her bubble. \u201cI only took out his pressure points.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Doc chuckled, and looked back at the rest of the recruits, and said, \u201cSamual\u2019s lucky that it was my granddaughter who faced him. Her uncle, my son-in-law, likes to break every bone in a recruit\u2019s body, and will kill them on occasion. Useful for teaching potential medics to revive the dead I guess, as well as healing each bone in a person\u2019s body, however, he is currently overseas, making his own fun, with various insurgent groups, guy loves a good fight. Anyways, as you can clearly see, Jenifer, who is a Private First Class, easily took down a giant, something that no human should be able to do. Now, before you ask, Jenifer has no magic in her, trust me, her father, my son, her mother, and I, had hopes that she had inherited the ability to use magic, if only to a degree, as my son had magic in him, as did her mother, but she wasn\u2019t born with the ability to use it. Also, there was no magic placed on her, nor was any placed on Samual. She just went through the same training that you will go through, in which you will have a gravitational spell placed on you, which will do the same thing as if we placed actual weights on you. However, unlike with physical weights, which can be easily removed, this spell will last until you either quit or graduate, unless you happen to be someone who wishes to help me teach those training to be medics, so that they can learn to heal various injuries, which include, but are certainly not limited to, broken bones, lose of limbs, open wounds, and even, death itself. Also, all of you with the ability to use magic, in any shape or form, are required to take the basic courses for healing with magic. This is because, in case the medic with you is killed, it will be your responsibility to keep your squad mates alive, if only just. As for the rest of you, you will also have to take some medical courses. Now, even though you may not be able to use magic, it is always wise to know how to handle common injuries, like broken bones, slow the bleeding of open wounds, do an emergency blood transfusion, treat burns of all sorts, and other very common injuries, which will serve you well, even if you decide that the military is not the career that you wish to pursue. Now, let\u2019s get down to business. This gravitational field will increase the pressure on your body, making it feel somewhat heavier. Once it is put on, you are to walk around the track, and just walk mind you, until your body gets used to it. Also, as you get stronger, the pressure will increase, slowly mind you, slowly, so that by the time that you graduate, even the weakest of you will be able to do what Jenifer just did.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Jenifer blew and popped another bubble, as she went back to reading her novel, which caused Doc to groan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJenifer, I\u2019ve told you before to not blow bubble gum when I\u2019m trying to talk to the recruits,\u201d he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know that grandfather,\u201d the girl said, with a quite chuckle. \u201cBut you do have to admit, it helps make the recruits underestimate my capabilities.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, she does have a point,\u201d Doc said, as he looked back at the recruits. \u201cYou must never take your opponents lightly, not when we compete with the recruits from other boot camps, and especially, never in combat. If anything, overestimate their capabilities. Some of the worst injuries I\u2019ve treated were caused by races, and people, and other things, which you would think were weak, or even silly. Why, I remember treating a giant for a concussion, all because he slipped on a banana peal that someone forgot to put in the trash. Now, let\u2019s get back to business.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoc then looked at Jenkins and said, \u201cSince you were the first one up and about, you get to be the first to have the spell placed on you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Jenkins gulped, as he stepped forward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNervous recruit?\u201d Doc asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would be lying if I said no, sir,\u201d Jenkins said, as the old man placed a hand on him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry too much,\u201d he said, so everyone could hear. \u201cThe spell takes an hour to fully kick in. That is why you need to walk around the track, so your body can adjust to the increasing weight.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he said quietly, \u201cBy the way, my father served with your great-grandfather. No matter what anyone else tells you, he was a brave soldier. I know of no one who could come close to doing what he did, to willingly take another person\u2019s spot, and die in their place.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he spoke loudly, so all could hear, \u201cNow, go to the track, and start walking, and walk until your body can\u2019t even make another step, and walk past that. When it comes to the point that you can\u2019t even pull yourself with your arms, elbows, and hands, then you can stop. At that point your guiding officer will pick you up, and drag your carcass back to your quarters, and feed you like the little babies that you are.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Five hours later, Jenkins never realized how fantastic that the hard cot that he slept in could feel. He, and every other recruit, was in their quarters, on their beds, all with bodies complaining about the abuse that they had just been put through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you feel kid?\u201d Bloodtooth asked, as she helped feed him some warm soup. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike I just walked across the country without stopping,\u201d Jenkins said, as Bloodtooth put the spoon in his mouth, as, like everyone else, there had came a point that his legs wouldn\u2019t work, and had to crawl until the Doc told them that they could come in then. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, don\u2019t say that to the commander then,\u201d Bloodtooth said. \u201cThe guy just might make you eat those words and have everyone do just that.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure about that?\u201d Jenkins asked, wearily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me go ask him,\u201d Bloodtooth said, making as if to stand up, which made Jenkins really nervous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m just kidding,\u201d she said, leaning over to give him another spoonful of soup, and to kiss him on his forehead. \u201cThe commander may be a hard-ass, but he isn\u2019t that cruel. For the moment, you will be allowed to recuperate from your walk, until it is seventeen hundred.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s five o\u2019clock in the afternoon right?\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, and at that point, the commander will meet with you, as well as the other recruits, out on the grounds. Also, he has an interest in meeting you, personally.\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy is that?\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s just say that his grandfather served alongside of you-know-who.\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe served alongside of my great-grandfather?\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Bloodtooth nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d she said. \u201cIn fact, many of the officers currently in the military, if they are not related to those who served with him, were taught by those who did serve with him, or those related to them, as well as their students. Oh, and I may have some news for you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is that?\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere is a chance that you may not be the last living member of your family. While you and the others were walking, the commander gave me a file about the murders of your father\u2019s brothers and sisters. At one of the places, the remains of one of your cousins, a Tabitha Jensen, were not found. Of course, well, there are ways for a person to kill someone without leaving a body.\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah, I know,\u201d Jenkins said, as he looked away, with tears in his eyes. \u201cHe could have swallowed her, either dead or alive, before he killed the others.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know,\u201d Bloodtooth said, as she wiped the tears away from his eyes. \u201cHowever, it could also mean that she got away from him, and went into hiding, one way or another.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah, but she would have been seventeen then, and well, anything could have happened between now and then. She could have been eaten, turned into a slave, or even turned into a living piece of furniture, or jewelry, or anything else even.\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey,\u201d Bloodtooth said, as she gently turned his head to face her. \u201cI\u2019ll make a promise to you; I\u2019ll help you find her. If she\u2019s alive, I\u2019ll get her for you, even if I have to steal her from her owner. If she\u2019s dead, I\u2019ll kill whoever did the deed, and if we find her remains, I\u2019ll burry them for you, and you can say whatever you need to, to comfort her spirit. On this, you have my word. Together, whether it takes money, or tooth and claw, you and I will find her.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you really mean that, madam?\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, you helped me save my niece. It may have been a set up to catch the owner of the place, but there was that element of fear in me, that we wouldn\u2019t make it in time, that she would have been eaten before we got there. This situation with your cousin is similar. Besides, the moment that Wolfblood marked you, she became military property herself.\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking about? The mark wasn\u2019t there this morning.\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Bloodtooth placed her lips next to his ears, and whispered, \u201cThe next time that you need to take a leak, save the liquid in a container, and have a piece of cloth soak in it for a few minutes, then wash your shoulder with it. The mark will reappear if you do that. In a way, the mark on my niece works in a similar manner, though with her, a light layer of makeup completely protects it from being revealed, as hers is revealed when she washes herself with water, and it takes a lot more than a casual wash to remove that makeup.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut then, what about that brand madam, the one that you happen to have on your shoulder?\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is something that you will receive upon graduation, if you still want to go through with becoming a member on the armed forces. If anything, the blank mark, which you have, is more like telling others that you are military property that the military is not using right now, much like the reserves, who are soldiers that don\u2019t know which branch that they want to serve in. While they do have the brand for soldier on them, until they actually make a choice as to what part of the service to serve in, it will be as if they were a private, or its equivalent. Now, don\u2019t you worry, we will find her, so let\u2019s finish your soup, and you can get some rest. You will need it.\u201d (Bloodtooth)</span></div></div>",

Also, the Commander will be here soon. He just likes to, take his time, as it were, when he actually introduces himself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, a man who looked to be about fifty, walked out of the barracks, with a limp, and using a cane to help him walk. As he went to five officers, one of which was the Lieutenant Colonel, all of the officers, began to salute, as he walked past each of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was in front of the five officers, each of them who were just below the commander, whom the officers of their respective branches reported to, saluted him at once. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood evening sir,\u201d Lieutenant Colonel Jethro Seventails said. \u201cI trust that your walk was a pleasant one.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, that it was Jethro,\u201d the old man said. \u201cThere is nothing like a good long walk to set ones mind at ease, especially since I have to command this place, and keep things running smoothly.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t agree more, sir,\u201d Seventails said, as the old man saluted to the five officers in return. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt ease gentlemen,\u201d he said, as he, and all the other officers, lowered his hand. He then looked at the recruits, walked in front of them, looked at the Drill Sergeants, who nodded, and stepped back, looked back at the recruits, and said, in a normal sounding voice, one that radiated confidence, instead of overwhelming power, \u201cI am Colonel Jacobs Sanders. I am the commander of this fort. Now, if you think that it is beneath you to work under a human, guess what, I don\u2019t give a damn! Here in the military, we do things a lot differently. For instance, if you try something that wouldn\u2019t get you into trouble out there, like raping, or murdering, someone, you could find yourselves being executed, no matter whom you are. We operate under a code, which our founder wrote down before he did what he did. In this code, which will be given to you by your guiding officer, you will see how it is that the entire military is run. This information is not to be revealed to anyone, not even your priest at confession. In fact, we will take you, and your priest, and execute the two of you, right here, on the grounds, and our chaplain will exorcise your spirits, all to keep the code a secret. As for your bodies, the officers will take them, and Chef will cook them up for them. This is because, while soldiers are not allowed to eat their comrades, a traitor is no one\u2019s comrade! That is what you will be if you even as much as talk about it in your sleep. In fact, I will execute you myself, in a way that makes being killed by Doc\u2019s son-in-law seem pleasant, in comparison.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Meanwhile, as the Colonel was giving the recruits the rundown on how the base was run, and what the recruits would be doing, Bloodtooth stood by the barracks, watching Jenkins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe boy has potential,\u201d said one of the other officers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know,\u201d Bloodtooth said. \u201cAnyone who could take on a trained soldier, even one turned traitor, and survive, has the potential to do a lot of things.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you saying that because of what your head is telling you about his capabilities, or is it because you owe his great-grandfather for saving your own great-grandfather\u2019s life, so that you would be born, or is it, your heart?\u201d (Other officer)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have no Idea about what you are talking about,\u201d Bloodtooth said, looking forward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes you do. \u2018Listen Jenkins, I can\u2019t do this with just you too often. After all, if we have to go into combat, and I had developed feelings for you, I might be unable to issue an order that could get you killed.\u2019 Remember?\u201d (Other officer)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou were in my room?\u201d Bloodtooth said, angrily, as she looked at the other officer, a color-changing Chameleon-like creature, who could blend into the background, especially when he was out of uniform. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, it\u2019s my room to,\u201d the man said, his face blending into the red and black speckled bricks of the barracks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout the only things to not vanish were his cap, shirt, and pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut, I wouldn\u2019t worry about it. As long as you don\u2019t tell anyone that I was out of uniform, and walking around naked, I won\u2019t tell anyone about you and your, private, matters,\u201d the man said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell in that case, Lieutenant Changehide, you had better keep your mouth shut, or else I will get some red and white paint and paint a target on the back of your head. That way, when the snipers are looking for you, during their training, they will be able to find you in two seconds.\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh come on Bloodtooth. That isn\u2019t fair.\u201d (Changehide)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, what\u2019s not fair is shaving my fur off before the graduation ceremony last year, especially since it was snowing then.\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh come on, that was a prank. And you have to admit, it was funny.\u201d (Changehide)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGod, why do I put up with you Changehide?\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause we swore an oath,\u201d Changehide said, his voice becoming serious, and he became visible. \u201cYou, me, and the rest of the others, swore that we would find the traitor who murdered The Uniter\u2019s family, and kill him.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, and we also swore to find the survivors as well,\u201d Bloodtooth said, a slight growl in her voice. \u201cJenkins is one, his cousin, a Tabitha Jensen, might be another.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Bloodtooth handed Changehide a file. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did you get this?\u201d he asked, as he opened it up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSimple, the moment that Jenkins joined up, anything referring to him became of military interest, to see if he had any ties to terrorists, if you know what I mean,\u201d Bloodtooth said, as she looked at the commander. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, what about his cousin?\u201d Changehide asked. \u201cAre there any leads?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot for the last five years,\u201d Bloodtooth said. \u201cWith Jenkins, we got very lucky. The moment that he walked into town, the tax collectors were after him. In fact, he had just finished signing his name on the dotted line, when they broke in, looking for him. Thankfully, the officers there were able to persuade them to leave, especially since he had just joined the military.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, how were the officers able to get him to sign?\u201d (Changehide)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey told him that the military would pay off any debts that he had, or some such thing. In fact, the lookout saw him running, and told him to come in if he wanted to lose his pursuers. The guy held them back long enough for Jenkins to answer all one hundred questions in that packet, which every perspective recruit must do before they even sign their name.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow long did that take?\u201d (Changehide)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot even ten minutes,\u201d Bloodtooth chuckled. \u201cThe lookout was a sphinx, and you know how they like to tell riddles.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, in order to get past him, they had to figure out his riddle. Which one was it?\u201d (Changehide)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was the \u2018What is the meaning of life?\u2019 one,\u201d Bloodtooth said, with a grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Changehide started to chuckle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere is no answer to that one,\u201d he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue, but that is why they had to wait until Jenkins was signing his name, before the guard said, \u2018Fine, I\u2019ll let you in. Just don\u2019t expect me to do it again.\u2019\u201d Bloodtooth said, as she gave Changehide a hearty slap on the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, a harpy landed next to the two of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLieutenant Sir!\u201d he said, looking at Bloodtooth, as he saluted the two officers. \u201cI have some important information, in regards to Private Recruit Jenkins, as well as you sir.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what would that be Sergeant?\u201d Bloodtooth asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think that there is someone at the gate that you might want to see,\u201d the sergeant said. \u201cIt is a police officer that you and Wolfblood talked to the other day.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me guess, male, kitsune, between the ages of twenty-five and thirty.\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right. He says that he wants to ask you out on a date. Well, I would have told him to go and steal eggs from a chicken coop, but there was something about him that you should know.\u201d (Harpy sergeant)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat would that be?\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere was a scent on him, similar to that of Jenkins. Now, I know that Jenkins may not have any family members that are kitsunes, but he does have that missing female human cousin, Tabitha Jensen.\u201d (H. Sergeant)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you saying? That he has her?\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat would be my guess madam.\u201d (H. Sergeant)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll right, take me to him. Changehide, go to Wolfblood and tell him to watch Jenkins. Tell him that something important came up.\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell what if he asks where you are?\u201d (Changehide)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell him it involves pet patrol. He\u2019ll get the message.\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Bloodtooth started following the harpy sentry to the front gate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Bloodtooth walked out of the barracks, she saw the kitsune sitting on the trunk of his patrol car, which seemed to sound as if someone was kicking it, from the inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s in the trunk?\u201d she asked, knowing the answer already. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, just some female human,\u201d he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds like she\u2019s a fighter,\u201d Bloodtooth said. \u201cI like those who try to put up a fight.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSame here,\u201d the man said, with a grin. \u201cDo you want to take a look?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, I prefer to see their eyes turn to fear when they see what their fate will be,\u201d Bloodtooth said, as she walked up to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe officer smiled, as he pulled out a set of keys, and popped the trunk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he was doing that, Bloodtooth checked to see if her Desert Eagle was in its holster, as well as her Colt revolver. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the sight of them, the kitsune gave a whistle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cImpressive revolver,\u201d he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know,\u201d Bloodtooth said, watching as the man opened the trunk, to reveal a woman, who had a distinct resemblance to Jenkins, tied up, gagged, and doing everything that she could to try to escape. \u201cI got this revolver from my one comrade before he died after a firefight, a Private William Henry Jenkins. In fact, before he passed on, I made a promise to him, that I would find his cousin, a Tabitha Jensen, and give it to her.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThose sound like human names,\u201d the kitsune said, not noticing the look in the eyes of the woman, who was trying to get free, and fighting him, when she heard the two names. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know how the names are human sounding names,\u201d Bloodtooth said, as she knocked out the woman, Tabitha, so that she wouldn\u2019t reveal herself. \u201cHowever, I am still in debt to him, and his family, just like my great-grandfather was to his, and I am also indebted to that man.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d the kitsune asked, as the two of them put the woman back into the trunk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if Jenkins\u2019s grandfather hadn\u2019t given his life to save mine, I would not have been born. As for Jenkins, he saved my niece a while back. Now obviously, that means that my family is in debt to his, and I don\u2019t like to owe the dead.\u201d (Bloodtooth) <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A few hours later at the kitsune\u2019s house, the two had finished watching a movie, one that Bloodtooth pretended to like, as it was a war movie, which had all the facts wrong. For instance, the sergeant, in real life, was a human, and the privates were kitsunes, not the other way around, and the sergeant only killed one for treason, by shooting him, not two by eating them alive for his supper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat movie, don\u2019t you agree?\u201d he asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah, it was alright, I guess,\u201d Bloodtooth said, with fake enthusiasm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t like it?\u201d the kitsune said, puzzled. \u201cI thought that you would have, considering that you must have been there at some point.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I would have liked it, if they got the details correct.\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean? This is based on a true story.\u201d (Kitsune)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBased on one? Sure it is. But, is it accurate? No.\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d (Kitsune)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know the sergeant in real life, and he is nothing like what this movie depicts him to be. Besides, even if he was a kitsune, he only killed one, and that was by shooting him though the heart and they left his body to rot.\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that how it really went down? Well tell me, if he wasn\u2019t a kitsune, what was he?\u201d (Kitsune)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Bloodtooth smiled and asked, \u201cDid you check out my file, Officer Orangetail?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was impressive. Over thirty separate engagements in over a dozen countries, including a few fights with bandits.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you see my picture or race listed on it?\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the funny thing; those two things were not on it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is because the look of my face, in both forms, and the race that I am, are classified information. We always do this to protect the soldier, or officer, should there be an incident.\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike what?\u201d (Orangetail)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike as to who blew up the Dragon\u2019s Den, as well as that place the other day,\u201d Bloodtooth said, with a knowing smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was you!?\u201d the office said, moving to the other side of the couch, as he had had his arm around her shoulders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yah,\u201d she said, with a grin. \u201cOf course, I did have some help.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat vampire was your accomplice?! I\u2019m going to see that you two get arrested and executed!\u201d (Orangetail)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, but didn\u2019t you hear, there was another.\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell me who and I\u2019ll see that the judge grants you a quick death,\u201d Orangetail said, as he pulled out his pistol, and pointed it at Bloodtooth, nervous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEasy answer kid,\u201d Bloodtooth said, as she leaned back on the couch, relaxing. \u201cIt was the cousin of the woman who was locked in the trunk, a Private Jenkins, and just for you to know, some friends of mine are letting her out now, even as we speak.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Orangetail started to pull on the trigger of his pistol, when Bloodtooth said, \u201cYou might want this,\u201d and pulled out a clip from her pocket. \u201cAll that you have is that one bullet in the chamber, and while getting shot is a bitch, as is dying, such things are nothing new to me. Also, by the time that you get this clip from me, or go for my own guns, which are not loaded by the way, the others would be in here, and you would find yourself being dragged before the base Commander, who, for your information was that Sergeant, and is human, will execute you himself. As for me, I\u2019ll be revived and, after some physical therapy, back to duty within the month. And, after having been separated for five long pain filled years, Jenkins will be reunited with his cousin. All in all, I say that it all turns out quite good. Now, put the gun down boy. After all, an empty gun is worthless next to a human who is willing to do what it takes to be reunited with his family. Of course, seeing as to how you now know classified information, you have two options, take a sniper\u2019s bullet, from a guy who is half a mile away from here, or, you sign up. Then again, haven\u2019t you always wanted a real challenge?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay,\u201d the man said, as he put the gun down. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll sign up.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood,\u201d Bloodtooth said, as she picked the gun up, and pressed a button, revealing that there was a loaded clip in the pistol. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou tricked me,\u201d Orangetail said, as Bloodtooth put the clip back in the pistol. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes and no,\u201d she said. \u201cWhile there is no one else out there by the car, if I know my comrade, Wolfblood, that vampire you saw with me, is perched on a rooftop some distance away, looking down the sight of a sniper rifle, aiming at your head, even as I speak.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she pointed the pistol at the officer, stood up, and said, \u201cNow, stand up, and get your keys. After all, I, and several others, made a promise to find that girl, as well as, the rest of her family.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy would you want to find a scrawny girl like her?\u201d the officer said, as he stood up. \u201cI just bought her, just before I went to see you. I thought that she\u2019d be perfect for the two of us to share with dinner.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah, as the dinner itself right. I should have told you this but, for your information, I\u2019m a vegetarian,\u201d Bloodtooth said, as the pair walked outside. \u201cFather always told me that one should not kill someone just to eat them. The only time that it would be, understandable, would be if there was absolutely no other choice, and then, I was to give that person a quick death, pray for their soul, as well as my own, and then eat their body, with the utmost respect.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds contradictory, considering that you have killed more than a thousand people in combat, over the last twelve years,\u201d Orangetail said, as he nervously tried to put the keys into the keyhole in his car\u2019s trunk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh there is a difference, believe me,\u201d Bloodtooth said, with a smile. \u201cSomeone like you kills others to satisfy a barbaric desire to eat those weaker than yourself. Someone like me, on the other hand, kills to protect those who can\u2019t protect themselves, from those like you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you saying? Is the whole military like this?\u201d Orangetail asked as he finally found the right key and put it into the keyhole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Bloodtooth smiled, as the trunk opened up, and pulled him away from it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou will find out soon,\u201d she said, as she pulled another gun from a third holster, and shot him with it, and he fell to the ground with a thud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then saw the young woman, Tabitha, looking at the now fallen officer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs he dead?\u201d she asked, after Bloodtooth removed the gag from her mouth, and untied her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d Bloodtooth said, with a soft, and gentle voice. \u201cI used a tranquillizer dart on the bastard. He\u2019ll be out for a few hours, long enough to get him to base and placed under a dream spell.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy did you do that? I heard you say my cousin\u2019s name, as well as my own, before you knocked my out. Did you really know him, and is he dead?\u201d (Tabitha)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo kid,\u201d Bloodtooth said, with a smile. \u201cThe boy is very much alive. And I really did promise him that I\u2019d find you, one way or another. Now, I best give you some clothes. I don\u2019t think that you\u2019d want to see you cousin for the first time in five years, naked.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Bloodtooth got out her shrink bag, pulled out some fatigues, and gave them to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know they are not much,\u201d she said. \u201cBut they are better than nothing. Now, before we go, I best deal with this bastard.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then got out the officer\u2019s handcuffs, and cuffed his hands behind his back. Then, she got some rope from the shrink bag and hog-tied him. After that, she picked him up, took his keys, and tossed him into the trunk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen you are done getting dressed,\u201d she said, closing the lid. \u201cGet into the passenger seat in the front. I need to take you to the base, for your protection.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Tabitha asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is because the moment the tax collectors realize that you are alive, they will come for you, just like they tried to with you cousin. Thankfully, he signed up before they could get him,\u201d Bloodtooth said, as she opened the driver\u2019s side door, groaning in disgust at the \u2018leftovers\u2019 that Orangetail had left in the car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRemind me to give him one hell of a nightmare,\u201d she grumbled. \u201cI hope that Chap doesn\u2019t mind giving them a proper blessing, so that, if their souls are still around, that they will cross over, peacefully.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then looked at Tabitha and said, \u201cSorry about the car. It is his after all.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat will be done to it?\u201d the woman asked, as she finished dressing, and came up to the front, and saw what was in the car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst off, the remains will be removed, blessed, and give a proper burial. As for the car itself, giants step on small things all the time.\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d (Tabitha)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfter it is cleaned out, a giant friend of mine will accidentally step on it. After that, it will be nothing more than scrap metal, and it will be taken to a factory, that is owned and operated by the military, and turned into something else, like parts for tanks, service vehicles, and weapons.\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut, why would the military happen to be interested in someone like me?\u201d Tabitha asked, as she opened the door and the two of them crawled in, Bloodtooth being forced to push the seat back as far as it could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTwo reasons,\u201d she said, turning the car on, and setting it into gear. \u201cFirst off, according to regulations, anyone who is related to a current, or an honorable discharged soldier, in any branch, falls under military jurisdiction. Anyone who harms them, in any manner, will face a military trial, and if found guilty, executed by that soldier, or his squad mates, should the soldier be unable to do so him/herself. Since your cousin has now joined the military, it became our job to track down any family he had, and made sure that they were protected, which means, since you are his only living family member, unless you have a husband and/or a kid somewhere, you are now under our protection.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, what is the second reason?\u201d (Tabitha)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Bloodtooth looked behind her, backing the car out of the driveway, and said, \u201cThat\u2019s classified information. However, I can safely say this; your great-grandfather started something that changed the way that the military operates. If I was to say anything else, either you\u2019d have to join up, get your memory wiped, or I\u2019d have to kill you, and, for the sake of your cousin, I wouldn\u2019t want to have to kill you. That would leave you with getting the information wiped from your mind, or signing up, and something tells me that, while you would be perfect for the military, as you have a fighter\u2019s spirit, you don\u2019t want to have a thing to do with the military.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou would be correct on that,\u201d Tabitha said, with a sigh, as Bloodtooth started to drive towards the base. \u201cAlthough, I would like to know if my cousin will be safe, while he is in the military. After all, he could get killed.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue,\u201d Bloodtooth said. \u201cHowever, our military won\u2019t kill one of our soldiers, unless he/she/it breaks the Code, well, at least not on purpose. Of course, if it was an accident, or a result of enemy efforts, we make sure that our doctors know a top secret spell, one that has a good chance of bringing one back to full life, over ninety-nine percent. Although with humans, there is about a thirty percent chance that they could end up as either a vampire or a zombie, both of which have an equal chance at happening. Of course, if that happened, we have special places to help those men and women out, so that they can control their new urges, as well as, train them to use their new abilities.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave you ever needed to, you know, be brought back?\u201d (Tabitha)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah,\u201d Bloodtooth said, looking at her out of the corner of her eye. \u201cAnd to be honest, I don\u2019t know which is worse, dying or being brought back to life. However, five years ago, I swore an oath, one that I aim to keep, even if I have to be brought back to life a thousand times, until I see it through.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWas someone important to you killed then?\u201d (Tabitha)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah, it was some family members of a guy that I owe my life to. If he hadn\u2019t done what he did, I would not be alive today. When they were murdered by a good-for-nothing-not-even-for-food traitor, I swore that I would do everything that I could to catch and kill the bastard.\u201d (Bloodtooth)</span></div></div>",

The bastard\u2019s a messy eater, and his car would attract the Scavengers (Sanitation/Body-Clean/Pick-up department) if he left the windows down on a hot day in an empty parking lot.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caused some more tapping to be heard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s alright Wolfblood,\u201d Bloodtooth said. \u201cChangehide could use some responsibility. Now hold on, the road is tricky up ahead, as it is an area that large children like to play near.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean by that, and who is on the roof anyways?\u201d Tabitha asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s just Wolfblood,\u201d Bloodtooth said. \u201cHe\u2019s a good friend of mine, and a damn good shot with a sniper rifle. Of course, seeing as to how it would be hard for anyone, even someone like me, to hear him over this piece of shit that that piece of shit likes to use, he had to use Morse code, very useful trick to learn. As for why the road is tricky, we are about to travel through the giant section of town, and their children like to play in the road, especially to either pick up, or step on, cars made for those our size. Thankfully, I know someone who lives here.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho is it?\u201d (Tabitha)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is a widow of an officer that I served under, one who was in the military herself. Of course, after her husband was killed in action, when I had to fight my first real battle, she fell into a state of depression, and was given a medical discharge, which means that she is still under the military\u2019s protection.\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWill we be safe with her though?\u201d (Tabitha)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, although I best give her a call, so that she knows that we are coming. After all, she may be a vegetarian, as long as you don\u2019t do something to anger her, but she could still step on us if she doesn\u2019t know that we are coming.\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh Cindy, it is good to see you again,\u201d a grandmotherly looking woman, who was five hundred feet tall, said, as she opened the door to her, and her late husband\u2019s, home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe pleasure is mine Sally,\u201d Bloodtooth said, as the woman picked up the car that she and the rest were in, or in Wolfblood\u2019s case, on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d the woman said. \u201cI best get you in. The kids of civilians have no respect for others.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah, I had to avoid a few,\u201d Bloodtooth said, as the woman carried them in and set them on a coffee table. \u201cBy the way, do you have something that I, and this woman, can take a bath in? The owner of this car, who is in the trunk by the way, never took the time to clean it, if you know what I mean.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah, I know what you mean. \u2018Serve and Protect\u2019 indeed. The only things those monsters who call themselves police officers serve are their stomachs, with those that they are supposed to protect. You just wait here, I\u2019ll go fill a small bowl with some warm water, and get you a scrap of soap, so you can wash off,\u201d the woman said, as she left the living room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow well do you know this woman,\u201d Tabitha asked, nervously. \u201cI don\u2019t really like giants.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBad experience with one before you dropped out, or after, right?\u201d Bloodtooth asked, as she got out of the car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah,\u201d Tabitha said, as she also got out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGod, the guys on laundry duty are going to kill me, if the commander doesn\u2019t do it himself,\u201d Bloodtooth mumbled, as she looked as the back of the clothes she had given Tabitha, which were covered in blood, knowing that her clothes were just as bad, if not worse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn, uh, Cindy,\u201d Wolfblood said, as he got off of the roof, not used to calling Bloodtooth by her first name. \u201cYou were right when you said that I wouldn\u2019t want to sit in the car. I mean, by God, while I may have to drink the blood of the living, but this, this is just wrong. Are you really sure on having him join up or some such thing?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s that or killing him. I told him some classified information, in regards to the commander\u2019s race.\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy did you tell him that?\u201d (Wolfblood)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe bastard had me watch a movie with him, a war movie. It was the one based off of the commander\u2019s time when he was a sergeant, about twenty years ago.\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, it was that movie. I really wish that the film industry really looked over the reports that we give them when they want to make a movie that is based on actual military events. I mean, even if the races and faces of people have to be concealed to protect them, the media industry should try to stay within the facts, and not elaborate, and fictionalize, them. I tell you, the commander was pissed when they aired that movie in the public theaters before the higher ups had a chance to look at it.\u201d (Wolfblood)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know,\u201d Bloodtooth said. \u201cI was at the theater myself. The guy just destroyed the place, with his own bare hands and feet, and he calls me the loose cannon on the base.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, at least the military respected his wishes to not show it to the rest of the base,\u201d Wolfblood said, as he looked at Tabitha, with a slight look of hunger in his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t even think about any of it,\u201d Bloodtooth said, smacking him upside the head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Wolfblood asked, with a grin, as he rubbed his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor the first part, you are married. As for the second, I don\u2019t think Jenkins would like it if you gave his cousin a kiss, as it were, especially one on her neck,\u201d Bloodtooth said, as she waited for Sally to come back to the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout thirty minutes later, after Bloodtooth and Tabitha had gotten themselves cleaned up, and dressed in some clean clothing, Bloodtooth in a decent pair of military fatigues, and Tabitha wearing a borrowed set of clothes from one of Sally\u2019s servant\u2019s, most of which had husbands serving in the military themselves, Bloodtooth asked Sally if she and her could talk in private. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Cindy, or is it Lieutenant Bloodtooth, something tells me that this is not a social visit,\u201d Sally said, when the pair were in her kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou remember the murders committed about five years back, in which the victims tended to be related to The Uniter?\u201d Bloodtooth asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah, I remember. The authorities called it an overenthusiastic hunt, and closed the case in two seconds,\u201d Sally said, with a huff. \u201cSuch things make me wish that the military would take over the country. Admittedly, there would be those who might let the power go to their heads, but, overall, most would make sure that everyone was treated fairly. In fact, the predation of others for non-survival reasons would be called what it really is, murder.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah, well anyways, there were two survivors, William Jenkins and Tabitha Jensen,\u201d Bloodtooth said, as she held up two fingers, with a smile. \u201cAnd, we finally found them, all within the last week. Jenkins enlisted when some tax collectors chased him into a recruitment office, and we found Jensen just a few hours ago.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what is it that my Howard\u2019s favorite soldier asks of me?\u201d Sally asked, with a look of knowing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell obviously, Jensen has no place to call home, and while she is technically military property, there are those who don\u2019t respect that title of ownership, if you know what I mean. Also, she will need a place to stay, as she has no interest in joining up, though I get the feeling that she\u2019d make a great officer,\u201d Bloodtooth said, as she drank a cup of coffee that one of the soldier wives had given her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, what about this Jenkins guy?\u201d Sally asked. \u201cIs he anything like the original?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery,\u201d Bloodtooth said, with a chuckle. \u201cIn his entrance test, he gave his \u2018life\u2019 for a recruit that was quite a ways behind him while they were doing pushups. Then, during the intelligence part, he quickly realized that he couldn\u2019t do it alone, and asked if I was allowed to help him. Well, of course I did, and his test was the one where the recruit has to touch the brick, while the floor is buried under mud and the brick is a distance above the mud. Well, even while standing on my shoulders, he still couldn\u2019t reach. So, he had two options, stand on my head and jump, which could have killed both of us, or, ask me to tilt my head back, open my mouth, and stand on the edges of my jaws, which would of risked only his life. Well, he chose the second option, putting my life above his, despite the fact that we\u2019d only just met then. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if, if he was an officer, and was in a situation, one that required him to take the life of one of his soldiers or watched them all starve to death, he\u2019d take his pistol, place it under his chin, and pull the trigger, sparing the life of one soldier, and making sure that the rest had something to eat.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you really think that he would really do something like that?\u201d Sally asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProbably not,\u201d Bloodtooth said, taking another sip of her coffee. \u201cBut, like I said, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he did. Also, when it comes to making plans, and leading others, he is a natural strategist and commander all rolled into one. Of course, that\u2019s only if he makes it through the training.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ll tell you this, I\u2019d be a fool to not help one of the Uniter\u2019s bloodline,\u201d Sally said. \u201cIf she agrees to it, I can let her stay under my roof until the military helps her on her feet.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d Bloodtooth said, as she finished her coffee, and set the cup down. \u201cHowever, we do need a ride back to the base, so we can get Tabitha and William reconnected with each other, drop the owner of that car off to the second in command, get the car cleaned out, give the remains a decent burial, appease the owners\u2019 spirits, and of course, scrap and melt the car down into something useful.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is not a problem, Lieutenant Bloodtooth,\u201d Sally said, with a smile. \u201cI just need to get a carrying case for you and the other three; I trust that you knocked the bastard out before you stole his car, right?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course I did,\u201d Bloodtooth said, as she pulled the tranquillizer from her shoulder holster, and held it out for her. \u201cWhile I love my fifty caliber Desert Eagle, as well as my forty-five caliber Colt revolver, this thing will do the trick if I want to bring someone, especially if they have no scales on their skin, in alive, without the need for a medic to revive them. Besides, carrying a corpse around is not easy, even with a shrink bag, as you have to keep it preserved and relatively intact. With this though, the prisoner is kept alive, and will be asleep until the dose wears off, or is given the reversal.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, the woman just chuckled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess that you don\u2019t always bloody your teeth, as it were,\u201d she said. \u201cWell, we best get ready. I have a feeling that the commander will throw a fit about you bailing out on his orientation.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, better that than not saving the life of a comrade\u2019s relative,\u201d Bloodtooth said, chuckling.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>During the ride back to the base, Tabitha found herself strapped down on the bottom of the inside of a case, next to Bloodtooth, with Wolfblood on the other side of her, who had the bound sleeping body of Orangetail on the other side of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm Cindy, I noticed that um, Wolfblood seemed to hesitate when he was trying to say your name after we got out of that car,\u201d she said. \u201cDo people tend to call you something else?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, my full name is Cynthia Mellissa Bloodtooth,\u201d Bloodtooth said. \u201cHowever, most people tend to have a nickname that just seems to stick to them. Mine happens to be Bloody Teeth.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Tabitha gulped, and asked, \u201cWhy do they call you that?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Bloodtooth looked at her and gave her a friendly smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause,\u201d she said. \u201cI tend to bloody my teeth, and claws, while protecting the lives of humans, like you kid.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you really do that?\u201d (Tabitha)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(The following is Bloodtooth speaking)<br>\r\n\u201cYah, in my first battle, about eleven years ago, I took on a whole enemy force of several hundred men, while protecting a human village, which was run according to its tribe\u2019s culture, and while friendly, wasn\u2019t really into technology. Well, when the battle was over, I was covered in blood, so I went to take a shower under a waterfall. The village\u2019s witch doctor, or shaman, saw me bathing under it, and started chanting something, looking at me with a smile on occasion, and saying the translation of my name in his language, which was Bloody Teeth. The guy had blessed me, saying that I was a warrior of Righteousness and Virtue, and asked his gods if they would protect my spirit. When it came time for me and the others to leave, he gave me a gift, a blue and green colored stone, with a hole drilled through it with a cord tied to it. The one person who could speak our language the best said that the stone was created by the gods of the river and forest, and that only those who were favored by the gods could receive it. The man then asked me to kneel down, most likely because I was taller than him, and placed the cord around my neck, as if it was a priceless treasure in and of itself. After that, in everyplace that I\u2019ve been stationed, someone always called me Bloody Teeth when they told my name to the natives, and when I did something, like save the village or its people, someone always gave me something that held great value to their people\u2019s culture. Of course, while I accepted those gifts, when the children tried to give me their favorite toys, I couldn\u2019t really accept those. However, I did something that cheered them up. I would shift into my human form, which your cousin finds very attractive by the way, take out my knife, cut a small lock of hair, braid it, and give it to them, telling them that it would be as if I was with them if there was ever any trouble. Needless to say, even the leaders of these peoples were impressed by this simple gift of mine, and thanked me for it themselves. Needless to say, I have quite a collection of gifts from those peoples.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Tabitha asked, \u201cIs there something going on between you and my cousin?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I am his guiding officer,\u201d Bloodtooth said. \u201cAlso, he did help me out with a sting operation the other day, catching someone who bought military property without a proper license.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, what sort of property?\u201d Tabitha asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe breathing kind,\u201d Bloodtooth said, as she looked back up at the roof of the case. \u201cUnlike the rest of society kid, the military realizes the importance of every life, especially those of the very young. So, sometimes, we send two undercover operatives to certain restaurants, one pretending to sell the other to the owner of the place. Once the sale has been confirmed, we swoop in, capture those who work or go there, claiming that the place had bought stolen government property, and rescue those held there, and help them out. Should they be of recruitment age, we give them the chance to serve, and if they decline, we will help them get on their feet. If they are under the age, the officers on the base take care of them and in some cases, adopt them, or let their families take care of them. As for the really young, like newborns and toddlers, and the like, should a young female officer wish to care for the child, the medic on the base will put a spell on their breasts, causing them to produce milk, so that they can breastfeed the child, until it doesn\u2019t need milk, at which time the spell is ended. At that time, the officer might decide to adopt the child.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy would the military do something like that?\u201d Tabitha asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Bloodtooth sighed, and said, \u201cBecause, when a human soldier, who could have ran, took his officer\u2019s spot and gave his life for the man, who had been planning on eating him a few minutes earlier, it showed the officer, a werewolf, that all life is valuable. Then, in honor of the man\u2019s sacrifice, the officer, and those who had served with the man, set out to make sure that every soldier was treated fairly and given equality, from the tallest of giants, on down to those who are lowest on the food chain, humans. After that, the military made it a mission to see the fallen soldier\u2019s dreams a reality. That soldier, who gave his life for the officer, was William Henry Jenkins the First, your great-grandfather. The officer, whose life he had saved, was mine. Also, I owe my own life to him, because, when great-grandfather returned home after that day, he got his wife pregnant with my grandmother, who had my father, who then had me. Also, after your family\u2019s murder, I, along with bunch of other officers, swore an oath, to catch and kill the traitor who had done the deed, as well as find any survivors of The Uniter\u2019s bloodline.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou do realize that you are telling her classified information,\u201d Wolfblood said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know Wolfblood, I know,\u201d Bloodtooth said, with a sigh. \u201cThe Doc can wipe it from her memory later, after she and her cousin meet up again, and get reunited. However, she does deserve to know the truth, if only for a few minutes.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, how does this memory wipe work?\u201d Tabitha asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t know,\u201d Bloodtooth said. \u201cWe tend to use it on those who have broken the Code, and are to be dishonorably discharged. We do it so that they can\u2019t remember how the military works, our tactics, the other officers and soldiers, and especially about how everyone is treated the same and that even a giant has to follow the orders of a human officer, and other such things. All that he will know is that he broke the rules, and that it was decided by the higher ups that he was to be discharged, and stripped of any protections that the military once gave him.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what about someone like me? How will they do it to me?\u201d Tabitha asked nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt will probably be something along the lines that I saved you because of the fact that your cousin is in the military,\u201d Bloodtooth said, as she looked at the woman. \u201cYou won\u2019t remember this conversation, my face, my name, my rank, or anything about your great-grandfather. All that you will remember is that a werewolf, who is an officer in the military, saved you from being eaten by that kitsune over there. However, you will remember seeing your cousin, and anything that he might have said, providing that it wasn\u2019t classified information. However, I will see about dropping by from time to time, in one form or another. However, you will only know me as Cindy, a friend of your cousin, one who also serves in the military. After that, the military will find a place for you to stay, preferable with those who are under our protection, like Sally. After a mark has been placed on you, saying that you are military property, you will be free to do as you wish. After that, no civilian agency will touch you, like police or tax collectors, for fear of having your owners, the military, hauling them off and having them executed. Also, we will see about helping you with any schooling that you missed, and see about finding you a job with someone who works with us.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike what sort of jobs are we talking about?\u201d (Tabitha)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever job you want, we will set you on the path to reach it. Storekeeper, model, actress, teacher, doctor, whatever, the military has connections to those that can help you reach it. Admittedly, it might take you a few years to get the position, but, what sort of job doesn\u2019t take time to get anyways?\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, what about William, will he be allowed to see me?\u201d (Tabitha)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, he won\u2019t be able to visit you himself for the next six months, and you won\u2019t be allowed to see him. However, the recruits are allowed to write one letter a week, which is examined by the officers first, and send it to their families, and they are allowed to receive letters, everyday, and they won\u2019t be examined,\u201d Bloodtooth said, as she gave the woman a friendly kiss. \u201cBy the way, I owe your family my life.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy is that?\u201d Tabitha asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe officer that your great-grandfather gave his life for was mine, and after that day, he got my great-grandmother pregnant with my grandmother. Needless to say, I\u2019m in that man\u2019s debt and I\u2019ll do everything that I can to keep you and your cousin safe from harm. Also, I\u2019ll see to it that the man who murdered the rest of your family, who is a traitor by the way, is brought to justice, and pays for what he did,\u201d Bloodtooth said, as she pressed a pressure point on the woman, knocking her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was wondering when you were going to knock her out,\u201d Wolfblood said, as he saw the woman fall limp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know,\u201d Bloodtooth said, as she removed her hand from the back of the woman\u2019s neck. \u201cIt\u2019s just that, she is, in a sense, a member of my family, and you know how I don\u2019t like it when my family is in danger. The whole pack thing, and the Jenkins bloodline aside, I do care for her cousin, and I did make him that promise, that I\u2019d find her, dead, alive, or otherwise.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright,\u201d Wolfblood said, as he felt his stomach start to beg for blood. \u201cUm, would you mind it if I feed on the kitsune?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind it if you drained him dry of blood,\u201d Bloodtooth said, as she kissed the woman\u2019s forehead gently, and friendly. \u201cHe was trying to get me out of my uniform throughout the movie, and get himself in me, if you know what I mean.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd this coming from the same woman that likes to have sex with every other equally ranked male officer on the base,\u201d Wolfblood said, with a chuckle, as he turned his head, and sank his teeth into the sleeping kitsune\u2019s neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah,\u201d Bloodtooth said. \u201cBut that is because I want it, and not just the other guy. Him, hell, even if I wanted to have sex, I\u2019d sooner be covered in blood and have sex with you when you are going through withdrawal, and risk being drained, than even have him so much as kiss me. No offence meant comrade.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright,\u201d Wolfblood said, taking a pause from his snack, as it were. \u201cI know that my wife doesn\u2019t get much satisfaction from me anymore anyways, and I even told her that, if she wanted to, she can seek out another for when she wants to have sex. After all, I\u2019m as cold as a corpse.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah, but you have a warm heart, one that still beats, deep inside.\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah, I just wish that it was my blood that flowed through it, instead of that of other people.\u201d (Wolfblood)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, it\u2019s not your fault. Your squad was ambushed, and you were in pieces by the time that reinforcements arrived. As for the medic, he was new and made the mistake of trying to revive you without sufficient energy to get everything completely healed. After all, it takes more energy to repair a guy whose throat was torn out as opposed to being just slashed or stabbed.\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know that, it\u2019s just that, I envy Jenkins, and every other living human. They have their own blood, they can feel the warmth of the sun, the coolness of a breeze, and, a lover doesn\u2019t recoil from them when they are in the same bed together.\u201d (Wolfblood)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know about the rest, but I might be able to help you out on that last one.\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, but you know how the military frowns on that sort of relationship between those of different ranks.\u201d (Wolfblood)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah, but if they don\u2019t ask, we don\u2019t tell, remember?\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that after the rule that says that no soldier is to rape another?\u201d (Wolfblood)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t know. Dragon-Man (the officer who had bought Bloodtooth from prison) never really talked about the rules that dealt with sex, in either of his forms. After all, Dragon was too busy having sex with me at night and Man was too ashamed about Dragon\u2019s behavior to talk to me about it during the day. However, I do hope that they are alright overseas. I mean, I may not really care for Dragon, but he is connected to Man, and if one dies, so will the other, and I care about Man, because he saved me from being executed.\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Wolfblood just chuckled, and went back to his snack.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cSo, what kind of dream do you want him to have,\u201d Doc asked, when Sally arrived at the base, as some of the medics-in-training carried Orangetail and Tabitha over to the medical building. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomething that makes \u2018The New Recruit Dream\u2019 seem like a pleasant vacation in comparison,\u201d Bloodtooth said, when she had asked Doc to give Orangetail a really bad dream. \u201cI want to make him suffer for all the murder that he has done, all in the guise of serving the law. If anything, I want his victims to do unto him as he did to them. No, wait, scratch that. Have him paralyzed and tied to a pole and have each one of his victims beat him to death, individually, and then he is to be brought back, and face the next. Finally, turn him into a human, and have him face Jensen and Jenkins, while they are each in the form of a kitsune, and make him a woman to, most of his victims were women, from what I can tell from the remains in his car.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what about the woman, it is Jensen right?\u201d (Doc)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you will need to erase me and Wolfblood from her memory, as I told some classified, as well as, personal, information. However, I want you to give her a strong impression that a werewolf, who says that he\u2019s a good friend of her cousin, and is also in the military, saved her life. Also, if Jenkins is asleep, give them a shared dream, as it were, so that they can see each other, and know that the other is alive. If he is awake, after you erase her memory, bring him to her, and, after you tell him what he is allowed to tell her, give the two of them some alone time. After all, it has been five years since they last saw the other. After that, mark her as military property. After that, find a commanding officer that she won\u2019t be afraid of, and tell them why she is here. Also, put a light persuasion spell on her, nothing dramatic, just a nudge, that makes her want to take up on Sally\u2019s offer, when she offers to take care of her until she gets back up on her feet, as it were. Also, when Orangetail\u2019s punishment is over, and he is good and broken and scared, send him to me. I want to show him what it means to serve ones country.\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d (Doc)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI gave him two choices, take a bullet to the head, or join the military. The bastard had me watch that war movie that the commander hates.\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I can tell you this, we all hated it.\u201d (Doc)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah, well, he has a deeper reason to hate it, after all, the man that he had to execute was his younger half-brother.\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah, I know. That\u2019s why he got posted here, so he could be away from that theater of that war.\u201d (Doc)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah well, I\u2019ll be at my quarters, for when the commander wants to debrief me.\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, after Tabitha had left after seeing her cousin, and had her memory altered, Bloodtooth was in her quarters, waiting for someone. At six hundred hours, there is a knock on her door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLieutenant Bloodtooth, I\u2019m here with the prisoner,\u201d said Changehide\u2019s voice, \u201cPermission to enter, madam.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPermission granted Lieutenant,\u201d Bloodtooth said, as she sat down at her desk, and picked up a pen to write her report. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard the door open, and the jingling of a set of shackles, as well as a thud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice to hear you drop in, Officer Orangetail,\u201d she said, with a heavy amount of sarcasm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, don\u2019t kill me,\u201d said a scared, nervous, and shaky voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Bloodtooth looked at the man, who was huddled on the floor, scared beyond scared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh you had it easy,\u201d she said, looking back down at her report. \u201cWhile you are alive, those people are very, very, dead, dead at your hands, and it was your job to protect them from harm. Do you know what we do to those who don\u2019t protect their comrades, especially if they can\u2019t protect themselves?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-n-n-no, I d-d-do not know at al, w-w-what d-d-do y-y-you d-d-do?\u201d (Orangetail)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe shoot them in the head and leave their bodies to rot. In fact, we don\u2019t even give them a funeral, of any sort. Hell, we don\u2019t even eat them. The body is not to be touched, and is to decompose, like some animal\u2019s body in the woods. Of course, that is nothing compared to what we do to traitors, in real life.\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat d-d-do y-y-you m-m-mean?\u201d (Orangetail)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, while we do eat them, we tear them to pieces first.\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Bloodtooth stood up, and walked around her desk, to get a look at the pathetic man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe also do it very slowly and painfully,\u201d she said, as she stood the man up, and hung him from a hanger by his handcuffs, and got out her knife. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then used her knife to tear off his clothing, and started to trace a line with her claw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst we start by skinning them alive, being real careful to not damage the hide, after all, good leather is not cheep. After that, we cut off at the joints, starting with the fingers and toes. When we get to the hips and shoulders, if they are still alive, we cut them open, and remove their organs. After that, we cut their heads off and cook the pieces up. Of course, that\u2019s during peacetime, but during wartime, which is what we are going through now with the Middle East, with the insurgents there, why, we don\u2019t even use blades, we use our teeth and claws to deal with traitors then.\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, she gave an evil grin, with her teeth exposed, her jaws somewhat separated, and ran her tongue over her teeth, licking her lips as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy are you doing this to me?\u201d Orangetail asked, nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEasy,\u201d Bloodtooth said, as she walked over to the window and pulled up the shade, the sunshine coming in, revealing the statue of Jenkins\u2019s great-grandfather. \u201cLook out the window, and look at that statue.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah, what does a statue of a dead giant have to do with me?\u201d Orangetail said, feeling bolder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat man was given the nickname, The Uniter, for a good reason, for he made our military the strongest military fighting force out there,\u201d Bloodtooth said, as she went to the door, opened it, and shouted, \u201cChangehide, get Uniter and send him to my quarters. Tell him it has to deal with the bastard that tried to murder his cousin.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Madam!\u201d Changehide said, as the sound of a set of somewhat heavy steps march off, on the double. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, this Uniter guy, is he a giant?\u201d Orangetail asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe he is,\u201d Bloodtooth said. \u201cMaybe he isn\u2019t. Either way, when it comes to what he is capable of, the sky\u2019s the limit. When he was fifteen, he took on a deserter, who had killed his family, and survived. That, Traitor, was as good of a fighter as I am, and I am the best, in this barracks at least. When we are done training him, that boy could surpass me by a large degree. In fact, I may end up saluting him in the long run. Also, he is that man\u2019s great-grandson, and that woman is his cousin, from the same great-grandfather, who had only one child, a son, who was human. That man had five children with other humans, and we are tracking down those that he had with non-humans, in hopes that some of them, and their own children, are still alive, as that traitor wiped out all, but two, of The Uniter\u2019s human offspring.\u201d <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>But then, she smelled something familiar, a scent similar to both Jenkins and Jensen, coming from him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d she wondered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then walked up to him, and started to smell the kitsune. The scent was definitely coming from him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, this is a surprise,\u201d she said with a strange smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Orangetail asked, nervous about what she had found out about him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s just say that you are of the same line as the woman that you tried to eat last night, the same grandfather, and great-grandfather as well,\u201d Bloodtooth said, as she looked out the window at the statue, to compare the two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, there it is,\u201d she said, with a chuckle. \u201cYou have the same eyes as him, the eyes of a human.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m not human,\u201d Orangetail said, shaking his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI never said that you were,\u201d Bloodtooth said, as she went back to her desk, to continue writing her report, and chuckled at her discovery. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis will be an interesting reunion,\u201d she thought, as she heard the door knock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome in, Uniter,\u201d she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the door opened, Jenkins came in, causing the kitsune to gasp, and he did a double take, as the human looked like the statue come to life. Jenkins looked at him, his eyes filled with anger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou bastard,\u201d he said, walking up to him, his hands clenched, and punched him in the stomach. \u201cI spent five years looking for any surviving members of my family. To hear that someone like you tried to eat one makes me want to tear you to pieces.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he punched him in the nose, breaking it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t damage him too much,\u201d Bloodtooth said, as she looked up from her report. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Jenkins asked, getting ready to punch the man again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne, the bastard signed up,\u201d she said, holding up a finger. \u201cAnd two, I have a feeling that your grandfather had a fling with his grandmother, and got her pregnant with either his mother or father. Of course, we\u2019ll have to have Doc do a DNA test, and compare his DNA with that of you and Tabitha.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she held up a second finger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow would you know if he and I could even possibly be related?\u201d Jenkins asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBloodtooth just tapped her nose and said, with a smile, \u201cThis nose knows. After all, I use it to smell for dangerous chemicals and explosives. Using it to hunt down someone, or their family, comes natural to me. Seeing as to how you and I have spent plenty of time with each other, I know your scent, and one\u2019s relations can give off a common scent, especially when they are related through blood. Of course, I know of an even faster way to find out if you two share the same blood.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow would one do that?\u201d Jenkins asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBlood taste,\u201d Bloodtooth said. \u201cA vampire drinks some of the two peoples\u2019 blood and compares them to each other through how they taste. Also, Wolfblood can identify the common ancestry of two people up to seven generations back. However, while he knows Orangetail\u2019s blood\u2019s taste, he doesn\u2019t know yours.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo get a needle and a syringe from Doc and-\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t work like that kid,\u201d Bloodtooth said, as she stood up. \u201cHe has to taste it while it is warm, and flowing from the person\u2019s veins and you can not be given any injections either while he does it. In fact, He will have to drink some more of this scum\u2019s blood.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean by more?\u201d Orangetail asked, nervously, as Bloodtooth walked up to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery easy,\u201d she said, as she took out an electric razor, and started to shave a part of his neck, and expose the skin underneath, exposing two recently scabbed over small puncture marks. \u201cYou caused him to miss his supper last night, and since I told him that Tabitha was off-limits, that left him with either me or you, and he has had enough of my blood to last him, as I made him drain me dry once. However, something like the tranquilizer dart that I shot you with, can alter the taste to a degree, and make it hard for him to determine ones relationship to another, or even if the blood came from the same person. So, I guess that he will have another taste of your blood, to see if you are indeed Jenkins\u2019s cousin, just as I know that that human that you tried to eat last night is. Of course, the problem will be trying to explain to your great-grandfather why you tried to eat your own flesh and blood.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d the kitsune asked. \u201cDidn\u2019t you just say that he is dead?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, the man is dead,\u201d Bloodtooth said, as she walked back to her desk to continue writing her report. \u201cHowever, until his mission is complete, his spirit will not pass over. Also, every demon in the military is under explicit orders to not exorcise the spirits of those who still serve in the military after their actual deaths, unless they break the Code that we swear to uphold, with our lives. So, until then, his spirit will remain in this world.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was it that he did?\u201d Orangetail asked, as he started to wonder about his alleged, and human, great-grandfather. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot much really,\u201d Bloodtooth said. \u201cOnly broke a guy\u2019s nose, had the man chase him, and sacrificed his life when the other man stepped on a landmine. However, that was how he died. His dream though, that will never die.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what was his dream?\u201d (Orangetail)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor there to be a world where everyone walking down the street will not have to worry that someone will eat them, or their children, at the very least,\u201d Bloodtooth said, as she looked at the kitsune. \u201cAnd that is a dream that we all hope to see come true.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she picked up the phone and said, \u201cSergeant Wolfblood, Please report to Lieutenant Bloodtooth\u2019s quarters. Oh, and Doctor Charles, It would be appreciated if you could show up as well.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she hung up, she said, \u201cUseful speaker system the base has. After all, it goes everywhere.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a voice is heard from a speaker in the corner. \u201cHey fur ball! I was asleep! Goddamn it! I am almost seventy two years old! You don\u2019t need me to help you with your hairballs!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t ask,\u201d Bloodtooth said, as Jenkins started to look over at her. \u201cThough you cousin there might know a thing or two about them.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she spoke up and said, \u201cI need you here to document, and cross-check, a blood taste test. The kitsune that I brought in might be related to another recruit on the base.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhich one is the suspected relative?\u201d (Doc's voice)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow that would surprise you sir, but, if I know Jennifer, and your son, they might be in the same room as you, and, unless the two of them are also doctors, there is that Doctor-Patient Confidentiality thing that you doctors seem to care about.\u201d (Bloodtooth)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOn my way, but don\u2019t wake me up this early again!\u201d (Doc)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, there is a click. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMedics,\u201d Bloodtooth said, shaking her head. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be too surprised if he ends up using me as a test subject for a new healing spell someday. As it is, he likes healing women when they are naked. But, then again, I\u2019m not going to argue with him. After all, mess with a medic, and you could wake up with your head on backwards.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, two people enter the room, Wolfblood and Doc, who looked at Bloodtooth, with a look that said, \u201cI\u2019ll get you for waking me up fur ball.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMorning sirs,\u201d Bloodtooth said, as she waited for them to sit down, with Wolfblood offering the better seat to the medic. \u201cI have need of your services gentlemen. Wolfblood, it seems that you and I found a third relation to him.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Wolfblood and Doc took a look at Jenkins, who just had something of an angry look, and Orangetail, who was scared beyond belief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Wolfblood asked, as he stood up, and compared the two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d Bloodtooth said. \u201cThey have a slightly similar scent. Now, admittedly, it could be because Orangetail was close to Jensen at one point, and her scent may have transferred somewhat, but, I have the feeling that Doc washed him before he put him in one of his clean rooms.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is correct, it is standard procedure,\u201d Doc said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, you want me to do a blood taste test, right?\u201d Wolfblood asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is correct,\u201d Bloodtooth said, as she sat down. \u201cAfter all, if someone is related to a soldier, they have to be considered military property; otherwise a soldier might not perform as well as they should. Besides, the man did decide to join up anyways, which means that, as the doctor, you could order him to take it anyways.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, technically, that is true. Then again, I do need to collect a sample of blood from each recruit, just incase we need a blood transfusion, and knowing ones blood makes healing them easier, in case something happens,\u201d Doc said, as he looked at both Jenkins and Orangetail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jenkins heard Doc\u2019s words, he did some quick thinking. While he didn\u2019t want to know if he was related to the bastard that tried to eat his last known cousin, but, if something happened to him, having the doc know the sort of blood that he would need would be useful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright,\u201d he said, as he sat in a chair. \u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry too much Uniter,\u201d Wolfblood said. \u201cMy saliva has a natural anesthesia, which makes it useful for vampires to sneak up on an unsuspecting victim, and give them a kiss, as it were, on the neck, and they won\u2019t know what happened, unless they place their hand on the wound and see it covered with blood. However, like I told you the other day, I don\u2019t normally drink from someone\u2019s neck. So, you can hold out your wrist and I\u2019ll get started.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll right,\u201d Jenkins said, as he held out his wrist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolfblood then firmly, but gently, grasped it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, the blood taste test doesn\u2019t require a whole lot of blood,\u201d he said. \u201cIn fact, you\u2019d lose more in a nosebleed, which, while annoying for anyone, doesn\u2019t normally cause one to lose more than an eighth of a cup at worst, well, at least in the case of humans.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he bit down, just barely touching the vein and artery in Jenkins\u2019s wrist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds, Wolfblood lifted his mouth from Jenkins\u2019s wrist and said, \u201cWell, I\u2019ll say this about your blood Uniter, it\u2019s defiantly unique. In the three years that I\u2019ve been a vampire, I\u2019ve never tasted blood like yours.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then looked at Doc and said, \u201cHey, when the blood that you get from him when he donates spoils, I want the first cup. His blood is even better than dragon blood.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe means that as a compliment,\u201d Bloodtooth whispered, when Jenkins walked over to her, and sat down. \u201cHe tends to be somewhat, picky, when it comes to the blood that he drinks, and sometimes prefers the blood from certain individuals.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caused Jenkins to give a weak nervous laugh. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard a compliment quite like that,\u201d he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah well, don\u2019t worry,\u201d Bloodtooth said, giving him a friendly pat on the back. \u201cUnless they want to be locked up in the stockades and fed their least favorite type of blood, no vampire will just drink the blood of a fellow soldier. If they ask, that\u2019s one thing, but to just drink your blood, well, that can be considered assaulting a fellow soldier.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you did say that he does drink the blood of recruits that won\u2019t get up. What\u2019s different about that?\u201d Jenkins asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, the difference is because they are not soldiers yet,\u201d Wolfblood said, as he walked over to the kitsune. \u201cIn fact, off base, I can drink the blood of several dozen prostitutes, and not worry about a thing. Of course, if I drink a little too much, I can always place a healing barrier on them. Useful little things, as they stabilize an injured person and help them start to heal, and protect them from harm as well.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he bit the kitsune\u2019s neck and started drinking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, Jenkins felt a small prick on the arm that Wolfblood hadn\u2019t drank from, and saw a needle in the vein where his upper and lower arms met. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow hold still,\u201d said the Doc\u2019s voice. \u201cI just need a few units of your blood.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow much are we talking about?\u201d Jenkins asked, as he looked away, and wondered how much blood that the military needed from him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, the more blood that I can collect from you now, the more you\u2019ll have when you need it,\u201d the doc said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah, but still, how much are we talking about?\u201d (Jenkins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor someone of your size and weight, three cups for now.\u201d (Doc)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Jenkins asked nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, however, seeing as to how I have to collect blood from every recruit today at some point anyways, the drills won\u2019t be much more than just running and strength training today. After all, soldiers have to be fit to fight. It would be similar to weight room and track, only without the risk of the gym teacher eating you for not completing a rep, or for being the slowest runner. There, that will do.\u201d (Doc)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Jenkins looked back over and saw Doc holding a pouch of blood, his blood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately, he felt faint. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you alright?\u201d Bloodtooth asked, as she carefully turned his head to face her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYah,\u201d he said, nervously. \u201cI\u2019ve just never had that much of my own blood taken out of me.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright,\u201d Bloodtooth said. \u201cAs the doc said, today is just some basic strength training, and you do it at your own pace. No one will tell you how much weight that you have to lift, or how fast that you are to run.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Jenkins said, as he watched the doctor get out a large needle and walk towards the kitsune, who already had Wolfblood drinking some of his blood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Bloody Teeth,\u201d the man said, as he wiped his mouth off, as he walked away from the kitsune. \u201cDo you have a washcloth that I can wipe my tongue with? This guy\u2019s blood tastes worse than cat blood, and I hate cat blood.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve got one right here,\u201d Bloodtooth said, as she tossed him a reddish washcloth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the vampire washed his mouth of the awful taste of the kitsune\u2019s blood, Bloodtooth asked, \u201cAre the two of them related?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wish that they weren\u2019t\u201d the vampire said, as he put the cloth on the table. \u201cBut they are. William Henry Jenkins the Second is their most recent common ancestor. After all, The Uniter only had the one child, although if he did do a kitsune, and if he was of that child, if he were here, he\u2019d posses him and slam his head against the wall half a dozen times, although he may do that anyways.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d have to agree with you,\u201d Doc said, as he stuck the needle into one of Orangetail\u2019s veins. \u201cWhile I\u2019ve never had the opportunity to see his spirit, my father told me that he\u2019d do anything to make sure that there were no problems between the men in the unit that they served in. After all, he wanted to keep the men safe from each other, which was why, after this one particular ambush, which injured many of the non-human soldiers, and got several of the human soldiers captured, he lead the non-humans, that could still fight, in a charge, and had the human soldiers, who could pull a trigger, give them covering fire. From what my father told me, he singlehandedly rescued the prisoners, and captured several of the enemy officers, and killed twenty of the enemy\u2019s giants that day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I\u2019m sorry to tell you, but you were misinformed,\u201d said a voice, one that was eerily similar to Jenkins\u2019s own voice. \u201cIt was twenty-three, but the other three died of their wounds the next day, so they wouldn\u2019t count them as part of my kills.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two soldiers and the medic looked at Jenkins, who had a grin on his face, one that it was said that The Uniter used every time someone saw him in person. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMorning Sir,\u201d the three said, saluting him, and backing away from the young man, whose body had just been possessed by his ancestor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh come on,\u201d the possessed man said, as he stood up. \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, I\u2019m still Private William Henry Jenkins the first. That whole posthumous promotion thing to General doesn\u2019t mean a thing to me. After all, all I did was save a man\u2019s life, and made him see the truth.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then looked at Bloodtooth and said, \u201cYou\u2019re a lucky person to have my great-grandson as your responsibility. However, just because you think that you owe your life to me, I don\u2019t want you to waste it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, but you saved my great-grandfather\u2019s life sir, which allowed him to get his wife pregnant with my grandmother,\u201d she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, at the cost of my own life, and to never be able to watch my own son grow up and have his children, with his various lovers,\u201d the man said, as he touched the werewolf\u2019s face. \u201cYou know, other than the fact that you are a woman, you are just like Colonel Richards Redclaws, in appearance, and the fact that you care for those under you, much like he did, after I made him see the truth.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he kissed the woman on the forehead, and whispered, \u201cI\u2019ll allow the relationship that the two of you have with each other, but should he stay in the military after he passes the training, I want him to be in another unit than yours, so you don\u2019t have to worry about putting him in a situation that could cause you to make the decision that could him to get killed. After all, he is like a family member to you, and potentially more than just someone for you to have, fun, with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he walked over to Wolfblood and said, \u201cThanks for saving his life the other day. I do not want him to die before he has lived his life to the fullest.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy, you\u2019re welcome Sir,\u201d the vampire said, as the man gave him a hug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d appreciate it if you didn\u2019t drink his blood too often,\u201d The Uniter whispered. \u201cAfter all, it is my blood to. Oh, and I know a way that your wife will sleep with you in bed. Just sit in a steam room for a few hours, and it ought to make your body, including a certain part of your anatomy, warm enough that she will sleep with you, as well as have sex with you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Wolfblood smiled, as the possessed Jenkins let go of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks sir,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd thanks for the advice.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, just helping out a fellow soldier,\u201d The Uniter said, as he walked towards Doc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell Doc,\u201d he said. \u201cI expect you to take good care of this young man. Also, the last time I met the spirit of your father he told me to tell you that he is proud of you, your son, and your granddaughter.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he whispered, \u201cHe also says that you need to learn how to control your anger towards your fellow magic users. However, if you want them to appreciate their non-magic using relations, there is a spell that you can use to prevent them from using magic, unless you, or another authorized person, say the magic words, as it were, which will let them use it again. It might also be useful to teach to those planning to use combat magic against enemy magic users as well to.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks sir,\u201d the old man said, with something of a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the man walked over to the kitsune, who was scared for his life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, all the possessed man did was take him off of the hook, that he was on, and drop him to the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the man said, \u201cTo think that a piece of shit like you is related to me by blood repulses me. It may have been a one night stand that my son had with your grandmother, but your nose should have been sensitive enough to tell you that the human woman that you bought was your cousin. That meant that you were to not even think about eating her for dinner, but to care for her due to the fact that you are blood relatives.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, he picked the kitsune up and slammed him against the wall and said, \u201cThe next time that you even think about eating a defenseless person, I will posses you, and ask a demon to open a portal to Hell and send you there, and leave you there to burn, get the picture.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, the kitsune nodded, quickly and nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood,\u201d The Uniter said, dropping the kitsune. \u201cI will forgive you for your past transgressions, including eating those that you were supposed to protect. However, make no mistake, if I find out that you break the Code, which I helped create, I will kill you in a manner that makes burning in Hell seem pleasant in comparison. That is because I will posses you, and walk into a minefield, and step on one. After that, I\u2019ll give control back to you, and leave you there, until you decide to end it, whether by moving or pulling out a service pistol and blowing your brains out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he looked at the other three and said, \u201cWell, I best take my leave. I only stopped by to check up on my great-grandson, when I heard that he had enlisted. Well, at least now I\u2019ll have something to brag about at the next ghost soldiers\u2019 reunion. Oh, and would one of you hold him before I give control back to him. He seems to be a little anemic at the moment.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes sir,\u201d both Wolfblood and Bloodtooth said, as they went to his sides and they each placed an arm under his shoulders, and he placed the kid\u2019s arms over theirs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTake good care of him,\u201d he said, as he closed the young man\u2019s eyes and the body went limp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the young man\u2019s eyes opened again, they were clear of being possessed by the spirit of his great-grandfather. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhy am I over here? Why are you guys holding me, and looking like you\u2019ve seen a ghost, and why do I know a guy by the name Redclaws all of a sudden? I don\u2019t even know anyone with that name, let alone any who are werewolves.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Uniter,\u201d Wolfblood said. \u201cYou were possessed, by The Uniter.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My great-grandfather possessed me?\u201d Jenkins said, in a questioning manner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d Bloodtooth said. \u201cAs for the name Redclaws, that was my grandmother\u2019s maiden name, before she married my grandfather, and changed it to Bloodtooth.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do I know about her maiden name then?\u201d Jenkins asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is because when a ghost possesses someone, they sometimes leave behind pieces of their memory when they give control back to the owner of the body,\u201d Doc said, as the two soldiers helped Jenkins get back to the seat that he\u2019d been sitting in before his ancestor had possessed him. \u201cHowever, they tend to fade into the back of ones memory within a day or so. Of course, if you see someone who is descended of someone from your great-grandfather\u2019s unit, you may feel like you know them somewhat. However, try to keep yourself from calling them brother or sister like your ancestor did. That fell out of fashion a long time ago, and while they might understand why, because if a ghost possesses someone, it must be reported, and which ghost it was, and what the message was, incase they found out something important, they won\u2019t like it if you call them brother or sister.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(This is the end of the prequal of Army of Men and Monsters.

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">This is the story that my interactive, Army of Men and Monsters is based off of. You will see familiar faces, a few you haven't seen, and some information that ties this story, and Army of Men and Monsters, with John Wolfstone and Vegetarian Monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Note, this is to be treated as a static item, in a manner of speaking. No one will be allowed to add to it. So if you want a character in the military, you best put him/her in Army of Men and Monsters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Also, seeing as to how it will just suddenly stop after a while, that was when I started writing the interactive that this is based off of.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere is the bio of the two main characters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrivate Recruit Jenkins (Uniter)<br>\r\nAge: 20<br>\r\nGender: Male<br>\r\nRace: human<br>\r\nSigns up to avoid being claimed by the county for not paying for back-taxes, which were not paid for the last five years. Five years ago was also when most of his family was murdered, with him surviving by sheer luck. A natural strategist when it comes to planning things. Willing to risk his life for those he cares for. <br>\r\nHis nickname comes from the fact that his great-grandfather was THE Uniter, as he was the man who united the military when he sacrificed his life to save his superior officer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLieutenant Bloodtooth (Bloody Teeth)<br>\r\nAge: 30<br>\r\nGender: Female<br>\r\nRace: Werewolf <br>\r\nBeen a part of the military since she was 17. Was bought from prison by an officer to keep her from being executed for killing a man who ate her human sister. Has fought in over thirty engagements in over twelve countries. Likes to keep mementos that were given to her by those she saved.<br>\r\nHer nickname comes from both a mispronunciation of her name, and from the fact that she bloodies her teeth and claws for humans. <br>\r\n*Note, her great-grandfather was the man who Jenkins's gave his life for. Also, her grandmother was born a year afterwards, meaning that Bloodtooth owes her life to the man for his sacrifice.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Please note, the first chapter is part of a dream spell, and the Drill Sargent is just based off of Bloodtooth. As for any gender confusion, Bloodtooth is in her werewolf form, standing at eight feet tall, looking like a humanoid wolf. Also, she as a sore throat, which makes her sound more like her father instead of her mother. Also, what person, in their right mind, is going to ask a werewolf, who could rip them to pieces in two seconds, what their gender is? I know I wouldn't.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*If you wish to see the encounter between their great-grandfathers, just check out the first page of Army of Men and Monsters. You will cry when you read it.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*This is dedicated to the men and women, past/present/future, who have served in the armed forces in any branch. No matter what anyone says about you, you are heroes all, every single one of you. Your sacrifices will never be truly forgotten, for freedom doesn't come free. May you come home safe, and be reunited with your families, who all love you in their hearts.* (A grown werewolf cries as he writes his dedication, despite the fact that he doesn't have any family or friends serving in the military.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere is a list of the things I've made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"90%\" style=\"position:relative;\" class=\"norm\"><tr><td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\" width=\"56\" style=\"position:relative;\"><div style=\"position:relative;\"><a rel=\"awardlightbox\" title=\"...
