By shooting at some birds with a sniper rifle.  Most animals knew better than to stray to close to your house, but it was early fall and these birds seemed to be getting an early start on migration.  You didn't care about going to get the dead bodies, you had plenty of stuffed specimens throughout your house.  Your parents were rarely home, and you had never had a baby-sitter since... the incident...  When you got bored (at around noon) you walked downstairs and ate some deer roast you made yourself.  The house was quiet as usual, until someone knocked on the door.  You groaned and looked through the peep-hole, seeing nothing.  You cautiously grabbed your shotgun and opened the door.  \"Hey!  You shouted.  This is NOT the kind of place you want to--\"  You got cut off as the shotgun was batted from your arms as something dug into your torso.  You yelped with pain as you flew into the air and landed on something, losing conciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you came to, you couldn't see a thing.  You tried to stand up but fell backwards when the pain hit you.  As you fell, you hit your head on a rock, losing conciousness again.  When you awoke again, you stayed still as your head throbbed and you examined your surroundings.  You were in a cave, it seemed.  You could see light moving toward you from the far end of the chamber you were in.  It was blinding, and when your eyes adjusted you saw Shinnok the wolf.  He had pure white fur, with piercing golden eyes and gold markings on his sides and back.  You scowled as you wished you had your shotgun.  \"Go ahead!\" you shouted.  \"Kill me!\"  The wolf stepped closer and said, \"I don't want to kill you, I never did.  Unlike you, I have a sense of mercy, which is why I brought you here.  You have driven the population of the forest animals so low that they came to me to, 'fix' you.  And there is only one way I know how...\"  You started to answer when you blacked out again.</span></div></div>",

And by that I mean no rampant sex, gore, death, etc.  They are allowed, but use them realistically.
