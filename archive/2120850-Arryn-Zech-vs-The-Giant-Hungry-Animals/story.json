She wore a white bra, a pair of dark blue lounge pants, and was completely barefoot. As the movie dragged on though Arryn started having trouble staying awake due to how late it was, and as she drifted off to sleep she thought about how terrifying it would actually to suddenly shrink to such atiny size like in the movie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night as she slept, Arryn had a nightmare in which she was only an inch in height. Throughout the dream she found herself being chased by huge animals that all wanted to eat her tiny self. Eventually, one of the animals manged to catch and swallow her, but just before she entered the stomach Arryn woke up panting. She calmed herself down relieved that it was only a dream before she noticed that something was not right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArryn's panic renewed when she realized that part of her dream had come true and that she was now only one inch tall. Somehow, while she slept she had shrunk like in her dream, the outfit she wore when she fell asleep thankfully having shrunk with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is bad,\" Arryn muttered to herself as she nervously paced back and forth. \"I'm now bite sized just like in my dream. I need to find a way to get to my normal size before I get crushed or eaten.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArryn then stopped pacing and finally took a good look at her surroundings and found that she no longer in her living room. Her location was now... </span></div></div>",

After all she was in her home and when it came to animals at least she didn't have to worry. Her puppies wouldn't eat her after all, would they? Then Arryn noticed an odd moist sensation all over her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT THE?!\" Arryn cried out in surprise as she looked down. She found herself submerged up to her neck in an open package of cocktail wieners on the floor. Being shrunk to an inch in height was one thing but how did she end up in a package of cocktail wieners?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This feels so weird,\" Arryn moaned as she dug herself out of the package and onto the kitchen floor. She took a moment to let herself drip dry. She still had the scent of the wiener's all over her though. The scent of food.

It was then that Arryn truly comprehended how tiny she was. Her adorable pup might as well be a kaiju compared to her. The kitchen floor seemed to grow cold beneath Arryn's barefeet as she watched Watson sniff the air. Was he looking for her or something to eat?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gulped when Watson turned his head in the direction of her and the package of cocktail wieners. Arryn did not like the look on his face, and she liked it even less when he licked his lips as though he were about to have a tasty treat. Then Watson started to walk towards her. Was Arryn's dog going to eat her? Surely he wouldn't, would he? As Watson approached the RWBY star wondered if she should make a run for it. But then again maybe Watson was just coming to eat the cocktail wieners and not her. Arryn needed to decided what she was going to do quickly. </span></div></div>",

The lovely lady found herself nearly being sucked up his nose. Then Watson opened his mouth and let his pink tongue roll out. The slimy muscle slid over Arryn as he licked her. Arryn, now covered in dog drool, desperately hoped that Watson was just being friendly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, for her he wasn't. Watson hadn't recognized Arryn when he saw her. She was far to small to be his mistress, and when he sniffed her he noticed that she smelled more like food. While the taste test had told him the bug before him tasted similiar to his owner it also told him that she was tasty. That was all the convincing he needed that this tiny creature before him was food instead of his mistress. With that Watson licked his lips and brought his tongue back out to his tasty treat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArryn's eyes widened as Watson's tongue slid beneath her feet, forcing her to fall forward on the powerful muscle. She could only watch in horror as she was pulled into his hungry maw. Before Arryn could recover from the shock that her own dog would eat her, Watson snapped his jaws closed, thus trapping her inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watson!\" Arryn cried out as she lay on her dog's tongue, \"Please, don't eat mommy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Watson either didn't hear her, understand her, or care as the tongue began tasting her in earnest. Arryn was rolled around on the tongue and licked against the pallet. It seemed Watson enjoyed how she tasted quite a bit, as the saliva in Watson's mouth increased quite a bit. It did not take long for Arryn to become covered from head to toe in it. She even had to spit some out of her mouth at one point. After about ten minutes of tasting the tongue settled down and began pushing Arryn towards the back of the throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOOO!\" Arryn screamed as she felt Watson tilt his head back and with a loud 'GULP' swallowed her whole and alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe Watson ate me,\" Arryn said, tears streaming down her face, as muscles rippled all around her, massaging her slowly down to the stomach. As the gurgles of the belly grew closer a mixture of saliva and mucus clung to her from head to toe. Before long the lovely ladies journey came to an end when she reached a wall of flesh that was none other than the stomach sphincter. Recognizing Watson's former mistress as food it quickly squeezed her into the stomach where she ended up splashing around in digestive juices. As Arryn floated in the digestive enzymes, she felt her skin begin to tingle. Arryn's eyes widened when mush that was once cocktail wieners started raining down on her. Apparently, eating his owner wasn't enough to satisfy Watson's hunger and he decided to have the wieners for desert. Arryn tried to swim out of the way of the incoming debris, but there was just too much. Eventually, some of the mush eventually landed on the former voice actress and trapped her beneath the surface. She struggle to break free, but it was no use as she too weak to get the mush off her. Eventually, Arryn had to gasp for air, thus allowing the digestive juices to enter her insides. The Last thing Arryn remembered was the tingling sensation entering her, followed by the sensation of drowning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Watson finished the cocktail wieners and made his way to the living room. Once there he jumped up on the coach and curled up to sleep. In his mind he wondered when Arryn Zech was going come and feed him, not realizing she already had. </span></div></div>",

She breathed a sigh of relief and fell onto her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew Watson wouldn't eat me,\" Arryn said. She closed her eyes and allowed herself to relax for a moment.

However, the door to the back yard as not more than five feet behind the tiny voice actress (well five feet at her normal size). If She could squeeze under it she'd be able to get away. So with all that in mind Arryn turned on her heel and bolted for the back door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Watson was intending to eat her or not was now irrelevant. The moment Arryn started running she became nothing more than food.If he caught her, even if he recognized her as his former owner he would still eat her. Licking his lips Watson began to give chase. Arryn turned her head to look back for just a moment and regretted it. While she was half way to the door Watson was almost atop her. The former RWBY star picked up the pace as she tried desperately to avoid becoming her dog's lunch. As Arryn got closer to the door she could practically feel Watson's breathe on her back. She was almost there and Watson was reaching for her with a wide open maw. With a grunt Arryn dived towards the door. Does she make it, or does Watson get a tasty snack?</span></div></div>",

Not taking a moment to rest she quickly began crawling on her belly beneath the door. Seeing his prey about to escape Watson redoubled his efforts and lunged at his former mistress's legs. His jaws snapped closed just barely missing her barefeet as they disappeared beneath the door. A shiver ran down Arryn's spine as she felt the resulting gust of air from the closing jaws on her feet. She could hear her dog's growls and barks of frustation as she crawled to freedom. In less then a minute the RWBY star emerged on the other side. However, she didn't stop to celebrate as she could hear Watson scratching at the door on the other side, still wanting to catch her. So the young woman continued to run. She ran across her once small patio and into the jungle of grass that was her back yard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Arryn was a few feet into the cover of the grass she slowed to a stop and sat down on a leaf to catch her breath. Once her breathing returned to normal she looked around at the grass that toward over her like the tallest of trees, and the reality of her new situation hit her. Arryn was tiny. She was now at the bottom of the food chain. By going outside she was not at risk from multiple predators rather than the one or two she had kept as pets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I should have just let Watson eat me,\" Arryn moaned. Still she had already prolonged her possibly inevitable consumption, and if she were to go back into the house now she would surely be eaten.

Arryn didn't need anymore convincing that she was about to become cat food. She screamed and turned around to run.

The air was forced from Arryn's lungs as she landed on the ground with an 'oof'. Shakily she got back onto her feet only for the cat to start batting her around with its paws. After a few minutes of this the disoriented voice actress found herself pinned yet again under the cat's paw. Then the feline began to roll her around on the ground for a few minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Why isn't it eating me?\" Arryn wondered as it lifted her into the air via her bra again. Then the cat once again dropped her and began batting her around before she could recover.  However, when the cat once again pinned her under its paw a chill ran down her spin as Arryn realized what was going on. 'Cats tend to play with their food before eating it,' Arryn thought in horror as it once again began rolling her around again. This meant that she had a slim chance to escape being eaten though.

As Arryn began to fall towards the hungry maw she screamed in terror. She flailed her limbs wildly in a desperate attempt to alter her course, but her fate was inevitable. With a splat the former RWBY star landed in the feline's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArryn quickly sat up on the cat's tongue . Her eyes grew wide as she watched the mouth close sealing her in darkness. That was the last time the poor girl would ever see the outside world. Arryn soon found herself flat on her back again as the tongue licked her against the palette and rolled her around. Saliva clung to the tiny woman as the cat tried to determine just how she tasted. Evidently, Arryn was pretty tasty as the cat started purring while it continued to taste her. While the cat might have been enjoying this, its prey found the experience excruciating. The tongue was like sandpaper as it licked her all over, and it would not be long before it started tear her skin. Realizing there was only one way out Arryn crawled towards the throat behind her. As soon as her head and shoulders entered the throat a reflex was triggered, and with a loud 'GULP' Arryn felt herself get swallowed whole and alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the muscles in the esophagus rippled all around her Arryn's eyes grew wide as she suddenly realized what she had done. She had traded a slow and painful demise by tasting for a slow and painful demise via digestion. 'There was no other choice,\" Arryn thought trying to comfort herself as a mixture of saliva and mucus began to cover her from head to toe. So with that she just let the muscles massage her down to the waiting stomach. Before long her head came into contact with the stomach sphincter. Recognizing the former internet star as food it quickly squeezed her into the stomach where she landed with a splash. Inside the fleshy chamber Arryn Zech found herself floating in digestive juices, and her skin tingled where they made contact with her bare flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did I do to deserve this?\" Arryn asked woefully as a single tear streamed down her face. Thankfully she passed out from a lack of air before she feel the full agony of being digested.</span></div></div>",

'<i>Wait, I didn't fall asleep in a sleeping bag</i>,' Arryn remembered. Her eyes snapped open and she screamed. Wrapped around Arryn's legs just above her knees was the maw of hungry snake and the slight bulge in its neck was unmistakably what it had already swallowed of the former RWBY star. While Arryn had been sleeping the snake had come into the bottle looking for a home and found a free meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\" Arryn cried out as with a 'gulp' the snake swallowed more of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesperately, Arryn tried to pry the snakes maw open with her bare hands, but it was futile. All the young voice actress accomplished was having her hands slip into the maw as with another 'gulp' the snake swallowed her up to her waist. With her arms now effectively pinned all Arryn could do was squirm and watch herself be slowly be consumed. Another 'gulp' and Arryn's bare belly entered the serpent's maw. Arryn looked up at the sky one last time through the bottle's glass ceiling as with another 'gulp' the snake took in her breasts and shoulders. Tears streamed down Arryn's face as she watched the roof of the bottle get replaced with the roof of the snake's mouth as its maw closed over her head with one final 'gulp'. Then a bulge that was once Arryn Zech could be seen traveling down the length of the snake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArryn squirmed within the tight confining tube known as the esophagus. All around her she felt the powerful muscles slowly massaging her, feet first, towards the stomach. A mixture of saliva and mucus clung to Arryn from head to toe, effectively hiding her tears. '<i>I can't believe I avoided getting eaten by my puppy and a cat only for a snake to get me while sleeping</i>,' Arryn thought as she listened to  the gurgles of the stomach getting closer and closer. After what seemed like an eternity the former RWBY star's journey came to an end as her bare feet made contact with the stomach sphincter. Recognizing the lovely lady as food it quickly squeezed her into the snake's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stomach was only slightly roomier than the esophagus was, and thus Arryn was forced to remain on her back as she continued to squirm. Before long the digestive juices began to flow. Arryn's bare flesh tingled were the digestive enzymes made contact with her skin. As Arryn marinated in the digestive enzymes the walls, floor, and ceiling began kneading her all over. Fortunately, for Arryn she passed out before the end of her first day digestion so she did not have to endure the full four days of being slowly digested.</span></div></div>",

However, she soon felt herself land with a 'SPLAT' instead of a thud. Arryn's eyes snapped open, then widened in horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\" Arryn cried out as she found herself on a slimy pink muscle. As the former RWBY star had dived for the door Watson had unfurled his tongue to catch her on it. Before she could even try to escape Watson pulled his tongue, along with Arryn, back into his maw. Arryn could only scream before her dog's jaws closed sealing her inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watson!\" Arryn cried out as she laid on her dog's massive tongue. \"PLEASE DON'T EAT ME!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the former voice actress's pleas fell on deaf ears as Watson began the process of tasting his former owner. Arryn felt the tongue begin to move beneath her. Soon she was being licked against the palette and rolled around on the tongue. Occasionally Watson would suck on her like a piece of candy. Evidently Arryn's dog found her to be quite tasty as saliva slowly flooded the mouth, and effectively covered the former voice actress from head to toe in the substance. Watson continued to savor Arryn's delectable flavor for about ten minutes before the tongue finally settled down. Arryn sighed in relief thinking that maybe Watson had changed his mind about eating her. Then she felt the tongue tip up and she started sliding backwards. Turning her head Arryn's eyes grew wide with horror as she saw the black abyss of her dog's throat approaching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO! NO! NO! NO! NO!\" Arryn cried as she desperately clawed for some kind of handhold on the tongue to stop her descent. Unfortunately, both the former RWBY star and the pink muscle beneath her were too slick with saliva for her to get a good grasp. Within a matter of seconds Arryn felt her barefeet enter the back of the throat. As soon as that happened Watson tilted his head back and with an audible 'GULP' swallowed his former owner alive and whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the esophagus Arryn screamed and squirmed as the muscles surrounding her slowly massaged her down to the stomach. She could hear the gurgles of the belly beneath her grow closer with every second. Mucus mixed with the saliva that covered her from head to toe. Arryn's journey came to an end almost to soon as she felt her feet come into contact with a wall of flesh that was none other than the stomach sphincter. Recognizing the lovely lady as food it quickly squeezed her into the stomach, and she was in free fall for a moment before landing on a soft squishy surface with a 'PLOP'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly sitting up Arryn surveyed her fleshy prison in shock and horror. She couldn't believe her precious pooch had actually eaten her. However, the fact that he had eaten her was too strong to ignore. Getting back up on her feet Arryn quickly made her way to the stomach wall. She pounded and kicked it as she begged Watson to let her out. Meanwhile, Watson felt and heard nothing from his former owner as he made his way to her bedroom. Once there he jumped up on her bed and laid down on it before drifting off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the stomach the force of Watson's jump knocked Arryn off her feet and she fell into a small pool of digestive juices. Feeling her skin starting to tingle Arryn cried out and quickly scrambled out the pool and back onto relatively dry stomach. Panting the RWBY star turned dog food looked back at the pool and watch as it slowly grew. That was when the hard truth of her situation hit her. This was the end of Arryn Zech. She had been eaten by her dog and there was only one way she would be leaving his belly. As she realized this Arryn hugged her knees to her chest and began to sob in despair as the stomach slowly filled with acid. Soon Arryn found herself floating in nothing but digestive enzymes that caused her skin to tingle where they made contact with her bare flesh. After a few minutes though Arryn began to scream in pain as the tingling turned into a horrible burning. Being digested alive was the most agonizing thing Arryn had ever felt. About an hour later Arryn's screams finally stopped as she was reduced to nothing more then a nutritious soup that was soon sent to the intestines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo hours later Watson awoke from his nap feeling the need to relieve himself. So he jumped off Arryn's bed and made his way to the front door. Once there Watson used the doggy door in the door to exit the house. Going over to a bush in the corner of the front yard he quickly crouched and relieved himself of his former owner's remains. Once he was finished Watson went back into the house blissfully unaware that he had actually eaten his owner. In the end Arryn Zech wound up as nothing more than a steaming pile of dog poop in her front yard.</span></div></div>",

On the other side of the fence Arryn notices a barn, a chicken cope, a dog house settled next to a country style farmhouse, and a few select animal pens in between the barn and house. Then it clicked she was somehow in the middle of a farm on the country side, which explained the smell, Arryn just wished her nose would adjust quickly to the smell. Some of the pens had pigs, goats, sheep, turkeys, and she could tell there where other pen behind those but her vision was blocked, and she couldn\u2019t tell what others there are.

The farm house was only two stories high, but to Arryn it might as well have been a skyscraper. The same could be said for the dog house just a few feet next to it. Arryn curled and and uncurled her toes nervously as she looked up at the now massive structure.

Normally Arryn would be more than happy to see a cute canine, but the sight of one more large enough to swallow her had the young woman frozen in fear. The border collie quickly sniffed the air, and looked in her direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It must be able to smell me,' Arryn thought as the dog began making its way over to her. As the dog came closer she squeezed her eyes shut not wishing to see her end, but it did not come. Slowly she opened her eyes, and nearly had a heart attack as she found the massive dog peering down at her. The border collie took a few quick sniffs of the tiny woman, nearly sucking her up its nose. The border collie then brought its head back up and stared at the tiny woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dog was perplexed by Arryn. She clearly looked and smelled like a human, but she was much smaller than most humans it had seen. Was she perhaps some kind of special treat from its master? The dog had to admit that the tiny human before it did look and smell tasty, but how did she taste? So the border collie lowered its head, opened its maw, and rolled out its tongue. The large pink muscle slammed into Arryn and licked her from her feet to her head, and slightly lifting her into the air. Now the tiny voice actress found herself covered in saliva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she tried to wipe the saliva off of herself Arryn looked up at the dog once more. The border collie licked its lips and let out a loud bark. Despite the ominous signs Arryn desperately hoped that it was just being friendly.

All this plus the amount of saliva in the mouth was enough to let Arryn know that this particular canine found her to be quite tasty.

Thus Arryn began to swim towards the shore, but sadly she didn't make it very far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe anaconda had noticed a small but tasty looking creature land in its pool. As the meal tried to swim for it the snake re positioned itself under the water and rose to the surface with a open maw. As Arryn swam she didn't notice what was happening in front of her. She only noticed something was wrong she felt her upper half became beached onto a slimy surface.

Then with another 'GULP' the anaconda swallowed her completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the esophagus Arryn found herself being slowly massaged down by the powerful muscles towards the stomach. A mixture of saliva and mucus covered her from head to toe. After nearly five minutes of travelling down the long esophagus the former voice actress came to the stomach sphincter. Recognizing her as food it quickly opened up and squeezed her into the belly. Thanks to the anaconda's size Arryn found herself able to stand up in the fleshy chamber. She was surprised that she was able to see as well as she could in the stomach despite there being no light source. She saw digestive enzymes dripping down the walls and ceiling. Panicking Arryn ran across the spongy flesh as the digestive enzymes slowly covered her to a wall and began pounding on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LET ME OUT! PLEASE!\" Arryn begged as she kicked and punched at the stomach wall to no effect. She felt her skin slowly began to tingle as she began to experience the wonderful process of digestion. The poor girl spent an entire week and a half in the stomach as she was slowly turned into a nutritious stew. Arryn Zech was only granted a reprieve from the pain of digestion when the digestive enzymes reached her heart on the second to last day.   </span></div></div>",

Its eyes followed Arryn as she slowly made her approach, its head bobbing up and down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she got close to the lizard the tiny voice actress reached out and patted the lizard on the snout. 'Its like petting a giant dog,' Arryn thought as she patted it a few more times. After about five minutes of patting Arryn seemed to have patted a spot that seemed to cause the chameleon to open its mouth. She took a step back and stared into pink maw and dark gullet of the lizard. It struck her fancy a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile the chameleon believed it was getting food and kept its attention on the tiny human in its habitat. Arryn's fascination was almost never ending, but the moment she turned her attention from the open maw the chameleon shot out its tongue at her. The slimy appendage wrapped around the lovely lady, and pulled her into the maw with a yelp. IT THOUGHT ARRYN WAS THE FOOD!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe former RWBY star found herself sealed in darkness as the jaws snapped closed behind her. The tongue quickly unwrapped itself from Arryn and began to lick her all over.

Fortunately, for her there was a broom leaning next to it. Climbing the broom wasn't easy and Arryn fell a few times, but not hard or far enough to kill her, just make her sore in the morning. After about ten minutes the RWBY star made it to her destination, and collapsed on the floor of the cage as she took a moment to catch her breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was finally rested, Arryn got back onto her feet and looked up at the parrot. She gulped at the sight of it looking down at her, and the metal floor of the cage seemed to grow colder beneath her barefeet. Now that she was up close to it the parrot was a tad bit more intimidating then she initially thought. However, she came into the cage with one goal. Arryn took a deep breathe and curled and uncurled her toes. Then she began pacing back and forth as she tried to come up with the best phrase to get the parrot to say to draw an employee's attention. After a minute of pacing the young lady came up with three words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me food,\" Arryn said to the parrot. 'Give me food' ended up being a phrase she would have to repeat multiple times. After about ten minutes the voice actress got her desired result. Satisfied, Arryn smiled and decided to reward the parrot with a treat. Looking to the food tray on the cage wall, she climbed up to it and leaned in over the edge to get the parrot something good to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, almost empt.. WHOA!\" Arryn cried out as she leaned to far and fell into the tray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArryn quickly sat up and looked out to the top. The tray was too deep for her to be able to climb out without help. However, that was the least of Arryn's concerns at the moment. The parrot was looking down at her once again, but this time in a different way as it cocked its head to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me food,\" the parrot said, and Arryn's eyes grew wide with horror as she realized what was about to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, please not like this!\" the voice actress turned bird food begged as the parrot's open beak descended upon her. In less than a minute the parrot lifted its head up and the lovely lady's tiny legs could be seen kicking outside its beak.This did not last long though as with a 'GULP' and click of the beak Arryn was brought entirely inside. The parrot's tongue tasted her only long enough to determine if she tasted good enough to eat. Upon finding that Arryn did taste good the parrot tilted its head back and with a loud 'GULP' swallowed her whole and alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe journey from tray to beak to gullet was so fast Arryn barely put up a struggle before she found herself being massaged down to her doom. Saliva and mucus covered her from head to toe. Then Arryn screamed as she found herself being squeezed into the bird's crop. Sitting up the former RWBY star looked around the fleshy chamber in horror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PLEASE NOT LIKE THIS!\" Arryn cried out as she struggled not ready to die just yet. She cried out that phrase and multiple variations of it the whole time before the crop begin to chew her up to make her easier to digest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen morning came all that remained of Arryn Zech was a white smudge at the bottom of the parrot's cage, and one phrase the parrot repeated over and over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, please not like this!\"</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately, the only response the young woman got was the feline purring, causing both her and her environment to start shaking as she was slowly digested alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile on the outside, the calico kitten laid down for its own cat nap. As it drifted off to sleep it couldn't help but wonder if all of its toys were as tasty as Arryn Zech had been.</span></div></div>",

Inside was syrian hamster, and the normally small mammal was now six times the voice actress's size. It stared at her and Arryn begin to consider her options. Hamsters were generally cute and not aggressive towards humans. She looked up and saw that there were holes near the top that were big enough for her to fit through.

It wasn't easy climbing up the glass and she fell a few times, but after about ten minutes Arryn finally reached one of the holes in the top. She hung from it with both her hands, took a deep breathe, and with a little effort hoisted herself up and through the hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Arryn fell into the cage the first thing she noticed was the smell. She wrinkled her nose and gaged before she landed on the ground with an 'oof'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who knew hamsters could be so smelly,\" Arryn said as she sat up. Suddenly, a shadow fell over her and she looked up to see the syrian hamster towering over her. The way it starred at her was a bit unnerving. Then Arryn took a good look at her surroundings and saw that she was surrounded by seeds in a blue, plastic bowel. A food bowel. Putting two and two together the hamster grabbed Arryn with its front paws before she could make four, and stuffed as much of the former voice actress as it could into its mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the maw, Arryn found herself being tasted by the hamster's tongue. She squirmed as the saliva quickly covered her. Apparently, Arryn must have been quite tasty since the hamster didn't seem to be in a rush to finish eating her. Outside the maw all the lovely lady could do was wiggle her barefeet and toes as they were the only parts of her not in the hamster's mouth. After about five minutes the hamster's tongue slipped out and started licking Arryn's toes and the soles of her feet. The former voice actress squeaked in surprise and wiggle her feet and toes harder in response. After about three minutes of tasting Arryn's feet the hamster's tongue wrapped around them and pulled them into the maw. This forced the young woman's head into the throat, and out of reflex the hamster swallowed her whole and alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the esophagus Arryn was at a loss for words as the muscles rippled all around her. She couldn't believe that of all the threats in this world it was being eaten by a hamster that did her in. A mixture of saliva and mucus covered her from head to toe as she was slowly massaged down to her slow demise of digestion. Unfortunately, Arryn's journey wasn't a long one as she was soon squeezed into the belly of the beast. Sitting up in the fleshy chamber the RWBY star turned food noticed that it was rather warm and smelly inside the belly, and that she was slowly being coated in digestive juices that made her skin tingle. Not willing to die just yet, Arryn kicked and punched at the stomach walls in a vain attempt to escape, but the heat in the belly quickly drained her of her energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I thought they smelled bad on the outside,\" Arryn said, so her last words would be a Star Wars quote, just before she passed out from the heat and exhaustion, never to awaken again.   </span></div></div>",

Turns out she didn't have long to wait. The frog hadn't been staring in her direction for more then a minute when the amphibian opened its mouth and shot its tongue out at the tiny voice actress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\" Arryn cried out as the long sticky appendage wrapped around her arms and torso. Then the frog used its tongue to slowly pull the young woman towards its hungry maw. Arryn squirmed and dug her heels into the muddy ground in a futile attempt to save herself, but she still moved closer and closer to her doom. As she continued to be pulled towards the maw she wondered why the frog didn't just eat her and get it over with. Then with another squirm Arryn's eyes widened in horror as the look on the frog's face told her the truth. She was delicious and the frog was going to savor her as much as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you like how I taste huh?\" Arryn said as she squirmed once more to provide the frog another blast of flavor. \"Then enjoy me while you can, because I won't be eaten easily!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll too soon she found herself in front of the frog's hungry maw. The former voice actress could only let out a yelp as the slimy lips sealed around her waist. The frog lifted its head back up and Arryn's dangling legs could be seen kicking the air as she continued to struggle against her fate. Inside the maw the tongue unwrapped itself from the former voice actress and began to lick her all over, thus covering her in the frog's sticky saliva. Despite her claim the frog was eating the poor girl rather easily as with a quick 'gulp' the lips resealed around her knees. Arryn kicked her legs harder in response as the tongue continued to assault her. Some saliva entered her mouth and she quickly spat it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is just like my dream,\" Arryn moaned in despair. With another 'gulp' the frog's lips sealed around her ankles, thus leaving only her barefeet visible to the outside world. Now all Arryn could do to struggle is wiggle her feet and toes. The poor girl now found her head inches from the throat that led to her slow demise of digestion. Soon the frog's tongue slipped out of its mouth and licked each of the former voice actress's toes and the soles of her feet. Arryn squeaked and wiggled her feet and toes harder in response. Unfortunately, with one last mighty 'GULP' Arryn felt her heels, soles, and finally toes squeeze past the amphibian's slimy lips as the frog swallowed her whole and alive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she first entered the esophagus Arryn had screamed, but now she only silently wept. She became covered from head to toe in a mixture of saliva and mucus as the muscles slowly massaged her to the stomach below. All to soon though Arryn came to a wall of flesh that was none other than the stomach sphincter. Recognizing the lovely lady as food it opened up and squeezed her into the stomach. The fleshy chamber while less constricting than the esophagus was still cramped enough to keep Arryn laying on her belly. Though she couldn't move much any way as she was covered in the frog's sticky saliva. Soon the digestive juices began to flow and Arryn once again wept. Her skin tingled from where the digestive enzymes met her bare flesh as she lay marinating in them. As the digestive juices continued to flow though Arryn soon found it impossible to keep enough of her above the fluids and they soon rushed into her lungs, thus quickly drowning her. While it wasn't the most pleasant way to die it did at least spare Arryn the agony of feeling herself being slowly digested alive. </span></div></div>",
