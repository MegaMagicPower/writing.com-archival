It was bad enough already that her mom had forced her into a summer job. But, on the bright side, a summer job meant money, hot guys...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached into her pocket one last time, and re-applied her Supergloss lipstick. She was raised on the idea that lipstick made the job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened for her, and Mary strutted into the Agency.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany of her friends had gotten jobs there at the Agency, but not so many of them talked to her after that. They all said the same thing though; it was the best summer of their lives. Most of them were now semi-famous, and one of them now adorned posters all over Paris. Mary wanted to join them desperately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary met the receptionist at the desk, and with an air of confidence, said, \"Here for the summer positions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe receptionist looked up at her, laughed and rolled her eyes, ushering Mary into the next room. Mary swore the receptionist gave a laugh, \"Wonder what this one's gonna be like...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary entered the conference hall...</span></div></div>",

She had to admit, it was disappointing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Mary's good by me! Um, I didn't think I'd be meeting my boss this early...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Boss? Oh, me, I'm just the assistant. Don't worry, happens all the time! The boss is really busy right now, so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment the phone went off, and the forty-something cringed. He stalked over towards the phone, and picked it up like it was covered in slime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GODDAMMIT, WISE!! 7:15, I SAID! 7:15! CAN'T EVEN GET THE GODDAMN TIME RIGHT! I'LL BE COMING DOWN TO THE CONFERENCE HALL NOW, SO YOU BETTER KEEP YOUR ASS THERE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary shuddered, it was the <i>real</i> boss. Somehow, she had the strangest premonition this job wasn't going to end well... The assistant, whose name must have been 'Wise', desperately motioned for Mary to come back. She pitied the poor guy, and without a sound walked his way. When he saw her meandering over, he smiled and began to explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My boss, and yours in the future, is a little scary at first. His name is Doxon and please remember that. Oh, and do whatever he says; your life could depend upon it. I'm sure you'll see Mr. Doxon as a very fair employer...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conference doors slammed open again, and in walked \"the boss\". He was tall, with jet black hair and beady brown eyes that looked like hellfire. As far as age, Mary thought he didn't look a day over 25, which contrasted highly to his weakly elder assistant. Mary kept it to herself, but despite his imposing get-up, Mr. Doxon was kind of hot. She stood as primly as she could, and tried to look very eager for the job. This could be the thing that rocketed her to the top, if what her friends said was the truth. She wondered if any of them had to face this man before her... She got a little excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well, you even let her in? Good morning, Miss...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary was unsure how to greet him, so she kept her hands to herself at first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Longfield, <i>Mary</i> Longfield. It's a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Doxon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoxon shot a dirty sneer at his assistant, and then his face completely morphed. He smiled candidly at Mary, and quite frankly it was freaky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's such a nice time when summer rolls around, don't you think? For me, it means fresh, young faces <i>all</i> around the building. I think you'll find this the best summer job you've ever had! Maybe, even, when you get a little older you'll come on back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoxon laughed, and Mary had to stop herself from completely melting. This guy seemed sexier by the minute, but she knew he was 1: her boss, 2: interviewing her for a job, 3: completely and utterly creepy. So, she submissively sat down across from him and Mr. Wise, tentatively twiddling her thumbs under the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I'm sure, you've never applied her before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, well, the job is basically this. We are a modeling agency, no?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary nodded her head; it was good to hear her old dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you, for a special piece, will be modeling for us, and this will run approximately...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three months,\" Wise stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Doxon glared at him, and redirected a happy face to Mary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you will start tomorrow, and wear baggy clothes, please. The receptionist will meet you on your way out with the schedule. Thank you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoxon and Wise flew out in a hurry, but just before leaving, Wise shot her a solemn glance. It seemed to say, \"I'm so sorry.\" Mary couldn't make sense of it. She walked out of the conference hall, and moved towards the receptionist table. The receptionist looked up at her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's you. So, I'm assuming you're hired.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, ma'am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ma'am? Ha! That's a new one. Here's your schedule, kid. May God be with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Mary left the Agency, but not without a confused look on her face. What was all this about? Needless to say, it would really begin tomorrow...</span></div></div>",

It had been an odd day yesterday, and she was glad to wake up in a pleasant, absolutely normal atmosphere! She strolled her way into the bathroom, and on the way caught a glance of the time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"9:00\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary suddenly recalled that schedule she'd been handed the day before... Her hours started at... 9:30! Quickly, Mary bolted through her morning routine, finishing up within 15 minutes! In her hurry, she didn't stop to think about Doxon's specific instructions... \"Please wear baggy clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid Mary subconciously remember?

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mary got behind the wheel of her own, beat-up dirty car in the rush to work. She knew it would probably look bad on her reputation to bring such a scummy car to such a high-scale place of business, but right now image wasn't a matter. Suddenly, Doxon's instructions returned to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please wear baggy clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe almost flipped out, thinking she would be late and improperly dressed, but took a quick peek down and noticed she'd subconciously worn a nice and baggy outfit. Not to mention it still looked cute! Mary smiled to herself; it was going to be a wonderful day. That was before her car broke down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary welled up with tears and sweat as she finally crossed the block to get to the building. Her sobs became flowing rivers as she found out she was not only late, she was late by <b>half an hour</b>. The receptionist gave a once-over of Mary, and offered her a tissue. She graciously pointed Mary in the direction of the conference hall. Mary, about to bash her face against the door, was rescued by Wise, who also pitied her and ushered her inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked around the long hall, which was strangely devoid. Why would they rent out such a big room for only one meeting? Mary looked ahead, and saw Doxon waiting for her at a table in the dead center of the room. Without a sound, she sat down. Doxon smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad you could make it on time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary flushed, and her words poured out faster than she could say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Omigosh, I'm so sorry! I woke up late, and my car broke down, and I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sh-sh-shush!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoxon continued to grin at Mary, and put a finger to her lips. Mary's color turned a deeper shade of red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're on time. Don't worry. I'm here to take you up to where you'll be starting for today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoxon stood up, and began to walk off towards a door at the end of the hall. He stopped, twirled around, and cocked a gesturing finger, telling Mary, 'Come on.' She followed like a lost puppy, and they both exited through the door. From there, they boarded an elevator, riding all the way up to floor 20. Mary clung a bit to Doxon's sleeve; she was afraid of heights a little bit. He didn't snub her off, but merely smirked. 'He looks sexy when he smirks,' Mary thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last on floor 20, Doxon corralled Mary over to a desk counter, where an older looking Chinese woman sat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Norma?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman gazed up, and smiled to see Doxon. She then averted her gaze to Mary, whereas her smile became a toothy grin. Mary thought it looked a little too friendly, and shivered a bit. Doxon strung his arm around her shoulder, which calmed her nerves a lot. The woman listened intently to Doxon's words. Mary became lost in him holding her, and thus didn't overhear the words, \"Prepare the procedure.\" All of the sudden, Doxon's arm disappeared, and Mary snapped awake. He waved goodbye to Mary, and re-entered the elevator. Now, it was just Mary and the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your name is Mary, right? I'm Dr. Chin, but you can call me Norma. They all do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorma continued to beam at Mary - just like a vampire. Mary was afraid to shake her hand. Norma began to laugh, and then drove Mary into a room that looked completely white.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's where new employees get a quick touch-up job before their first shoot. It's a neutralizer, very good for your skin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary instinctively rubbed her cheek, which caused Norma's frightening smile to grow wider. Without haste, Norma guided Mary into a chair on the other end of the room. Norma then entered the control room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please lean back as far as you can in the chair, and close your eyes. The process will be over sooner than you know it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her every instinct to get out of this creepy as hell room, Mary stayed put, and faithfully followed the instructions. She lulled off to sleep...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the control room, Norma handled a tiny panel of buttons and levers. All that waited for her was to press the button...</span></div></div>",

It had been Doxon's specific instructions, anyways, to incite the transformation as snappy as possible. So, the process had lost its subtle charm - why Norma enjoyed it in the first place. Regardless, the boss was the boss, and his orders came first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her name's Mary, huh? God save her, then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorma walked out of the room; she wouldn't be needed any further. Mary had already been tranq'd, so she wouldn't be waking up anytime soon. It would be another normal day...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary could vaguely sense what was happening around her. Vivid dreams, full of beauty, happiness, and Mr. Doxon swirled in head, lulling her away from her senses. Unfortunately, those senses were the only things that could have warned her of what was to come...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Mary's legs that took the first wave of the transformations. They grew longer and longer, until they splayed out carelessly under Mary. It moved up from there, as Mary's body became older and rounder. Trapped in a drug-induced sleep, Mary couldn't notice herself growing faster and faster into a young woman. When at last the changes stopped, Mary was a beautifully formed woman in her mid twenties. When Norma re-entered the room, Mary couldn't even stand up on her own. Norma sighed, and got a few of her workers to help hoist Mary out. All of this occured while Mary was unconcious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe workers descended down 14 flights, and stopped on floor 6. They rolled her onto one of the empty beds, and so Mary slept...</span></div></div>",

Mary stirred instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Mary, Mary, what do we have here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat opposite her side of the bed, and lifted her up. Under the remnants of her dazy stupor, Mary couldn't hardly think straight. Doxon looked her straight in the eyes, and Mary's breath shortened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're perfect, Mary. Perfect for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe strung out her arms, as Mary had to gasp for air!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I brought you here for a very special piece; can you guess what it is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoxon now whispered in her ear - Mary sat panting- and he held her close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to be my girlfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe kissed the side of her head; Mary passed out. With a sigh, Doxon readjusted her position on the bed and dimmed the lights again. He was just about to leave, when he gave another glance back at her. Smiling, he offered one last remark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll come back tonight, please be ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary nodded, and then returned to sleep.

One read \"For Tonight\"; the other \"For Tomorrow\". Mary marveled at the beauty of them! A model must have worn these, or at least now <i>she</i> would! Carrying a smile brighter than sunshine, Mary donned her first evening gown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThoughts began to flow into Mary's head as she pulled up the dress. Had Doxon been planning this all along? If so, then he'd hired her to be his girlfriend?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary stumbled backwards. Trying to put on a dress and uncover her boss's inner workings: two jobs that didn't fit together. So, Mary accomplished the more pressing of the duo: her dress. Once she'd slipped into the dress, a letter fell out from behind the garment bag. It read,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear Mary,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, I knew from the start you were going to be my girlfriend. And yes, that's why I hired you. If you don't hurry up, you'll be late! I'll meet you downstairs in the lobby after you're finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoxon<br>\r\n<br>\r\nP.S. The jewelry should be in the box, check it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so she did. Displayed like any old jeweler would. Mary carefully handled the probably priceless earrings of (pure?) silver. Mary caught a glimpse of herself in the mirror, and couldn't look away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I look like some sort of princess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in the doorway was Mr. Wise, who had a tear to his eye. Mary, in confusion, came up to the old man. Had he known, too?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Wise? Was this supposed to happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Doxon is waiting in the lobby, and I'm sure you don't want to be late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWise showed her the way to the elevator, and from there left Mary. The whole time he'd had his hand to his eyes, wiping away falling tears. One look, and Wise set off reservedly crying. Mary tried to make sense of the gesture...

It was going to be an interesting term for Mary...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince the changes were all too subtle, Mary couldn't notice a hint of them. Not that she would, anyways.

Everything went alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes, quite!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, that's good. I'm glad, Mary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought about it now; had she really done <i>any</i> work at all during her first day? Only vague memories surfaced from the day before. Mary remembered the smiling \"doctor\" Norma, the room... Room? What had happened in that room? She couldn't remember a single thing about it... And after that, she was home, and slept again... Yeah, that's right, she'd slept during the day... Gosh, what had happened? Why couldn't she recall any of it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something on your mind, Mary?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yesterday. It felt like a breeze...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's understandable; the first day always feels so fast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And not just fast, I mean... I can't remember it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember it? Perhaps there was nothing to remember...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That could be the case...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean, of course it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, Mary got a control freak vibe from the way Doxon imposed his last remark. He struck her as the type to shut her trap around, especially about the memory lapse. Perhaps, he could even be involved? Yes, that made perfect sense. She gave him another once-over; despite his sexy exterior, he was a snake! But wait! Why was she making all these accusations now? She must have left one of those crime dramas on last night, and it lapsed over into her waking thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey... I just realized something,\" Mary said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... already knew my car was trashed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, wasn't it obvious?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My car was in my garage; I was standing out in front of the closed door. You... did that, didn't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis grin was ill-placed, and he turned with that sickening smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, it's true. I had them wreck your car so I could pick you up. Don't worry about the cost, you're covered by us and a replacement is en route.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're... a pretty smooth operator, Mr. Doxon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe proudly chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary curled her fingers around her thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, why did you pick me up?

He says it's something for company policy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWise handed Mary the most beautiful dress she'd ever seen before!

It had been the only seat left, and she was <i>not</i> going to stand in some crummy old bus! So, she took the stupid move: the seat. Needless to say, it wasn't long before one of those guys started to pay attention to Mary, in the exact wrong way. The jacket hadn't necessarily hid her new body from sight, only further suggested it. Naturally, the guy was interested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, little girl. Your first time on the bus?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer every instinct told her to just ignore the guy, he might get tired of her. The rest of her experience, mainly spawning from watching Cops, told her to get off the bus... <b>NOW</b>. But, the next stop wasn't for a couple of miles, and it would be downright idiotic to ask anymore of the driver than his job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Little girl, I'm talking to you! You don't look like you've been taught many manners...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neither do you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary swiveled towards the other man sitting next to her, who had just made the last remark. Something about him seemed kind of fishy, too, but right now he was focusing intently on the newspaper. That same newspaper obscured him from view. Unfortunately for Mary, the other guy was still trying to take advantage of her - no heed for the newspaper man's words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, as I was saying, when someone says hi to you, little girl...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Mary had her hands pinned up against the seat- the man's cold, ogre-like eyes peered straight into hers, no matter how she looked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You say <i>hello</i>, too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, the man made a pass on her, briskly unzipping the jacket. Mary wanted to holler, but his intense gaze trapped her! Could no one see what was going on! Her eyes darted around the other passengers, who were taking absolutely no heed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought I told you to mind your manners, <i>sir</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man next to her whapped Mary's attacker with the newspaper he'd been carrying, which made the other man very angry. He lunged at the newspaper man, who then struck him with his fist, and the attacker was unconcious. At that, the bus driver finally stopped the bus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on back there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, sir, this man on the ground here tried to attack this young lady next to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thank you sir! That's the perp!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of nowhere, seven of the passengers turned around and one pulled out a pair of handcuffs. The driver walked up to the newspaper man, and shook his hand. He and the others were really cops!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've been trying to catch this bastard for weeks now! Thanks to you, we finally got him! The police force offers you our humblest gratitude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the cop tipped his hat, and the officers left the bus, where another bus driver came on: the real one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Mary glimpsed up at her savior.

Something fishy was afoot, and she wouldn't be the one to miss out on it!

You've had your nice little nap, I've had my nice little chat. Let's continue where we started in my room...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!! What do you mean?

She picked up a little note in the compartment, which read, \"A Token of our Thanks, the Agency.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe almost pinched herself, to make sure she wasn't dreaming! It was almost the best day ever! She felt like jumping around like the people who win the lottery, but it seemed a little too stupid for the occasion. Needless to say, Mary jumped in her souped-up car, and sped off towards the Agency.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she got there, she didn't even need to ask the receptionist where to go anymore. It seems she'd already guessed at Mary's arrival, and pointed her finger towards the conference hall, as usual. Wise met her up in the hall. He was aghast!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that... thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grimaced at the jacket, and Mary flushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's my brother's jacket...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, why in the <i>world</i> are you wearing his jacket?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary knew it would come out sooner or later, so she unzipped the jacket to show Wise.

For some reason, Mr. Doxon has told me to give you <i>this</i> jacket.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWise handed Mary the most beautiful jacket she'd ever seen before! She muffled herself before she squealed with delight, and wore it with pride.

She knew it would probably look bad on her reputation to bring such a scummy car to such a high-scale place of business, but right now image wasn't a matter. And yet, Mary sat in the car with one of her most expensive, and tight, outfits on. She was dressed to impress, obviously, so she hoped it might take a bit of the edge off of her nasty old car. Doxon's words suddenly came back to her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please wear baggy clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid it matter? She was now really worried. Because, should it matter, Mary would be in an even worse position! Nearly late, in a ratty car, <i>and</i> forgetting her new boss's specific instructions? Mary wanted to slump her head, but right now she had more important issues: keeping on the road!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, Mary found her way again without any trouble, and managed to get to the building at exactly 9:31. She could already imagine her new boss yelling at her, probably worse than the chew-out Wise, his assistant, had gotten yesterday. She quietly worked her way into the conference room, as per her new schedule, for the meeting with all the new employees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWise found her outside the room, and ushered her in with exasperation. She hoped, for Heaven's sake, they weren't waiting on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey weren't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary found herself surrounded by people she'd never seen before, but all of them were gorgeous, beautiful. Well, most of them. There were a few people Mary wondered if she should even be in the same room as, for they <i>had</i> to be applying for something other than modeling! She kept her laughs to herself, and attentively looked towards the front of the room after sitting down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoxon walked in onto a platform, and spoke into a microphone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings, new employees!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary was still bedazzled by that smile of his. 'Focus,' she reminded herself with a little slap on her leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Today, for most of you, is your first day in employment under the Agency's name. We thank you, for arriving on time, dressing appropriately, <i>not</i> fidgeting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked Mary right in the eye; he'd caught her right in the act of slapping herself back on task. Doxon raised an eyebrow. Mary gave a nervous giggle, and shyed away after seeing everyone else glaring at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, if you please, you've been assigned a section to go to. Please look at the tickets my assistant, Mr. Wise, gave you at the door.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary sat confused for a second, and then noticed a piece of paper laying between her fingers. She pulled it up to her face to read it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Longfield, MARY. Room 15-7, Floor 17.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is your temporary pass card. Don't lose it, please, ladies. Wise will organize you into groups, and the representatives of each group will come and take you to the appropriate floor and room number. And so, I bid you farewell, and good luck!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary watched Doxon walk away- Wow, he looked amazing today. She took another quick peek at her ticket, and gulped. It was a long way up to floor 17...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust out of the corner of her eye, Mary caught a glance of someone coming up to her.

Wise escorted them into the elevator, as the 10 of them easily fit (including Wise).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one spoke a word as they entered Room 15-7.

These custom built stalls work a little like showers, but please don't confuse them for one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorma laughed at her stupid joke, which none of the girls, or Mary, thought was funny. <i>Huh</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please sit down your own stall, and no pushing, please. Once you are seated, please tie up your hair or clip it back, keeping hair out of the face and away from your neck. There will be a pair of opaque goggles next to you, please don them with haste. And once you are in the stall, please do not leave for any reason. It would be a good idea to go to the bathroom now if you must.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, nobody decided to go, so Norma nervously began ushering in the girls. A relatively young looking \"pretty\", the same from before, was speaking to Norma. The girl seemed distressed, but weren't they all? Mary decided to go and sit in her stall, bored. Before she even made a step, Norma stopped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you're completely ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why wouldn't I be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this process takes a while, and you might want to consider something a bit more... comfortable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorma made a gesture to her clothes.

By the by, should you make the decision to change, you'll find spare clothes in the bathrooms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl turned to Mary, who groaned. Hearing such, the girl's pretty eyes squeezed up with tears, and then Mary turned a sympathetic eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, hey. It's okay. I'm sorry. I'm Mary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Evangeline.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young girl Evangeline still wept, and Mary wandered off highly confused.

Uneasiness settled in again as Mary's lips turned to crinkled plastic wrap, and she only got worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer neck shortened, and she could see the starts of a nasty double chin. Luckily, the baggy clothes hid from Mary's view the thing she feared most. In mere seconds, Mary lost all womanly dignity worked for these 17 long years. Now, at least, she didn't have to suffer through her old shirt becoming completely unwearable before her eyes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary watched in horror as even more gas poured out of the tanker. She lost the tone of years trying to stay supremely skinny, and the news didn't lighten up as the transformation broadened her once non-existent hips. As Mary refused to look in the mirror in front of her, she couldn't help but imagine the gruesome process she experienced throughout her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, the transformation took a turn for the worst, as Mary started to shrink farther and farther away from the pod's ceiling. She cried tears of pure sadness; it had taken her whole life to reach 5' 5\", and now she barely reached the fifth foot. Mary's whining seemed to be useful for one thing - Norma told the girls they could now leave the pods. The doors' locks simultaneously unhinged, and Mary pushed out her door. She tried to make an exit, but mobbed by the other girls, who had become even uglier than she, Mary couldn't spot the door she came in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls, girls! Calm down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorma desperately attempted to overpower the gripes of the girls! The mob of transformed uglies wouldn't shut up! To silence them, Norma pressed a button! A piercing buzz filled the girl's ears as Norma safely wore headphones. So, the now silent room filled with Norma's instructions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This has been your only official task for the day, but Mr. Doxon requests that you girls find rooms here in the building. It's not like your nasty little faces can go back home any time soon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorma's once cheery little laugh became a hag-like cackle, and the sheepish girls sobbed under her terrible reign. Mary focused upon other things, desperate to not become completely lost and under Norma's control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, single-file, please, and follow me out. If you're lucky, we'll offer you a couple of meals!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of the girls understood what they must do, so they followed Norma because they lacked otherwise. Left alone in the other room were Mary and a strangely tiny girl...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello? Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I <b>LOOK</b> OKAY?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small face peeked up from behind hands, and Mary recognized it as Evangeline, the worried little princess from before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Evangeline? It's me, Mary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-mary?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvangeline cried harder as Mary tried to comfort her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got to get home, Mary. I can't stay here. Not with that witch around... Please, you have to help me! You can drive, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvangeline's sorrowful eyes struck a cord in Mary's heart.

Perhaps she could just call one of her friends to pick up the car...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey drove on for miles, and reached a thicket of trees. Evangeline assured Mary that her house was now only a few miles away, and Mary gave out a glad sigh. Something in her envisioned Evangeline as a little rich girl; the long road supported that idea. What had made that girl go into the city to get a job? Evangeline motioned towards the right, and Mary turned into the suberbly hidden driveway. The house that met her eyes paralleled the beauty that Evangeline had once exuded. Now, it seemed to mock the poor girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be stopping here, Mary. Thank you, for driving me home...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary then realized the biggest problem. She couldn't get home, because that car belonged to Evangeline...

He took the taxi to his home, and now it's yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary's bewilderment wouldn't cease! What had made the previous owner quit? She was really confused...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, if you're worried about it, you could come inside while I find you an appropriate ride home. I mean, of course you shouldn't just take gifts from strangers, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvangeline's words were true; but Mary would be expected at home...</span></div></div>",

As Mary refused to look in the mirror in front of her, she couldn't help but imagine the gruesome process she experienced throughout her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, the transformation took a turn for the worst, as Mary started to shrink farther and farther away from the pod's ceiling. She cried tears of pure sadness; it had taken her whole life to reach 5' 5\", and now she barely reached the fifth foot. Mary's whining seemed to be useful for one thing - Norma told the girls they could now leave the pods. The doors' locks simultaneously unhinged, and Mary pushed out her door. She tried to make an exit, but mobbed by the other girls, who had become even uglier than she, Mary couldn't spot the door she came in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls, girls! Calm down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorma desperately attempted to overpower the gripes of the girls! The mob of transformed uglies wouldn't shut up! To silence them, Norma pressed a button! A piercing buzz filled the girl's ears as Norma safely wore headphones. So, the now silent room filled with Norma's instructions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This has been your only official task for the day, but Mr. Doxon requests that you girls find rooms here in the building. It's not like your nasty little faces can go back home any time soon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorma's once cheery little laugh became a hag-like cackle, and the sheepish girls sobbed under her terrible reign. Mary focused upon other things, desperate to not become completely lost and under Norma's control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, single-file, please, and follow me out. If you're lucky, we'll offer you a couple of meals!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of the girls understood what they must do, so they followed Norma because they lacked otherwise. Left alone in the other room were Mary and a strangely tiny girl...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello? Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I <b>LOOK</b> OKAY?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small face peeked up from behind hands, and Mary recognized it as Evangeline, the worried little princess from before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Evangeline? It's me, Mary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-mary?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvangeline cried harder as Mary tried to comfort her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got to get home, Mary. I can't stay here. Not with that witch around... Please, you have to help me! You can drive, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvangeline's sorrowful eyes struck a cord in Mary's heart. She had to help the girl, but Norma would be coming back soon... What should she do?</span></div></div>",

And I was wondering if we had the same room. I mean, I've been asking everyone, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary zoned out as the boring girl droned on and on about it. Even now, she couldn't believe someone like this had gotten through Doxon's rigorous process. She was half-tempted to tell the girl that she was in the wrong room, just to be rid of her. But, Mary knew that if she said that, it was all downhill. So, she let the girl prattle endlessly; it was all she could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, Wise came back into the room and held up a cue card, which read \"Room 15-7, Floor 17\". Mary knew it was hers, and quickly headed over into the line. Her fellow members of room 15-7, however, weren't the greatest of picks. In fact, each one of the girls was horrendously hideous, and Mary interally shriveled to imagine herself even in the same group as these ugly girls. But, she sighed in submission: the job was more important. All of the gross girls and Mary boarded the elevator (after all, there were only 7 or 8 of them, excluding Wise) and rode all the way up to floor 17. Mary was squeamish around heights, but she feared showing any signs of weakness would flock the geeks to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen at last the girls reached the top floor, Mary felt a very unknown finger prod her shoulder. She had the oddest premonition it was someone she hadn't wished was in her room...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's you! Yay! I'm so glad. You remember me, right, Darcy, from downstairs! I'm so happy we have the same room! That must mean we'll be...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarcy gasped like a complete idiot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>modeling</i> together!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarcy did a little leap of joy, and Mary groaned. Just then, Wise began to push the girls into a room of complete white, where a grinning Chinese woman met them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, girls. My name is Dr. Chin, but please call me Norma, they all do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis woman had a giggling problem, and was always smiling. Mary gave her the once-over, and knew her over-eager type. This was going to be interesting...</span></div></div>",

These custom built stalls work a little like showers, but please don't confuse them for one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorma laughed at her stupid joke, which must have been effective because the other frumpy girls began to laugh to. The awkward group made Mary <i>extremely</i> uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please sit down your own stall, and no pushing, please. Once you are seated, please tie up your hair or clip it back, keeping hair out of the face and away from your neck. There will be a pair of opaque goggles next to you, please don them with haste.

It would be a good idea to go to the bathroom now if you must.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, at least 5 of the girls made a rush for the bathroom door, and Mary was left alone with Darcy and Norma. Darcy was already giggling and laughing with the older woman, and Mary decided to go and sit in her stall. But before she even made a step, Norma stopped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you <i>sure</i> you're completely ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why wouldn't I be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this process takes a while, and you might want to consider something a bit more comfortable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorma made a gesture to her clothes.

They became even more slender, and her horrible sunburn from the week before all but disappeared into an even tone. Her hair plumed out from the sides, and the platinum color washed out like rain as Mary's natural golden brunette returned. As she looked across from her, Mary noticed the full length mirror in the pod for the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary watched in complete awe as her awful acne disappeared and her complexion became utter perfection. To compare, imagine airbrushing, on a live scale. Mary's face lost any flaws, and for the first time she saw a truly beautiful her. The changes continued on, going down from her head. Her neck lengthened a bit, and her shoulders creeped in a little. Mary's biggest shock was when her new \"assets\" came in. The onset came by complete surprize, and Mary envisaged the next step. The fabric of the loose T-shirt stretched and stretched, but not a single tear. Fortunately, she had listened to Norma!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe changes delved down further as Mary noticed her elongating waist. It had always been abnormally short, but now it had reached a beauteous height. Mary sprinkled herself in the misting fog now; it brought insane euphoria upon her! Mary noticed the tip of her nose stretching to mere centimeters of the blast hole now, as her legs rocketed her up to probably near 6 feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary thought to herself, \"I'm really going to be a model!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Mary's nose got close enough to the emitter, she took in a full deep breath of it.

Mary thought she was going to pass out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, Norma gave the all clear, and the doors unlocked and opened. Mary stepped out, and for the first time ever had to duck her head. Back in the room, she stared at the other girls exiting the stalls. Each of them looked like cutouts from magazines! Just like she did!

He dreamt of playing pirates with Jake and friends, exploring Neverland, and outwitting Captain Hook. Dillon was there with him. It was a wonderful dream. He smiled and hugged Skully even closer. It just felt so warm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe warmth flowed through him. All his troubles melted away as he dreamed of swimming in the ocean with his \u201cbabysitter\u201d Dillon. Happily splashing in the water, building sandcastles, and looking for treasure. As Greg slept, he didn\u2019t notice the warmth growing in his diaper. It started out as a trickle at first, but gradually became a stream. The front of the diaper was getting soaked. Greg didn\u2019t care. He was sleeping too soundly to feel it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed like Greg\u2019s stream wasn\u2019t slowing down soon. He didn\u2019t need to pee before he started napping, but for some reason his body couldn\u2019t stop now. He mumbled and shifted lazily in the crib as the warm dampness continued to spread, dying the thick diaper around his waist a pale yellow. He was wetting so much that the thick, puffy diaper couldn\u2019t contain it, and soon, some of the urine started leaking out onto the mattress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his dream, he was sitting in a tide pool with Dillon; happily splashing around. He was wearing the cutest swim diaper and Dillon was wearing his big boy swim trunks with pictures of Spider-Man on them. The two of them just playing in the warmth. Suddenly Dillon looked at him, and suddenly kissed Greg on the lips. Greg loved it and kissed back. The boys were soon hugging and kissing each other deeply while laying in the small pool of water together. Greg felt something funny in his crotch. He rubbed it, sending more ripples of pleasure through his body. It started to feel hard, and was only getting stiffer with Dillon\u2019s kissing and cuddling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDillon noticed Greg groping his crotch and giggled, \u201cHere, let me do that.\u201d, before he started rubbing Greg\u2019s groin for him. \u201cM-Mistah Dillon\u2026 P-Peepee hard\u2026\u201d Greg moaned, both in his dream and in his sleep. Dillon smiled, \u201cIt\u2019s supposed too. Boys\u2019 peepees get hard when they\u2019re happy. Just keep touching it, it feels soooo good!\u201d Dillon continued groping him while Greg sat there and softly moaned. He could feel some sort of pressure building up inside of him, something leaking out and making stickies in his swim diaper. \u201cMmmph\u2026!! D-Dillon, peepee\u2026 C-Cumming!!\u201d He gasped as he came into his diaper. In real life, Greg ejaculated suddenly and drew in a breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDillon patting him on his shoulder, smiling warmly, had waked him up. \u201cWake up big guy, time for lunch!\u201d Greg grinned. \u201cMistah Dillon!\u201d As Dillon helped him out of the crib, he saw just how heavily used his diaper had been during his nap and giggled, \u201cLooks like someone had an accident.\u201d Greg blushed sheepishly as he suddenly became aware of his soggy diaper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDillon led Greg to the changing table again and got him a new diaper. \u201cBoy, you sure did wet a lot, huh?\u201d Greg nodded, \u201cI hadda goo\u2019 dweam Dillon! We were at Jakes, n\u2019 Nevalan\u2019 an\u2019 we played an\u2019 \u2018den\u2026\u201d Greg babbled childishly about his dream to Dillon, who just smiled and nodded, \u201c\u2026An\u2019 \u2018den we were in a pool and it was soooo warm, an\u2019 \u2018den we kissed and cuddled an\u2019 it felt weally good!!! \u2018An\u2019 \u2018den I woke up.\u201d Dillon chuckled as he changed him, \u201cSounds like you had a really good dream.\u201d Greg nodded excitably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he was finished changing him, Dillon led Greg to the kitchen and sat his big, poofy butt down in a high chair, \u201cWait here, I\u2019ll go get you something to eat!\u201d Dillon grinned as he went over to the fridge. Greg kicked his legs and buzzed his lips in excitement. He was starving. Dillon opened the door and looked inside for some food for the both of them.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He heard the robbers again, hobbling back down the stairs; time to go!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDillon and Gary made their way through the tunnel, and came out in the elderly neighbor's lawn. In fact, that same neighbor happened to spray them down with water! They explained their story quickly, and the neighbor turned up their hearing aid. Of course they hadn't noticed before! So, now all that waited was for them to stay safe until the police arrived... Which they did, within the next five minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe robbers didn't have the smarts to leave once their two hostages had, so of course the police caught them right as they went back out the window.

For that, it came to no surprise that Gary was fired from his job at the movieplex, and cut classes to the point where most people didn't know his name. Alas, it was same old, same old...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he got home, he found a note left by his mother...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gary,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's been a really hard time on your mother. I've gone up to Florida to relax for a while. Please keep up the house while I'm gone for the next month or so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nP.S. It's not your fault.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreat! His own mother had left him, too. The woman couldn't stay in one state for more than a week or two. Then again, she hadn't really taken any time to herself since Dad left...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne look at the house erased Gary's notions of sympathy. How could she just leave the house to him? It hadn't been a week since the last time he'd watched a house, and look where that ended up! Gary sighed, and planted himself on the couch. It was too much work! Just as he hit the power button, the phone rang. He disregarded it. Probably a wrong number. After a few more minutes, the phone rang again! What was this? Finally, the phone chimed a third time, and Gary meandered over towards it. He picked up the receiver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hello, is this Gary, Gary Tahel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, yes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Gary! We just can't thank you enough for that last time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was none other than the Ramseys. He groaned to himself. Why were they calling about this <i>now</i>?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were wondering, Gary, if we could call on you again for something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuh? They wanted him to do another job? Not gonna happen! He had one house to take care of, that was enough!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, we're going out of town. We just need someone to watch Dillon and the cat while we're gone. The house is fine, we installed a new security system after you left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you fix the problem with the doors?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, never mind... I'm sorry, Mrs. Ramsey, I can't really do that right now. You see, I'm watching my own house...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Where do you live? We could drop off Dillon and the cat at your house!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wait---!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on, I just remembered, we have your address!

Gary grinned, and wondered what kind of power the cat had given him... Hold on, the cat? What kind of power could a cat give? He thought he was just dreaming, but holding that cats-eye necklace, which was solid, made him ponder. What was going to happen?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe robbers decided that for him, and showed up!

He felt hot and itchy all over, like thousands of bugs where crawling under his skins. <i>w-what did that cat give me...</i> he thought to himself. Dimly he could hear the robbers coming closer but he was more concerned with the sudden tightness in his clothes. He panted lookin over him self groaning as he sees rips and tears appear in his clothes, underneath his skin taking on a rather red bumpy look. He shifted around hearing one of the robbers suddenly let out a loud curse, slamming the kitchen door shut, and somehow hearing their cursing despite the kitchen door being solid oak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary was more concerned on how his hands had taken on a beastly look, the fingertips growing into thick claws scoring deep gauges into the kitchen floor. His pinky and ring finger fusing together leaving him with 4 large long digits on a rather big paw. Gary gasped again studying his new paws as he felt his nose pull forward into a snout and his clothes finally rip unable to take the stress, revealing his new scale covered muscular body. Stumbling around the kitchen creating untold damage, he attempted to look over himself as the changes kept coming faster, two wings sprouting from his back and practically punctuating themselves on the ceiling before folding and settling themselves on his back. A tail grew from his behind quickly reaching over four feet in length, whipping around wildly, causing some kitchen appliances to crash to the floor before settling down behind him swaying softly as Gary finds his new equilibrium on all fours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon a tall slender adolescent dragon was laying in the kitchen instead of a sixteen year old boy. Red scales gleaming on his hide, shimmering with every single gulp of breath he took. A red fin was on his head leading down to a spikey spine going down his neck, back and ending as tiny nubs on the end of his tail. His wings were curled tightly into his side, unable to stretch out into the tight confines of the kitchen. Gary licked around in his mouth feeling the now predator like canines and needle sharp teeth that now filled his mouth. He then noticed to his surprise that his tongue was now forked. With shock and a bit of amusement he flicked his tongue out tasting the air, mostly tasting his own sweat, the cat, and the robbers... THE ROBBERS. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary gave a sudden start, remembering the thieves that were just beyond the oak door. He scrambled to his feet creating some more scratches within the floor as he heard the robbers end their argument, the sound of a gun's safety coming off sounding like a death toll to his new ears. Gary gave a soft whimper feeling as if his heart was going to hammer straight up his throat and that his chest was heated up almost boiling him.. Infact his chest felt like it was burning up, fire starting deep in under his diaphragm and working its way up his esophagus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n He gave a loud groan which soon built into a roar, fire streaming out of his mouth and to the door that was just beginning to open, blasting it closed and making the robbers on the other side yell in fear, scrambling to get away from the door which grew super heated and charred. Taking a deep breath the fire stream suddenly dribbling from his mouth, smoke streaming from his nostrils, Gary gazes in amazement at the destruction he caused, the door practically ash now, falling off the hinges that was dripping off the door-frame, crackling and smoking. Beyond he could see the two robbers whom where unconscious and beyond them poor Dillion tied to a chair and looking at Gary in a mix of wonder and fear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Gary... </span></div></div>",

You'll be older and younger, but you'll still have plenty of energy and<br>\r\n<br>\r\nwon't have the side effects of being a particular older age for the most part, though some of the younger ages may not be so easy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just think of it as adventure, and we all take care of each other around here.

Well then, you'll love the next changes.

You dare not try running away again, in this girlish body you weren't going to get anywhere. \"Well well well, someone's a bit disobedient aren't they? Go get changed, you'll find your new working clothes in the closet over there. Report to your desk outside when you're done.\" As he left, you did as you were told. Heading over to the closet, you pulled off your clothes. Looking inside, you found a little black dress as well as a lingerie set. You pulled on the push up bra and matching panties set. The push up made your D cup breasts form two perfect round shapes. Having trouble with the tightness, you manage to pull on the dress. Finally, you slip on the tall pumps that also came with the outfit. Looking in a mirror, you could see the black dress was tight all around, and had a low cut. The form of your breasts was easily visible at the top of the dress. As well, the dress also had an open back, which made it feel a bit breezy. The dress barely made it up to your knees. Not wanting to be punished again, you reluctantly head for your desk. It was a typical secretaries desk. Sitting down, Mr. Whiteman came over. </span></div></div>",

To be honest Olivia I'm suprised how quickly Robert and Sofia have taken to you, they both love you to bits... And thank for looking after them the other day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are a natural Olivia... You'll make a brilliant mother one day...

Looking up at Myra she smiles and says, \u201cWanna play with my dollies Mywa?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving outgrown dolls ages ago Myra saw nothing especially fun about them, but since it was her job to make the child happy she smilingly agreed to play with the dolls. At first she only went through the motions, feigning interest in the games they were playing, but soon enough she found herself completely engrossed in what they were doing. Meanwhile, Stephanie found the dolls less interesting by the minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAren\u2019t dolls fun Stephie?!\u201d exclaimed Myra giddily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMMM, I guess, but I wanna do sometin else Mywa,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww, but I wanted to play with the dolls, they\u2019re so pretty and fun,\u201d says Myra with a pout. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wan you to wead me a book Mywa!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh alright Stephie, I\u2019ll read you a book,\u201d acquiesced Myra as she got up and selected a book from a nearby shelf. She sat back down and Stephanie on her lap, between the book and her chest. She opened up the book, but when she tried to read it she found that she couldn\u2019t understand it, it looked like gibberish to her. She rubbed her eyes to see if that helped, but it wasn\u2019t her eyes, she could still see perfectly, but she couldn\u2019t read. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wong Mywa?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh nothing sweetie, I\u2026I just can\u2019t read this book, I think it\u2019s in another language or something,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo it\u2019s not, it says Wittle Wed Widdin\u2019 Hood. Want me to wead it to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, ok Stephie, go ahead,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little girl started reading the book with ease, while Myra listened entranced by the word, unable to read a single word but lost in the story. As the story progressed little Stephanie started to speak more like an adult then a little girl, pronouncing the words perfectly. When she finally said, \u201cThe End,\u201d Myra jumped up, got another book and handed it to Stephanie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWead me anothew stowy Stephie,\u201d said Myra, unaware that she now talked like a little girl. Myra was once again spellbound as Stephanie read her a story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA while later, Myra felt a familiar pressure in her bowels and, like before, she was unable to control it.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The door opens and a fifty year old is standing there with the dog at her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, you must be Myra. I'm sure you heard my dear Peanut barking before. I need to get going, all the information you need is in the kitchen. Bye my little sweety, Mommy will be back later!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman hustled out the door without even introducing herself. Myra is now alone with this Beagle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi there Peanut!\" Myra says as she starts to scratch the long ears of the dog. Peanut happily sits, panting, looking up at Myra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, sometimes I wish I could be just like you. Being cared for all day, not having to worry about finding a job or a boyfriend or anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter this, Myra stood up and walked toward the kitchen.

She tried as much as she could and even though her human half of her mind knew it was pointless, her canine half overpowered and kept her thinking of how 'it's fun' and to hope that it will happen soon. Later on, Myra got tired and tried to lay like how dogs would, but to no avail. Myra, defeated, laid on her side  and let her now fully flat canine tongue hang to the side of her mouth and pant. <i>What's next?</i> she tried to say, but her new tongue prevented her from doing so, so all she managed to say was, \"Bark bark!!\" Peanut smiled that Myra still wanted to go through with the changes.</span></div></div>",

When asked what the woman wanted as payment for the sale of the reusable scrap, she stated, \"Nothing, just rid the world of that terrible place!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin knew of the Hayworth castle, it a large red sandstone building, three stories tall, and several thousand square feet built into each floor. It would hold a wealth of rich rare metals used to build it, as well marble slabs for steps and some interior walls. He signed the contract of promise to raze the building to the ground level and back fill then the basement with sand and topsoil to remove any reminder the building had ever stood on the land.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the woman dressed n black turned and was walking out his office, Kevin thought he noticed something of her dress dragging along the floor. He being a gentleman, rushed to take hold of it and then tell the kind woman as to her dress was touching the floor. What he touched made the woman turn quickly and stop walking, she stood looking down at Kevin, as he kneeling was looking up at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not try to disgrace me by touching me in an improper way!\" The woman said in a demanding tone of voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" Kevin said to her, \"I saw something dragging across the floor, a hem of your dress perhaps, it might have caught in a closing door and caused you to trip and fall, I would not wish that no matter what!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mind you own self,\" the woman replied, as she hoisted higher her dress an inch or two as turned and walked out the office, as this time and from where Kevin had knelt what he saw then better was a hairy switch, as found or part of, being the end to an animal tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, but you have a tail!\" Kevin said, he seeing, knowing what he saw, and she having demeaned him, rich contract or no, he would call a spade a spade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman dressed in black stopped walking, she turned quickly as if on one heel of her shoe to face toward Kevin. \"So, I have a tail, if that is not an insult than nothing more need be said about you working at the castle, I decide the contract is null and void.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin stood up, he turned to his desk and picked up the contract he had just signed, but then ruined the mutual trust, and was about to hand it back to the woman when he saw what was dragging on the floor swish to one side as if it had the ability to move of its own accord. Seeing this oddity, Kevin knelt and reaching for the odd item, the woman bade said for him to stop, not touch, or she would...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a handhold of the then realized hairy switch, Kevin slipped his hand along the attached bony structure of the warm as living appendage, his hand following up as under her long dress to where he touched her flat muscular behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe this was your tail dragging across the floor, cute, a woman with a cow tail, should make for some interesting conversation.\" Kevin said, this time with a smile as if the woman were a weirdo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly her eyes blazed a wild eyed stare at Kevin. He saw her eyes being bright yellow, glaring at him from under her black broad rimmed hat and the netting she had covering her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bold you are, too bold to remain a man, bold enough to walk a pasture, bold too of worth to be the herd sire, then such should be that you, become beginning now then a bull worthy of his salt from being diligent to his herd, then farm owner, and feeling demeaned, different from what he was born!\" She said, she laying her curse upon Kevin, wishing to doom as damn him for his insolent attitude.</span></div></div>",

She trod up the familiar steps, a little teary-eyed. Once, long ago, this had been her home, too. Where her younger brothers had grown up, and then left forever. Where, oh so long ago, she had been like these young children, alone, without family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria looked far beyond her 51 years of age. Most of her friends joked around with her, calling her the \"Old Granny\" of the group. She lacked the confidence and happiness to keep her youth with her, and she felt extremely embarassed to be asking for a job involving children. They'd probably just torment her, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut being around children made her feel young again, too. It was the reason she'd worked so hard in the school system. But now, retired from teaching, she just wanted to be among those she loved to see everyday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria rung the bell, and as a surprise, Mr. Grant himself answered the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Herman Grant was the nephew of one of Victoria's oldest friends, and through such friend did she find out about this job. He was youthful, too, perhaps not even 30 yet, but he struck everyone he met as the most eccentric person possible. Because of his humor and good nature, the kids stuck to him like glue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrant welcomed in Victoria, and already she felt happier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The children are all in the back yard right now, so I thought it might be a good time to explain the job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Victoria said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked into the kitchen, and sat down across from each other. With a very serious face on the otherwise jolly man, Victoria knew to take him seriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been trying to get this one kid to settle down and play with the others, y'see. The kid won't listen to me, or any of the others. So I heard that you used to work with students like that, and I thought, 'Huh, well I'll get her to work for me!' And so, I'm hoping that maybe you can relate to the kid, help 'em out, make 'em happy, y'know? And about the pay... It comes at the end of every week, and it's about $50 an hour. Sound good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n$50 an hour? This Grant might really be crazy, to pay that much for such a simple job. But Victoria wasn't going to complain, she was very excited now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is this child? Can I meet them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sure! His/her name is...\"</span></div></div>",

With my aunt's guidance I came to this orphanage with the intent to turn these poor kids into happy adults. If no one wants to adopt a kid anymore, why not just boost them into adulthood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria remembered the times she wished for something similar when she was growing up in the orphanage. She was practically a mother to her younger brothers growing up and she often dreamed she would suddenly transform into an sexy independent woman and raise her own brothers as adorable sons. That would have been a  good life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why haven't you?\" Victoria asked, \"I'm sure a bully like Claire would love you for that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrant grimaced, \"Because she doesn't have a future.

Not a reality that should be merged with a young child.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So the offer for me to come here....\" Victoria was beginning to understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to bring some good back into the orphanage, If I can pull some of the past into the present I can weave the timelines and hopefully influence a brighter future for the kids here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then you'll grow them into adults.\" Victoria stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If they want to.\" Grant said. \"And that goes for you too. I can't really pay you $50 an hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?' I'm here for a job Herman. I expect payment!\" she yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what better payment is there than getting your youth back? You help me with Alicia and Claire and you get to be young all over again. But you'll be a child Victoria, I'll have to allocate resources to feed and care for you just like the others. I'm on a low budget as it is.\" Granted stressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her heart Victoria wanted to be a kid again, it was embarrassing to admit but she took Grant's fantasy as gospel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To be a girl again.....It would be something else for me.\" Victoria said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should be sure about this. You'll keep your consciousness and your memories but lose everything else to your past self.

Her sagging breasts, perked up before then retreating body back into her chest. Her greying hair gained color and grew into a shoulder length cut.

I'm just asking for something a little more mature than 2. And this girl, it's not like she has a criminal record! Her only problem is she has no one to reach out to her. From the way she was speaking, I'm pretty sure she's the only one her age around here. And the only one with a phone, too. That means she'd have to be pretty special. So, let me get to know her, and I'll see what I can do about her attitude. Get us on the same level, and it'll work out fine. No crazy regression!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria stammered the last words, and Grant broke out into that eccentric smile of his. He jumped up to shake Victoria's hand, and the offer was settled on $100 an hour.

And now, he was finally applying for retirement, on the social front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJ.D. Hanson crocked his head properly upon his head again, and shifted his eyes around as if he was John Wayne. He walked up to the youthful clerk, who'd just peed his pants seeing the man himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Son, you might wanna watch that, next time you're calling up for interviews.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Hanson shook the terrified clerk's hand, and slipped into the next room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, waiting at the table, sat the Mystery Man. A collector Hanson had been familiar with in the world of animal bounty. If there was a price on it, you could bet the Mystery Man had a req out on it. <br>\r\n(req is slang for request in this story.) Hanson hadn't wanted to fool around with this shady guy, but after the terrible outcome of his last hunt, he had no choice. The Mystery Man offered him a price that no man could ignore in Hanson's position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Hanson, so nice to finally see you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Mystery Man's voice was distorted, but J.D. knew he'd met the man in the flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was sure you wouldn't refuse the offer. The price is high enough for even the Huntsmaster himself...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the Mystery Man laid out a briefcase. Business type...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Inside that briefcase is every batch of info you could ever want about your prey. Common locations, last sightings, etc. Plus, a couple hundred to get you around. Couldn't leave that <i>all</i> up to you, could I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Mystery Man laughed devilishly. Hanson himself feared the Man might be ol' Red himself, come to snatch his title back from the elderly J.D.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your mission begins in 24, if you can handle it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanson glared at the Mystery Man.

He knew that he had summer break and all that, but he wanted to get some good job experience before hitting the books again the very next semester. It was with this in mind that he began job searching. However, many places were full, and he was unable to get many offers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as he was looking around the internet, he found a Help Wanted to help around the Johnson Farm just outside of town. It wasn't that far away from his house, and it seemed to pay well as well. His family seemed to agree with the idea, although his younger sister found the idea of him working on a farm to be pretty funny, something that even he laughed a bit at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, the very next day, he was driving off to the Johnson Farm, making the 1 hour trip out there. The road got a bit rocky as he got closer, and soon enough, he found a tiny parking lot there, but he imagined meant that they didn't usually have large crowds here for whatever reason. Anyway, he parked his car where he figured was a good spot to stop and got out of the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked up to the house nearby, knocking on the door gently. As he waited, he looked down at his attire. A simple red t-shirt, some jeans, and his work shoes. The ad said to dress casually, given the work on the farm, so he took that to heart. Soon enough, an older man opened the door, smiling at Robert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello son, I'm Ken Johnson. Come on in.\" he smiled. He welcomed Robert in, showing Robert a bit of the inside of the house. He talked a bit about the job, saying that he was glad that someone took up the offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you think you can do it?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course sir.\" said Robert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Glad to hear it.\" said Robert before taking something out of his pocket. \"I'm going out for a while now, so I'll need you to take care of things. There are instructions about how to do things, and it's pretty easy. This here is a little something as a thanks from me. No, go on and take it. I don't take no for an answer.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thing was a tiny necklace, not really special in any way, but Robert imagined that it might not be a bad idea, so he took the necklace with a smile, thanking the man. After that, Ken excused himself to go do some errands. He didn't say when he would come back, so Robert was apparently alone for now. Absentmindedly, he clasped the tiny necklace around his neck. Right as it happened, he felt a tiny surge go through him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" he asked, looking around. \"Oh well, guess it was just the wind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf only he knew.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Robert took a quick look around the house. It was a pretty rustic, old looking farm house, the types you would see in those old movies about farmers trying to save their land. Robert kind of liked it. He lived in the city for all of his life, and he never really got out to the country much. He started to think about how he wouldn't mind staying out here in his future. He didn't really have anything planned out. Maybe, eventually, a nice, long stay in the country might do him some good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert quickly realized that, while the house was interested, what he really wanted to check out at the moment was the backyard, the actual farm itself. Robert found his way through that house, and to the back door, which lead right out to the actual farm. Robert let out a bit of a gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe farm was pretty huge, even surpassing Robert's wildest imagination. It seemed like there were miles and miles of field, of grass, of crops. There was a large, red barn pretty close to the house, and many different pens full of various animals. Pigs, Sheep, Chickens, every single animal you could think of being on a farm, was on this farm. Even in the distance, Robert saw a bunch of cows grazing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then he noticed something a bit odd. One of the cows was very far away from the pack. In fact, one of the cows was grazing right next to the house. This struck Robert as a little odd. So he decided to walk out and say hello to this strange cow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert only had to take a couple of steps before reaching this cow, who was still grazing on the grass around the house. Robert stood right next to this cow and started petting her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there, girl. What are you doing out here?\" Robert said with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cow looked up, straight into Robert's eyes. Robert stared back. He was so entranced by this, that he didn't notice his necklace was starting to glow. Nor did he realize that the cowbell about this cow's neck also started to glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs both of the glows died down, the cow mooed at Robert, and went back to grazing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when Robert noticed the cowbell clanging around this cow's neck. Robert noticed there was an engraving on it, and took a closer look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bessie, huh? I guess that's your name. Well, Bessie. My name is Robert. I guess I'll be around to take care of you.\" Robert said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBessie looked up and mooed again.</span></div></div>",

Besides, she was just one of the many animals there. It was with that in mind that Robert waved a bit to Bessie and began to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bessie. Kind of a typical name.\" laughed Robert to himself. He shouldn't have been surprised though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, he looked at a lot of the other animals, which all seemed to be behaving normally. It was a good indicator of how Mr. Johnson ran the place, with it being so well organized even when he was away. The chickens ran back and forth in their little pen, while the pigs just laid out in the sun. It all seemed pretty peaceful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, from what I read, he already fed them today. Maybe I should take a look around the fields.\" he said to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he observed, the fields looked like they could go on for miles and miles, leaving plenty of room for the animals to graze and whatnot. Robert decided to take a short walk through the fields, choosing to get a good grasp of the farmland, especially since he was going to be working here and all. He wondered if he should tell his parents or his sister about this. She loved animals, after all. He made a mental note to call Sarah about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat aside, he walked through the fields until he was a good distance from where all the cows and others were grazing, and just admired how the small hills and green grass made for quite the scenery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those cows are lucky, having this much room to run around, even though they don't really run.\" he chuckled to himself. After a while, he was beginning to think that it might be time to head back, perhaps explore the house a bit more. However, as he did so, he could feel his stomach growling. Apparently, it was close to noon, and he was starting to get pretty hungry. However, this hunger felt a bit unusual, as if he was even hungrier than normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, how much room do I have in there to feel this hungry?\" he said to himself.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Robert slightly quickened his pace as he walked back across the field. This specific hunger hit him at an odd time. It almost came out of nowhere. When was the last time he had eaten? He thought back to eating breakfast back at his house, but that was only an hour and a half ago. We shouldn't be this hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo matter. If his body was telling him that he was hungry, he was hungry. And so he needed to find food. He was sure that he would find food somewhere in the house. And he was sure that Mr. Johnson wouldn't mind at all if he took something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, he had made it back across the farm, and towards the back of the house. Robert looked on to see Bessie still there, chomping down on the grass she was grazing on. Robert smiled, thinking about how much Bessie must be enjoying herself. Robert passed by Bessie and paused to look her over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoying yourself, Bessie?\" Robert smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBessie didn't pay attention, as she grazed some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be hungry too, huh?\" Robert asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, Bessie looked up at him and mooed, before eating some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert looked at Bessie once again, but this time, couldn't help but to sense something was... weird. There was something off... Did Bessie seem skinnier? Before, Robert had looked at Bessie as a perfectly healthy cow. But now, she seemed like she was a little, tiny bit smaller in weight. Not too much. But a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that why you must be eating so much. You need to get some weight. I'll leave you be, girl.\" Robert said, as he walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked towards the house, he ignored the chill in his body. He couldn't really have noticed that his belly grew just a little bit. But it did.</span></div></div>",

He found his way back to the kitchen, deciding to take a quick look through the cabinets and refrigerator. The house seemed to have everything a normal house would have, even some snacks and whatnot. However, despite the growling hunger in Robert's tummy, none of it seemed that appetizing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's weird. I feel hungry as heck, and yet, none of this looks good. And I usually like chips and crackers.\" he groaned to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was hardly what he expected to happen on the first day. What was wrong with his stomach for him to feel so hungry, and yet so unhungry at the sight of normal food. The very thought frustrated him. Eventually, he put his shoes back on and decided to head back outside. Might as well clear his head while he was at it. For some reason, being inside the house just seemed to irritate him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, the sun feels really nice.\" he said, ignoring his hunger for a second. \"Makes me want to stay outside all day. Heh, like that would ever happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took another look at Bessie as he was passing by, and something else seemed to catch his eye briefly. Was it just him, or was Bessie getting closer to his size or something? Her belly seemed smaller, including her udder. That didn't exactly seem normal to him at all. He raised an eyebrow as he observed the cow. Her behavior didn't seem to change at all though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For some reason, this doesn't feel too odd, even though it's clearly odd. What is going on here?\" he asked himself. He briefly looked down at the necklace he was wearing. It didn't look any different, but something felt off about it too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, his stomach practically roared at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooohhhh, so hungry.\" he groaned, clutching his stomach as he fell down on the grass.\" As he fell, he didn't get a good look, but his belly got a tiny bit bigger, causing his bellybutton to be seen beneath his shirt.</span></div></div>",

Or more specifically, he started to look at the grass. His eyes quickly locked onto the green grass sticking right up at his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, an urge came upon him. The first thought that came to his head was to just take a bite of the grass. To just grab it with his teeth and just chomp on it. That was weird, right? He shouldn't be having those thoughts as a rational human being, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet he couldn't get the thought out of his mind. He was hungry, and that grass looked a million times more appetizing than anything he had seen in the house. Robert struggled with it, but he couldn't help it anymore.

There was no natural way that she could fit through the door into the house. That was totally bizarre.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, his mind kept going back to the grass. The taste felt pretty good in his mouth as a matter of fact. The texture seemed perfect and the taste was simple. His stomach seemed to accept it just fine as a matter of fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, eating grass is totally weird, but my stomach seems to like it.\" he muttered to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leaned back down and grabbed another mouthful of grass, chomping it in his mouth. He continued to chomp and chomp, almost getting into a bit of a routine with it. Still,his hunger never seemed to subside, as if it was hardly filling him up. With that in mind, he continued to chomp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, this is pretty good. Maybe I should tell Sarah about this sometime.\" he said, not realizing how odd it was for him to be pondering telling his younger sister about eating grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, back to the matter at hand, he eventually sat up on his legs, letting that batch of grass digest a bit. For some reason, it tasted better than any normal lunch he had, which was nice in a way. There was grass everywhere, so a diet of that would go forever. Still, the thought of eating just grass sounded strange to him, even as he stood up and tried to make sense of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as he did, he felt a little plompy on his belly. He looked down and gasped a bit as he did. His belly was sticking out of his shirt, his belly button fully exposed to the cool and crisp air. Not only that, when he put a hand to it, it looked a tiny bit pinkish to him, and the skin texture felt slightly different, as if it wasn't even skin anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck is wrong with me belly?\" he asked himself.</span></div></div>",

This chimpanzee was meant to be sold to a circus, but it needed to be trained first. The chimp was fairly grizzled and hard to manage, however Jacob has trained numerous simians over the years. In his mind he knew this chimp would be no different, yet he was about to learn that wasn't the case at all. Jacob entered the zoo at 11:00 AM, and looked around for the woman he was supposed to meet there. As he stood next to the giraffe enclosure he heard someone approaching, he turned to see a knockout of a blonde standing right across from him. \"You must be, Jacob!\" Exclaimed the blonde, as she reached to shake Jake's hand. \"You must be Talia! I've heard you've done a lot of research on chimpanzee behavior, and the like!\" The blonde blushed and said, \"It's not big a deal!\" She said in a rather bashful tone, \"There are plenty of women who know the inner working of a chimpanzee's mind. Yet, I have had no such break-through on Barney, our newest chimpanzee. Hopefully, you could train him! We were planning on selling the chimp to a nearby circus, that raises funds for charity!\" Exclaimed the energetic blonde. \"Leave it to me, I'm a master of getting into a monkey's mind! By the end of this, you won't be able to tell the chimp apart from me!\" The woman laughed at Barney's boasts, as she lead him too...</span></div></div>",

He made some throat clearing sounds, and began fidgeting slightly. \"There we go!\" Shouted Barney using Jacob's voice. \"Now you, try saying something!\" Jacob tried, but the only sounds he could make were screeches and grunts. \"All right, time to move on to the next lesson.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next?</span></div></div>",

We can't teach you the proper tricks if you are not the right size yet.

Some more changes would need to happen in order to make that position more explicitly comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Jacob wasn't thinking about that.

Instead, as he turned his thankfully still human head, he saw that his body was now quickly getting covered in.

In fact, it seemed like her overall body size was shrinking as the kangaroo groomed and changed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa began to panic, unsure as to what was happening with her daughter, but the feeling turned into confusion as her daughter's appearance and name seemed fuzzier and hard to remember by the second.</span></div></div>",

Behind her was the pair of jeans she had been wearing with a large kangaroo tail hanging out the large hole it had created. Amber swung it side to side playfully, giggling as if she had that tail her whole life. Several more rips echoed after the first as her feet ripped free from her shoes, her clawed toes wiggling happily at their newfound freedom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa looked at her daughter as memories of her began to fade. Soon, she was wondering why the kangaroo in front of her seemed familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber looked up at the mother kangaroo, getting a face full of marsupial tongue which triggered her final transformation. Giving a happy chortle sound like her new mother, her face began to stretch out, bones creaking and shifting to adjust themselves with the change. The then stretching stopped, leaving Amber with a snout to match the one in front of her. She opened her eyes, revealing widened brown irises and pupils that made her eyes appear darker. Sniffing the air with her new nose, she approached the mother kangaroo's pouch, slipping into her sticky folds before happily popping her head outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlinking a few times, Melissa came out of a daze as the last remnants of her Amber faded away, along with any evidence of her daughter's human past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalia walked up to her like nothing happened and began commenting about the new joey and her mother. \"I see you've seen our newest joey, Amber! She took a real liking to this lonely mother kangaroo, and now it's like they've always been mother and daughter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa could only rub her head a bit, unable to remember anything about that name. \"Well, I guess that one has it easy, since it's been a kangaroo all her life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalia gave a sly smile as she stood next to her. \"Oh I'm sure you'll do just fine!

She even pulled her wrists near her armpits instinctual way to fold them like wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe habitat itself seemed to never end, as when she walked further into the building, the bigger the forest gets. Whenever she would see another person, she could only reply in human sounding squawks and repeating the last thing she said, \"Make me...aRRRAWWWWK\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough she didn't noticed, it was clear her mind was becoming bird-brained like the rest of the guests turned bird people here.
