You look at her and wonder a lot of things, why is she so beat up, why did she fall out a tree, and why was she in a tree in the first place. She just laid there and slept way. You felt happy she was resting but you were unsure what you were going with your parents. You could't think of anything but give her back to her parents. She started to move a little. She started to look like she was being chased by something. You poke her on her side and she starts to wake up. She looks around quickly and sees you and starts to back away from you again.

You smile and lean over and say, \"My name's Jake nice to meet you.\" yousay as you picked yourself up and went to your parents. Your mom was 37 years old and your dad was 38. Your mom and a beautiful face that made her look so much younger. As for your dad he was a well built guy that could take anyone down if needed. He was once a street fighter but now his a cop. People said you looked like your mom but the body of your dad. You laugh at them but you say thanks. As you walked into the living room you noticed that both parents were sitting towards the television. You look at them hoping to make this quick so you could talk to your new 'friend'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how was your day at school?\" is what your dad said. You hate when they make small talk cause then you knew they were just talking about you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think to yourself for a moment and say, \"Same as any other day. I ran into someone on the way home and had a nice little chat with them.\" You smile at yourself because that is all true and you don't need to lie about anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who was it?\" your mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A girl that lives a couple a blocks from us named Jess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice you get this cutey's phone number?\" your dad says making you embarrass to call him your dad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah dad I did and I was hoping I could talk to her some more until you guys called me out here.\" you say trying to get back and make sure Jess didn't hurt herself. Your parents let you leave because you had very little friends. You tell them that your going over a friends house on the weekends to get some extra cash in your pocket and they let you sometimes and won't the next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk into your room once again and look at the bed to see if Jess is still there. She is but she moved from being on top of the bed to being on top of the pillow. She destracted herself as she jumped on the pillow like a trampoline. She hasn't noticed that you came in yet so you just lay on the bed and watch her while she enjoyed herself. Though with you sitting down made her bounce twice as high as before. You take your hands and grab her in midair. She turns around in your hand and stares at you with her dark blue eyes. You now take this time to notice how she looks. She has red hair that goes past her shoulders, Beautiful blue eyes, a small but noticeable nose, a smile that makes you very happy to see on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou also start to stare that he rest when she says, \"Are you picturing me naked?\" She giggles and it causes you to blush. This tiny girl made a giant like you to blush. You chuckled to yourself about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I am you don't know though do you,\" you tease her knowing that you don't even need to imagine her naked but you could force her if you wanted to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get any ideas big boy. I don't think you've earned that right yet,\" she says as she starts to blush. You laugh when you hear your door open. You look and see that both your parents are looking. At not just ou but the little girl in your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long have you two been there?\" yousay angrily. You didn't know your parents didn't care for your privacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Were you imaging her naked?\" your mom asked as they both walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why were you guys....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We weren't at first until we heard her voice. Then we looked in and saw your phone was nowhere near you.\" your dad states. You look at your parents knowing that no matter what you had to tell them about her sooner or later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, Dad this is Jess the girl I \"pumped\" into earlier.\" you tell them. \"Jess their my parents.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nice to met you.\" Jess said as she bowed to your parents. You look back at them and their look said enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To the table and we'll talk about this.\" your mon says as both your parents walk to the dining room. You look at Jess and smile, all you could really do. You knew that if they found out she did run away instead of you kidnapping her would make things ease down a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you reach the dining room you sit down across your parents and put Jess right next to you. You look at your parents and said, \"Look, I didn't kidnapped her. She fell out of a tree and \"pumped\" into me. She was asleep so I took her home when she woke up we talk and nothing I told you was a lie.\" You think for a moment. \"Except For having her phone number.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour parents change their looks from you to Jess, \" Is this true?\" your dad asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes he didn't do anything else then that. Although he did make me something to eat though.\" Jess said.</span></div></div>",

He had a Gib's (NCIS) stare that you and your mom joked about a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess looks back at your dad and falls into the same truth spell everyone falls under. \"I did have a home but I ran away.\" Jess says. You look at her confused. She ran away from home but fell out of a tree? She continued to tell her story, \"As long as I can remember.... I was a sex toy to my family.\" She then started to cry her heart out. You looked at her and a shocked to hear this. Why would anyone want to abuse this tiny little girl. It isn't human. You then rub her back and she is crying even worst! You pick her up and put her on your shoulder and let her cry it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you whisper to her, \"It's okay. It's okay, we'll never abuse you at all. Don't worry.\" she then looks up at you tears still coming out of her eyes like a waterfall. As she looks at you, she smiles and continued to cry on your shoulder. You would like to ask her how she got in the tree but you then thought it maybe best to ask later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at your parents and their whispering to each other. You knew that they were talking about how she would live with us and all the other stuff. You smiled because now you knew she is now a part of your family. You had no siblings and no one in the neighborhood was around your age to hang out with. But now this cute little girl was now probably the greatest thing to have ever happened to you. You even start to cry a little and bring Jess closer to your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute or so the tears stop and you and Jess just look at your parents. \"Okay here are the rules if your going to stay with us Jess. Jake if Jess is staying with us then you need to help her out since me and dad work. Make sure she has everything she needs to be comfortable, \"your mom says. \"Jess I need you to listen to Jake when he is helping you out. Jess I have one question for you.

You look down at her to see she's a little afraid of what you said. You stop and think, 'If she was treated as a sex toy then she must not think ai threaten her.' You rub her back and and tell her, \"It's okay I didn't mean anything bad about it.\" She calms down a little bit and nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile and put Jess down on to the table. \"Jake if you could can you make it so Jess can live in your room with you and make a small room her size?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay mom,\" you say.

She just listens and asks small questions that most children ask when they learn about them. After that you start to talk about some history when you think of something.

Stripping down she walked over to the mirror that was on her small table and frowned, wishing she had a better body that wasn't covered in scars. Shaking her head she blushed, \"Wh..why am I thinking that.\" Without further delay, she turned and put on the first set of clothing which was a simple pair of jeans and a T shirt. Walking back out the door she looked up at you and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had meanwhile been busying yourself with preparing the story on what to tell the teacher's at school on Monday. Looking over you saw Jess step outside in her new outfit and nodded, \"It looks very good on you Jess. Does it fit alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess nodded, \"I-it's fine, although its a... little umm..\" she squirmed a bit not wanting to sound ungrateful, finishing meekly, \"itchy around the..... c-crotch\" She blushed a bright crimson looking down quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt yourself getting a little red out of awkwardness, and a bit embarassment, \"Oh I'm sorry. I didn't even.... I mean I should've.... er...\" Scratching your head he leaned close asking, \"Umm... do you have panties on?\" You kept your voice at a whisper looking around as though you didn't want anyone eavesdropping to overhear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess blushed and shook her head, \"I.. I don't have any....\" She hadn't had any need for them in her past home so there was no reason for her to have them. Looking up at you she asks, \"Can you make me some like you made these clothes.... *yawn*.....oh i'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the time you smile and shake your head. Maybe in the morning, but right now I think that we need to get some sleep. Picking her up you head over to the dorm you had made for her and took the roof off laying her down gently smiling, \"See you in the morning.\" You start to turn until you here her call out, \".....\"</span></div></div>",

I mean I don\u2019t roll over in my sleep but still,\u201d you say a little concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright but you might want to put these on,\u201d you give her pajamas. \u201cThese are what you wear when you sleep.\u201d Jess nodded and took the pajamas. You closed the roof to give her some privacy. When she came out of the door she yawned again and walked onto your hand. \u201cYou know if I\u2019m supposed to be watching you then that means I should take your room and put it in mine uh?\u201d you ask, using your other hand to grab the little house you made and started to walk into your room. You put her room down on top of your headboard. \u201cI guess you can sleep on the pillow for safety.\u201d You don\u2019t get a respond; looking over in your hand she\u2019s fast asleep. \u201cI\u2019ll take that as a yes.\u201d Putting her on the pillow you rest your head right next to her, lie down, and go to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you wake up you feel something pulling your ear. Opening your eyes you see Jess standing on you cheek. With a quick snatch you get her off your cheek. \u201cWhat are you doing,\u201d you ask half asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWaking you up, sleepy head!\u201d Jess says cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh what time is it?\u201d looking at your clock it says, 5:02 am. \u201cWhat are you up so early?\u201d you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is the time I usually wake up at. Yesterday though, I woke up at two just to escape my little brother\u2019s cage,\u201d Jess looks down at the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, you don\u2019t need to worry about that stuff anymore, but I need to ask you to not wake up this early on the weekends. It\u2019s the only time of the week not to wake up at five.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, but now your awake, what do you want to do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSleep.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way, I tried too hard to wake you up, your now staying awake!\u201d Jess yelled into your ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, I\u2019ll stay awake. Now what to do? I guess I can make your underwear and show you a few things you\u2019ll need to know about school.\u201d She jumped in joy when you said that. First thirty minutes were spent on making her some underwear and bras. Once she puts them away you start telling her a few thing things she\u2019ll need to be ready for school. You tell her about knowing math, which it turns out she spied on her brother as he did his math and he was two years younger than her. \u201cOkay that makes this easier; all I need to show you is a few things.\u201d You ask her to do some old problems that you could remember and she is just picking these things up and is doing them like she\u2019s always been able to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow is that?\u201d Jess asked as you gave her one of your resent homework assignment. Looking at your answer she got it right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn you\u2019re good,\u201d is all you can say. \u201cI\u2019ll give you some of my other work.\u201d When you give her the assignments she does the English okay. Not the best, writer, but so would you if you had to write with a pencil that\u2019s the same size as you, or type on a keyboard that\u2019s the size of a cat walk to you. She was horrible at Spanish, and she was great at biology. \u201cSo you\u2019re good at Math, Science, and History. Okay in English, and is bad in Spanish and Gym.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, no I\u2019m not,\u201d Jess said as she sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay then run a mile in eight minutes.\u201d She went quite which made you laugh. \u201cIt\u2019s okay I\u2019m sure there\u2019ll be some things for you to do at your size, like pull ups.\u201d You say holding out your pencil above her head, laughing at your own joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery funny Mr. Giant,\u201d she says as she gives you a dirty look. \u201cSo where are your mom and dad?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey came home last night. They have to work in the morning, tomorrow mom\u2019s off and Monday dad is. What time is it?\u201d Looking at your alarm its 12:13 pm. \u201cWell that took longer than expected, hunger?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes I am what is there to eat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cApples, turkey, tuna\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s tuna?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a fish that\u2019s really good when you make it the right way.

It was the whole, what else live in the ocean, how big is it deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo there\u2019s still so much about the ocean we don\u2019t know because we as humans can breathe underwater. We have made machines known as submarines but they can only stay under for so long,\u201d you say, \u201cNow let\u2019s eat, I\u2019m hungry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay but it\u2019s strange, we haven\u2019t even explored half of our own world yet,\u201d Jess took a handful of tuna and tried it. \u201cMmmmmm it\u2019s good, I could eat this all day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBad idea, if you eat too much tuna you\u2019ll get mercury poisoning. Eating one a day, for a week is a good idea, part of the reason why tuna is so good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut if it can kill you why eat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s also health too, that\u2019s where a famous saying, \u201cToo much of a good thing can be bad.\u201d That means if it\u2019s good, too much of it will hurt you sooner or later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay. Strange, there\u2019s so much to this world that we don\u2019t understand.\u201d Jess said as she ate some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI could tell you some more interesting things, but I have a bad feeling you\u2019ll be confused,\u201d you say out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, nothing just another part of history, is mythology. It\u2019s the study of things that people used to believe in but not into days world. The best example would be dragons.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s a dragon?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a funny thing to ask. A dragon is a \u201cbeast\u201d that in all cultures are known to being large, scaly creatures that can fly, and breathe fire. Though different cultures have different ideas of what their dragons do, everyone in the world did believe in dragons before they thought of there being other human being around the world.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow long ago was that?\u201d Jess asked sitting there in astonishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA long time ago, I think the first idea of dragons was from when man was starting to evolve into who we are today, so about a few hundred thousand years ago.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, that\u2019s strange. Why would we believe in something like that if there never was any?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe truth is, Jess, which a lot of the stories of dragons had most killed. Dragons might have been real, but some believe that mankind made them go dye out as a species. In today\u2019s world a lot of more modern day stories are about the idea of meeting a dragon, or life would have been like to live with them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, that\u2019s cool. Can you show me some?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure but let\u2019s finish eating.\u201d That\u2019s where you thought of something, \u201cMy dad should have been home about an hour ago. I wonder where he is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe his work is keeping him?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr knowing him and my mom, they\u2019re both trying to get some more information about your birth. Dad might arrest your parents, if there is a birth certificate saying you are a human being.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I thought I was already?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are it\u2019s just that if you have a birth certificate it says you are who you are, that you were born in a certain place, and that you exist. Without one, you might have a lot of problems ahead.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere could they find my birth certificate?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d is all you can say. You finish the rest of her side of the tuna sandwich. She jumps off the plate so you can put it way. \u201cNow let\u2019s find us story about a dragon,\u201d you try and brighten the mood you set.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, don\u2019t you have any books about them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have some books called Eragon, but I know a website that has a lot of good stories about dragons. Some in fact let you see their point of view.\u201d You go onto the computer and pull up Writing.com, you go to your favorites bar and find Outcast. For the next couple of minutes you two were stuck on the first page because you had to explain to her about the computer, but when you finish explaining it, you both sat down and enjoyed the story Bruce Lee Gifford Jr. made.</span></div></div>",

Looking over to the door you find your Mom walking in with another doctor and a suitcase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Mom, who\u2019s this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is Dr. Roy Gilmore. He was in charge of Jess\u2019s doctor that watched over her. He works at the in the genetics. Roy has her records and her birth certificate, but before he will let us see it, he wished to see Jess and hear what has happened after she left the hospital.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice to see you again Roy,\u201d Jess said waving to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice to see you too, from what Tina told me I would take it you don\u2019t remember what happened since you were four,\u201d Dr. Roy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe first thing I remember is leaving the hospital and you waving bye to me,\u201d Jess said sitting down on the computer desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell from what Tina told me is that they abused you, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Dr. Roy said getting to eye level with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at your mom, \u201cI guess you plan on suing her parents for child abuse uh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, we need Dr. Roy to give us her birth certificate. He is the only one with access to it, because he helped give birth to her. Don\u2019t ask how they know, or how that worked.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWon\u2019t, but does this mean his going to take care of her?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo son,\u201d Dr. Roy said, \u201cI have a family on my own and if I had Jess stay with us, she would most likely be my baby daughters\u2019 chew toys.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI remember when my little brother did that to me, ugh,\u201d Jess shuttered. Jess then started to tell Dr. Roy. This time, she didn\u2019t cry, but she looked like she was about to at some points.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry for letting them take you like that. I thought that once you grew up in a hospital, and try and adapt to regular sized people you\u2019d have a \u201cnormal\u201d life. But hearing that the moment you left you were used as your mother\u2019s vibrator, uh,\u201d was Dr. Roy could say. \u201cThree weeks after you left they said you were dead, but I just kept your birth certificate in case we had another like you, then I would have someone to help reference to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo they said I was dead just so I wouldn\u2019t have to keep being asked about me? I don\u2019t ever want to return to them, is there away so I don\u2019t?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell sweetie, that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing,\u201d your mom said, \u201cIf we sue your parents for child abuse, and with all this to back it up, you won\u2019t have to return to them. They lose custody of you, and if we fill out the custody forms, you can live with us. Jake will help you with any problem, and if he can\u2019t take care of it, then come to us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess started to get teary eyed, \u201cThank you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Roy then opened his suit case and pulled out Jess\u2019s birth certificate, looking at where the feet print were all you saw where two dots. \u201cHere you go Tina, I wish you all luck in the case, and know I\u2019ll help out any way I can.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you Dr. Roy.\u201d And with that Dr. Roy left, looking back at Jess she was looking at her birth certificate, and chuckled a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, those used to be my feet, their so small,\u201d Jess laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo us, your baby feet look like dots,\u201d you say putting one finger on her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you really think they even want custody over me?\u201d Jess said both you and your mom looked down at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve been gone a day now, and after everything they\u2019ve done to me, I don\u2019t think they even know I left. I just think, that maybe they think I\u2019m dead, so we might not need to sue them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe could do that Jess, but what would happen if they find you with us?\u201d your mom asked. \u201cThey would try and sue us for kidnapping. The fact that they live on the street means that sooner or later they\u2019ll see you. The only legal way to keep you is through a custody battle. With your birth certificate we should be able to get the jury to know you\u2019re human too. If we can, we win; if we don\u2019t then \u2026 we\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about Jess,\u201d you say, \u201cNo matter what happens you\u2019re always welcome here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, but when will this whole thing happen?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTomorrow, hopefully it won\u2019t take long,\u201d your mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs dad trying to get a case for her on his break?\u201d you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, he called me saying he got her case, that\u2019s how I know it\u2019s for tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, you want some tuna mom?\u201d \u201cJust made,\u201d You and Jess taunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, but I\u2019ll have to have it to go,\u201d your mom said. You know she might so you had one premade ready in the fridge. You hand it to her and she was off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow can you deal with them being out all the time?\u201d Jess asked once the door closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust one of the things you get used to. They\u2019ve been working since I was born. I do some things my parents might not like, but it\u2019s nothing to worry about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI like to draw and work on some computers, so I have a little business that people come to me to fix some of their computers or want a drawing of something and I do it for a price. I\u2019m not legal age to work, but I do it more as a hobby.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy is it not legal?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I don\u2019t have the right papers to say I can do it, I\u2019m not old enough to own a real business, and then the fact that most of the kids ask me to fix their parents computers without them knowing. Business is a little slow but here and there I get some customers,\u201d you say, but there is another thing you do for cash that you didn\u2019t dare, tell anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, what\u2019s wrong with some of them?\u201d Jess was full of questions, far too easy to tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNormally something that they did, spilled soda on it, downloaded the \u201cwrong\u201d thing, the things that most kids do on their parents\u2019 computer,\u201d you think of what you usually have to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, but what do you do on your parents\u2019 computer?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that\u2019s funny; you think I would do something like that? I really just use the computer to download some of the art I do, and some of jobs I do. Some people email me about some problems and I tell them what to do. Other than that, I usually draw.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your Dad was able to seek the counseling of one of the most successful Child Custody Lawyers in the county, Jack Downey. Jess's case intrigued him, for obvious reasons, but Jack insisted on having a sit-down with the family before they officially took this case to court. A dinner date with Jack and Dr. Roy was set up for the following Friday night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...............................<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were never really popular at school, but you still managed to find yourself a few acquaintances (even though you always seemed to be a \"fifth-wheel\" type person). In group conversations you'd occasionally throw in a joke or a witty comment of sorts and get a quick laugh, but you'd fade into the background just as quickly. School itself was a breeze, you being a genius and all that, but those 6 hours away from home could feel pretty damn lonely at times. The only person who you would consider to be your friend was this sophomore guy, Jordan Michaels. He towered over you and most other people at 6'7 and, of course, played basketball. He was a member of the FCA (Fellowship of Christian Athletes), a leader at his youth group, and one of the nicest guys at the school. He was the type of guy who would smile politely after a stranger made a \"Jordan Michaels = Michael Jordan\" joke for the billionth time and even though he often invited you to youth group and church events he never seemed preachy or overly-aggressive in sharing his religion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the week leading up to the dinner with Jack and Dr. Roy, you felt even more isolated than usual. Even though it was the middle of May (about 5 or 6 months away from basketball season), Jordan got talked into doing off-season workouts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got some college scouts looking at me now,\" he explained, \"I need to keep getting better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was fine with you though; with Jess waiting for you at home, you had no interest in hanging out with anyone else. Every day you were welcomed by Jess in the same way that you imagine a dog would greet their owner. On Wednesday, in fact, she actually perched up on a shelf next to the front door and pounced onto your neck as you walked in. Over the next couple of months she would relentlessly tease you for the \"girlish shriek\" that you let out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you went back to school on Monday, you showed her how to type on the computer (for someone who had never been to school before, she learned to write/type fairly quickly) and enter things into Google. Every afternoon she would have thousands of questions, mostly having to do with books, music, and movies. You would do the best you could to fill her in on what she missed pop-culturally the first 15 years of her life. You would think that a task like that would be draining on you, but something about her raw enthusiasm for learning about these things gave you the desire to teach them. She learned about everything from Peter Pan and Grim's Fairy Tales to YouTube and Vine in the afternoon and all the \"boring stuff\" as you did your homework. The concept of homework seemed to baffled her and throw a wet towel on her perception of school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean they teach this boring crap to you all day and then they make you do more of it when you get home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're preaching to the choir,\" you told her as you finally finished off your 15th math problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.............................................................<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn Friday, Jess greeted you at the door and demanded that you watch a movie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've learned so much about books and music, but I've never seen a movie before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" you mutter under your breath, trying to wrap your head around that fact. \"Yeah, we've got a few hours before dinner. We can totally do that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get a giant bowl of popcorn for the two of you (mostly just you), grab a Coke and pour some of it into a shot glass for Jess to sip on (ignore the fact that your family has shot glasses. They totally don't have a drinking problem). You open up Netflix on your laptop and and set up everything in the living room. You lay down on the couch with the laptop on your lap and Jess sitting criss-cross on your chest with her body facing the massive computer screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want to watch?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something good, I guess?\" she said, \"I don't know, I've never watched <i>any</i> movies before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is so weird,\" you mutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knooooooooowww,\" she said, curling into a ball; visibly embarrassed, but still playful, \"I'm so weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" you reply, \"Don't worry, I've got you covered.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned around and grinned at you. It always stuck you as strange that someone who had been used as a human sex toy in her previous home could ever be as comfortable around normal sized people as she was. Over the past week, she never screamed when you picked her up, she insisted on sleeping next to you every night, and she even started to open up to you about her past a little bit. It reminded you a bit of a quote from that book you were forced to read this year, The Great Gatsby, \"...she blossomed for him like a flower.\" You feel almost like she's yours, not as if you took her by force and own her but as if she simply decided to completely trust you with her life. These were all weird things to notice while you were simply getting ready to watch a movie with her, but you are just now noticing these feelings of... intimacy you feel for her. You think that you might actually love her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Hello?\" Jess was saying, standing up and waving her hands in front of your face as you snap out of your trance, \"You still there, Jake?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompletely embarrassed, you turn your attention toward the computer screen and type \"Star Wars\" into the Netflix search bar as you try to ignore Jess's hysterical laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man,\" she gasped between breaths and laughter, \"You were really gone there. You were just staring into space for a solid 45 seconds.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess I did space out pretty hard there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What were you thinking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on,\" she said, stretching her body out, laying on her stomach and army-crawling up toward your face, \"Tell me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Could you stop being so damn cute?</i>, you think to myself. If I tell her the truth, that could make things weird between us. On the other hand, what would she do about it? It's not like she could leave, she needs me. Then you scold yourself for thinking like that. That's not far off from how her old family used to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you looked back down at her, she had her head resting on her folded arms with her eyebrows raised and a half smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm waiting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you open up to her a bit or do you misdirect the conversation?                                       </span></div></div>",

You have her full attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a strange question to consider: On one hand, you think she's adorable in the way that some people view energetic kittens. But you never really viewed her as a non-person. On the other hand, you're a 15 (almost 16) year old guy and you can't held noticing her figure. Dr. Roy was able to find some more clothes that could fit her 5-inch tall body and the cutoff jean shorts and the tank top she was wearing was showing off her great skin. She wasn't fully tanned, but she wasn't even remotely pale. She had curves in all the right places and the combination of her red-hair and her pale blue eyes made her face completely stunning. Her attitude, her looks, her energy, how do you summarize it all?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds of thinking you drape your hand over her tiny body like a huge blanket and start stroking her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Adorable in the best kind of way,\" you finally answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly moves her arm to try and cover her face, but you can tell she's blushing. After a minute she asks another question:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think I'm pretty?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're beautiful,\" you respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-d....do you like me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I do,\" you answer.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would...would you uh...well...,\" she stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it, Jess?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess takes a deep breath and moves her arm away from her face. She looks up at you, but her eyes are closed because she doesn't want to make eye contact. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would... would you kiss me?\" she finally asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking a moment to make sure you heard correctly, you wrap your fingers around her tiny body, bringing her into a gentle grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely,\" you say with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raise her toward her face, but you do your best not to suffocate her with your lips. She reaches her arms up during the kiss and sort of \"hugs\" your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like you too big guy,\" she says after you've finished, with a smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat whole exchange could not have gone better. It might be early to say that you have a half-foot tall girlfriend, but you both know your feelings for each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now,\" you say as you set her down back on your chest, \"time to show you what good movies look like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou two begin watching the original Star Wars trilogy (not the prequels though).    </span></div></div>",

She looks up at you and starts slowly crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJess? Why are you crying?\u201d you ask her. There wasn\u2019t anything too sad about the movies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI...I just love these. The suspense, the action, everything. But I do have a question.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShoot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat built up to these movies? I just feel like there\u2019s something missing\u201d she said, tilting her head slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell...I mean there are three other movies that go into that, but...you wouldn\u2019t like them. No one does.\u201d You think to yourself \u2018oh god. Please don\u2019t go there.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I\u2019ll be the judge of that. Let\u2019s watch them\u201d she said determinedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe another time. It\u2019s getting late and I want to eat something.\u201d You would do just about anything to not watch the prequels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, but we <b>will</b> watch them. Promise?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cP...promise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou close down the laptop and head to the kitchen, where and make some rice. You carry the bowls over to the table and sit down to eat. The rice want anything special, but it was something to eat. Jess wasn\u2019t amused though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is something\u2019s people actually eat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes? Why, is something wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell it\u2019s just so...bland. There\u2019s no taste to it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrust me, there are plenty of foods that don\u2019t have taste. You\u2019ll get used to it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you went back to eating. Jess didn\u2019t enjoy it much but she didn\u2019t complain. Once both of you finished, you put the bowls in the washed and headed to your room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn your room, you started working on your school work while Jess went on your computer, looking up all sorts of things. Just as you finished the last math problem, Jess called over to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Jake, take a look at this.\u201d You walked over to the bed and laid down next to her. On the screen was a beach. \u201dRemember that one story we read about those two kids who went to the beach? I want to go to one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew there weren\u2019t any beaches close to where you lived. You had to break it to Jess. \u201cWell there aren\u2019t any close to here. Maybe one day when we go on vacation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, but that could be forever.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to say more to Jess when you heard the door to your room open. Standing in the doorway was your dad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey you two. I\u2019ve got some big news.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBig news? Is this about Jess?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. We have a court case tomorrow. We arrested your parents Jess and tomorrow they are going on trial. I need to ask you Jess: are you willing to come tomorrow to testify?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA trial? Testify? What do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s like that one game I showed you the other day, where a person is either found guilty or not guilty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh. So you need me as a...oh what is it? Oh, a witness?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. It\u2019s up to you though. I know it might be tough seeing them again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. I want to help bring them to justice, just like in the game.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk. That means we will have to go in early tomorrow. Both of you get some rest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, see you in the morning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGoodnight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your dad closed the door, you looked over over at Jess. She was curled up in a ball, a waterfall of tears pouring from her eyes. You quickly moved over to her and started softly moving your finger gently over her face, wiping the tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJess, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was I thinking?! I can\u2019t see them again! I...I...!\u201d She screamed before passing out in your hands. Quickly you cupped her in your hands and rushed her over to your mom\u2019s room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom, Jess just passed out!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe got all worked up about tomorrow\u2019s trial. She\u2019s got over-anxious.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, give her to me. Grab a piece of cloth and wet it.\u201d You quickly ran to your room and grabbed a spare piece of cloth and put warm water on it, returning it to your mom. She laid the cloth over Jess\u2019 head and laid her on a pillow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a little bit, Jess slowly woke up. She started crying again. You gently picked her up and place her on your shoulder, rubbing her back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s ok Jess. You don\u2019t have to go tomorrow. It will be fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I need to go. I need to get passed this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure Jess? We don\u2019t want you passing out like that again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t. Norm, let\u2019s get some sleep.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your mom went back to bed, you and Jess went back to your room and laid in bed. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next morning you and Jess wake up and start getting dressed. You decided it would be best to go to the trial with Jess, in case she needed your support. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom and dad were running all around, getting paperwork together, and double checking everything. This was too important for anything to go wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only 6:00am when it was time to go. Everyone got in the car and started heading for the courthouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole car ride down Jess shivered in your lap, a tear leaving her eyes every now and then. All you could do was rub her softly and sooth her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, you arrived at the courthouse and everyone entered. You, Jess, and your mom all headed to the courtroom and sat at the prosecution table while your dad headed to briefing. Your mom started talking with the lawyer, going over everything while you sat with Jess, comforting her. She wasn\u2019t crying as much, but she definitely wasn\u2019t fine, only showing how much she needed you right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Jess\u2019 family came in, sitting at the defense table. Just by looking at them you could tell they were a toxic family. The father was very scruffy, while the mother was very snobbish. They obviously had a hatred for their daughter (If they even thought of her as one) which they put on us for obvious reasons. The whole time they looked at us, making faces. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after almost two hours, the whole court was alive with voices of curious people and officials. Once everyone was ready, the court came to order. All the legal mumbo jumbo went on and on. Mom and dad talked, and arguments ensued between the two family\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, it was time for Jess to take the stand. Getting up from your chair, you carried her over to the stand and placed her on the wooden counter. You were allowed to stay with her as she might require assistance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the stand, Jess told her whole life story. The abuse, the torture, everything she went through. The whole time she started weeping and shuddering. All you could do was stand there as she went through a mental breakdown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she finished, you put her on your shoulder and headed out of the courtroom. Neither of you needed to be part of the conflict.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was now 3:00pm. It had been almost eight hours now and the whole time Jess had either been crying a waterfall or passed out from exhaustion. You had gently held her in your lap, running your finger over her head. Finally, the bang of a gavel could be heard from the room, followed by the combined chatter of everyone inside. A crowd of people started exiting the room, the chatter following them. Then, your mom came out, her face as bright as the sun. As she came over, you looked down to Jess, who was passed out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what happened? Did you win?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWin? Is that even a question? That family had it coming. You wouldn\u2019t even believe some of the worse things they have been convicted for. Besides abuse-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure. So we get to keep Jess?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. Your father is current filling out the custody papers as we speak. How is Jess doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell if being passed out is anything, then that\u2019s something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw. The poor girl must be completely tuckered out. Let\u2019s leave her be. I\u2019m sure she will feel much better once she gets the good news.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter leaving the courthouse and arriving home, Jess had still now woken up. You took her up to your room and watched over her. Her breathing was slow and light, her body limp. It was worse that anyone had expected. It wasn\u2019t till almost 11:00pm it happened. While working on some schoolwork, you could hear Jess rustling about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo...No! I...I can\u2019t go back there! I...I!\u201d She screamed.  You quickly rushed over to her, cupping your hands under her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJess! Jess! Wake up! It\u2019s ok.\u201d You gently but firmly shook her, moving you finger along her back. To your relief, she finally awoke. She slowly opened and closed her eyes, taking in her surroundings. She looked up to you, giving a slight smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, hey...Jake. That was some sleep I had.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo kidding. You had me worried for a bit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo...what happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe won Jess. You\u2019re here to stay.\u201d Almost like a cat, Jess popped up to her feet and pounced onto you, giving you a \u201cbig\u201d hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa, easy there. You welcome. Welcome to the family. Officially that is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you Jake. Now, maybe we can get to watching the prequels?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJess, it\u2019s 11:00pm. Time for bed.\u201d</span></div></div>",

The bag is removed from your head it takes a second for your eyes to adjust to the light.

I'm not quite sure how people are going to take to seeing a 4 inch person on my shoulder.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right...I guess I could go in your backpack for now.

Offered me a job on the spot after I told him about my living conditions.  He wouldn't go into detail about it at the time.  He only told me that it paid well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next thing I knew,\" she continued.  \"I'm being strapped to a gurney, pushed into this whole new world and forced to be someone's pet.  I escaped first chance I got.  This little girl took me outside to play with her and as soon as she set me down, I ran.  I cleared the yard and kept going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, that was over a year ago, I think.

If you want to be able to roam free, walk around, that's fine, too.

To make it easier for you all to understand his parents ditched him at an orphanage when he was a month old, the nuns never make sure he was alright, and he ran away from the orphanage at the age of ten. He found an abandon house and made it his home. Sure he stole gardening tool, seeds and stuff like that but he was able to raise himself. Now for the house it was a normal house probably about a couple of devades ago but now it was a house that had rotten wood, holes in the ceiling, and vermin at every turn in the house. No one wants to live there but Jake makes do of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs fir school Jake just lies for almost everything about it. What he tells everyone is that his parents are divorced and only during the fall and winter is when he is in state while spring and summer he lives with his dad in Maine. The truth he only went to school to keep warm and once it got warm enough he ditched and waited for the whole cycle to start over again. While he did this no one even cared enough to look for him, to befriend him, or even talk to him. He was nothing more then a phantom to everyone. He doesn't mind the lonely life because that was what his life was destain to be. Until he found this little girl. Now he had someone/thing to share his pain. To keep him company, to talk to, hell if she cursed him out he could just use her as a toy/slave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jake walked home thinking of what he should do with his new friend/toy/slave only one thing bugged him. What was he going to say to her? Or better yet how would she react?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake thought and figured Let her do the that for me. If she flips shit she is my slave, talks down on me = toy, tries to reason with me a friend.</span></div></div>",

(Make do with what you got.) when he found it he then spit the little girl into his hand then gently put her into the jar. As he looks at her he wonders what is she about to do? All she did was crawl into the farthest part of the jar and just watched him for the most part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe silence was akward so Jake thought it be best to start things off. \"Hi I'm Jake.\" he said to his little prisoner. She was still naked but neither one of them cared because they both had plans for when the other slipped. The little girl just looked at him and muttered something. \"I'm sorry I didn't hear that.\" Jake said. She gestured him to come closer to hear her even though she was whispering her answer until he came close enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jake put his ear next to the glass where the tiny girl was she said, \"my name's ROSA YOU DUMBASS!!!!!!\" She yelled that so loud and high pitch Jake became dizzy and knocked the jar on the ground. Rose was hoping for it to tip over not to hit the ground because then as the glass turned into shards she would end up dead on impact. Jake was dizzy but saw that she was indanger and he grabbed the jar and put it on the counter again. Nothing broken or hurt but Jake was still dizzy from the yell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that for?\" Jake asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that incident she was now cowering in fear of what Jake could have done to her. But when she heard Jake question she was confused. He had no hit of angre in his voice or anything but concern. She looked up at him, still in fear and asked, \"Yo... Your no...not mad at me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would I? Sure you could have not done that but atleast I got to know your name Rosa.\" Jake said with a smile. (See Jake is strange for a loner. He puts himself in others shoes and then reacts the way he would like to be treated. This was no different. Jake knew the size different was against her and everything his done to her would have made her yell like that. So Jake didn't take a problem with that at all. But like most people he has a limit to his kindness.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa saw Jake's smile and was confused horribly. \"Your not going to punish me for what I did?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would I? If I was you I think I understand why you did this.\" Rosa was confused. She hadn't talk to this guy for ten minutes and yet he said he understood her? \"See I'm not sure how you got so small but what I can tell is that you are increably resourceful, strong, and you have to be cunning too.\" Jake said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa was shocked he was right so far she was strong, resourceful, and cunning but it seems to be that he can figure out most of her life easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake continued, \"I'd take it that your used to fighting things larger then you not just because of your size but because you tried to take me down showing you had the guts to do so. If I'm not mistaken I think you've done that kind of thing before. Holding someone hosted to get what you need and never return. Then looking at your weapons,\" Jake says as he pulls out her clothes and weapons. \"I can see this 'sword' is made out of steel and that you have tiny daggers in your bra. To say the least your were clever for thinking that once the sword is taken away you still had some more weapons on you to fight back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa had her mouth wide open. He had just read her like a book in less the ten minutes. She was scaried because now he didn't seem human but like some mind reading alien.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake saw her face and laughed. Jake has always been good at reading people because not only was he smart and wise but when everyone has fun he just sits in his corner either reading Sherlock Homes or tries to read what each stundents' personality was just by looking at them. For Jake it was fun to everyone else it was just plain creepy. Jake looked at her again and smiled, \"No I'm not a mind reading alien from Mars\" he says looking at his tiny guest. She sighs but Jake then adds in \"I'm from Jupiter.\" Rosa looked up in fear and began to pray he wasn't going to cut her open like a frog which made Jake laugh so hard he feel to the floor. \"Sorry I make that joke a lot. I am human I'm just good at reading people that's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosa was confused but tried to keep a smile on. \"So Uh.... what do you plan on doing to me?\" Rosa asked hoping to be released.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to keep you here with me.\" Jake said crushing her hopes. In truth Rosa doesn't have a family or past life. She was about five when she shrunk and grew up alone. If Jake could read her this easy she wasn't about to lie to him. \"See believe it or not I'm kind of a loner and with you here I won't be so lonely anymore so I'll keep you with me. Treating you the best way I can.\" Jake said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I'd be your pet?\" Rosa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you'd be my friend. I'll even give you back your clothes and weapons if you agree.\"</span></div></div>",

She was only six inches tall, stuck in a jar at the mercy of anyone who wanted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you don't want to you don't have to be my friend.\"'Jake said kind of deaferedly. She was taking a long time and it seemed she was plotting a way to escape. \"Here.\" Jake said as he tipped the jar over and she landed on his hand that had her weapons and clothes in them. \"You can leave and never return, taking what you want or you can stay here. Your choice Rosa\" Jake said as put her on the floor near the door. \"I'm going to be out side taking care of my garden and checking the animals outback if you decide to stay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n And with that Jake walked outside leaving her to think what she was going to do. Jake made it too hard for her to leave so she put her clothes and weapons on and ran outback to find Jake in a play pin full of chicken and ducks. She ran over to Jake and climbed his leg climbing all the way to his ear. Not sure if he felt her or not she walked to his ear and said, \"I'll stay with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake jerked his head up and turnned into her rubbing her into his shoulder gently say \"Thank you Rosa.

This confused him sticks aren\u2019t supposed to make noises when they fall he though. He looked over his shoulder and saw a little girl he guesses was about 6 inches tall and about 15 like him, she was also looking very beat up with scratches all down her arms and legs, her clothes that she was wearing was in shambles. He could see that she was almost unconscious and was slipping from his shoulder. He quickly grabbed her before she fell to the ground and had her sitting in his hand; she tried to say something but lost consciousness before she could say anything. Jake did not know what to do he looked around him and saw he was the only one around. He cupped her and quickly ran home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake was not popular, he had some friends but defiantly not the most popular person in school. But he did have a secret from the other kids at school, which was his family was unbelievably rich. His dad was a decent doctor but nothing super special then his mom was the biggest lawyer in the next 6 counties all of her clients were very wealthy and paid her well for winning their cases, the kids as school could not put it together that his family was wealthy because his mom the only one that everyone knew but she used her madden name for her law firm so everyone thought it was not his mom. That being said he lived in a decent sized house, it was big enough to need some staff but it was a small staff of about 4 people. His parents were busy and would spend some time with Jake and Amanda but it was mostly the maids and butler that raised him and his little sister Amanda. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he opened the front door he looked around and did not see anyone he then ran to his bathroom where he had some first aid supplies. He got in to the bathroom with no one seeing him and closed and locked the door. Setting the girl on the counter he looked at her. The bleeding looks like it had at least slowed down on the way home but she was still bleeding and out cold. Her clothes were in shreds and he began to wonder what happened to her. She looked about the size of one of his sisters Barbie dolls so he could steal some of the clothes from one of them that she will not notice. Then he went to addressing her wounds.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nUsing what little he had and what little his dad taught him about dressing wounds he thought he did a good job at stopping the bleeding and bandaging her up but she still looked beat up. He cleaned the counter so the maids would not get suspicious of anything when they came in to clean.

Since your dad would only be about five minutes of your life a week and he was there 24/7 you have seen him as a father. Since you were seven you asked Lucas to stop calling you \"sir\", or \"master Jake\" and you asked him for help like a father would do for his son. Take you and the few friends you had  to go to watch football out in the stadium. He has even told you about the \"Birds and the Bees\" talk with you. You could tell when he was lying and needed help and the same way for him. He was married to one a maid name May, you haven't talked to the maids because they have kind have been busy taking care of your sister. Not because she needed help but she loves to have attention no matter what so they had to please her \"needs\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew he could tell you ly a mile way so you had to think of how to mix the truth in it to. \"I'm fine Lucas,\" you say as you threw away the bandages you just used.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" Lucas said. \"Anything happen at school today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing happen in school.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about the way to or from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Damn it he's good', you think.

She was beaten really bad but there was nothing I could really do for her. A man walked by and asked me what happen. I told him just call the hospital and make sure she was okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was nice of you.\" Lucas said. 'Did I just ly to Lucas and get way with it?' you think. \"Now tell me the whole truth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'GOD DAMN IT he is good,' is all you can think. You look at the tiny girl in you hand and think do I show Lucas or do I just try and ly again? \"Uh Lucas I'm not real sure you would Believe me if I told you the truth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay I was walking home when I felt something hit my shoulder and make an a uff sound. I look and see a tiny girl on my shoulder and she was about to fall off so I grab her and hold her in my hand. She was about to say something when she pasted out. She was really beaten up so I brought her home and I bandaged her wounds when you came here and ....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh I understand your not sure who to trust with her so your trying to figure out what you should do before you try and have others involved.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.... Why do you believe this when you the other one is more believable?\" you asked as you opened the door to Lucas. The tiny girl is in you left hand as you open the door with your right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jake it's not that hard. Just think what would a fifteen year old boy would be doing with bandages in his backpack as he walked home or send thirty minutes in the bathroom without making any grunting sounds. Then the fact that you looked lime you were trying to sneak another pet in again\" Lucas chuckled the last part remembering the last time you tried to sneak a pet in. Boy was your mom pissed when she found a pee mark on her carpet and found your pet chewing her hairdyer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want to see her?\" is all you can say knowing that it would be nice to have Lucas help you takecare of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You trust me that much?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I trust you more then my mom and dad so yes\" you say with a smile on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright where is she?\" Lucas asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right here.\" you raise your hand in front of Lucas and open it. There she was still asleep with the barby doll clothes you stole from your sister. She was in a green tangtop shirt and dark blue shorts. You even stole the matching flip-flops that were white. She had a few scratches on her arms but nothing very deep and that you had to worry about. She had had very pretty blond hair that had some brown mixed in with it.

Where am I?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You then watch as she attempts to crawl away from you, still on your shoulder.

I go to school with the twins, your little sister Amy, and your little brother Billy. The last thing I knew before I found myself on your shoulder is walking over to a school dance.

For an eleven-year-old girl you sure have a nice rack and a nice ass, you think to yourself quietly. Those perky size B breasts must be getting close to C size you think.

She looks around to find a way off when she sees that the blanket that she was laying on stretched all the way to the floor. Taking her only chance of escape she slides down to the ground. Once on the ground she looked for a place to hide in case the giant came back. Looking around she then found that across the floor was a dresser that had plenty of room to hide under. Sadly the distance seemed to look like it would take a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have to do this,\u201d Orihime said running across the floor as fast as her legs could carry her.

Once she had to stop for being out of breath she found a giant shoe near the dresser. \u201cI have to be at least two inches tall,\u201d Orihime said. \u201cOh what could have happened to me?!?\u201d she yelled. She looked around in case the giant had heard her but because she was so small no one could hear her unless they were in the same room with her. Sighing knowing that if she wanted to do anything she would need help from the giant or work her ass off to get it done. As she walked towards the dresser she had a few things were on her mind. <i> I\u2019m so hungry, why did this happen to me, what will that giant do to me, will I ever see my friends again, will I </i> Her thoughts were interrupted by the ground shaking and a load voice.<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026 Orih\u2026I mean uh tiny girl.\u201d Orihime looked back at the dresser and just ran to it with her remaining strength.

Rich snobby assholes that get what they want and don\u2019t understand the word NO. I felt insulted to be near them and one tried to fight me because I told him what I thought of him. I beat him horribly and got kicked out. I told my parent\u2019s just send me to a regular school and they did, a little agreement here and there but I got convinced them otherwise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh. But why are you different than them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell because my family was never rich until four years ago. My parents are what you would consider mad scientists that do what they put their mind to. They were failing at most of their projects but now they discovered something new and have gotten our riches like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did they do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey do a lot of things, from human soldiers\u2019 improvements, weapons, turning animals into furriers, and a lot of other things. They do a LOT of strange things. Funny story, the time they perfect the animal into furry thing they asked me to take care of her. She was scared that she might be just a test dummy I told her that as long as you think for yourself, and have dreams and beliefs then you\u2019re not a test dummy, or an animal, but a living breathing person.\u201d You say with a smile remembering how happy she was when she heard you say that. \u201cWell here we\u2019re at the computer.\u201d You seat down and type into Google search bar BLEACH WIKI.

Then something strange happens again. Another portal appeared between you guys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the\u2026\u201d was what your parents said. Looking at the portal you see a man walk out of it. That\u2019s when you noticed this wasn\u2019t some random guy; this guy was from bleach too. But who was he? Strating to think you go from strongest to weakest and remember this guy is the seventh espada. Zommari Rureaux, 7th espada! <i>Oh shit what the hell is he doing here?</i> With him looking right at Rukia he finds Orihime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is interesting. So it seems that the first teleport was more successful then the second. Still have to move the location but I\u2019m sure to tell Szayel Aporro Granz about the error. But I\u2019ll take Orihime now.\u201d You and Marry then stand in between the espada and Orihime. \u201cAre you going to stop me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes we are,\u201d you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd to get though him you have to get through me,\u201d Mary said stepping in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay then,\u201d Rureaux said, then took off in a mad dash, but not at blinding speeds just a run. Mary sees him coming and pulling out his sword, so she front flips above and jumps on his back grabbing his shoulders and flipping him over. While he was in midair you jump right up in front and kick him dead center of his chest, sending him flat on his face. \u201cStrange,\u201d He said as he got up, \u201cIt seems like my powers don\u2019t work here.\u201d He looks at the portal he entered and some long tentacle grabs him and pulls him right back to his dimension. Looking over at your parents they just look at the portal as it fades away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cInteresting, so they have the technology to teleport to dimension to dimension?\u201d your mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure But I can say that we might get drugged off into a war,\u201d you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWill aren\u2019t they from your manga and anime, Bleach?\u201d your dad asks, you nod. \u201cThen you know how this will turn out. Mmmmm I think if we could send them back with you and Marry we might be able to turn the tides.\u201d You know your dad too well, whenever he wants to \u201csend\u201d you somewhere it\u2019s to gather information and give it back to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell at least I grabbed this thingy from, his belt,\u201d Marry said showing a strange ball that has a green glow around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery good Marry, now Will is it okay if we take a blood sample from the both of them, just for simple test, and a cat scan or two?\u201d your mom asked you nicely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMom it\u2019s their choice,\u201d you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be fine with it uh\u2026\u201d Rukia said not knowing what to call your parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRukia,\u201d you say, \u201cjust call them by their names, Mark and June.\u201d Rukia nods.</span></div></div>",

They saw the torch light but it was what lite it that scared them. What light the torch was a dragon. The dragon was tall, to them, had to be over thirty feet tall. In truth he is twelve feet tall. The head is a mix of a human's face and a dragon's muzzle. With a dark green scales on top side of his body. As for the underbelly was a lime green shade. The whole body had scales but it seemed to be human if it wasn't for the the the spikes that cover his forearms, a long narrow tail, and talons on the end of his fingers and toes. Two long horns grow out of his head that looked like their friend Chopper's horns only his are pointed out and a little further apart. \"Do I scare you?\" he asked. In truth he seemed to long like a human dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you?\" Viven asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am a half breed. My mother was dragon, father human, making me the freak. Anything else you wish to know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What type of dragon was your mother?\" Robin asked remembering that some dragon types are friendlier then others in some of the ancient text she has found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forest the scale colors tell what dragons are what. Forest dragons do breathe fire but it's not as strong as others. We can sense where anyone or thing is in a forest and tell about everything about it, once skilled enough that is,\" he said looking down at each of them. \"Strange, I have never seen humans with blue or red hair before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know we're humans?\" Nami asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your smell is human. Fairies have a more natural smell to them, while humans are more .... Um, polluted I would say. Though I do wonder why your only a foot tall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Polluted?\" Viven asked. \"Why would you say that if your a half of us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I have never lived with humans but the smell of their work is what poisons everything in the forest. And to be honest my dragon side took kinder to us then my human half. My dragon half teaches us how to talk with other creatures and try to make peace. Along with how to fight if needed and to hunt,\" the dragon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that is how you speak English,\" Robin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you have nothing you wish to do to us?\" Nami asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing but I will warn you, from seeing the way you are dressed means your not from here. So if you do need help with anything I can point you in the right direction, but from there your on your own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have any maps of local areas and of the whole world if you'd have one?\" Nami asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom collected a lot of things people dropped most were maps and some gold here and there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much gold are we talking about?\" Nami asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well just gold, enough to buy a small castle. Along with everything else is enough to buy a small kingdom,\" looking into Nami's eyes he saw the greed grow greatly. \"But I will NEVER sell any of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on big boy,\" Nami said doing a seductive dance towards the dragon. \"Why don't you give it to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No that's my mother's treasure and I swore to her That no one will ever find it. Now I'm off to gather the maps the torch will stay here so you three can explore a little.\" And with that the dragon walked off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what should we do?\" Viven asked.</span></div></div>",

The other two were maps of nearby towns that they could  stay. \"And if you need help you know where to find me and/or the fairies.\" The last one was a map of the world where the three women realized that they were no longer on their planet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for everything you have done for us,\" Robin said. \"But aren't these maps your mother's?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes they are, but I was hoping that once you have a place to stay you can return the maps to me,\" the dragon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well can fairies teleport people to other worlds?\" Viven asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait your not from her? Oh well that explains a couple of things,\" the dragon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?\" Nami asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You all smell like the the ocean. Your clothing isn't from anywhere around here, lack of knowledge,  and a couple of other things,\" the dragon stopped and thought for a moment. \"Well I...\" before he finished a spear flew right at the dragon's shoulder hitting it dead on. Holding his breathe the dragon grabbed the three girls and retreated to his treasure room. He left the torch so the women wouldn't find them, nor his attacker know where he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The beast is here!\" some man yell. \"I'm not sure if Joe hit the beast. Let's find out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's happening?!\" Viven asked shivering out of her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dragon hunters,\" the dragon whispered. \"They don't care if we're peaceful creatures or not, they just want us as dragon armor, or to sell our hides.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's sick.\" Viven said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is but their hit bounced off of me. Dragon scales are stronger then any man made weapon, that's why our hides are worth three bags of gold,\" the dragon said backing up hearing foot steps come closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like the creature ran into one of the tunnels. It would be suicide to try and find it. Let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon waited for a moment or two before moving again. \"They're waiting outside of the cave. Best chance is the roof.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" they all ask. Before he gave an answer his wings unfolded and in two seconds they were airborne. Drak keep his hands cupped and put them close to his chest so the cold air wouldn't harm them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, but that is the only way to get out of there other then the front door way,\" Drak said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could have warned us!\" Viven yelled as they flew through the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well At least I have the maps. Without them we would be horribly lost. Now,\" looking at the maps, \"the flight should be five minutes.\" Drak smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's it like,\" Robin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To be a halving, both sides make fun of me and most wish to kill me. Other then that it's okay.\" Drak said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we have a captain named Luffy that would love to have you on the crew if you want to join,\" Robin said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not sure, dragons took me in and taught me how to speak English, how to fly, breathe flames, everything I know they taught me. And to join a group of humans who I just meet? Sorry but I need to know you better and then I still might not go,\" said Drak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe I remember how Luffy got me to join,\" Nami began. \"When we first meet I thought he was just another dumb-ass, stole his ship, and in the end he helped me with a problem I had, I still don\u2019t know what I would have done if he didn\u2019t help.\u201d Nami started to cry a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh Nami what did Luffy help you with?\u201d Viven asked while rubbing her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell a fishman named Arlong, he took control of my town, and \u2026 and \u2026\u201dNami started to cry harder. \u201cHe killed my mother. I joined his crew to so I could buy the town back but that dirt ass bastard broke the deal and, Luffy beat him all in the name of our friendship,\u201dNami started to laugh, \u201cIn fact he didn\u2019t force me to join, or do anything, I joined and stayed through thick and thin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Nami, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Viven said.

I wouldn\u2019t mind taking to him some day,\u201d Drak said still flying to the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three girls started to laugh, Viven said, \u201cLuffy\u2019s not a smart guy, but he knows that if something bugs his friends, he will put an end to it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, is there anyone else on our crew?\u201d Drak asked looking down, making sure he didn\u2019t past the fairies domain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell Luffy\u2019s our captain.

But sadly because the fact both your parents are travel freaks you can never stay in the same place too long. When you were five you they started their travel businesses. Your dad is one of the lead heads of a famous car industry. He fixes all the problems the company\u2019s machinery has. As for your mom, she is the lead of a help helping other countries. She basically goes from one country to the next, while you dad goes from one side of the country to another. You usually went with your dad, but since they got a divorce when you were eight, you went around the world with both of them. To make friends was rare for you. To see your any of your old friends again was even rarer. Right now you\u2019re staying with your dad as he fixes the machinery in New Jersey. You\u2019ve never been here before, so it\u2019s a new start, for the next two to three months before you go with your mom to Kenya, another place you have never been. Now with the new school you\u2019re going to, no seems to like you so you\u2019re on your own for the most part. As you walk to the hotel on today something hit\u2019s your shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked over and saw a tiny girl on your should, before you got a good look at her, she got up and jumped off your shoulder. It happened so fast that, you weren\u2019t sure what just happened. You keep walking, trying not to look strange, but you also think about what just happened. A tiny girl fell out of a tree, onto your shoulder and then jumped off. You looked back to the tree and saw the drop she had, it looked that she might have feel from a low branch, maybe a foot from your head. If she jumped off it would have been at least a five foot drop, and at her size, that would have hurt. Looking back at the sidewalk, there was no blood or little girl. So what happened to her? You shake your head. Then a cold breeze hit you. Your ears start to freeze a bit; you put up your hood\u2026. Your hood! She must have jumped in your hood, but was she still there? You had a couple of more feet to go before you were at the hotel. Once you get in the elevator you find yourself alone, sort of. You turned your jacket around and looked in the hood to see the tiny girl still there. Once again before you can see her, the elevator stops and it\u2019s your stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh on the inside as you fix your hood and walk into your bedroom. You turn your hood around again to see she is still in there. She is now cowering in fear, it seems that she thought she was hidden and you didn\u2019t notice her, until you turned your hood around the first time. You pick her up out of the hood, and you can hear cries. You rub her back and try to calm her down. Looking at her clothing, she has some well sown dress, made of some fabric. She had the basics clothing, but what she had on her back confused you. It was a stick made of a couple of things, maybe a walking stick, or a weapon of some sort?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d she asked you. You were taken back, she could talk?! You\u2019re having a hard time understanding the fact that you have a tiny girl in your hand, let alone for her to be able to talk. <i>Well she does look human. I shouldn\u2019t be surprised if she can speak English. </i> you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi,\u201d you say, and she just gives you a look, which causes you to remember her question. \u201cI want to know why you jumped in my hood.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks at you for a bit, looking a like confused, but she responds, \u201cIt was either that or be...\u201d she stopped in order to think of something, \u201cWhat do you call the things with puffy tails?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSquirrels?\u201d you answer, wondering why she would ask that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally, we call them jumpers but okay. I would have been squirrel food if I didn\u2019t jump in your \u201chood\u201d.\u201d The way she talked seemed to be like she knew what she was talking about, but had different names for some things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMay I ask what your name is?\u201d you ask her.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
