Truth be told it was a bad movie.  John started toward's their apartment building when he noticed Kyle wasn't following him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn turned around to see him staring at the sky.  \"What are you looking at dude?\"  He asked.  Kyle pointed.  \"Do you see that rainbow?\"  John laughed.  \"Come on are you really amazed by a stupid rainbow?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This one looks funny to me somehow.  It looks like its ending in the woods over there.\"  He said transfixed a the sight in the sky.  John squinted.  It did kind of look like it was going into the woods, but that was impossible.  Rainbows don't have ends.  They are just an illusion.  It appeared to start somewhere far away then grew larger down into the trees next to the apartments.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be silly.\" John said about to turn around to go up to his apartment when Kyle took off running out of the parking lot into the woods.  John sighed then followed him in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kyle slow down.  There might be coyotes out here or something.\"  John said panting.  Kyle slowed down.  John understood why.  The forest was dark but there was a colorful glow coming out of the darkness.  They approached cautiously and came to a clearing with a dazing and blinding rainbow light where the rainbow ended.  They shielded their eyes and approached where it touched the ground.  As soon as they reached it the light went out.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a minute for their eyes to readjust the darkness.  In the middle of the clearing in front of them was a black iron cauldron.   \"Holy shit the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow!\"  Exclaimed Kyle.  He put his hands on the rim and peered inside.  He frowned then bent his body over and reached deep to the bottom and pulled out a single coin.  \"There is only one coin.\"  He reported holding up his hand.  There was a single gold coin with the image of an ugly leprechaun glaring back at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn pointed at the iron cauldron.  \"Look there is an inscription!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Coin of Wishing - Your hearts desire will be granted, but after one the coin shall be depleted.  Don't despair, for you only have to share!</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does that mean?  You can make one wish then its depleted?\"  John asked.  \"I don't know lets see if it works.  I wish I had a latte with extra whipped cream.\"  Kyle said loudly and clearly to John's disbelief.  Did he really waste a potential wish on a coffee?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo both of their amazement a latte with extra whipped cream appeared in Kyle's hand.  Kyle took a sip and it left a cream mustache.  \"Awesome!\"  He exclaimed.  \"I wish I had a hamburger!\"  He said next.  Nothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you didn't waste our chance at a wish.\"  John said annoyed.  Kyle looked down at the coin.  \"Woah its different look\"  He held the coin for John to see.   While before the image of the leprechaun seemed to glare at them, now his eyes were closed.  \"Let me see.\"  John said holding out a hand.  Kyle dropped the coin in his palm.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The eyes are open again!  Maybe thats what it means that we have to share.  Once you make a wish it depletes the coin until someone else makes a wish.\"  John said.  He held out his empty hand.  \"I wish I had a hundred dollar bill.\"   The money appeared in his hand.  This was incredible.  The coin's eyes were now closed again.  John handed the coin back to Kyle and the eyes opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets get back to the apartment I am freezing out here.\" Kyle said.  He puts the coin in his pocket and they leave the woods and towards their building.</span></div></div>",

Once sounded like Lexi, one of the girls that lived in the apartment next to theirs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That must be Lexi and Katie coming home.\"  Kyle said.  He had a big crush on her but she never seemed to notice him.  \"Saaay... do you think this coin could.\"  He cleared his throat.  \"Ahem I wish there was nothing Lexi wanted more in this world than to love me.\"  He said with an evil grin gesturing towards himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn's jaw dropped.  Did Kyle really just wish for that?  What was going to happen?  The talking outside stopped and the doorbell rang.  Both boys stared at each other frozen and not sure what to do.  Now there was knocking.  \"Well go answer it.  You made the wish.\"  John said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle's look of astonishment showed that he didn't actually expect anything to happen like this.  He put the gold coin on the coffee table, got up and went to the entry way.  John couldn't see who was there when he opened it  but sat there on the couch waiting.  There was some muffled speaking then he could hear the front door close.  Kyle walked back into the living room holding hands and followed by Lexi!  She was giggling and staring at Kyle like she was in love.  Kyle looked at John wide eyed and amazed and the two went down the hall towards his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just like that.\"  John said shaking his head and picking up the gold coin.  He could see through the blinds the outline of a person still waiting out on the landing.  They obviously didn't understand why their conversation was cut so short or if Lexi planned on coming back.  \"That must be Katie.\"  John said in a low voice.  He stood up, his heart pounding.  He always had sort of a thing for Katie, but too shy to ever try and talk to her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Kyle could do it, why not him.  He slowly walked towards the front door.  \"I wish that when I opened the door she would fall madly in love with me.  \"  He said gripping the coin.  He opened the door and to his surprise saw </span></div></div>",

Hi Candace I thought you were someone else..\" John began to say.  Candace was giving him the most alluring gaze as she looked him up and down taking in every inch of him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh god what have I done... </i>Thought John.  Candace was wearing stretchy yoga pants and an oversized maternity sweater. She was very pretty but also very pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John did you know I adore you?\"  She said walking in through the front door uninvited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Candace, um now isn't a good time..\"  John said nervously.  He looked at the Leprechaun's coin in his palm.  The Leprechaun on the front of the coin had his eyes closed.  He couldn't make another wish until someone makes a wish on this coin first what was he going to do?<br>\r\n <br>\r\nShe made herself at home and curled up on the couch.  She patted the seat next to her.  \"Why don't you come on over and have a seat next to me?\"  She said winking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn laughed nervously.  If her husband Howard found out what was going on right now he would be pissed!  \"Candace I don't think its a good idea for you to be over here\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle walked down the hall pulling a shirt over his head. \"Hey I thought I heard you talking to someone... oh hello there.\"  He said surprised to see Candace on their couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I uh.. thought Katie was outside and you know.\"  John said.  Kyle understood.  Lexi left the bedroom in her underwear and wearing one of Kyle's oversized shirts to also see what all of the commotion was about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandace got up and leaned over and kissed John.  He blushed.  \"Aren't you married?\"  John laughed nervously.  Candace pulled off her wedding ring and threw it on the ground.  \"I don't care about him anymore, all I want is you.  I should have never had this baby.\"  She said looking at her large bump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn idea flashed across John's mind.  Well she said it herself, what if he did pursue this relationship?  He could always wish this baby onto someone else.  That way Howard still has his baby just with someone else.  It felt so wrong yet she suggested it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn handed Kyle the coin.  \"I need you to have a turn.\"  John said looking him in the eye seriously.  Kyle understood.  \"Oh yeah sure.  I wish I had a latte with extra whipped cream.  \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe latte appeared in Kyle's hand and he took a sip of it handing the coin back to John.  This was probably not a good idea.  Both girls saw this latte materialize out of thin air and looked amazed and confused.  Lexi was looking from the latte and back to the coin in John's hand.  This might not end well if those girls find out about the wishing coin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn looked down at his hand and the ugly leprechaun glaring at him from the coin.  Did he really want to try this out with Candace?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What kind of chaos could a girl magically bewitched to fall in love with Kyle cause?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLexi looked at Candace.  \"You may regret your relationship with Howard, but my love for Kyle will never falter.\"  She held up the coin and looked at if very seriously.  \"You may no longer want to have kids but I wish me and Kyle had a baby together.\"</span></div></div>",

He opened his mouth \"Uh Maria..\"  His speech was interrupted yet again as Maria stuck her tongue in his mouth as she continued to try and passionately kiss him.  John pulled away and  took a few steps backwards then headed back to the living room where the magic coin was sitting on the coffee table.  He was in complete shock.  Never in a million years would he even imagine him and his neighbor Maria kissing like this in his apartment.  She was a beautiful and curvaceous lady but she was much older than him.  If anything he could have seen himself pursuing her daughter but this was so weird!  He turned  around to see Maria close the front door and follow him into the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe jumped over the couch and reached out and grabbed the magic coin.  The Leprechaun's head on the front was sleeping with his eyes closed.  He could not make another wish until someone else got a chance at this coin.  Maria joined him on the couch.  She still gave him that alluring gaze as if she was madly in love.  She put a hand over John's shoulder and put her other on his middle.  \"What do you want to do honey?\"  She rubbed him affectionately then put her hand on his upper thigh.  He felt a little aroused.   But he was caught off guard by the entire situation he wasn't ready to go do what Maria was suggesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well how about we uh watch some tv?\"  He put the coin back on the coffee table and picked up the remote and turned on the tv.  Maria put her legs on the couch comfortable and snuggled with him with her head on his chest as they watched the tv.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later out came Kyle with his arms around Lexi.  When he saw John on the couch with Maria his mouth dropped.  John mouthed the words <i>\"It was an accident!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle looked like he was trying not to burst out laughing.  Him and Lexi went to the kitchen and Lexi pulled out a pan and some bacon in the fridge to make Kyle a late night breakfast.  \"Hello Mrs' Sanchez\"  Kyle said beaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn had one arm around Maria and with his free left hand he pointed to the magic coin and looked at Kyle expectantly.  Kyle understood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Maria gave him a playful smile and put the hand with the coin behind her back.  \"Have what back?\" She said innocently before giggling.  She didn't realize what she was holding.  She brought it out for them all to see and John could see the leprechaun on the coin with his eyes open and giving that awful grimacing stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maria want some bacon?\"  Kyle piped in.  Lexi was almost done frying them up.  \"I can get you anything you need.  What do you want?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn was leaning over with an outstretched arm to grab the coin while Kyle was talking to Maria.  \"I just want John to be my husband.\"  She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn felt something cold bind his finger.  He looked down and to his surprise there was a gold ring on his finger.  Maria lifted up her hand and covered her mouth with a joyous expression.  She also had a ring with a diamond on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit!\" Kyle said then laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria wrapped her arms around her new husband and attempted to kiss him again.  Funny enough he didn't have any memory of ever marrying her.  Only the rings on their fingers changed.  John wondered if this was because he knew of the magic coin?  There was probably a lot of variables they didn't understand about the ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLexi saw Maria's ring and excitedly said \"Oh my god congratulations guys!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah congrats on the new wife dude.\" Kyle said laughing.  \"Mrs. Sanchez is a real catch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thats Mrs. Powell now.\"  Maria said crossing her arms.  \"Oh I stand corrected!\"  Kyle said grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLexi rummages through the fridge.  \"You guys don't have any champagne but here is a beer to celebrate!\"  Lexi pulled out a glass bottle of beer and shook it up.  She brought it into the living room and opened it.  Beer sprayed all over John's shirt.  \"Oops sorry!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God damn it Lexi.\"  He said angrily.  He got up and walked down the hall and opened up his bedroom door.  To his shock all of his belongings were gone and the room was empty.  \"What the hell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle followed him to see what was up.  They both stared blankly into the empty room.  \"Maybe now that you are married you live at Maria's now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn's heart sank.  Maria was overjoyed to hear this.  \"Lets go home then honey to get yourself changed up!\"  She grabbed his arm and tried to drag him down the hall.  \"Hold on, um dear I will meet you outside.\"  John said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Maria was out of earshot he whispered frantically to Kyle. <i> \"Dude where is the coin we need to fix this.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got it.\" Kyle said.  John held out his hand.  Kyle didn't move.  \"Come on give it to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle's face twisted to an evil grin.  \"I think you should go home with Maria tonight and try out this new life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!  Hell no give it to me!\"  John said in shock.  \"Hey I slept with Lexi you should see what its like to be with Maria for a day.\"  He stifled a laugh and tried to look serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but this was an accident!\"  John said.  Kyle had his hand in his pocket as if he was holding onto the coin.  John tried to lunge for it and Kyle stepped back and held the coin in the air.  \"Go spend the night at Maria's tonight and I'll give it back.  Just have fun man!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle wasn't giving it up.  John felt like he had no choice while Kyle wielded that power in his hands. He had no choice but to follow Maria to their apartment.  What about her daughter Gina?  Would she be shocked to find out he married her mother?  Or will she already know hes her stepdad?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There was what looked like a pit and next to it was a shovel sticking into the ground.  They stopped walking.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHesitantly Kyle walked over and looked into the pit.  \"There is nothing in here.\"  He reported.  \"Its pretty deep though.. woah!\"  He was standing on the edge and some dirt collapsed and he slid into the hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn ran forward.  \"You alright?\"  The hole must be almost 6 feet deep.  Kyle was standing up  tall and was still under the ground level.  \"Yeah.  I wonder why someone was digging this big hole.  Looks like they made some indents in the wall to climb out.\"  Kyle put his hands and feet into some small indents carved into the dirt wall and climbed his way out.  He grabbed John's hand and he pulled him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was hard to get out.  I bet they left to go get a ladder or something.  I wonder how far they plan on going?\"  Kyle kicked the shovel and it fell over and slid into the pit.  There was a loud <i><b>Clunk!</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you hear that?\"  Kyle jumped back into the hole.  \"Maybe if they stayed a while longer they would have found what they were searching for.\"  John said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the pit Kyle was shoving the shovel into the soft earth searching for what made the clunk sound.  He found it.  He dug a little more then with his hands he pulled something out of the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\"  John asked.  \"I'm not sure here.\"  Kyle held a box and John retrieved it.  He placed the box onto the ground.  It was an old wooden box held shut by nails.  Kyle threw up the shovel and crawled back out.  He put the point of the shovel into the lid of the box and pried it open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a4adee76422ee6febcdeed8cf711f20e/5223b690c08af1e1-70/s1280x1920/c8dcb8ace9e035c1ea1866e93322957317a641a5.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://66.media.tumblr.com/a4adee76422e...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a folded yellowed paper.  Kyle picked it up. To their surprise underneath was filled to the brim with syringe needles!  Like the ones they have at the Doctors office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think its drugs?\"  John picked some up carefully.  Most of them with clear liquid.  There were also some with bright blue liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle shook his head.  \"This is really weird look what it says.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe handed John the paper.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><font class=\"size35\" style=\"\"><b>Transformation Shots.</b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTransform your body into anyone you desire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Instructions:</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarvest a person's DNA.  This can be collected by retrieving hair, blood, etc.  To create a shot of that person, you remove the top of the syringe and add the DNA to the clear mixture.  The mixture will turn bright red signaling the shot is ready to use.  Simply inject into your body and you will slowly start transforming into that person starting from that point.  The same Transformation Shot can be used several times until the mixture is depleted.  It is not necessary to inject all of the mixture in one shot.  To speed up the changes you can inject in multiple spots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>This is very important!  When transforming one's self, always create a back up syringe of your own DNA.  If you fail to do this you may lose your original form forever.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue shot stops the transformation from spreading.  This is good for partial body transformations when you do not want to completely change into the person.  <br>\r\n<b><br>\r\nIf you fail to create a back  up shot of your own DNA, the blue shot will not save your original form.  If you use the shot half way through a transformation your new body will be whatever form you are in at that moment.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou may mix red shots of different people to create unique hybrids of that person.  Just simply inject yourself with two different red shots if you want to create a hybrid of two people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tips of the shot needle are very thin and coated with a numbing solution so the Transformation Shots will not sting.  This can be good for discreetly injecting a potential victim you wish to transform.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn shook his head.  \"What kind of idiot would inject themselves with this mystery liquid  Look how old that paper and box looks?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, but someone obviously wanted to find this.  There is only one way to find out I guess.\"  Kyle placed the instructions back in the box and picked it up and started heading back to their apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait where are you going?\"  John asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To see if I can find hair or something.  We should get out of here before they get back anyways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait you are actually going to inject yourself with one of these shots?\"  John asked in disbelief. </span></div></div>",

His left arm was now slightly shorter than his right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got a girl arm!\"  He said in disbelief.  \"Guess it does work.\"  He said and grinned at John.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a womans arm alright, but whose was it?  They will find out as the changes spread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His expanding hips and ass was really making his shorts tight.  He tried adjusting his shorts to keep them from crushing his junk but there was no hope.  His ass was only getting wider.  He patted his lower front and had a funny look on his face.  Maybe it was his imagination but his junk felt smaller than he remembered.  He better wrap this and up get rid of this person at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opens the door and to his utter shock Allison is standing there.  For a minute he was trying to figure out how she found out they were transforming into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi there, John right?\"  Allison asked.  John nodded.  He winced as his ass felt more compacted in his shorts.  \"Well someone just complained that there were muddy tracks all over the laundry room and they thought you and Kyle were in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn felt a little relieved.  For a moment he thought he got caught.  He was wincing and shifting around uncomfortably.   \"Um I don't think so.\"  He said to Allison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison narrowed her eyes.  She looked behind her at the ground.  John noticed there was some dirt trailing up the stairs and towards his apartment.  Allison looked back up at him and gave him a look like she didn't believe him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a loud tearing sound.  His shorts were being pulled apart at the crouch where the zipper parted and was beginning to tear.  There was no more room in these shorts for this ass to grow.  They were going to force their way out of these shorts one way or another.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison looked down at the sound and John saw her eyes bulged.  John looked down.  His heart pounded.  His legs were looking thick and his hips were wide.  You could see the front of his boxers were the shorts were being stretched apart.  He started feeling nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are.. you ok there John?\"  Allison asked.  \"Yeah I'm.. ok..\"  He said as there was another slight tearing of fabric.  His thighs had the circulation cut off.  \"You look a little swollen.\"  Allison said sounding concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think so?  I think these shorts might have shrunk in the wash...\"  He tried adjusting the pants so his boxers were not so visible.  Some felt different.  He suddenly noticed that his balls didn't feel crushed anymore.  He patted his front and realized his dick was gone.  John felt a bead of sweat form on his forehead.  <i>Just leave...</i> He thought frantically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison looked alarmed at both John's appearance and how he was touching himself.  John looked at Allison's lower body.  She was so fat.  He realized that his hips were going to keep growing to her size and that so would the rest of her body.  How could anyone let themselves go like that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n John gritted his teeth.  He put his thumb in the waistband of his shorts as if he could make them not so constricting and he thought he noticed his tummy feeling softer than he remembered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I just... want to let you guys know that if you make a mess you need to clean it up.\"  She handed John some form she printed out about Apartment Etiquette and respecting your neighbors.  It fell from Johns shaking fingers he was so anxious.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops\"  John said and he bent over to pick it up and there was a loud tearing sound as the back of his shorts split.  He let out a sigh of relief from the reduced pressure and stood up leaving the paper on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok Allison I'll talk to you later..\"  He said quickly trying to close the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison put up a hand and prevented him from closing the door.  \"Is Kyle in there I should tell him as well.\"  Allison was trying to sound stern like they were in big trouble but her eyes kept traveling down at the sight below John's waist.</span></div></div>",

Allison narrowed her eyes and pushed open the door and stepped inside.  \"I just want to tell him that... that.. oh my god..\"  Allison said stopping in her tracks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn sided stepped and looked around her shoulder and saw a strange sight indeed.  Kyle had been going through some dramatic changes of his own.  While Johns lower body was no longer recognizable on him, neither was Kyle's upper.  It looked like a fat blonde woman with skinny legs was sitting on the couch.  Kyle's fat belly was sticking out from his shirt and spilling onto his lap.  He has fully developed G cup breasts sagging down unsupported that could be clearly defined through his t shirt and cleavage was showing.  His flabby arms were identical to Allison's.  His blonde shoulder length hair was covering his face as he looked down and cradled his quivering gut in his hands.  He looked up at Allison gaping at him.  Kyle's face looked a lot like Allison's except slightly different as it was not yet 100% changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn's shorts were in tatters around his wide hips.  The only thing that kept them from dropping to the floor was how compressed the legs were around his thick thighs.  His boxers were skin tight, but since they were stretchy they miraculously were still covering his rear.  He could take it no further  He grunted and struggled to pull the shorts down his fat legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison looked back and forth between the two boys in horror.  \"What the hell is going on with you John and who is.. who is this?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn wondered if she recognized herself in Kyle or if she was just shocked by his too small clothes clinging to his fat body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn breathed a sigh of relief as he finally pulled the shorts off.  There were red rings on his thighs were the shorts were digging into and he now heard his boxers straining.  His belly was beginning to look a bit bloated.  The changes were spreading upward.  She was a big woman there was a lot to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you let Allison in here?\"  Asked Kyle.  He sounded identical to Allison now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He felt cool air on his rear end.  He tried pulling up his boxers over his large backside but it was no use.  His lower half was now identical to Allison's and although his boxers were stretchy he could no longer pull them over his fat wide ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis belly was now quite a plump gut now.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle stared at John's new shapely ass.  \"This is going to take some getting used to.\" John said looking back at his ass and how it jiggled as he walked.  He sank into the couch.  \"The couch is much more comfortable now.\"  He remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle stood up and grabbed his big flabby stomach and gave it a shake.  \"You think that is bad wait until you start lugging this thing around.  I feel so heavy.\"  Then Kyle pressed his tits together.  \"And these things are definitely a new life experience.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn was well on his way there and Kyle's ass seemed to be plumping up now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison looked back and forth between Johns expanding body and Kyle who looked like her twin from the belly up.  John pointed at her midsection. \"Look your belly is shrinking the shot worked.\"  He said.  Allison looked down and her belly did look smaller.  She looked wide eyed from the shot in her hand to her belly and back to the boys.  She started taking a few steps back and tripped over a footstool.  When she stood up her hair was messed up and her glasses were on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Allison this is all reversible.  We can return ourselves back to normal at any time.\"  John explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison turned her back then hurried out of the apartment with the shot still gripped tightly in her hand and her glasses on the floor.  John sighed.  His rounding belly was pushing out from under his shirt.  He felt his new girth.  \"You were not kidding I do feel so heavy.\"  He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle dropped his pants to the floor preparing for his ass to grow to Allison's size.  \"Well she is probably more than both of our weights combined.  How many Hostess cupcakes do you think someone's got to eat to get a belly this fat?\"  He slapped his fat gut.  He picked up the glasses Allison left behind and put them on.  \"Nice I can see clearly now!\"  He said laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think we should go get Allison?  I wonder who she is changing into.\"  John said sounding worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I got some clothes that might be big enough to contain this body.\" Kyle said and he walked down the hall towards his room with an audible creak with each footstep.  John spotted where he put down the shot that turned him into Allison.  He picked up the pen and wrote Allison on it, there was still a little bit left in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe bent down and set it down and picked up the other two needles that they already added DNA to.  There was the needle that had Kyle's name written on it, and the other needle had no writing.  \"Wait this must be the shot we added the black hair to.  I injected Allison with my self?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle came back down the hall.  He was wearing an over sized shirt and some stretchy pajama pants.  It looked like he stretched the neck of his shirt while he was putting it on.  \"Wait you injected Allison with your shot?\"  He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah looks like it.\"  John was now a bit worried that she took the shot with her.  That was his only way to return to normal.   Kyle pointed at John's chest.  \"Look\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn looked down and saw that he was sprouting breasts.  \"Wooah\"  He said amazed.  His voice sounded strange.  He cleared his throat.  \"Ahem.. hello?\"   His voice cracked and sounded more high pitched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you are getting a new voice.\" Kyle said.  Kyle already sounded like Allison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next few minutes they watched their bodies humorously.  John's breasts swelled bigger and bigger and his arms started to thicken.  Kyle was fascinated by his widening rear and was testing out sitting on different chairs and the floor to see how different it felt.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like your hair is turning blonde.\" Kyle said laughing.  John put a hand to his hair and it felt longer.  \"You think that's funny have you looked at your dick in a while?\"  Not being even being able to see his feet past his protruding belly anymore, Kyle reached down and felt around.  His eyes widened.  \"Oh shit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn laughed.  His hair was growing over his eyes.  He pushed it aside.  John grabbed the collar of his shirt and pulled like he was a wrestler trying to pry it open.  He ripped it a bit exposing his cleavage.  \"Hey thats a much better view.  If you got them might as well flaunt them!\"  Things around the room started getting fuzzy.  \"Woah I am getting her eye sight now.  You were right her eyes are bad.\" John remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle was in the kitchen testing out the wooden chairs with his new bum.  \"Yeah try these out.\" Kyle slid John the glasses over the counter and he put them on.  Both boys were about done transforming.  \"Wow crystal clear.

Think about it, you could finally get the chance to have Lexi's rocking body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you dense?\" John asked as his hand continued to shrink. \"That could be anyone's hair! There's more than one person in the world with blonde hair you know. And more than one in the apartment complex too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, wouldn't it be funny if this was that chubby Allison chick's hair?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, seriously. Did you even think about how I'm going to get back to normal? We didn't take a sample from myself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chill, man. I'm sure we'll have no problem finding a sample of hair from your room on something. Like a comb.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We better,\" John growled, though he was feeling rather odd now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he looked down to his right hand, he compared it to the unchanged left hand. It was like looking at two different people, though he could flex the right one and control it just like his own. It was slowly occurring to him that his body was now undergoing a complete transformation. At the rate of the spread, pretty soon he would be an entirely different person, be that Lexi or Allison or someone else in the apartment. He could feel his arm's reach shorten, leaving behind a mass of much softer and tender skin in its wake. The rash was spreading up his arm now and towards his shoulder. He could feel his veins pumping the soupy concoction towards the rest of his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fear came of what might happen if they couldn't find a sample of his old self. Would using a hair off of his transforming body be enough? Or would that leave him half himself or half whoever he was turning into? Would that be better than fully transforming into a girl? He didn't know, but he had to hurry and find his answer first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go,\" John ordered, pulling Kyle along with his dominate hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright,\" Kyle muttered, fumbling with the shots behind him. \"As you wish, princess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn ignored him as he could feel his blood literally boil. He couldn't help but wonder whose hair they had grabbed. Though he supposed he would find out soon enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it turned out, the hair belonged to...</span></div></div>",

Gina was wearing leggings with a flora pattern that really showed off her hips and Maria was wearing a green dress.  They were a family of curvy women for sure.  Kyle gave John a sly look and pointed at the box of Transformation Shots.  John handed him a fresh shot that still had the clear mixture in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria put an empty basket on one of the counter tops in the room.  Kyle looked at John, winked then approached her from behind.  Kyle poked the need into Maria's backside.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn's jaw dropped.  Maria didn't seem to notice at all, the letter said the needle would case no discomfort, but the shot had not melded with anyone's DNA yet.  What was Kyle's plan?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle pulled back the plunger and a red cloud appeared in the shot before the entire mixture turned bright red instantly.  That was an interesting idea John had to admit.  Instead of going through the trouble of finding a hair he just used the same needle to extract a drop of blood.  Very risky and strange, but effective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle wandered over to an open washing machine and inspected it.  He was trying to blend into the laundry room environment and not draw attention to himself.  He started walking back to the row of washing machines that John was waiting in and his hand flew out with the needle inconspicuously jabbed Gina in her butt and injected some of the red mixture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn's hand flew to his mouth as he stifled a laugh.  If this really worked Gina's perfect ass would be growing much fatter.  When Kyle came back to where he was John said \"I cannot believe you got away with all of that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey we needed a guinea pig right?\"  Kyle said grinning.   He put Maria's shot in the box.  \"Hey they got a pen in here.\"  He said pulling it out.  He wrote Maria's name on the shot.  That would come in handy once they start making transformation shots for more and more people.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know that black hair I found earlier could belong to Gina.  Her hair is about that long.\"  Kyle said thoughtfully.  They looked back at Gina and her ass looked as though it was thicker than when she walked in already.</span></div></div>",
