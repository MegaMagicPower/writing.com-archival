Looking in the want ads, she saw the local dairy store was hiring Milk Maids, with the treatment paid for, minimum five year contract, it all looked very reasonable but she just had to go see this for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo describe Lilly, she was below average height, standing at 5' 4\", with breasts that were just <i>barely</i> in the C-cup, had she been only a bit smaller, she'd qualify for a B cup, but she could fit in a C, and that's what she said she was.  She also had beautiful green eyes and a head of bright orange-red hair, and yes, her carpet matched her drapes, she was a natural redhead, no dyes in this girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello ma'am,\" an extremely endowed woman greeted her as she entered the lobby of Douglas' Dairy, \"how can we help you today?\"  Were the ladies breasts leaking?  Yep, some milk had begun to seep through the ladies blouse and drip onto the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm here for the milk maid job.\"  Lilly responded as confidently as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\"  The receptionist seemed surprised, \"In that case, here's the contract, if you agree to take the job, it'll take about a week for you to get to full size, though occasionally you keep growing.\"  She handed her a thin stack of papers, \"The last page is a chart to help you know when and how often to get milked.  Finding clothes that will fit is your own choice, we don't supply them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly tried to keep up with what the lady was saying and what she was checking and signing, but it was just so much in such a brief amount of time, that she truthfully didn't see what she was checking as she wrapped it up.  \"Here you go.\"  Lilly handed the packet back to the receptionist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking the papers over an humming. A bit, the receptionist nodded and dug around in a cabinet before taking out a small white pill.  \"Just take this and you'll be a milk maid in a week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly, feeling the ghost of chickening out, decided to go ahead and take the pill, swallowing it quickly.  \"Do you send me milk jugs or do I come here?\"  She asked as she started to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We do both, each week you send us back the jugs in the mail, we'll send you replacements, if you come here, you'll still have them at home in case you can't make it.\"  The receptionist shrugged, \"Saves money.  Have a good day!\"  She waved as Lilly left the building before returning to file Lilly's paperwork, looking briefly at the type of milk maid Lilly selected to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heifer-weight class.\"  The receptionist read the description: \"Largest bust size and milk output, will cause maids to be stuck on hands and knees due to weight and size.  Breasts span from chest to floor, occasionally larger, other side effect vary ... see geneticist for details.\"  Her eyebrows disappeared into her bangs before looking out the door at the shillouette of the red head walking down the street, \"Don't see too many of that size working here, hope she knows what she's getting into...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce back at her apartment, Lilly could feel the pill working, her breasts felt warm and her nipples extremely sensitive, feeling tired, she collapsed on her bed and in no time was snoring away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning...</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Hey there. Assuming you didn't get here by accident, welcome.<br>\r\nIm looking to produce a visual novel style game all about huge breasts! <br>\r\nUnfortunately, my writing skills are rather lacking and a visual novel relies on its story. That's where you come in. I want you to help me create the best narrative driven adult game I can!  Help me flesh out the story and make it interesting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow it works is pretty simple, just add a chapter to the story, or multiple chapters, and once there's enough chapters to begin a story, I'll edit them into a visual novel format. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne great thing about visual novels is they can have multiple stories just like writing.com's interactives!<br>\r\nI'll try to include the best of each chapter and give the player choices at specific chapters where I think the story breaks off into something really interesting! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo don't be shy, chip in and give me a hand. You may find the experience fun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf I do eventually get enough of a story going to turn into a game, it will of course be free to download.<br>\r\nAll contributors will be credited within the game's credits (unless you request not to be included) <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few rules:<br>\r\nI reserve the right to edit or delete chapters that I find too vague, poorly written or offensive. <br>\r\nThe focus of this story is breast expansion, try to keep this the main focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm a fairly open minded person, but I do have my limits. <br>\r\nAny chapters that include chapters or stories belonging to or written by somebody else, underage characters, furries, snuff, gore, scat, pro-violence or abuse themes or other generally gross or offensive content will be deleted or modified.<br>\r\nNo exceptions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther content I wish to not include:<br>\r\nWeight gain (unless it is about the breasts) <br>\r\nGeneral inflation (air, water, gas, magic, whatever, no inflation.)<br>\r\n\"readers choice\" or \"something else\" chapters (if you can't or won't contribute yourself, then please don't fill the story with useless and annoying one line chapters.)<br>\r\nLicensed characters (original only please.)<br>\r\nGiantess or shrinking (only the breasts grow and shrink.)<br>\r\nFutanari (no chicks with dicks please)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, while \"bigger is better\" is the aim of this story, remember to pace it out evenly, and refrain from adding ridiculous stuff like planet size boobies. Breasts don't grow 50 ton overnight. Try to limit the growth to reasonable sizes. I'm okay with unrealistically enormous breasts, but breasts that fill an entire football stadium just breaks down the story and makes no sense.</td>",
