The family set up some beach chairs, towels, and an umbrella on the sun-kissed sand. Blake sat himself on one of the chairs under their umbrella, when...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blake, honey, your sister and I are going to get some lunch. Want anything?\" Claire asked her son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks, I'm fine...\" Blake replied, before his sister and mother walked off to the nearby boardwalk for a good meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking forward, the mage watched the small waves of the ocean ahead. To his left, he noticed an occupied lifeguard tower, and to his right, a vacant volleyball court. Blake figured he might get bored to tears if nothing out of the ordinary occurred before his mom and sister returned from the boardwalk...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if fate was out to spite him, Blake saw his surroundings become bigger by the second. Was he having a shrinking episode?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not again..!\" By the time Blake finished speaking, he had already been reduced to the all-too-familiar size of half an inch. At least he was still in the shade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when his day couldn't get any stranger, the shrunken young man looked to his left and saw...</span></div></div>",

And what were the chances of her being at the same beach in the same place at the same time as he was? Questions he wondered but didn't need answers to at the moment. Blake looked upon her resting form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAria was resting in a yellow bikini, long strands connected to her bra piece that wound under her arm and sloped behind her back. Her chest the size of massive hills and her face resembling a stoic mountain. She was wearing sunglasses and a frilly yellow sunhat. Her skin was glazed slightly from sweat and the murky substance of what Blake could only assume was sunscreen. His eyes wandering down her body he found a similarly designed bikini bottom, her body the same all over. A unique feature that caught Blake's eyes, however, were her turquoise painted toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed that Aria was catching a tan unaware of her shrunken boyfriend in need of her assistance. Blake looked over her one last time before affirming that the person who would help him would be Aria herself, just as she had done when he first tried to impress her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake knew what he had to do. He was going to try and get his girlfriend's attention. Lookin out of the shade, a sea of hot sand awaited him. Blake groaned softly that he would have to cross a mini desert, but it beat being trapped alone at the beach. Setting out, Blake walked out of the shade and felt the blazing heat upon his diminished form. Blake covered his eyes and set out toward his resting girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of walking, he finally arrived at the towel of his girlfriend. Blake panted and clambered up and onto the cloth plane. As he regained his breath, he stared in awe at the sheer scale of his slumbering lover. It was enough to make Blake blush. He looked over and thought of a few ways to get her attention. He knew that the simplest way would be to climb onto her chest and wave her down, but from the sound of things, it seemed as if she were totally asleep. He could go to her face, but that in itself posed some dangers of being accidentally swallowed. Another way to get her attention would be to try and tickle her feet, something that had worked in the past when he was small though getting smothered and rubbed into hot sand wasn't appealing either, nor was getting stuck between her toes, clean as they were. Blake thinks for a moment and decides to go to...</span></div></div>",

We've been arranged to stay at a nice hotel in Tokyo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden thought occurred to Blake, replacing his excitement with nervousness. \"W-wait...I don't think I know the Japanese language!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire patted her son on the head. \"Don't worry.

It's been...honestly tiring.\" She then explained how her latest missions have been exhausting, both physically and mentally. It had become a rough time for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you decided to take some personal time?\" Blake asked. His cousin nodded, \"Yep, which is why I'm here now.\" She was thankful that her mother rubbed her back reassuringly. \"So, how have you been, kiddo?\" The military officer asked. \"Good. I've finally confessed to Aria.\" \"And?\" Jessica asked, receiving a smile from the mage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're now dating.\" He said, earning a hug from his cousin. \"Finally!

Jessica chuckled, \"Could've fooled me. Now, get some sleep. Okay, gem?\" Sapphire sighed and nodded, feeling her cousin rest his head on her shoulder, before they both went to sleep.

Even though they have been up this early multiple times, the kids still loved their beauty sleep. The two women would wake them up later.

There were no objections, so the family got their luggage and headed for the hotel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting to the building, it was decided that Claire and Jessica would sleep in one room, while their kids slept in the room next to theirs. The group put their luggage bags down and made sure they had keys to the rooms, before leaving to go to a restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey went to a hibachi, which was \"god-tier\" if you asked Blake, Sapphire, and Claire. By the time they got back to the hotel, it was close to 8:30. \"We should get ready for bed soon.\" Claire said. \"We have a lot of places to go tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter saying goodnight, the group went to their respective rooms. Sapphire immediately began getting ready for bed, saying, \"Getting ready first, because I know I'll fall asleep before either of you two get done.\" \"Hey, we are NOT that bad.\" Blake said, earning a chuckle from the military officer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure about that?\" Jade smirked. \"I can see me not being bad, but you take quite a while.\" \"You are no better than me and you know that.\" B<br>\r\nThe mage argued. Sapphire sighed, \"I think BOTH of you are bad.\", stopping the argument right there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got out of the bathroom, saying, \"I hope there's a hotspring nearby, because I need it.\" Blake nodded, knowing that she needed some rest after her busy time in the military. Jade was the next to get ready, allowing the mage and his cousin to have a private conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think it's wrong of me to think about leaving the military?\" The military officer asked. \"If you think that it will be good for you, I don't think it's wrong.\" The mage replied. \"I just want you to have a stable life.\" Sapphire nodded, \"I haven't talked to Mom about leaving yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should.\" Blake said. \"She might understand where you're coming from.\" Sapphire smirked, \"Since when did you become so wise?\" The mage chuckled, \"I learned from the best.\" Jade came out, yawning, \"Okay, I'm...done.\" Blake nodded, before saying goodnight to the two and went to get ready as his roommates went to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he got in, the mage began getting ready, only to be interrupted when he felt a stinging feeling in his head. He decided to get ready as fast as possible, getting out sooner than expected. 'Maybe some sleep will help.' He thought.

He didn't know whether it was the way she said it, or how she didn't even ask, but this greatly irritated him to the point of holding the phone back to the woman, who was already posing for her picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you didn't even ask me.

He stood there, listening as the woman began to chant something weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh magic, help me thrive. make my enemies change in size.

The somewhat pudgy fingers were quick in their motions, wrapping around the tiny man's body as they brought their victim up to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so brave now, are we little guy?

Didn't fink he'd catch on. Hmf. Must be a smarty pants from the states then. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmf, not too many o those. That should make things more interestin'~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake tries to crawl towards the door but passes out as he hears one of the sisters walking and placing her feet on his either side of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hope yer ready for some fun boy-o~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">                                                                                                                                                                                                    </span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Blake comes too he looks around and feels up his body, finding his clothes and belongings still on him. Except. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My phone!\" Blake looks around and as his vision adjusts he sees a giant figure holding something. As his eyes adjust further the figure easily become clear. Anne, holding his phone with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Howdy there boy-o~ Rest well?~ Ah reckon you were avin a right snooze weren't cha?~\" Bonnie steps out from behind her sister with an equally sadistic grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah reckon he was, seein how he's been out fer four hours,\" Bonnie says with a giggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lookin fer somethin lad?~\" Anne wiggles Blake's phone in front of him and giggles as well. \"Well. seems like yer a special, wee little lad. You knew what was about tah 'appen fore most other shmucks~ Familiar with magic are ye?~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-let me go! O-or there will be consequences!\" Blake says, hoping to sound intimidating. Apparently, though, it does nothing but amuse his captors as they laugh loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oo~ Consequences? From a wee tike like you? Oh that's rich!\" Anne says loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry little lad~ You belong to us now. We were just gonna sell ya to some fancy pants over in parliament, but ah dun think they'd take a person that can poof themselves back to normal say?~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye, reckon we ought to keep this' un for ourselves~\" Anne coos sweetly to her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye~ For, posterity sake o course~\" The two sisters beam down at him as Blake looks around and finally observes the mouse cage he's in. He backs up against the wall and waits for them. The two sisters chuckle and leave to talk about what to do with their new toy.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"What do ya say we find out how far this little bastard's gotten on his magical studies, eh Bonnie?\" Said Anne, as she bent down as to taunt Blake, simply sitting in the cage unable to do anything about his predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would we do that fer? What good is the wee man gonna be based on his abilities?\" Replied Bonnie, obviously confused at what her sister was implying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if the little bastard isn't powerful enough...\" Anne started back up, before her sister's eyes perked up, signaling that she had finally caught on to what she was talking about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we can-\" Bonnie was cut off as soon as she started to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't go tellin the wee lad, we don't want to ruin it...\" Anne said, as her sister nodded in approval. Whatever they had up their sleeves, Blake didn't like it. Especially if it was like the last trick they tried to pull on him. Obviously, they were experienced witches themselves, and based on their ability to shrink him, he knew that they would probably be strong enough to enact whatever they had in mind next. He needed to successfully maintain a bluff of his power, and to do so would require some skill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could even muster up a boast of his might, the mouse cage's door swung open, and the titanic slender fingers of Anne entered the place designated as his home. Blake squeaked, much to the humor of the two Scotts, who laughed as he was withdrawn from the cage and held in front of the gigantic face of Anne. She was beautiful, there was no doubt about that, but in his current predicament Blake had plenty of other women he would rather be around, trying his best to maintain a courageous face as her breath poured on to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So lil fella. Me and Bonnie have a special way of breakin our tiny folks in, but today you're not gonna get that. You're gettin the special treatment, the kind of stuff you Americans could only wish for at Guantanamo Bay.\" She chuckled after her statement, turning to her sister. \"What were you thinkin for the wee guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For him? Only the best Scotland has to offer! Hand em over and pull down your skirt!\" Bonnie said as she snatched Blake's petrified frame out of her grip. Maybe it was the foreign environment, or perhaps even just the strangers, but for some odd reason this time it felt different than the last time he shrank. He at least had some magical friends back then, but ever since he had lost contact with them. Now, he was stuck with these two sociopaths, and had no means of protecting himself from what they may have in store, and as Anne slipped off her skirt, something told him it wasn't in his best interests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what ya see little Yank? I got bad news for ya! You're not going in my lady bits, that's for sure!\" Anne cackled, as she turned around and slid the back of her panties down slightly, hanging them just below the entrance to her ass crack. It looked like a canyon from Blake's perspective, one that he noticed was getting closer and closer as Bonnie gripped his legs, dangling him by the two and giving him a good view of the butt. \"I'd recommend you only make us do this once, as I'm starting to get really bloody sweaty!\" Anne taunted, as it became clear that he was going in at least once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake didn't even get a pre-torture chance to give his answer, as he soon found out opening his mouth to yell was the wrong decision. As soon as his jaw parted, Bonnie inserted him into the large crack, Blake getting a mouthful of salt water from within the fleshy tomb. She maintained her grip on his legs, thumb and index finger tightly pressed against his shins as the warm flesh surrounded him. The only oxygen he got was humid, and smelled rank as the Scottish girls held him there for at least thirty seconds, no matter how much wiggling he did to try and escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, they decided to open up the questioning, and withdrew him from the horrid prison where he had been for the last half minute, still dangling him as Bonnie raised her arm up to make him at eye level with the pair. A cruel smile adorned Anne's face, looking at the man she had just had kicking around from within her butt, knowing that there was nothing that he could do to prevent her from doing it again. Bonnie seemed to be amused as well, but somewhat less thrilled about having her fingers submerged in her own sister's rear end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think yer ready to talk yet?\" Asked Bonnie, as she transitioned to a much more stern look, making Blake feel even more uneasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Please let me talk!\" Blake screamed at the top of his lungs, hoping to get the point across that he was ready for questioning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds as convincing as we're gonna get. Let the lad talk.\" Bonnie replied, signaling to her sister, who by this point seemed to be the leader of the couple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright buggie. How much magic ya got in you? We dealin with a newbie, or a grand mage?\" She said, trying to hold back a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a masterful high mage! You are all lucky that I haven't grown back and punished you like the scum you are, release me right now! This is your final chance!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two looked unimpressed at his statement, as thought they saw right through his bluff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you were a high mage, then you wouldn't have just been drowning in my ass sweat? You Americans really are thick, aren't ya? Oh well, I've made up my mind. You're gonna be sapped of any magical powers ya got, and then we're gonna</span></div></div>",

It just started hurting all of a sudden! I don't know why, I didn't eat anything that I thought was expired, and I definitely haven't eaten too much today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarn, it wasn't fun to be Jade right now... If only there was some way he could make her feel better...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHey, wait a minute! Drawing sudden inspiration from that old movie he'd seen a few nights previously, Blake realized that he could totally help out Jade! He could shrink himself down to a tiny size and get into her stomach to see what was causing her distress. It was a brilliant idea- with his magic he could protect himself (probably) from her stomach acids, so there wasn't much worry about getting hurt inside of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut getting Jade to agree to his plan was a different matter entirely. While she could be short-tempered, his little sister was quite a sweetie around him (at least, most of the time), so she probably wouldn't be entirely cool with anything that had even the slightest chance of Blake getting hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Blake reaaally wanted to try out his idea... So what was the best way to go about implementing it?</span></div></div>",

He pouted his lip contemplating how to tackle this and try out what he wanted at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it's just a stomach cramp? How long have you been having these symptoms?\" Jade groaned as she looked off to the side, shutting her eyes tight as she rubbed her aching belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... about an hour and a half? Maybe two hours?\" At his sister's expense, Blake knew the perfect way to execute his plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHmm... well aside from Pepto Bismol I-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ew! Yuck! You know I hate that stuff, makes me more sick than the stomach aches.\" Blake shrugs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then not much I can do than offer bedrest for now. If it gets worse then, of course, I'll help but belly aches aren't exactly medical emergencies... too often\" Blake said with a half chuckle. Jade glares at her brother and sighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. I guess I'll get a ride home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Blake blurts out. \"Erm... No. It might be a bit of a hazard. Tell you what. You can sleep in my office. I have a bottle of Zzzquil somewhere. You'll be out like a light and when you wake up, I can guarantee that your stomach ache will be gone!\" Jade pouts her lip and looks to the door then back to her doctor. She looks to the clock and sighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long will I be out?\" Blake smiles that his sister has taken up his assistance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Around 6-8 hours. Afterward, you'll still feel a teensy bit drowsy but by then I'm sure you'll feel better. It takes around 20-30 minutes for the medicine to take its effect.\" Jade nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suppose I won't be needing these then.\" Jade fishes into her pocket and hands over her car keys to her brother. \"got a room I can crash all day in?\" Blake sputters a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like... a patient room? No! I wouldn't let my sister sleep on something so uncomfortable. Here, follow me.\" Blake walks back to the door and opens it. Letting his sister into the back. Once in Blake follows after Jade, then leads her down the halls to his personal office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake unlocks the door and shows off his window office. A nice blue couch on against the glass and a small cubicle for his work, photos of his close friends and families. Jade walks in and looks around the room in awe. Blake smiles and looks on his desk and sees a photo of Aria with him shrunk. His eyes widen and he goes over and blocks the line of sight, putting the photo face-down onto the desk. Jade meanwhile is admiring his degrees and doctorates on display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this is where you put 'em~ Not too shabby big bro, not too shabby indeed. She turns to face him as Blake brings his hands back to his front pockets with a soft smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah well, it's my home away from home.\" Jade smiles and eyes the couch, walking over to it. She leans into it, sighing as her body collapses onto the soft surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feel free to put the pillows on the ground. Helps with space when you need a nap. Jade nods and complies, putting all three pillows on the floor. \"Right, I'll be right back. Just be use your phone for a bit. Charger iiiiiiiis over there.\" Blake says, pointing to it. \"I'll be right back and uh... don't look at anything.. please? Hippa laws and all that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry bro, ain't gonna snoop around..... unless you got something you're hiding.\" Blake blushes but smirks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like you'd ever find it.\" Jade's eyes widen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HA!\" She yells. \"Like YOU would have something to hide.\" Jade smiles and plugs her phone in. \"No worries bro, no snooping for me.\" Blake smiles and nods, closing the door and heading to the in-hospital pharmacy. <i>Phew... thank goodness for reverse psychology. I knew that class would come in handy someday!</i> Blake thinks with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake gets a bottle and returns to see Jade wince in pain again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey... mmm... that thing doesn't need food .. nnf... right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it should be fine.\" Blake un-caps everything and pours serving. He hands it to his sister who takes it quickly and downs it like a shot. Her face scrunched and she sticks out her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blegh... cherry flavored...\" Blake chuckles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, you should be out in 20 minutes. You can watch an episode of something.\" Jade nods before her eyes widen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! What about you? Don't you have patients you need to attend?\" Blake smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine. I can have someone fill in for me. Family emergency~ I can just do paperwork and still be doing my job. Jade relaxes and sighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, bro... you always got a plan,\" Jade says as she slips on some ear pods and watches some Netflix show. Blake smiles, enjoying the admiration of his sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter around 30 minutes Blake hears something land on a cushion. He turns to see Jade had dropped her phone onto one of the sofa cushions and was out like a light. Blake smiled and started enacting the second step of his plan. He had sent out an email telling his fellow staff not to be disturbed and to cover for him while he did his work. He gets up from his desk and gets on his knees. He arranges the cushions as makeshift steps and moves Jade's phone onto his desk so it can still charge. Blake gets up and locks the door just in case. He kneels on the bottom-most cushion and whispers a familiar chant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake's whispers increase in speed and complexity before suddenly he starts dwindling away on top of the seat cushion he was kneeling on. Blake smirked and saw how he was successful and carefully made his way to the second step of the seat cushions when he was the appropriate size. Quickly he passed from 5'8\", to 5', to 4'6\", 3'4\", 2'1, 1', 6\", to 3\", to finally 1.5 inches tall. In that time he had barely managed to climb the cushions onto the sofa and now stood close to his titanic sleeping sister. Blake could only stare in awe at the sheer size of his slumbering sibling. Blake stood right next to Jade's arm, able to see the individual fibers of her shirt as great threads to hold up the massive form of Jade's outfit. Blake could not help but admire the size of everything again. He had not been this size since ... well a few select times after High School, but other than those, not many other times. Blake turned around and inspected his office. The whole room felt so much bigger than before as if he was in some great ancient hall. Something that you'd read about in stories of heroes finding a treasure deep within a cursed temple. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGRRRRRRRRRNNNNNMMM <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake turned around and saw Jade turn her head in her sleep<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"mmm...\" The giant arm in front of him moved as it rested on top of Jade's stomach, the sound muffled under seemingly tons of flesh and cloth. Blake blushed and remembered his mission. To help his sister! He inspects the area and deduces the best way would be to climb up her sleeve and make his way to her mouth and find the problem head-on. It was fool-proof! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting out, Blake walked up to the massive sleeve and started climbing, grabbing climbs and finding purchase against the side of Jade's arm underneath the cloth. It was like climbing a massive blanket by the handfuls on top of a marshmallow. Soon though Blake is able to hoist himself upwards and gazes upon the landscape that is his sleeping sister. The plains of her stomach, the hills of her chest and the perilous cave entrance to her inner depths, sealed at the moment. Blake wastes little time and carefully makes his way over from her shoulder to her neck, stepping lively. He keeps walking crossing over her shirt collar to her bare neck. Blake carefully walks over to the underside of Jade's chin and yelps as the landscape shakes and a sound rings out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nmm...GLRK...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe neck bulges and lifts Blake up a bit as Jade seemingly swallowed some spit in her sleep and lets out a sleepy moan, trying to tiredly fight off her stomach ache herself. Blake blushes as soon he would be in a similar situation, not just on the opposite side but deep inside his own sister. Intrigued, he continues on and clambers up onto her chin, holding onto it in case Jade moves her face. As Blake crosses the top of Jade's chin he sees that her mouth is open, most likely a result of that reflex swallow. Carefully, Blake crawls on his belly towards his sister's lips, the soft skin offering easy traction to reach his goal. Soon Blake arrives on Jade's lower lip and feels the breaths of his mighty sister upon him. No air from her mouth, all from her nose as she breathed peacefully and easily. He'd have to give his thanks to Zzzquil after this was done and try some himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAir pulled into her nostrils and out in simple sessions, blowing the tiny mage doctor's hair around. Smiling and beyond excited, Blake peers over his sister's soft plush sticky lip and peers deep into her dormant maw. It was easy to see why Jade had swallowed as spit was already starting to pool in the back of her mouth again. Blake again found himself admiring the sheer scale of all that was before him. The squishy, bouncy, and playful muscle that was her tongue, her almost perfectly white teeth designed specifically for cutting and chewing morsels like himself, and her small uvula which laid cutely tucked away waiting for stimulation. Blake starts carefully moving forward to go headfirst into the mighty maw when Jade's face starts moving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tired groan echoes out from Jade's mouth as Jade starts closing her lips. Not wanting to waste this opportunity, Blake pulls himself forward just in time as Jade closes her mouth and rolls onto her right side. Blake is immediately sandwiched between the roof of Jade's mouth and her spit lathered tongue. A resounding moan roars in Blake's ears as Jade tiredly suckles on him. Blake groans and blushes and tries squirming forward. Jade's intrigued tongue rolls and probes the tiny mage against her palette roughly tongue-handling him. Blake winces and squirms and tries to keep moving forward as spit soaks his clothes and dampens his hair.</span></div></div>",

It had been nearly five years since he shrunk professed his love to Aria. Since then the two began happily dating. Blake and Aria graduated high school and are on their own adventures in college. Aria went to a university and shares a dorm/apartment. Blake goes to community college to get his general education out of the way. The two visit each other frequently and Aria still often teases Blake for shrinking. Most of Blake and Aria\u2019s close friends know the story by now and have generally either accepted it word for word or think it\u2019s some elaborate metaphor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake steps out of the shower and gets dressed. Once he does, he goes down stairs, making himself some breakfast. Blake has just finished his finals and was glad to be through them. Suddenly he hears thuds racing above him. Soon his younger sister Jade emerges from the staircase and quickly makes breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey shortstuff~\u201d Jade had seen Blake tiny firsthand and never truly got over the feeling of being the \u201cbig sister\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey sis.\u201d Blake replies. \u201cSomeone is dressed for fun.\u201d Truly Jade was. She wore a short t shirt that showed off her midriff  and preppy short shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDuh, I\u2019m hanging out with some friends for a graduation party. A goodbye to boring high school and a lovely hello to college life~\u201d Jade smiles as she poured some cereal and milk, eating rather quickly. \u201cBut yeah,\u201d she said with her mouth full. \u201cI\u2019m going out all night after finals today. Told ma I\u2019ll be home tomorrow afternoon... ish.\u201d Jade smiles and chugs the rest of her cereal down and finishes with a heafty sigh then a loud belch. \u201cOops~ \u2018scuse me. Alright, I\u2019m out. Later squirt.\u201d Blake chuckled, she had grown and changed  so fast these past few years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, whatever. Stay safe, \u201cbig sis\u201d,\u201d Blake said with a smirk. His comment earned a smile from Jade as she waved goodbye. She exits the house and gets into her friend\u2019s car. Blake hears the familiar car of x speed away. Blake sighs with a smile, \u201cteenagers.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake was planning something special for his 5 year anniversary. Aria and Blake has begun talking about moving in together. It was scary at first to Blake but he auickly came around. He was thinking of taking Aria of a tour of a place he picked out. A small two bedroom house that was close to both of those colleges and was close to downtown should they eventually get a job there. Blake couldn\u2019t wait to tell Aria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly as Blake is preparing to head out a spirit appears before him. It\u2019s the timid spirit that helped him along his journey. Blake is surprised but welcomes her eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-spirit! It\u2019s you! I ... I didn\u2019t expect to see you again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNor I you Blake. However... there is a matter of grave importance that requires your skills.\u201d The ethereal figure gestures towards Blake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy skills? You mean? My magic? I... I haven\u2019t practiced in years. I... I couldn\u2019t even summon a breeze.\u201d The spirit\u2019s figure starts to get twitchy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh... oh dear. This... this isn\u2019t good at all. Please Blake. You have to remember. There is an issue that\u2019s coming. I feel as if you\u2019re the one to help us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait.... us? What are you talking about?\u201d The spirit shifts in two before coming together, whispers seeping out from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTellHim.\u201d\u201dHeneedstoknow\u201d\u201dthisisouronlyhope?\u201d\u201dhecouldnthurtafl y\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSilence!\u201d The spirit says to herself. She regains her composure. \u201cYes... I house many spirits whithin me... even the two spirits who spoke with you before. There is a great evil that threatens all walks off life. From spirits, to mages, and even the mage hunters as well. We need you to help us.\u201d Blake was taken back by this. He truly had rarely ever casted after he started dating Aria, even swearing that he\u2019d hardly take the dark arts again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI... but I haven\u2019t practiced in ages! And I can hardly practice combat spells. Especially indoors.\u201d The spirit nods and bows her head when a few whispers speak to her. Her face lights up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes... yes yes! Of course! Blake! We shall shrink you again! You can try and do no damage to your world! No noticeable damage anyway! And we\u2019d be able to grant you much more strength and mana as well! Allowing to cast multiple spells on yourself at a time!\u201d Blake was even more shocked than finding out he would be facing off a \u201cgreat evil\u201d. Now they wanted him tiny as well?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait! What if this great evil finds me when I\u2019m tiny?\u201d The spirits whisper amongst themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is a good point. The evil is humanoid, that much we know... you should be able to hide from it, so long as you don\u2019t use too much mana.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t it detect a magically shrunken person?\u201d Blake retorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, to the evil it was sense you as alive and in magical like a mouse or... more accurately a bug.\u201d Blake grimaced. \u201cOur apologies. So Blake? Will you help us?\u201d The spirit extends her hand forward and looks to Blake expectantly. Blake thinks it over, pondering if this was truly the right way to go about things. He sighed as hesitantly extended his hand forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright I guess.... let\u2019s... save the world.\u201d The spirit smiles and giggled. She shook the two hands and Blake felt a great power surge within him. He felt himself becoming stronger than he had in ages. Eventually he starts to feel the power well into him. He felt himself slipping, which was normal he remembered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you Blake! Thank you so much! Please. Save us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later Blake groggily holds his head. He feels the strong magic coursing through his veins and sits up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh... and I was having such a good day too.\u201d Blake stands and stumbles a bit, getting familiar with his surroundings. Once things started to clear he realized just where he was. The giant furniture, the decorations. He was.</span></div></div>",

In the distance massive pictures of some of Aria's favorite bands and a massive clock. In fact, the posters were the same ones she had. Blake looked around once more and understood that the plastic slab was actually Aria's laptop, the structure around him was Aria's overhang wooden desk and the plain of cloth was her bed and that he was shrunk on her desk. <i>I\u2019ll never get used to this feeling\u2026</i> Blake thought to himself. He looked around and saw a few littered pens and pencils. He walks over to them and feels them. Their slick plastic coverings felt the same, just larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like I'm in Aria's room,\" Blake says to himself. He looks around a bit more and his gaze falls back onto her clock and he observes the time. 4:35. That's usually when she gets here so she should be here any-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCLICK. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake looks to his right to the door. It sounds like someone unlocking her door. Blake, nervous, hides behind the collapsed laptop. After a few moments, the door to the dorm opens and a few moments later the door to Aria\u2019s room opens and Aria steps in. Blake blushes as he sees her. He fawns over his girlfriend\u2019s long brown hair and her large emerald green eyes. Her skin was fair and smooth and she was wearing her lovely smooth yellow shirt and flowy orange skirt. She strides easily across the room and sets down her backpack. She sighs and smiles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFinally home. Hopefully, I aced that exam. Ugh, now I get to rest~\u201d Aria turns around and falls into her bed. When she makes contact it causes Blake to be thrown up a little from the shock. Aria sighs and lays her back as she appears to start to get some rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake rubbed his face as once he was thrown he landed on his face and chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh\u2026 so much for being durable\u2026 ugh\u2026\u201d Blake props himself up and looks at the sight of his resting girlfriend before him and blushes. He hadn\u2019t seen her from this perspective for a long time. He had to be honest with himself that he loved what he saw. How is this small like last time really brought out some desires he forgot he had. He shook his head, he needs to get her attention. He looks around and walks to the edge of Aria\u2019s desk and sees there is a small gap between her bed and the desk. Blake ponders on what to do as he looks over his resting girlfriend. He needed to get her attention, absolutely. But how would he get it? He could go to her face but if she swallowed him or anything else that would set him back. He could go to her chest, but she could probably roll over and pin him under her. He didn\u2019t even want to think about getting her attention on her lower-middle, but it certainly would get her attention. Though he could go lower to her feet, that would take the longest time and he could be kicked off her bed or even stepped on. Choices choices...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Blake blushed at the sight of her massive form, but quickly realizing he needed to get her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, the young man had landed near Aria\u2019s pillow.

Everything that he had been thinking had melted away as he saw the size of Aria's beautiful sleeping peaceful face. The sheer difference in scale brought him back to his memories of meeting his giant crush in the halls of Highschool. All the bad feelings and thoughts of worry and fear left him as he felt a gentle warmth radiating off of her body. He took in all of her monumental features. Her short brown hair, her big resting eyes, her soft plush lips... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's it! Blake was going to get Aria's attention from her lips! Blake smiled and walked over to his gigantic girlfriend's cheek and put his hand on it. He felt Aria's soft skin give way under his touch. Aria didn't move or flinch, seemingly not feeling his touch. Blake smiled and rubbed it gently. He leaned his face into her and kissed her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you Aria... So, sorry about this...\" Blake said as he starts climbing up along the side of his girlfriend's face. He gently placed his palms on her face and hoisted himself up and onto her, blushing as he had never crawled on Aria like this before. Not being used to needing to climb, Blake panted as he pulled himself on top of Aria's face and crawled onto her chin. Once on top he sprawled himself out onto her chin and sighed as he softly breathed in Aria's sweet perfume, her skin soft and allowing him to sink into her slightly. Suddenly a slight vibration comes from under him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm....\" Blake's world shook as Aria stirred in her sleep. The vibrations of her voice shook the plane that Blake was on and he held himself fast to Aria's chin as she moaned. Blake's eyes went wide, remembering the true scale difference again, remembering how dangerous even simple actions can be and why he had to get Aria's attention fast. He did have to admit though, it did feel kind of humbling to be this small with someone he loved and who loved him back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake rolls onto his side and crawls up to Aria's lips, blushing brightly as he puts both his hands on her bottom lip. Her mouth was so huge compared to him. She could swallow him whole right now and not even notice... kind of like how he confessed to her before. Blake blushed and chuckled as he rubbed the back of his head, hoping he wouldn't have to go through his girlfriend again to get her attention. Blake looks down at his girlfriend's plush lips again and smiles. he just loved Aria so much, one kiss wouldn't hurt anyone before he got her attention ... right? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake leans his head between Aria's lips and kisses them. After a second he pulls back before Aria's mouth starts opening as if his kiss were some kind of curse or spell. Aria tiredly yawns, breathing in deeply, threatening to pull Blake's tiny body into her warm maw!</span></div></div>",

Spit coats his chest and drips onto his head from the roof of Aria's maw. Light seeps into the cave that is Aria's mouth and illuminates her giant spongey tongue, her brilliantly red throat, and the inky blackness that leads deeper into her digestive system. Memories of Aria's mouth return to the mage as he blushes and recounts being part of just another meal for his girlfriend. Blake pushes his hands firmly into the tongue to slow, if not stop his descent. His hands sink into the plush muscle as the mouth closes behind him. Blake's eyes widen as the light fades away, leaving him trapped in the hot confines of his girlfriend's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! Aria! It's me! Don't swallow me! Again! HELP\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tongue lurches and presses Blake firmly to the roof of Aria's mouth. The tongue presses into him from his chest and moves down his legs, coating him further in her sweet spittle. Blake whines, his face crimson from this deep kiss he was forced to partake in. The mouth around him would shake and rumble as Aria moaned around him. The tongue rolled against his sides, feeling Blake's left flank, then his right. A quick satisfied \"hmm\" of approval sounds out around him and suddenly the world shifts. No longer is Blake sliding down towards Aria's throat, but instead, it levels out. Aria must have sat up! Blake's suspicions are confirmed as Aria's mouth opens once again and feels something grab onto his leg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to stay in the oppressively hot mouth of his girlfriend, he takes his chances and lets himself get dragged out of her mouth, a trail of spit still connecting him to the cave. As he is pulled away, the view of Aria's lips becomes smaller and reveals the entirety of her massive face. The shenanigans he got into before seemed so trivial for the magnificence of this view. It made shrinking back down worth it for the tiny mage. The view of Aria's titanic face. Her lovely eyes, her low cut bangs, her cute nose. Ultimately, however, Blake noticed the general expression on the face of his girlfriend. It was a look of ...</span></div></div>",

Perhaps she could help develop a potion to help him in his eventual battle or at the very least, something to help bring him back to size?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake takes in his surroundings and sees he is in Indigo's main foyer. He is currently sitting in a small forest of waist-high fibers that is Indigo's carpet. Suddenly, before he can look at the rest of the apartment, Blake hears a commotion from behind the front door. He turns his attention to it and ducks down, hoping to avoid whatever is on the other side. Could the great evil have found him already? Blake braces himself to the floor to see what would happen next. He hears the door handle shake and rattle then hears the jingle of keys and hushed muttering. A few seconds pass and the latch far above Blake on the monolithic door turns and unlocks. The handle turns and the massive wall of a door opens to reveal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndigo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndigo opens her door with a sigh and walks in. She heads into her living room and sets down her backpack but picks it up resigning to just put it in her room. She instead slips her shoes off and pushes them where she set her pack down. In her novel anime socks, Indigo walks into her room and sits on her desk chair and puts her backpack next to her bed and the desk itself. She leans back and the chair creaks, the cheap metal and plastic holding her weight as she holds her face. She pulls her hands down her face then interlocks her fingers. She then raises her arms up, hands still connected raising them above her head as well and yawn, cracking her knuckles elaborately. She crosses her feet at the ankles and shuts her eyes. She has just gotten back from a pop exam and is confident in her score, <i>I got at least a 95</i> She thinks to herself. She takes another deep breath and sighs, going over the questions in her head just to make sure. Her mental review easily an enjoyable pastime to improve her skills and memory retention. Though this hobby helps Indigo, it will seldom help Blake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake witnesses first hand Indigo stepping into her home, completely oblivious to his presence. Blake hasn't felt his low in quite a long time. In two simple steps, Indigo completely eclipses Blake and steps over him. Blake is able to see the threads of her jeans, the fibers in the socks, the canvas for her shoes and their devastating rubber treads. He sees the giantess set her pack down, a small tremor rippling through the floor from the force. He then sees her hesitate then lift up the massive pack, the idea alone of Indigo picking up something that could shock the world suddenly dawns on Blake shakes him to his core. He sees Indigo slip out of her shoe. Then with amazing grace she gently slides them against the wall before walking behind another hallway, that he knows leads to her bedroom. In only a few seconds, Blake has beholden the terror and magnitude of being shrunken. Before he dwells on it too much, he shakes his head and reaffirms himself of his goal. Get Indigo's attention. With that in mind, he immediately takes off after her. He bolts down the hall and just as he gets to the corner and sees Indigo resting in her chair. Blake groans and curses just how far he has to run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of jogging, Blake arrives out of breath at the foot, er feet of Indigo. Blake pants and as he nears Indigo he immediately feels the warmth radiating off of her large peds. The giant fabric clad monoliths incredibly warm, most likely from a stressful day from classes. Blake looks up and sees that Indigo is still resting with her eyes closed. He looks back down at the giant feet and contemplates on how to get the attention of his colossal friend.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Indigo\u2019s socks are light blue and have two anime characters on them from the movie \u201cYour Name\u201d. Her right foot is under her left as she rests them on the floor. Her body rises high into the chair above him. He senses just how fresh Indigo took her feet out of her shoes. He coughs once but makes his way to her heel. It doesn't seem like she is moving too much if at all so Blake decides to climb her before that changes. He grabs the fabric and starts climbing his unaware friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake is able to climb up past her ankle and up the outside of her jeans towards her lap. Blake figures he'll have a few better ideas about how to get her attention. He can try to get her attention at her lap and hopefully save himself a further climb. If not he can climb to her face or ear to reach her attention there. It will be harder as well since Indigo appears to be napping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake rolls onto Indigo's knee as he pants, out of breath. He sighs then stands up as he travels from the top of her knee to her lap then stares up at his giantess friend. He blushes slightly at the sight of Indigo's breasts lightly covering her face. That might prove troublesome. Blake cups his hands around his mouth and shouts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"INDIGO!\" ...  Nothing. The sleeping student remains motionless as her closed eyes dart around, most likely dreaming. Blake attempts again, shouting again.</span></div></div>",

Sighing, Blake stepped forward and took a handful of Indigo's blue shirt, hauling himself upwards Blake took another handful, and another and another. Slowly Blake made his way up Indigo's stomach, it took long enough that Blake's thoughts drifted off, thinking of what he could possibly do to find this world threatening evil even with Indigo's help. As Blake had let his mind wander, he surprised himself when he reached to take the next handful of Indigo's shirt, and found himself grabbing the bottom of Indigo's breast. Blake stopped, surprised and mortified for a second before composing himself. He had climbed to the point where he was directly beneath Indigo's breasts, from here he could either try to directly climb over them, or he could try climbing to the side and then up and around. Climbing over Indigo's breasts would be difficult, climbing on the bottom of an almost horizontal surface was never easy and Blake was already tiring from the long climb, not to mention that it would be a little difficult to explain to Indigo if she woke up and found him crawling over her bust, even though she did know about his history as a mage. While climbing around Indigo's chest would be easier, and probably more polite, it would take longer which might tire him out even more than the difficult climb directly over Indigo's boobs. Every moment Blake spent debating this his grip on Indigo's shirt grew more and more tenuous, in the heat of the moment Blake decided to...</span></div></div>",

A good chunk of the towering group didn\u2019t look familiar, but Blake quickly recognized one of them: a cheerful, playful blonde with a maroon and white two-piece uniform and matching sneakers.

Summoning his courage, the tiny young man rushed toward the monolithic cheer captain\u2019s sneakers before yelling and waving his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Ruby had first joined her new college\u2019s cheer team, she only recognized a few familiar faces from high school - the rest of the squad consisted of students unfamiliar to the blonde. Nonetheless, they bonded fairly quickly. That, combined with Ruby\u2019s unrelenting spirit, helped her rise to the familiar rank of cheer captain. Of course, she never forgot her closest high school friends - Indigo, Aria, and <i>especially</i> Blake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she set a pair of pom-poms down on the bench, Ruby spotted a moving, black-clad speck on the ground in front of her. Her emerald eyes widened as she recognized said speck as Blake Heart! Speedily scooping up Blake into her hands, Ruby turned to her teammates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGirls, I\u2019ll be right back,\u201d Ruby said, \u201cI have to, uh, use the bathroom...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout even waiting for any responses, Ruby sprinted to the nearest portable toilet and closed its door, then opened her hands for a better look at the shrunken mage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBlake, not again...\u201d Ruby sighed. \u201cDidn\u2019t you already make yourself tiny to impress Aria?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a long story...\u201d Blake proceeded to explain the events he\u2019d recently experienced. His encounter with the spirits, their message of a looming threat to all life, their desperate plea for his help. Ruby needed a few minutes to process all of this information...even after having seen him so small five years ago, it was still an otherworldly feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce everything began to make sense, Ruby smiled eagerly. \u201cAlrighty, Blake!

Without waiting for a response Ruby pulled back the neckline of her one piece suit, exposing her cleavage, Ruby quickly slipped Blake down between her boobs, gave a quick bounce to check he was secure, and released the neckline of her suit, trapping Blake in semidarkness. Blake was being pressed in on all sides by Ruby's warm skin, he could just barely see from the light filtering through Ruby's cheer uniform in front of him. As Ruby ran back to the others Blake felt himself bouncing, and Ruby had been right, he was pretty well kept in place by the friction of Ruby's breasts on either side of him, although while Blake was secure from the jolts and bounces of Ruby's footsteps, he wasn't sure friction would be enough to hold him safely if Ruby did anything dramatic during cheer practice.

I'm shrunk down and need your help and you p-plan to eat me?!\" Ruby giggles, shaking the tiny mage in her palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not little one~ Hehe. It's just the only place I can make sure you don't fall out of~ I could put you between my breasts buuuut you might fly out. I could put you in my shoe buuut I don't think you'd be too comfortable with that~ I've had hundreds of wads of gum and never swallowed a single one. Well.\" She lifts her finger to her lip and looks to the side, squinting. She pouts her lip and Blake shivers slightly at her hesitation. \"I swallowed like ... maybe 6 but that was when I was starting out. I'm a pro now!~\"Ruby smiles down at Blake and Blake shivers with trepidation. Blake looks around and thinks about his options. He thinks about what ruby said and realizes she's right. Blake hangs his head and presses a palm to his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-alright... how long will practice take?\" Ruby looks back to the side again and puffs out her cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Around.. an hour. Maybe 45 minutes if everyone is good.\" Blake sighs but knows this is his only shot, he'd just have to bear with getting stuffed inside of his friend's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" Blake started, his body shaking. \"Let's do it.\" Ruby smiles and gently and carefully lifts the tiny mage to her face and whispers to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Blake, You'll be safe with me~ I promise\" The giant cheerleader brings her face in closer and presses her giant soft lips onto Blake, smothering him in their softness. The mage stopped shivering as his face and body warmed. Embarrassed from this overt sign of affectionBlake tried to pull away by squirming in the giantess' hold. He found that her face simply pushed towards him anyway and was helpless to stop her. As soon as Ruby stops her kiss and pulls away she giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, you really are cute and helpless lil Blakey~\" Ruby smiles and slowly opens her mouth in front of Blake, giving him a full view of her ruby red interior. Her pink sticky tongue slithers on the bottom of her mouth, guarded by her pearly white teeth. Her uvula dangles in the back of her mouth, a chandelier to the foyer of her inner body. As she attempts to breathe through her nose, she fails and ends up exhaling warm air onto the puy mage. Immediately his clothes start to dampen from the humidity of her maw, making the mage cringe. She quickly shuts her mouth as she giggles, \"Heh sorry about that. Never done this before.\" Blake sighs and nods. He had, but even that was more enjoyable than this. ... on second thought, no it was just as bad, the fact it was Aria didn't make it any better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby reopens her mouth and once again exhales onto the tiny mage. Blake rolls his eyes at the assault of warm minty breath as it again dampens his clothes some more. Blake once again stares into the giant mouth of his old high school friend and fixates upon the hole in the back, her throat. The dark abyss that leads to her dangerous stomach. Blake shudders at the thought of reentering such a violent and turbulent organ. His time in Aria had made it hard to see the human body the same way. The whole mouth shook as the tongue convulsed as Ruby made a strange noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahen...\" Confused, Blake looked up and saw Ruby's expecting gaze then looked back into her mouth. His eyes widened and he nods<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"oh, right.. sorry, I'll uh... get in now.\" Blake figured she was getting impatient holding her mouth open for him. Ruby has her lower lip pressing against the bottom of her palm allowing Blake to simply walk into her mouth. As he approaches, Ruby's tongue shoots forward to cover the gap between her lip and the tongue itself, crossing over her sharp teeth. Blake shudders and shakes as he walks forward and steps onto Ruby's lip then crawls onto her tongue. Suddenly the mouth shakes and vibrates around Blake as Ruby lets out a moan around him. Blake blushes and Ruby looks away with her tongue shyly wagging and trying to pull away or at least pull Blake the rest of the way in. Blake follows its request and crawls further in, his hands and knees soaked in her sticky bubbly spit. \"Yuck....\" Blake says as he tries to pull his hand away from her tongue, a strand of saliva connecting him to her giant muscle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the maw grows darker and BLake turns around to see Ruby closing her mouth around the mage. The tongue springs to life and bucks Blake around, firmly holding and pushing him against the roof of her mouth and then into her cheek, carefully avoiding her teeth. Ruby carefully speaks around him, whispering to not hurt him or draw attention to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Blake, I'll keep you in there until practice is over. I am going to be talking to my crew so you'll have to shield yourself from that. We'll get through this little buddy~ See you again soon~\" As a sign of affection, she lightly rubs her giant sticky muscle over Blake's side. Blake grimaces but smiles back, rubbing the giant tongue in response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby sighs and makes sure she is fine in the mirror before walking out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right girls! Now, Who is ready for practice.\"A roar of cheers erupts from the locker room. Blake inside Ruby's maw clutches his ears, wincing and sighing how he'll have to deal with this. Blake remembers a spell to help minimize noise and attempts to cast it on himself As he does he notices all sounds sound dampened. He smiles and blows his finger like a smoking gun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still got it,\" Blake says... unaware he made all sounds he makes quieter as well. Ruby and the rest of her team get ready, heading out to practice while Blake is lightly jostled around the cheek of his friend. What could possibly go wrong?</span></div></div>",

But as she feels the sensation of Blake struggling all the way down her throat and into her stomach it dawns on Ruby what she'd just done. On the inside Ruby was panicking, but she did her best to present a calm face to the rest of the cheer squad. She couldn't reveal Blake's secret, especially if there was some big evil thing looking for him. Ruby thinks for a moment, she could either make up an excuse to leave right now, pretend to be sick or something, but that might draw suspicion if anyone was looking for Blake. The other option would be to finish cheer practice like normal, and then she could slip away and find a way to get Blake out, that would be more subtle, but not only would Blake have to spend more time in her stomach, Ruby would also have to try to act normal while feeling her little friend struggle and squirm inside her.

He saw that Jade was some way away from where he currently was. Blake took in his surroundings and saw a few plastic cups towering above him and the punch bowl to his right. Blake got as close to the edge without putting himself in the open and looked around some more from behind a cup. Jade was pretty far and his spells could only take him so far. If he could even remember them! Blake figures he could use his glide spell but the height of the table would never make him reach his sister. The distance he'd have to cover on foot would be even more dangerous. Blake looks around again for an alternative and he sees the punch bowl. It has a ladle that hangs high above the table and the bowl. Perhaps it would give him enough room to glide safely to Jade! Blake leaves his hiding spot and makes his way to the bowl. The wet ladle cup rests on the plastic table cover still pools a bit of the red liquid. Blake steps into it and hugs the handle. Once he does, Blake begins his climb up to the top. He hears the idle conversations around him but focuses mainly on getting to the top. Once he gets near the top a distant conversation catches his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'm gonna get some punch. You want any?\" Blake's eyes widen as he looks at who is approaching. It doesn't seem like anyone right now but Blake can't risk getting found. Above the punch, he turns himself upside down to avoid detection. As soon as he does he feels the table and bowl shake slightly then feels someone grab the area just above him. As soon as he does the ladle lifts and moves to scoop up some punch to fill a cup. Blake clings tightly to the handle but gets dizzy as he is constantly shaken, lifted, and lowered. Soon though the party patron sets the ladle down having finished their filling, but Blake finds he is no longer able to hold on and falls into the fruit punch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake splashes into the fruit punch and has to swim to the surface. Blake breaches from under the sugary drink and he coughs and sputters the strange tasting fruit punch out of his mouth. Does ... this have alcohol?! Blake coughs as he looks around and sees he's trapped in the punch. Suddenly a new shadow of another person is cast over him. Blake looks up and sees who it is. His jaw drops as he sees...</span></div></div>",
