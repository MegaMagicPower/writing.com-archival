That was util we realized they weren't going to fight us if we weren\u2019t going to fight them. Sure there was tension, but that was normal. But that was a while ago, now is more worrying, it was to help the population of both races to get used to each other. A student exchange program, a select few students are sent to each other\u2019s planet\u2019s schools to take part in their lessons. Of course Mark was excited to be part of this, he always found Saurians to be very interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Day at the Office</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaul was daydreaming again, he shook himself and focused on the PC in front of him, working was boring, but the real reason for his day dream was the Dragon across the room from him. She was stunning, her ruby red scales sparked in the sunlight coming from the window. So far she hadn't noticed his overly long gazes in her direction but it was only a matter of time, and her being one of the most powerful employees in the business if he got her annoyed he could find himself jobless. Then again, he really wanted to ask her out, he\u2019d have to decide what to do soon.</span></div></div>",

Standing at an astounding 13'4\", she has actually a pretty hard time getting around, even in the places made for saurians. Clothes shopping is especially difficult, since she has to basically custom order everything. However, since she works at the science department of a pretty prestigious university, she has more than enough money to finance her lifestyle.<br>\r\nBrenda loves looking good and isn't modest when it comes to showing off her figure. Because of her size, each of her breasts is bigger than a humans head, which she loves to emphasize with tight tank tops. The most modest thing she wears would be a blouse, thouh even there she has to have the top three buttons undone, otherwise the fabric would tear. She prefers jeans over leggins, especially with some fashionable tears in them. Finally, her human boyfriend Mark gifted her a silver pendant in the shape of a heart, which she always wears around her neck.<br>\r\nSpeaking of her boyfriend, Brenda is very social with everyone. She met Mark while still in college and both immediately fell head over heels in love with each over. Their third anniversary is coming up in a few days, and Brenda has just the thing to surprise her little lover...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">Roxanne Kirst</font></b><br>\r\nRoxanne - or Roxa, as everyone calls her - might come of snooty at first, however once you get to know her closer you will realize that's not true. In fact, she is an absolute bitch. The 7'9\" red scaled t-rex is going through a life with a chip on her shoulder. She subscribes to a philosophy of strength, meaning she views herself as superior to anyone who can't overpower her - a view that includes all humans. On top of that, Roxa loathes those larger than her and her ultimate whish is to find a way to tower over every living being.<br>\r\nRoxa works as a fitness instructor at a local gym, and even when she's not working, she spends her time bulking up. She is incredibly muscular, with massive arms, and thighs thick enough to crush someone's head effortlessly. A fact, most of her many boyfriends can attest to, since she doesn't take break ups particularly well.<br>\r\nRoxa almost never dresses in anything but work out gear. She prefers the colour black, since it goes well with her scale color. Her running shorts seem to melt into her scales, emphasizing her large, muscular rear, and her sports bras sturggle to contain her chest. Her sneakers are always polished to shine.<br>\r\nWhen she is not working out, though, she loves to wear jewlery. Its actually the best way to get on her good side - another fact her past boyfriends remember with loathing. Of course, she always kept the various trinkets they bought her after a break up. Gold is by far her favourite, and she owns many rings and pendants, and always has her favourite ankle bracelet on.<br>\r\nOne night, Roxa has a fateful encounter on her way home. A strange woman in a jewlery shop offers her a deal... and promises her enormous power...</span></div></div>",

Despite her size, she always made sure that she wasn't accidentally pushing someone over. It had taken her lots of practice to do so, but after more than once knocking unassuming passersby on their but by a careless turn, or a flick of her tail, she realized that she had to account for her size. Being double the size of most people, if not more, came with its own set of challenges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut today, she had other things on her mind. Namely, the package under her arm. After countless meetings with the safety council she had been finally allowed to take the experiment home with her. Officially it was to conduct experiments in a place outside the public eye - and, of course, without the risk of damage to public property. Unofficially though, Brenda had her own reasons to take the project home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, her anniversary was coming up. For the last three years, Mark had been her boyfriend, and every day she was thankful that she got to wake next to the tiny, little human. Well, tiny to her, at least.<br>\r\nBoth of them were attracted especially to the size of the other. Brenda loved cuddling Mark as if he was a teddy bear. Mark loved being buried under her body, especially if the clothes came off. And with how much Mark adored his titanic girlfriend, it would be the perfect surprise for him if she was even bigger...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Brenda reached her apartment and quickly rushed in.<br>\r\n\"Mark?\" she shouted tentatively, grinning from ear to ear when she didn't get a response. Perfect. He would probably come home in a few hours, which left her with just enough time to prepare.<br>\r\nBut first of all, Brenda wanted to take a look at the project itself. Tearing the unassuming, brown packaging open, she couldn't help but grin as she saw...</span></div></div>",

The shell was a blindingly white plastic, giving it an almost sterile feel. However, the insides were more important, specifically the transposer in the barrel and the charge battery in the grip. One might not assume that a device this small held the power to break the laws of physics... but then, the concentrated uranium inside wasn't very visible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course it was perfectly safe. She wouldn't have been allowed to take it home if it wasn't. The only radiation getting out would be the size ray itself, which was completely harmless, at least to the target.<br>\r\nGiddiness overtook Brenda. She had been working on this project for so long it felt unreal to hold it in her own hands. How could she not test it? Turning the dial to ten percent, she took aim at a nearby potted plant and fired. A blinding flash of green later and it had been reduced to the desired ten percent of its original size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrenda couldn't help it. In her enthusiasm, she had shrunk and regrown almost all of her furniture, laughing every time the green beam shot out, making something dwindle away. It was one thing to test it in a lab, but having absolute executive control over this marvel of technology was even better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't wait for Mark to come home. Brenda giggled, imagining the look on his face once she presented him with the device. If he had loved her sized before, just wait until he was only an inch tall. All the ideas racing through her mind on what she could do with him, made Brenda's head swim.<br>\r\nBut in the back of her head, there was another voice, one that was getting increasingly harder to ignore. One telling her to use the beam on herself. Yes, she might have been giant to everyone, anyway. But this device held the power to make her absolutely enormous. Brenda gulped. It wasn't like her to crave power. And she knew it would be dangerous - not to herself, but to everyone else. But faced with a choice like this... how could she not at least think about it?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A little bit wouldn't hurt, Brenda thought. After all, what difference would it make if she was 13 feet or 15 feet tall? The only one complaining might be the ceiling... but that wasn't a new problem. When she had first moved her, finding a place to live that would accommodate her size was actually rather difficult. Only barely she found this one, a complex specifically geared for the taller, with a 14 feet high ceiling. Now, to Mark the apartment may seem like a mansion, but Brenda still always had to be careful not to hit her head on something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiddily, Brenda weighed the small gun in her hand, slowly turning it so that it pointed towards her. How could she turn down an opportunity like this? Becoming even larger than she was... something about that intrigued her. And besides, if anyone from the university would ask, she could just say that she was conducting an experiment. Which she was doing, in a way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking one last deep breath, Brenda fired. In an instant, the green light of the size ray engulfed her form. Her entire body started to tingle with the feeling of an asleep limb, as if thousands of tiny needles were softly pricking her scales. Though a bit more pleasant.<br>\r\nThe effect was just as immediate. Slowly, Brenda's body expanded, and not just her height, but everything. Her hips grew wider, her arms and legs thicker, her breasts bulged outward. Ecstasy overcame the enormous brontosaurus, as she marveled at her own body growing.<br>\r\nHer excitement subsided somewhat when she hit her head on the ceiling. In all the joy of using the size ray, she had completely forgotten to duck. Furthermore, the sound of fabric tearing brought her plummeting back to reality. With a hot blush on her face she looked down.<br>\r\nOf course her clothes hadn't grown with her, which led to Brenda's legs becoming to wide for her jeans to handle. The pants looked as though they had exploded, holes and tears everywhere, Brenda's blue flesh bulging through. They were absolutely ruined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrenda shook her head, sighing. though it was annoying, she could always order a new pair. At least her underwear had survived in tact. She had just bought a fine set of lingerie for the anniversary. Her tank top had had, as well. In fact, the way it now tightly hugged her breasts, barely enough fabric left to cover anything else, it looked hot, in a way. Well, Mark sure would appreciate it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, something unexpected happened. The tingle returned... and suddenly Brenda lurched upwards, hitting her head on the ceiling once more. Cringing, she let herself fall onto her butt and looked around, slightly panicked. Her body had started growing again, faster this time. A malfunction? It may be... the transposer hadn't been thoroughly tested on organic material and least of all on humans and saurians.<br>\r\nBrenda racked her brain, but there was nothing she could do to stop her body growing even further. Shooting the ray again might have canceled it out... but who knows what else. All she could do now was to hope she wouldn't damage her apartment to much...</span></div></div>",

She sighed and shook her head, which had just burst through the ceiling, startling the young couple whose bed she was now wearing as a hat. How could she have been so stupid. Risking her property and maybe even her life for the cheap thrill of growing.<br>\r\nOnly that this thrill wasn't exactly cheap. By the second it was getting more expensive, as Brenda grew another story, bursting into the apartment of a single man smoking a joint who looked at her as if she was an alien. But jokes about property damage aside, Brenda found herself not exactly regretting what she had done. Maybe it was that the shock was making her detached. Maybe it was the strange pleasure she felt as her clothes finally ripped off and her naked scales pushed into the walls, quickly turning them to rubble. Sure, it was a shame about the apartment...<br>\r\nBut what did she care now that she was this big? And getting even bigger?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrenda couldn't help but moan as her more sensitive areas expanded further. Looking down, she saw one of her now apartment sized breasts eagerly gobbling up the young couple that had lived above her. A human woman and a male raptor. Always friendly, always polite. Now buried under her titanic tit. Immediately, she wanted to help them get out... but the way they squirmed under her felt so <i>good</i>!<br>\r\nAnd besides, if she got them out now they might be hit by falling debris. There struggle didn't turn more desperate as she grew. It seemed they weren't in danger, at least not from her body. In fact, she realized something even more odd than her uncontrolled growth. Her body had become strangely soft. The walls only broke once she was pressed so hard against them that there was no other way. But her flesh just rolled over smaller things. Now that she had noticed the couple getting trapped under her boob, she started to feel an odd tickling from all over her body. It only took her a second to realize that those were her neighbors, trapped under or against her. Trapped, but very lively.<br>\r\nBrenda sighed with relief. Even if she had just annihilated an entire apartment complex, at least she hadn't killed anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the building could take no more, and with one final growth spurt, Brenda exploded out of it, sending the tower's walls crumbling down around her. Her legs shot out first, feet crashing into the street in front. Then her arms. And then everything else. Brenda's entire body was covered in dust and debris... but she couldn't care about that. There was something way more important.<br>\r\nThe entire street had fallen eerily quiet. Not that no one was there. No, the street was packed with people. All staring at her, with open mouths, shocked at her appearance. No one dared move a muscle.<br>\r\nBrenda giggled. How could she not? The situation was absurd. Hundreds of people seeing her like this, one hundred foot or more tall. And to top it off - completely naked. She wasn't exactly modest, but even for her it was a bit much showing off her boobs to an entire crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm... hi!\"<br>\r\nAwkwardly, she waved at the street, sending bits of debris flying into the apartment complex next to her. She cringed. Not exactly a good first impression.<br>\r\nBut it came even worse. As if her words had broken some kind of spell, the people came to their senses. Turning away, they started to scream and run from her massive body, justifiably afraid that the massive bronto would crush them like she did her own building.<br>\r\n\"No! Wait!\" she called out, but even though her voice was booming across the entire block, that only made them redouble  their efforts to get away. Brenda couldn't exactly blame them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gulped. Something else started to stir within her. Seeing all those people run away from her gargantuan body made her feel... strange. Powerful. Suddenly she felt all the people currently pressed against her body even more. And somehow, the usually gentle Brenda loved the feeling of absolute power her titanic size gave her. She could rule over the city, if she wanted. Could make the people her toys...<br>\r\nBrenda shook her head. Where did that come from? Of course she wouldn't do that... at least not to strangers. However, she couldn't deny that her size made her horny, but there was only one person who would have to satisfy her urges. Mark. Her little - now very little - boyfriend, stuck at work. On their anniversary. A smile formed on Brenda's face. Maybe she should pay him a visit...</span></div></div>",

The scrawny little ass sat in the back, making sure she was on her best behavior. It was hell. How was she to get the scrawny losers that she was teaching to get into the program, if she had to walk on egg shells the whole time?<br>\r\nThe fact that Jake, the latest in her long line of boyfriends, had called her this morning, asking her with a pathetic tremble in his voice to not contact him again didn't help to improve her mood.<br>\r\nYet the cherry on top, the thing that really got her blood boiling, was the group of brontos that had visited the gym today. All of them were massive, towering above her. Taunting her with their natural height. Laughing all the way. If there was one thing Roxa couldn't stand, it was people larger than her. Though they were few and far between, she couldn't help but focus on them every time she saw one in the street. Since she couldn't take her frustrations out on her class, the only way she could deal with her anger was to work herself to the bone. Which she had done for the last few hours. By now, every muscle in her body ached, her tight sports bra was drenched in her sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, as she finally went to get changed, the anger still burned within her. Roxa sighed. The day was a wash. Maybe she could relax at home somewhat. But before that, she still had one final place she wanted to stop by today.<br>\r\nAfter she had exchanged her work out gear for a pair of tight denim shorts and a black tank top, Roxa quickly packed her bag and without so much as a goodbye left the fitness studio.<br>\r\nShe walked down the street, finally a spark of excitement igniting within her. She had been looking forward to this all week. It might tacky, but Roxa kept tabs on all the jewelry stores in town. So she was one of the first to know that a new one would be opening today. In fact, she might be the only one who knew. It wasn't a big store, or anything. A small ad that had popped up on her news ticker was the only hint to its existence.<br>\r\nShe turned the corner into a side alley, finally arriving at the store. From the outside, it didn't look like much. There were no windows allowing to see inside the shop, the concrete walls and metal door making it look more like a seedy nightclub. Had there not been a rickety sign advertising the store, Roxa probably wouldn't even have found it. All the more reason to be excited. No one was around - Roxa would be the first to enter!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slammed open the door, recoiling at the thick air pregnant with the scent of incense. Through the hazy smoke, Roxa could get a glimpse of the shop itself. It looked exactly how she imagined: small shelves cluttered with the tandy, cheap stuff that only an idiot would have an interest in. Instead, she focused on the tiny glass cases in the center. Various pendants were displayed there. Gold. Silver. Various gems. A true feast for her eyes.<br>\r\n\"Oh, welcome, young lady!\" Roxa nearly jumped at the voice. Behind the counter sat a frail, old human woman. The shopkeeper, judging by her attire. Roxa merely grunted a greeting. She didn't want to talk to her, she only wanted a new necklace.<br>\r\nThe shopkeeper, however, didn't take her rudeness as a hint to stop pestering her.<br>\r\n\"Please, look around. I have a feeling you will find just what you want in my shop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxa chose to ignore her. Slowly, she made her way through the shop, taking a closer look at the displayed trinkets. A frown spread over her face. Most of them were disappointing. Even the ones in the glass cases weren't all that exciting. Their design was either boring or gaudy. Some even somehow managed to be both at the same time.<br>\r\nGrowing more frustrated, Roxa was almost ready to storm out again, when she laid eyes on the final pendant. This one was actually a lot more interesting. A small, golden amulet, on a silver chain. She couldn't quite make out what the pendant was supposed to be, but it almost looked like a saurian's claw. However, far more interesting were the small carvings in its all over it. An engraving in some kind of language she didn't know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelieved that she had found something, at least, she grabbed the pendant and brought it to the counter.<br>\r\n\"Oh, how interesting. I had a feeling you would choose this one.\"<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh,\" Roxa mumbled, \"How much for it.\"<br>\r\n\"Hmmm,\" the shopkeeper hummed, \"for you, I'll make it a hundred.\"<br>\r\nRoxa balked. That was insanely cheap for what was the best piece of merchandise in this shop. Still, she wasn't one to look a gift horse in the mouth. Quickly, she scrounged up some bills out of her pocket and slammed them on the counter. Then, she turned. She had what she wanted, after all. No need to keep the old woman company.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? Do you not even want to know what the engraving says?\"<br>\r\nRoxa stopped dead in her tracks. On one hand she was annoyed that the woman kept pestering her, but she couldn't deny that she was curious. Slowly, she turned towards the shopkeeper and returned to the counter.<br>\r\n\"And what does it say, huh?\" she asked, impatiently.<br>\r\n\"Oh, this is an interesting one. Give me a moment.\"<br>\r\nThe old woman leaned closer, scrutinizing the amulet. A shadow fell over her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It says...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sounds good....\u201d   She exited the shop, stopping only a few feet out of the entrance and turned around.  \u201cWhat does that mean, exa--\u201d  the saurian woman blinked.  The shop was now boarded up, devoid of life, and looking like it hadn't been inhabited for years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way,\u201d she thought, inspecting the new state of the shop's door.  \u201cDid I pass out and dream all this or something?\u201d  The now warm-to-the-touch amulet was still there around her neck, so... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving no other choice, the big Rex made her way home, all the while the amulet seeming to grow warmer against her chest\u2014it seemed to pulse, even, especially when her mind drifted to those words the shop-keeper had said: \u201cPower grow ever upwards.\u201d    She stopped in front of her apartment door to fumble with the keys, and then noticed it:  Her breasts....seemed bigger.  Her clothes felt tighter.  She looked at her left bicep, flexing it.  The red scaled limb surged up larger than she remembered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way.....\u201d   the amulet glowed and warmed, and seemed to send a jolt of tickling, pleasurable energy through her body.   She quickly opened the door, and made her way to her bedroom, sitting astride her mattress as she affirmed....  \u201cI'm...._bigger_!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have a magic amulet now.\u201d she thought out loud, \u201ca magic amulet that can make me bigger!\u201d   She swiftly turned her muzzle downwards to gaze upon her cleavage, and began thinking of all those over-busted brontosaur girls that so-often out-shined her own chest in the gym, feeling the amulet grow hot, and intermittently glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBig tits!\u201d  she moaned, filling her mind with images of her scaly mammaries swelling,  \u201cI want giant juggs...bigger than any of those herbivore bimbos!\u201d   Roxa felt a gurgle within her chest, then heard a slowly growing, rubbery, stretching sound\u2014her breasts were swelling up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBigger....bigger...grow so huge that even Brenda's rack looks puny!\u201d  she panted, her tank top beginning to tear, her cleavage bubbling up from the straining collar a butting up against her muzzle.  \u201cBust it!\u201d she whispered, eyes closed, claws drawn up onto and squeezing her swelling mounds.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, her top split in half, letting her new, watermelon sized boobs out to play. She collapsed back onto her bed, fondling her swollen tits lovingly\u2014bouncing them up and down , kissing and sucking on her thick, black nipples\u2014drawing her left claw downward between her thighs, and beginning to rub herself as she soaked not only her denim shorts, but the sheets and mattress of her bed, as well.  Roxa rubbed herself to orgasm, squirting all over the lower half of her bed, leaving it dampness-darkened and soggy\u2014She then stood up, and examined her new, hugely busty self in the mirror, grinning at her new tits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSoooo BIG!\u201d she laughed, wiggling her chest from side to side, watching those mams swivel and smack gelatinously against one another\u2014they obscured her stomach completely, their bottoms pressing against her hips.   She never seen tits as big as hers\u2014at least, not in real life.  Putting her arms behind her red-snouted head, she looked down at the still pulsing amulet and thought:  Taller, now!  Make ALL of me bigger!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jewel pulsed warming to almost scaldingly hot temperatures\u2014the she-rex moaning as her body rose upward by nearly a whole foot, her shorts tearing and riding up into her ass crack, fraying and blossoming with holes.  \u201cBigger!\u201d she chanted, panting as her body once again ascended upward, her head impacting against the 15 foot ceiling, her shorts hanging onto her by the barest threads.  Roxa laughed, her new, deepened voice surprising her as she looked down at the amulet once again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA.  Roxa concentrates on her muscles; big, hulking muscles\u2014how big could she make them?<br>\r\nB.  Remembering the bronto-gals, she decides to grow a monstrous butt to match her tits<br>\r\nC.  Her boobs were already gigantic....why not keep growing them?</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next step was obvious. Roxa had spent all of her life letting out her anger on her workout machines and while her grueling training had given her a truly statuesque figure most people would be envious of, it had never been enough for her. What good were her muscles, if a bronto was born with thicker arms than she would ever have?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now it was going to be different. From now on there would be no one taller, stronger, or sexier than her. Her tits were already massive and now she would make sure that she had the bulk to make her desire a reality.<br>\r\n\"Stronger!\" She chanted. The necklace instantly responded by growing hot to the touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt began as a small tingle, the same that had went through her breasts when she had started to grow them. Muscles growing, becoming thicker and stronger, expanding outwards. She could see the flesh under her scales shift as it had to accommodate the ever growing muscles. Her biceps and triceps exploded outward, her arms becoming as wide as tree trunks. Her legs became thicker as well. Finally, her back and abs grew, more defined than ever. Roxa couldn't help it. She let out a scream - no, a roar! - of pleasure as she felt her body becoming as hard as steel. She doubted that even a bullet could now make it through her.<br>\r\nHer newly grown muscles itched and tickled. They were aching to be used. And so, she used them. A simple flex of her thighs was all it needed to completely shred the floor apart, her massive claws digging effortlessly through the wood. Ecstatic, Roxa slammed her arms into the walls, again simply plowing through as if she was punching through air. Even in her wildest dreams, she would have never believed she would be able to hold such incredible strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, there was just one last step. She had made her tits enormous. She had become a goddess of pure muscle. The only thing that was left was to once and for all transcend her limitations. Fifteen feet were good... but not enough. She wanted to be bigger. Way bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bigger!\" she chanted, the necklace complying without question. Her head dug through the ceiling, making her old apartment fall to rubble.<br>\r\n\"Bigger!\" The screams started as she searched even higher. All around her were people, their daily routines broken by her sudden and beautiful ascendance. Sadly, none of them realized how happy she was. All they could see was a Tyrannosaurus Rex becoming larger by the second. But Roxa didn't really care what they thought, anyway. They were dwindling into specks before her, after all...<br>\r\n\"Bigger!\" Her head reached the top floor of a neighboring banking tower. Barely, she noticed the horrified executives scurry away from the windows... right before her tail crashed into it, toppling the whole building. The shards of glass and steel tickled her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BIGGER!\" she shouted, one final time, and her growth intensified even further. Soaring upwards, she finally reached her desired height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n100 feet. Massive. Building sized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes glazed over as pure ecstasy overcame her, and she looked down. Hundreds of people were running away from her, multiple cars had piled up on the road. Her very existence had become the most important part of their lives in an instance. Rubble still fell off of her scales from her apartment. It tickled slightly as it bounced off her scales.<br>\r\nA wide grin spread over her face. Now she had truly become what she had always wanted: the biggest, strongest one around. Powerful enough to get whatever she wanted, when she wanted, and how she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there were a lot of people she wanted to pay a visit to. Ex boyfriends. Snooty customers. All the bitches and assholes she had encountered throughout her life. All of them would pay. And she would enjoy every second of her power trip...</span></div></div>",

Her massive, leathery wings are powerful enough to carry her where ever she wants. Still, the business woman prefers public transit, or her own car. Carrying her bulky frame with just the force of her own muscles gets tiring, after all.<br>\r\nCarla works in finance, though not in any prestigious role. She is more of a grunt worker, taking calls and managing the customers account. In fact, Carla is kind of frustrated with her work. Not only does it feel as if she isn't getting ahead on the corporate ladder, the office itself doesn't really fit her. It was constructed more with humans in mind, and the small adjustments she had managed to get made, barely widened her cubicle enough to stop her tail spilling into the hallway. She isn't the only one with that problem, but the higher ups are dragging their feet, since they don't want to spend money on expensive renovations.<br>\r\nThe only saving grace are her colleagues, which she actually really likes. One, in particular: Alex, a 5'4\" raptor, who makes up for his lack in height with his humor and charm. It only took a week for Carla to form a crush on him, yet she never acted on it, since she is afraid she might come across as intimidating. Her roommate <b>Brenda</b>, keeps trying to get her to ask Alex out, but its a slow going process.<br>\r\nCarla, in contrast to her roommate, dresses more modestly, preferring business casual over Brenda's more revealing outfits. Still, even her custom tailored suit doesn't do much to conceal her generous figure. Every time she passes by, the heads of her coworkers turn, though its mostly embarrassing to Carla herself. Sadly, the object of her desire, Alex, is either not interested, or simply considerate enough not to stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><b>Midnight</b></font><br>\r\nMidnight comes from a very old, venerable, and most importantly rich dragon family. Its enough to look at her figure to feel the weight of her status crushing down on oneself. Standing at an impressive 10'6\", she is tall even for a dragon, a fact she revels in. Her physical superiority, combined with her wealth and power, has completely altered her perception of the world. She sees herself as in charge of everything, and if she doesn't get her way, all hell breaks loose. More than once, her rage has brought businesses crumbling down. Of course, she never had to face any consequences for her actions, since the authorities are all in her family's pocket.<br>\r\nMidnight prefers dresses, especially silver ones, since they compliment the shining mane of her hair, as well as contrasting nicely against her deep, black scales. Furthermore, she is absolutely covered in jewelry. Rings, bracelets, necklaces... she loves them all. She even has three golden rings adorning her thick tail.<br>\r\nMidnight loves excess. Jewelry, food, partners, no matter what she pursues, she always wants the best. Her home is filled with designer clothes, she has hired multiple star decorated chefs. As for her partners... well, her interest in one only lasts for as long as they are in bed together. If the poor fellow can still walk afterwards, he can show himself out.<br>\r\nBut all that is still not enough for the dragon. Above all, she craves power. She craves being above everyone else. And soon, she might get exactly what she wants...</span></div></div>",

Though he has to endure some mocking comments from his friends - that he serves more as a teddy bear than a boyfriend - it is the perfect relationship.

However, not only is Jimmy absolutely fitness obsessed, his true strength lies more in logistics. He manages drivers, lifters, warehouses, and so on. Through his work, the company could even transcend the confines of the city, now offering moves across the whole country.<br>\r\nMost of his coworkers are some flavor of saurian. T-rexes, brontos, even some stegosauruses. Its an even split between the genders, though that doesn't matter much to Jimmy. Whether male or female, he likes everyone.<br>\r\nHe is usually clad in white overalls when he is actually working with the others.

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">This story is an attempt to revive the great story \"Anthrosaur\" that has sadly vanished from writing.com<br>\r\nSpecial Thanks to Toku, here on Writing.com, who graciously sent me a link to an archived version of the original!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe basic premise: In this world, dinosaurs, dragons, and humans all exist. The anthros are still roughly human sized, though most of them stand a few feet larger than an ordinary human.<br>\r\nRelationships between the species are common, though some anthros see the humans as beneath them.<br>\r\nThis interactive focuses on growth, shrinking, and muscles. Other fetishes are also welcome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\n1. Except for the character selection, keep choice chapters to a minimum.<br>\r\n2. Focus on grammar and spelling. I will try to edit mistakes as best I can, but please use the spell check function.<br>\r\n3. No underage characters.<br>\r\n4. Have fun!</td>",
