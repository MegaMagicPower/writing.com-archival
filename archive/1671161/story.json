But you managed to yell out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! Please I'll do anything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pressure suddenly stopped, and the foot lifted off you allowing a view of Mewtwo's confused face. \"Anything you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ye-yes, just please don't kill me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mewtwo finally placed his foot next to the other. He then lifted a hand, summoning a chair to sit on. He then crossed both of his feet in front of you. Showing the soles that still may very well be decorated by your flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you are true to your word. Then kiss my feet as a sign of submission.\", although hesitate. You walked forward and pressed your lips against the smooth sweaty soles and gave a long smooch, hoping to please him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent. Now then obey my commands and I won't crush your body into paste.\", Mewtwo nonchalantly said leaning his head on his palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then I want you to......</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The legendary being\u2019s voice reverberates in your bones.  Your heart leaps to your throat, and you swallow hard before collapsing painfully to your knees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Better to be quick, you think, a bruised knee is much preferable to a powdered skull.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up.  You\u2019ve never bowed to someone before, not like this.  This only happens in movies.  You hope for some kind of feedback but the Mewtwo just stares down at you expectantly, somehow conveying dissatisfaction without ever changing his expression.  Dissatisfaction and something else:  An unsettling  eagerness.  To see you groveling at his feet?  Or to Kill you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you have time to ponder the question, Mewtwo lifts his foot.  You feel his excitement peak.  This is the end, you think, certain now that this creature wants to kill you, but you know you can not stop him.  The Mewtwo\u2019s shadow eclipses the light coming from overhead.  Before you adjust to the sudden lack of light, you hear a rush of wind, then you feel it on your skin, tossing your hair.  You reflexively turn your eyes downward, and press your nose to the floor, cowering from a pitiful end\u2014 a transformation to paste on some pokemon\u2019s sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt doesn\u2019t come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see the shadow of his foot still looming overhead.  You can make out the silhouette of all three toes as he wriggles them impatiently, expectantly.  You wonder if he wants something more, but you know each one of those toes is bigger than your head, so you don\u2019t dare to ask.  You remain still, with your face pressed to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have no concept of the amount of time you spent frozen, but your muscles begin to ache from their forced posture of reverence, and the bruises on your knees have become something more.  They\u2019re swelling now, a blessing in disguise, perhaps; a cushion of flesh and pain for the weary bone underneath.  Unused to being in line with your heart, your head throbs in time to your pulse.  Your mind busies itself pondering your circumstance.  You reason that there must be something that will satisfy your would-be executioner.  After all, if the point was to kill you, it would be done already.  He must have some sort of plan for you, or some sort of point to make.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the thought crosses your mind, an angry roar erupts from the being looming over you.  The shadow of Mewtwo\u2019s foot becomes larger and darker.  Your muscles tighten reflexively out of fear and you once again expect the worst.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your eyes, surprised again to be alive, but you feel a moist heat radiating onto your back.  The heat and moisture combine with a thick, cheesy musk.  Mewtwo\u2019s foot, you realize, shuddering at how close to death you were.  Something you did angered him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe adrenaline has left your body after sustaining you for what must have been hours. You feel like you are trying to breathe through a heavy blanket, and each breath is rewarded not with clean oxygen, but the taint of your captor\u2019s foot odor. You push your body lower, flattening your chest out against the hard ground, trying in vain to pull the cold out of the floor and into your tired and sweating body.   You can no longer see anything but the shadow of your death and the spots beginning to swim through that darkness as your body continues to toil in Mewtwo\u2019s body heat without water.  You close your eyes tight to drown out the darting lights and flecks.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the verge of collapse, you pray, internally, to any god that may save you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, your new god is a psychic type.  You do not speak, but he hears you yell.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Let me live.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bassy chuckle sounds from somewhere above, and you chance a glance upwards.  A single drop of the pokemon's sweat falls from his paw; a drop to him, but a bucket to you.  It inexplicably changes direction and falls as if you, not the earth, are the source of the gravity pulling it from the towering being's flesh.  You curl up to protect yourself from the foul fluid, but the impact still knocks the wind from you and flattens you to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother chuckle from Mewtwo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou move to prop yourself back up on all fours and try to fill your lungs, but before you recover Mewtwo's foot sweat is oozing its way up your body, collecting around your mouth and nose.  Reflexively you close your mouth and claw harmlessly at the fluid gathering around your head.  Your lungs begin to burn.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear Mewtwo's voice in your mind.  \"There's one way for you to survive.   If you don't drown in that little puddle, I'll keep you alive for the rest of your natural life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear his voice and...</span></div></div>",

It's impossibly salty, and somehow thick.  Your eyes begin to water, though you're not sure if it's the lack of air or the foul taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallow and suck down another mouthful, desperately clinging to consciousness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween the taste of unwashed feet and the texture of the slurry, you begin to feel nauseous.  A layer of grime coats your tongue and you work to spit it out, only to watch with horror as it mixes with the sweat that's slowly drowning you, and swirl about before resting against your lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMetwo's thoughts echo in your head once again.  \"You know how to make this end.  Drink up, and when you finish, you will thank me for <i>allowing</i> you to live.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head furiously, trying to shake the perspiration from your face, even for a second, just for one quick, life-giving breath of air.  It doesn't budge.  You gasp, and watch sullenly as the last air from your lungs bubbles its way up and out of the rest of your vomit-inducing beverage.  Resigned, you go back to drinking it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time you chew the grit and swallow.</span></div></div>",
