He had to shout, because he was deep inside the T-Ship, cramped in a small space too tiny for his large body. Even with his prehensile extensions attached to his arms, it was difficult moving anything around in here. \"The Rift Amplifier's just too alien. I have to make adapters for adapters for adapters if I'm ever going to get anywhere with this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I be of assistance now, friend Cyrborg?\" Starfire asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Star,\" Cyrborg replied monotonously. \"I already said I got this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarfire looked worriedly into the bowels of the T-Ship. She could barely see Cyborg's form among the mass of pipes, wires, and machinery. It honestly looked as if he was stuck in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave him,\" Raven muttered. \"He won't ask for help even when he's being choked by the cables.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will NOT be choked by my own cables!\" Cyborg replied angrily. \"Oi! BB! Where's that laser lance?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarfire watched as small green monkey jumped up into the access hatch of the T-Ship, carrying a small drill-shaped device. The monkey chirped cheerily as he handed it to Cyborg. \"Thanks, dude,\" Cyborg replied. Starfire heard what sounded like a welding torch, followed almost instantly by a clatter of tools and a surprised shriek from the monkey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BB! Don't touch the Wormhole Moderator! NO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a small explosion inside the T-Ship, and instantly a cloud of black, putrid smoke began billowing out of the hatch. Beast Boy dashed out of the hatch a moment later, while behind him there was a series of banging as Cyborg made his way out of the ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarfire caught a whiff of the smoke and immediately  pinched her nose. \"Ugh. It smells like the smoke blubbers of Barhee'sleth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fans on!\" Robin shouted. A faint hum became audible, and soon the smoke was being pulled up to vents in the roof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCyborg climbed out of the hatch, coughing heavily. \"Beastboy, when I say don't touch the Wormhole Moderator,\" he got to his feet, \"DON'T TOUCH THE WORMHOLE MODERATOR!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, man,\" Beastboy replied, sitting on the edge of once of the work tables. \"I just wanted to get that screwdriver.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCyborg face-palmed and shook his head. \"Ugh... well, now I have to get the Wormhole Moderator repaired before I even think of getting the Rift Amplifier hooked up. T-Ship's grounded for a week, guys!\" he announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin sighed. \"Hopefully we won't need it before then,\" he said. He turned around and walked out of the hangar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCyborg placed a small device down on the nearest work table. It immediately caught Starfire's attention, as its design was obviously not Cyborg's. \"What's is that?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the Rift Amplifier, Star,\" Cyborg said. \"I picked it up in that last fight with Overload. He couldn't get it to attach to him either. Obviously some friends from out of town designed it, but Robin can't get any matches on any of the designs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does a Rift 'Ambifyer' do?\" Starfire asked, looking at the small device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Overload said it targets space-time foam and amplifies the minor cracks in it, in a sense expanding space itself into a bubble that can move about the dimensions freely,\" Cyborg said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" Starfire hummed. \"I do not see the froth of liquids in space ever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCyborg shrugged. \"Nah, it's not like that,\" he said. \"Basically, it makes really really small parts of space into really big bubbles, and we ride the bubble.\" He tapped the device. \"I just need to make it hook up, that's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, or perhaps in response to the tap, a whirring rose up from the device, causing both Cyborg and Starfire to look at it. There was a click, and then a small port opened up on the side. \"Wha?\" Cyborg said. He picked it up to look at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo yellow beams shot from the device, and thanks to the angle Cyborg held it at, they went straight to Starfire's chest, striking her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first she felt nothing. \"What happened, friend?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, Star,\" Cyborg said, looking closer at the device. \"You okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarfire looked down at where the beams had struck. \"I appear unharmed,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly an aura of pleasure welled up in her breasts, causing her footing to become unsteady. She grabbed the table she was next to in order to keep from falling. \"Oh...\" she moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatsa matter?!\" Cyborg asked, shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarfire found she couldn't reply. The feeling was becoming stronger, and she was breathing heavily because of it. She shut her eyes and her head lolled back. \"Oh... ooooooh,\" she moaned, even louder than before. \"My... my grumplins,\" she said. \"They feel so... soooooo...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe aura of pleasure suddenly exploded in her, and her spine arched backward. Without any control, she screamed in ecstasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa!\" Cyborg exclaimed, as suddenly he noticed a physical change occurring in Starfire. Her breasts, underneath her latex clothing, were growing at an alarming rate. Within seconds, they had doubled in size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe incredible pleasure surging through Starfire continued to grow, and as her mind was lost to it, she let go of the table. Her hands wandered up to her expanding bosom and began massaging them. The incredible feeling grew even faster than before, and so too therefore did her breasts, doubling in size once again after only a few seconds of the massage. She was unaware of how much noise she was making; the moaning, the screaming, the laughing, it was all out of her control. She was lost in the intensity of the pleasure. And the more she massaged, the more her breasts grew and the more compelled she became to keep rubbing her breasts...</span></div></div>",

Everyone's eyes went wide \"So are you going to blow up something every time you sneeze\" Beastboy asked. \"No that's only when I first start sneezing\" she replied. Just then Starfire's chest swelled rapidly to a good 3 cup sizes from b cup to an e cup. Everyone just stared in aw seeing this. Is something the matter \"Star asked. Uhm star......your chest\" Robin pointed out. Starfire looked down at herself and noticed how big her tits have gotten. \"Oh yes that, this is a side effect to the cold I get on tamaran\" she explained. \"But your on earth how is it effecting you here\" Raven asked. \"I am not sure, but don't worry its not contagious\" she told everyone.

Starfire nodded her head \"My grebnargs will increase to tremendous  sizes until I have overcome my cold\" she said. Raven, Robin, Cyborg, and Beastboy all stared at each other in worry \"Well we can't just leave you here Star we gotta find more room for you to ...........grow\" Robin told her with embarrassment. \"Agreed, I propose we go down into the storage room, that will provide plenty of room\" Starfire said. So that's what they did, they lead starfire down to the storage room so she could grow, they didn't have to help carry her down considering she was already strong enough to carry herself down. Once they got down to the storage room they all turned to Starfire. \"Well here you go Starfire do you need anything else before we head upstairs?\" Robin asked.

When the word mood swings was heard Cyborg, Beast-boy and Raven all looked at Robin. \"What are you guys looking at me for\" He asked. \"Your the best at dealing with mood swings with people\" Cyborg told him. \"Yeah I wouldn't be able to handle that.\" Beast-boy added. \"Also your the best to know at what to do in a tight situation\" Raven finalized. So all three of them shoved Robin up front towards Starfire \"He'll be the one to take care of you star\" Cyborg announced. \"OH Happy day this day couldn't get any better\" Starfire cheered as she ran up to Robin and begins to hug him squeezing him in between her big gelatinous masses. Robins face went hard red feeling the softness in her huge jugs rubbing all over his body \"Dude........jealous\" Beast-boy said in despair. All Cyborg could do was nod his head in agreement. Raven though also blushed a bright pink thinking \"Oh man why couldn't that have been me\". When Starfire gets done hugging Robin she backs up a ways so Robin could get some breathing room. \"All right so if that's all you need then we'll head upstairs\" Cyborg said as the other three titans rushed their way up to top floor again.What happens next?</span></div></div>",
