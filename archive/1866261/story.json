There's your clothes, your toothbrush, some books about duel theory, your laptop - something seems like it's missing... your deck! In a panic, you rush around the room looking for where you've left it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zack!\"<br>\r\n\"Just a second Mom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had to be here somewhere... frantically you grope every inch of your small, messy room as you try to find it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you even doing Zack!? Come on!\"<br>\r\n\"I've lost something, okay mom? I can't find my deck! Why don't you just give me a second!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a short pause, and then you suddenly hear laughter from the foyer where your mother was waiting. \"You left your deck over here at the front door\" she calls over \"You said that if you put it here then you'll see it on your way out, so you won't forget it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou facepalm. D'oh! Of course your mother was right. She always was.<br>\r\n\"Thanks mom!\" you call as you race to the front door, dragging your heavy suitcase behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom didn't move, however. \"I can't believe my little Zack is finally all grown up\"<br>\r\nYou look at her strangely. \"Uh - mom, I'm still only fourteen\" you point out.<br>\r\n\"Being invited to big tournaments all around the globe... already the number one ranked duelist in Australia...\"<br>\r\n\"Uh - mom?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes darling?\"<br>\r\n\"We're in a hurry, remember?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh - right.\" Your mom giggles a bit as she opens the door for you \"After you\"<br>\r\nYou begin to leave the house before your mom stops you. \"Just don't forget to pick up your deck on your way out\" she says.<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah\" you reply, smiling, as you picked up your deck and made for your family's old car \"Thanks mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, your best friend Andrew is already waiting for you to say goodbye. \"Laters Zack - we'll all miss you around school!\"<br>\r\n\"Hey, no worries\" you say, opening the boot of the car and stuffing your suitcase inside \"I'll make sure to call you!\"<br>\r\n\"Don't forget!\" replies Andrew \"Oh - but DO forget about Rebekah. You can't let that interfere with your dueling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh. Andrew was right, though you didn't like to be reminded of how your former girlfriend dumped you. Apparently your obsession with card games was too much for her. But since she left you, you had been finding it hard to concentrate on your game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Andrew\" you say as you enter the car \"I'll bear that in mind\"<br>\r\n\"OK, time to go, see you later Andrew!\" calls your mom.<br>\r\n\"Bye!\" calls Andrew in reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the car drives away, you smile and wave at Andrew, who waves back from outside your house.<br>\r\n\"It's a pity they only paid for your ticket\" says your mom as she drives \"It would be awesome to be able to duel with your friends.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah\" you say \"But you never know. Maybe I'll meet some new friends at the tournament.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you will honey. By the way, what's this tournament called again? I always get confused with all those events you're always going to...\"</span></div></div>",

All the duelists are travelling first class on the special KaibaCorp jets, so you aren't sitting next to one of your competitors. Of course, this gives you plenty of time to run through your deck a few more times and work out some last-minute strategies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you disembark the aircraft, please show your identification\" continues the announcer \"And you will be issued with a free official KaibaCorp Duel Disk. Don't forget about the rules of the tournament, including the ante rule and the locator cards system.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright\" you say, stretching and getting up out of your seat \"I'm ready to duel!\"<br>\r\n\"Please remain seated until the seatbelt sign has been switched off\" added the announcer.<br>\r\nYou groan and sit back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last when you get out of the aircraft and step on to the tarmac, you feel a cool breeze hit your face. Then suddenly, you hear a shout: \"Hey look, it's Seto Kaiba!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't even know who said it, but immediately you look around and see him wearing his distinctive white coat. There, flanked by his brother Mokuba, was Seto Kaiba embarking on to a helicopter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow\" you say under your breath \"Seto Kaiba! Now he'd be a good challenge for my deck.\"<br>\r\n\"Hey, no kidding\" said the duelist behind you \"Seto's practically unbeatable. Only the likes of Pegasus or Yugi can stand up to him.\"<br>\r\n\"I think I've got a shot\" you reply with a smile \"It's worth giving it my all! I am the Australian national champion.\"<br>\r\n\"Some attitude you've got there\" he said with a sly smirk in response \"You remind me a bit of Rebecca Hawkings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca. Dammit, you weren't supposed to be thinking of your ex-girlfriend right now. You had to push her out of your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'm a much better duelist than her!\" you say a little louder than you should.<br>\r\n\"Why don't you prove it?\" asked the other duelist \"In a few moments we'll all get our duel disks. Then you can put your cards where your mouth is.\"<br>\r\n\"Game on!\" you say passionately, turning to your opponent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man was about twice your height and had bulky, bulging muscles. He had thick, spiky brown hair and wore a heavy yellow vest and helmet that made him look like a construction worker. \"Some outfit you have there\" you reply somewhat sarcastically, while a KaibaCorp official strapped a Duel Disk to your arm.<br>\r\n\"Some outfit you have\" replies the man as another official strapped a Duel Disk to his \"How old are you, seven?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm fourteen!\" you sneer.<br>\r\n\"Then you're still just a little baby\" laughs the man \"I am Conner Structer, here to engineer your defeat!\"<br>\r\n\"Let's duel this!\" you cry out. It was something of a catchphrase you had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConner jumps up on to the aircraft wing, and you follow suit, standing a good distance away from him. A small crowd of observers, most from your flight, gather around to watch the action as both of you insert your decks into the Duel Disks at the exact same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your name's Alex, isn't it?\" asks Conner \"They say you're a national champion.\"<br>\r\n\"That's an understatement\" you reply \"I'm one of the strongest duelists of my time!\"<br>\r\n\"Well then let's put that to the test\" smirks Conner \"And I hope you don't mind if I start the action off?\"<br>\r\n\"Go ahead\" you say as you both draw five cards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd beneath is already starting to chant your names. For your first duel, this is actually pretty exciting. Conner looks happy with his draw, and quite frankly, you are happy with yours, too. Both of your life points stand at 8000. The duel has begun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right then, here we go!\" calls Conner, drawing a card to begin his turn.<br>\r\n\"Bring it!\" you reply.<br>\r\n\"I'll begin with this - the magic card - Heart of the Underdog! With this card, whenever I draw a normal monster at the beginning of my turn, I can draw again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice card\" you reply \"Is that it?\"<br>\r\n\"You like that card, do you?\" asks Conner \"Then you'll love this! Because it just so happens that I've drawn a second copy of that card as well! Now whenever I draw a normal monster to begin my turn, I can draw not just one, but two more cards! And thanks to the magic of my Heart of the Underdog, I can keep drawing until the card I draw is not a normal monster!\"<br>\r\n\"Uh - nice\" you answer \"I know the card's effect. I've only studied it like, a million times already.\"<br>\r\n\"Then you must know how devastating it can be\" smiles Conner \"And I've drawn both of the copies in my deck in my opening hand! With this kind of luck on my side, you might as well give up now. You wouldn't want to disappoint this crowd the way you disappointed Rebekah, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow did this guy know so much about your personal life? It's pretty creepy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what kind of engineer are you, anyway?\" you ask, thinking of a comeback quickly \"Do you just sit around and engineer intimidation like a bully? Or do you really want to see me defeated?\"<br>\r\n\"I will see you whimpering at my feet!\"<br>\r\n\"In that case, mate, here's a protip - you don't want me to give up. I'm going to keep fighting this thing! Just watch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConner looked annoyed, but not too much. \"It's your funeral\" he scoffs \"You're going down! My deck's full of monsters that combine and build their strengths together!\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, you mean like a combo!\"<br>\r\n\"Like THIS! I activate another magic card - Polymerization! With this card I can fuse two monsters in my field or hand together to form an even stronger monster! So I'll use Polymerization to fuse together Blast Juggler and Two-Headed King Rex to construct the ultimate marvel of modern engineering - Cyber Saurus! Come forth, Cyber Saurus, in attack mode.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow\" you reply \"These holograms are pretty cool!\"<br>\r\n\"Just watch until they break down your life point by point! Cyber Saurus has 1800 attack points!\"<br>\r\n\"That's nice. Is it my turn yet?\"<br>\r\n\"Not quite. I'll set this one card face down in my magic and trap card zone, and then end my turn. Watch out little boy. I think you're in way over your head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see about that!\" you say as you draw your card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich deck were you using?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Alright, here goes\" you call out \"I'll begin by playing The Creator Incarnate!\"<br>\r\n\"Zack! Zack! Zack!\" chants the crowd below. Conner looked a little taken aback.<br>\r\n\"Now my Creator Incarnate is a pretty powerful monster on its own, with 1600 attack points, but the Creator Incarnate has a special ability too! Observe! First, I tribute my monster to the graveyard, and in its place, I summon The Creator from my hand!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mighty red hologram of the creator flashes down from the sky, causing the entire aircraft you are standing on to shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Behold the most powerful monster in my deck!\" you gloat \"The Creator! With 2300 attack points!\"<br>\r\nConner is quite positively shaking at this point.<br>\r\n\"You like that, do you?\" you say, mocking his tone \"Well then you'll love this! Behold, my Creator's special ability! All I have to do is send one card from my hand to the graveyard, and then I can special summon another card from my graveyard. So I'll begin by discarding this Magician of Faith, to summon The Creator Incarnate back to the field! And now I think I'll use The Creator Incarnate's special ability to summon a second The Creator from my hand!\"<br>\r\n\"TWO creators!?\" cries Conner incredulously.<br>\r\n\"That's right!\" you exclaim \"And between them, they form a way better team than any of the monsters in your deck!\"<br>\r\n\"We'll see about that!\" calls out Conner \"Hurry up and make your attack!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I'm far from finished\" you say \"Next I summon Soul of Purity and Light!\"<br>\r\n\"You can't!\" calls out Conner immediately \"You've already summoned The Creator Incarnate this turn!\"<br>\r\n\"Yes but like my The Creator cards, this is a special summon. All I have to do is remove two light monsters in my graveyard from play - and since my graveyard consists of exactly two light monsters, that shouldn't really be a problem. Now come forth, Soul of Purity and Light!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween them, you're pretty happy with how your three monsters dwarf Conner's poor Cyber Saurus.<br>\r\n\"This can't be happening!\" calls out Conner \"How on earth did you summon three powerful monsters with awesome effects and over 2000 attack points, all on your first turn!?\"<br>\r\n\"I told you\" you reply casually \"I'm one of the best duelists of my time. But my turn isn't done yet.\"<br>\r\n\"What!\" shouts Conner, looking stunned.<br>\r\n\"I've still got one card left in my hand, mate. And I'm sure you'd like to know what it is, right?\"<br>\r\n\"Actually, I think I'd rather not.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, but I think you would. It's my favorite field spell card - Luminous Spark!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as your card touched the Duel Disk, the entire wing erupted with a bright light, reflecting and amplifying the light all your monsters were giving off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This card raises the attack power of each of my monsters by 500 points. So that means my Creators go up to 2800 attack points each, and my Soul of Purity and Light goes up to 2500 attack points!\"<br>\r\n\"This can't be happening!\"<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah. It totally can. And now it's time for my attack! Go, Soul of Purity and Light! Destroy his Cyber Saurus!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on!\" interjects Conner \"You really thought you had me there, didn't you? Did you forget about my trap card?! I activate - Mirror Force!\"<br>\r\nThere is a huge gasp as the massive amounts of light all around the wing are reflected off at all angles. Pilots around the airport lose their vision in a inferno of light that now seems to surround the whole airport.<br>\r\n\"Mirror force!\" presses Conner \"Reflect the power of his attack right back at Zack and destroy all his monsters!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\" you scream as the light clears, and all your powerful monsters are gone.<br>\r\n\"It's all over!\" laughs Conner \"You have no cards in your hand! All your monsters are discarded to the graveyard. All you have left is that Luminous Spark, but you have no monsters for it to power up. And now, there is literally nothing more you can do other than end your turn!\"<br>\r\n\"Hey - I'm not giving up that easily! Make your move!\"<br>\r\n\"With pleasure!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConner draws his card and grins menacingly. \"It's all over for you now. Not only is my Cyber Saurus the only monster still on the field, but I just drew a normal monster, Two-Headed King Rex! Now, thanks to my two copies of Heart of the Underdog, I can draw another two cards from my deck!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConner draws two more cards. \"You're in luck, Zack\" he says \"Both magic cards. But of course, that doesn't make things any better for you! I activate Fusion Recovery! This card lets me return a monster used for a fusion summon, as well as the card Polymerization, back to my hand. So return to me, Polymerization and Blast Juggler!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner had he said it than his Duel Disk returned both cards from the slot used for the graveyard. \"And I think you know what happens next\" he continues \"I activate my Polymerization card, fusing the Blast Juggler I just recycled with the Two Headed King Rex I just drew to summon a second Cyber Saurus from my fusion deck!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd gasps as a second Cyber Saurus appears at Conner's side. \"And remember what I was saying earlier about my monsters all supporting each other? Well you're about to see that happen. I activate United We Stand on one of my Cyber Sauruses!\"<br>\r\n\"An equip spell!\"<br>\r\n\"That's right Zack! United We Stand increases the attack strength of my Cyber Saurus by 800 points for each monster I control. Since I have two Cyber Sauruses on my side of the field, that means my monster is 1600 points stronger, for a grand total of 3400 attack points!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!\" says one bystander as he watches the attack strength of the Cyber Saurus grow.<br>\r\n\"That's stronger than a Blue Eyes White Dragon!\" remarks another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And all that is going to be transferred straight to your life points, Zack!\" sneers Conner \"You still think you're one of the greatest duelists of our time.\"<br>\r\n\"If I come back from this\" you smile \"I probably am.\"<br>\r\n\"But you won't come back from this! How can you? There's barely a monster in the game that can stand up to my powerful monsters! And you said yourself that your deck doesn't contain anything more powerful than The Creator! Look at you right now - totally defenseless!\"<br>\r\n\"I trust my deck\" you say \"And unlike you, I believe in my potential. I will admit, you're clearly quite the expert, Conner. But this duel is not over yet!\"<br>\r\n\"We'll see about that!\" snaps Conner \"Go, my Cyber Sauruses! Attack Zack's life points for 5,200 points of damage!\"<br>\r\n\"Argh!\" you scream as the sheer force of the attack throws you backwards, and your life points fell from 8000 to 2800.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now go ahead and draw your last pathetic card\" laughed Conner \"There's no card that can stop me now!\"<br>\r\n\"We'll see about that! In fact, I'm pretty sure I can turn this duel around completely in this move\" you call, rubbing your head which was hit from your fall about Conner's big attack \"I draw!\"</span></div></div>",

So there's absolutely no way you'll ever be able to get him back. Your show was great while it lasted, Zack, but now it's all over. Just like it's all over between you and Rebekah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy does he keep going on about that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't be needing to summon my Creator for the rest of the duel. Just watch. It's my move, Conner\" you say confidently \"And I've drawn my Pot of Greed! This allows me to draw two cards from my deck!\"<br>\r\nConner scoffs. \"Yeah, whatever. Get it over with. You seem to be good at that.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm not going to be distracted that easily, Conner. I have complete faith in my deck! Just you watch. I summon my Herald of Creation! With the help of my Luminous Spark field spell card, my Herald of Creation has 2300 awesome attack points!\"<br>\r\n\"It's still nothing compared to the power of my Cyber Saurus! Cyber Saurus has over a thousand attack points more than your measly Herald of Creation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As may be, but as you might have guessed, my Herald has a special ability. By discarding one card from my hand, I can add any one level 7 or higher monster from my graveyard to my hand. Which means my Soul of Purity and Light is back in my hand!\"<br>\r\n\"What? Why aren't you bringing back your Creator?\"<br>\r\n\"I told you, I won't be needing it to win. But it gets worse. The card I just discarded to bring my Soul of Purity and Light back to my hand was The Fabled Catsith! When The Fabled Catsith is discarded from my hand to the graveyard, it can destroy any monster on the field! And I think you know which one I'm going to pick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no!\" is all Conner can say as his Cyber Saurus is demolished, along with the United We Stand that is attached to it.<br>\r\n\"Now I remove The Fabled Catsith and one of my Creators in my graveyard from play\" you announce \"To summon the Soul of Purity and Light to the field!\"<br>\r\nOnce again the angelic figure came down with all its 2500 attack points, giving a spectacular light show to the crowds below.<br>\r\n\"This is not good!\" Conner remarks.<br>\r\n\"Now watch this, Conner! Go, Soul of Purity and Light! Destroy his weaker Cyber Saurus and deal 700 points to damage to his life points! And Herald of Creation! Deal 2300 points of damage to his life points directly, for a grand total of 3000 points of damage!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" cries out Conner as his life points drop to 5000.<br>\r\n\"See, I told you I'd turn things around in my move. Now look who's standing defenseless before my monsters, eh? And you've got nothing more in your hand either!\"<br>\r\n\"That's exactly what my Heart of the Underdog magic cards are for!\"<br>\r\n\"Well go on then, Conner! Draw your card, and let's see what it is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, Conner turns over his card. \"Well, would you look at that. It's the same card that you drew - Pot of Greed. Now I can draw another two cards from my deck.\"<br>\r\n\"That's not a problem. Since it's outside of your draw phase, your Heart of the Underdog cards won't activate even if you draw a normal monster. So go ahead! Draw your cards!\"<br>\r\n\"That doesn't matter to me!\" says Conner full of annoyance as he draws his two cards \"I set one card face down and end my turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then\" you say \"It's my turn! I draw! And look what we have here!\"<br>\r\n\"What! What is it!?\"<br>\r\n\"It's another one of my favorite magic cards - Change of Heart! This allows me to take control of your monster until the end of your turn!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden silence fills the crowd. Conner seems to be just barely standing. \"This can't be!\" he exclaims \"This can't be! It simply can't be happening! No!\"<br>\r\n\"I flip your monster face up - Mashmallon? Interesting. That would have hurt my life points quite a bit if I'd attacked it.\"<br>\r\n\"You're cheating! You have to be cheating!\"<br>\r\n\"Nope\" you flash a smile \"I'm just better than you. Go, Soul of Purity and Light! Deal 2500 points of damage directly to his life points!\"<br>\r\n\"ARGH!\" screams Conner as his life points halve.<br>\r\n\"Now it's your turn, Herald of Creation! Attack!\"<br>\r\nOnce again Conner's anguished screams fill the air.<br>\r\n\"And now for the grand finale - Conner's marshmallon! Attack Conner directly and wipe out his remaining life points!\"<br>\r\n\"NO!\" squeals Conner as he falls to his knees, and his life points drop to zero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, the crowds below have taken to chanting your name over and over again. \"Zack! Zack! Zack!\" they say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! This isn't right! I was meant to win!\" wailed Conner.<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm sorry, but you didn't. So... um... I think I get your strongest card and locator card, now, right?\"<br>\r\n\"NO WAY!\" screams Conner, as he throws his entire duel disk, with the locator card and his deck in it, into the airplane engine.<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?!\"<br>\r\n\"What does it look like I'm doing, idiot? I'd rather see my cards destroyed than let any of them get into your hands!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" says an official, running over \"That's against the official rules!\"<br>\r\n\"So what?\" asks Conner \"You going to have me arrested for destroying my own property? You should know I don't have any respect for my cards or this game!\"<br>\r\n\"No\" replies the official \"We'll have you arrested for vandalizing that aircraft engine. That's KaibaCorp property.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the official climbs on to the wing, however, Conner jumps off and runs away down the tarmac. \"Stop him!\" yells the official.</span></div></div>",

She held her great-grandfather's Blue Eyes White Dragons, there were now many of them, but not alot of people used them. I was probobly the only other person than Sarah to use the Blue Eyes White Dragon. I had only two while she had all three and his deck. I looked up to the Kaiba Family and treated each one I met with Respect. My family had some close ties to Kaiba Corp, my father was on the board, surprising he didn't lose his job after the kidnapping done by Pegasus. But I knew that Sarah was troubled and I wanted to check on her. I came over closer to her, but she still didn't look at me. I came over a little closer to her again, no response, but then a third time, She responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Note: I want to give credit to Spindleshanks for the creation of Sarah Kaiba and for her creativity, I recommend checking her out here.

I thought for sure you would after all that practice we did together.\" She had a small smile but it vanished just as quickly as it appeared. \"Well, at least we didn't go down to Slifer Red.\" She said looking at the bright side.

I was probobly the first to stand up to the three top Obelisk boys. I dueled Chazz and came out the victor. After the duel, His buddies tried to attack me, but that didn't well for them. They ended on the ground and I had a black eye from it after Chazz cheap shot me and ran off. I didn't get in trouble, but Dr. Crowler has a closer eye on me than Jaden. But Sarah thanked me for protecting her. A few weeks later, first exams came up and I came close, but wasn't moved up. But Sarah, though, could of if she wanted to, but choose to stay in Ra Yellow, for our friendship meant something much greater, so we made a promise, that we would go together to Obelisk Blue or stay together, no matter what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah then spoke, \"Yea, but they'll learn.\" I smiled and hugged her to help her feel better. Sarah just smiled and hugged back and got up. \"We better get back in bed before we get caught.\" I nodded and walked back to the dorm with her and led her to her room, hugged her and said good night. She walked into her bedroom and after saying Night, closed the door. I walked to my room a few doors down and walked in and layed down on my bed, thinking about tomorrow and what new adventures and duels would happen and finally went to sleep.</span></div></div>",

I smiled back at my dragon and got out of my bed and went over to my desk where my deck and my PDA was. I picked up my deck and saw my Mix of Dragons and many other creatures and then placed the deck in my side deck pocket. Then I picked up my PDA and saw I had a few messages. One from Jaden, who always checked on me and always wanted to duel me. One from Alexis, who tells me if she needs help with anything when Jaden's busy or if one of the Obelisk Girls start to have a crush on me. But last one surprised me, Sarah sent me a message after I walked her back to her room last night. I didn't hear my PDA beep since I sometimes forget its on vibrate. I clicked her message and read what she sent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Adam, I want to thank you for checking on me last night. I'm glad I have such a good friend like you. :) \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled at her message and sent a reply. \"Welcome Sarah.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>My name is Sarah Marie Kaiba.<br>\r\nI am the top duelist in the world, Just ask anyone. I have defeated the 'best' duelists that have come to duel me, and a now working on the rest of them. Though I don't duel very often any more because I am pretty busy running my family's company, in case you didn't guess Kaiba Corp., and also raising my little brother mark.  Our parents dissapeared when I was twelve and mark was five, none of our relatives wanted us, well none that we knew of, and so we were placed into an orphange, but what I could never sort out was that there were at least ten different orphanges in New Domino city and yet we get sent to one in the Satalite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have my ideas on that one but I've never been one to poke the sleeping dragon. I hated the satalite, absolutely hated it. the people were nice enough but it was not the place i wanted my little brother to grow up in,that being the case I set about planning our escape. <br>\r\nNow I coudn't rely on my grandfather's luck of having some rich socialite coporate head coming to the satalite to make nice with us 'mere mortals', but I could rely on my wits to help me get what I needed. and at the moment that was a computer with wifi.<br>\r\nThe dolts in New Domino made a mistake by sending me there, after all the people of the satalite reuse the trash that we send to them, don't they?  and since I inhereited more than my grandfathers good looks and his duel deck I was able to put to gether a computer and get it running with almost no problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter building my computer I started doing two things, the first was locating my godfather, and the second was buying back Kaiba corp, which as I had leaned with in days of my arrival had been bought out by Rex Goodwin. I was furious for days after hearing that. besides Martha, the woman who became all but a mother to me and mark, there were only two people who dared to go near me durring those ill tempered days. Jack Atlas and Yusie Fudo, granted I didn't much care for company and Jack stopped trying after the first two days, yusie hung in there and tried everything he could to cheer me up at least a little bit.<br>\r\nI had learned to distance myself from people by then, so he didn't get very far, but it was the thought that counted. <br>\r\nBut back to the here and now, I had bought back my family's company, and after some digging had found my godfather, who was thankfully more than willing to take us in. Of course our godfather, who by some twisted since of irony was also an uncle of ours, would have taken in the whole world, but that's a moto for you. More kindess than smarts.<br>\r\nMoto? you ask?  Yeah there's one more thing I need to tell you my uncle is Jackson Moto. the grandson of the king of games. My dad who was Seto Kaiba's son had married my mom (Well Duh!) who was our uncle jack's sister. Why he didn't step up before is unclear but his story, and I'm willing to believe it, is that he was told that we had vanished with our parents. Leave it to goodwin to twist the facts just enough to suit his needs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took back control of my company and began running it myself, talk about history repaeting itself huh? But I could only do that if I kept up my grades in school, according to my uncle Jack. It seemed fair after all I put together a computer made from scraps and it worked, so what was a little school? But it's now five years later, I'm seventeen and my sweet, adorable little brother is twelve, and I'm the full time C.E.O of Kaiba Corp. Goodwin had not been pleased when I took back control, and was even less pleased when I shut down the EnerD progect to repurpose my company (Again!) back to what it was origonally, a gaming company. But I was the owner along with my little brother, so what did I care that Goodwin was ticked? As it turns out I should have cared, a lot.<br>\r\nbecause my story doesn't begin in New Domino, ( know I could have said that sooner right?) no my story begins in the Satalite. I had been abducted (Agian!)<br>\r\nThis seems to be an on going theme for my family. I don't remember how I got there, but i do know that what ever moron thought to bring me back here was dumb enough to let me keep my cards and dueldisk. I check my deck looking for three cards in particular, My grandfather's blue eyes white dragons. <br>\r\n'Well I'll be able to get some duel practice at least.' I thought as I started to look around. the place was even worse than I remembered it being. everything was so....delapadated. I heard a motor running something coming towards me. Something fast!<br>\r\nI moved out of the way and tried to hide, but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stepped out of the alley, \"Can I help you officer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing out here it's passed curfe-Sarah Kaiba!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah don't go shouting it to the heavens you great lout.\" I said irritablely  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Miss Kaiba,\" the officer said, \"Is there something I can do for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah get me a cell phone.\" I replied, getting out of there would take a little time, so I had to wait and plan, but I could call Mark and make sure that hew as ok.<br>\r\nHe handed me his cell phone, I pulled the back off quickly and removed a bugg in the phone, and then called mark.<br>\r\nAfter making sure my little brother was all right and that uncle jack would keep him out of sight until i got back I tossed the phone back to the officer. I was about to ask where I could get a decent nights sleep when he darted off after a kid riding a red duelrunner.<br>\r\n\"Yusie Fudo!\" he yelled, \"Surrender now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here for another duel trudge? he taunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got lucky the last time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrudge huh? <br>\r\nWait<br>\r\nDid he say?<br>\r\nI took off after the two of them. I remembered the satalite like the back of my hand, well the alleys any how.<br>\r\nWhen I caught up with them I saw them mid duel, Yusie was fantastic! I hadn't seen a duelist like him ever, he reminded me of my grandfather seto almost but also my grandfather Yugi. Well what I imagined they'ed be like any way. trudge lost the duel miserabley. I called out to Yusie just before he could speed off, when he looked at me he looked like he'd seen a ghost.<br>\r\nI guess you never do forget some people. I sure never forgot him.<br>\r\n\"S-Sarah?\" he finally managed to ask, \"is that you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the living.\" I replied as I stepped out of the shadows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess the Alley Cat came back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For a time.\" I replied with a smile, \"Still being a junkyard dog?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know it.\"</span></div></div>",

I consider myself lucky for being related to them, but sadly that is all the luck I ever have in life. Technically speaking Syrus would be my great-great-great grandfather. And as such, his deck and cards have been passed down through each generation. Though, my father never really used them. My brother was against it too, so I took them instead. I did not know why they were neglected, I loved all of the cute monsters. However, I soon learned why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet me start from the beginning, I was born in Neo Domino City. I was born after the whole Satellite incident. In school, I loved my cards and often took them everywhere I went. I attended Duel Academy and loved battling. However, things weren't always right. My deck, as others and I sometimes say, is obsolete. Fusion monsters do not play a big role in Duel Monsters anymore, and Synchro Monsters were more famous. My deck was always beaten, taunted, and I myself was forced into the taunting. Some of the friends I had and even my brother gave me a new deck to use, but I did not want to change my deck completely. If my distant grandfather could use his deck and win, then I could too. Problem is, I've been having a hard time using it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, I was invited by Akiza to show me her friend's garage. Akiza became one of my first friends, seeing how she knew exactly how I felt being picked on. I wore my blue uniform nicely, since I had no idea how to dress around those guys. \"Are you sure Akiza?\" I asked her as we walked. \"I mean, I thank you for inviting me but, I don't think I should come.\" I brushed my gray hair nervously, and adjusted my glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sylene...\" Akiza spoke calmly, \"Its alright. My friends will not judge you from your deck. You're good, you just need to see it for yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled, knowing that Akiza really was trying to help me. Luckily the garage was not much farther now.</span></div></div>",

I knew of Akiza's feelings towards Yusei, but that did not mean he wasn't hot. He stopped his runner and approached us, cleaning off his cheek in the process. \"Hey Akiza, who's your friend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled, \"Yusei, I would like you to meet Sylene Truesdale. She's a fellow student and friend of mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI bowed, but my nervousness could obviously be seen. \"P-Pleased to meet you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYusei gave me a warm smile, which did not handle well with my nervous behavior or my red face. Akiza approached him, \"Yusei, I need to speak with you on something...Sylene don't go anywhere.\" I tried to stop blushing, even if that was impossible. Despite Akiza being my friend, I was scared of her. I mean, the whole \"Black Rose\" incident really did not play well on anyone. But, I am still her friend. Her and Yusei went off to another area, so I took the time to look around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was another thing I never really got into is Turbo Dueling. I mean, I did own a scooter that could go really fast, but I never decided to Turbo Duel. I never understood Speed Spells, mainly because I did not know of a single one that could help me out, being a Fusion deck and all. But one thing I did know pretty well was machines, and Yusei's was very well built. I just wish I could take a look inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sylene...\" Yusei's tone startled me, so I accidentally fell back in surprise. He put his hand out, \"Sorry, I never meant to startle you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blushed as I was helped up, \"Uh, oh, it's...it's fine...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, as I was saying, I heard you were having trouble with your deck.\" I was completely shocked, how did he know about that? Though, the serious look on Akiza's face automatically answered it for me. \"Akiza told me of the several duelists at your school taunt your deck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could not help but to look sad, could you blame me? \"Well...yeah...\" I held my deck out to show him, \"It's a passed down deck from generation to generation of my family. I...I was the only one in this generation that actually wanted it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watched as he shuffled through my cards. \"That's weird...some of these are a bit different...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right, you see some of my friends and family members gave me a few cards to help me out. Plus there is a few childhood cards in there too. I...I couldn't help but to mix them in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe handed me my deck, \"Well, you have a pretty good deck. I think you could do well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That makes one of us...\" I sighed, but soon found that I had a hand on my shoulder. My blushed deepened as soon as I saw it was Yusei.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, over the past couple of months, a lot has happened. But I do know that no deck is worthless, as long as you have the right faith.\" Yusei gave me a smile, \"So that is why I would like to duel you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stepped back in surprise, not expecting that at all. \"D-D-Duel me? B-But...m-my deck...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Has potential, as long as you believe it can. So what do you say Sylene? Care for a friendly duel?\" Both he and Akiza gave a nice smile. But dueling Yusei would be like a newbie taking on a world renowned champion, and that is exactly how this duel will be like! But, he said my deck has potential. He has been known to get out of tight spots before, but should I or should I not duel him.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>(Sorry about this note, but I decided to change to 3rd person instead of 1st. Also, I do not know how to type a duel properly.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylene nodded gently, \"Uh...okay...maybe a small duel wouldn't hurt.\" She rummaged through her backpack for her duel disk as Yusei went to retrieve his. His runner set it out easily before placing it on his arm. Sylene placed her deck in the holder and it was instantly shuffled. Both duelists stepped out of the garage and onto the area before it to duel. Each of their disks activated, illuminating the disks with energy. \"Let's duel!\" And with that, the match started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...I-I'll go first...\" Sylene spoke as she drew. It could be easily seen that she was nervous; her hands were shaking as she looked at her draw. \"uh...I-I summon Truckroid in Attack mode.\" <b>Truckroid ATK: 1000</b> Upon summoning it, Sylene seemed to calm down a bit. \"I end my turn with a face down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYusei looked to her, \"Not a bad first move, but let's see if I can do better.\" He drew his card and looked to his hand. \"I summon Speed Warrior in Attack Mode!\" One of Yusei's signature cards, summoned on the first turn, posed for battle. <b>Speed Warrior ATK: 900</b> \"And now, his special ability activates. On the turn he is summoned, his attack points double. So now with that power boost, Speed Warrior will attack Truckroid!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, 1800 attack points?!\" Sylene asked in shock. However, before she could proper get her answer, Speed Warrior charged and destroyed Truckroid, along with her losing 800 Life Points.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I place a card face down and end my turn.\" Yusei looked up to her, \"Its your move.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylene broke out of her state of shock, \"Oh...right...\" She drew her card. She looked at all of her cards in nervousness, trying to even think of a way to win. Then, her face cracked a smile. \"Oh yeah! I think I might actually have something here!\" That stated, Yusei and Akiza smiled. \"First I'm activating my trap card, Call of the Haunted! That allows me to summon a monster that was destroyed by battle, so Truckroid is coming back!\" Her card flipped up, and soon Truckroid drove straight out of it. \"Next, I'm playing Polymerization!\" A fusion vortex soon formed behind her. \"With Ploymerization, I can fuse two or monsters as long as they're on my field or in my hand. So I'm fusing together Ambulanceroid and Rescueroid!\" Upon mentioning of their names, the two monster appeared on the field. But then, they were both lifted and sucked into the vortex. \"I now summon, Ambulance Rescueroid!\" The giant red vehicle came smashing out, sirens ablaze. <b>Ambulance Rescueroid ATK: 2300</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYusei smiled, \"Its seems your confidence is up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well how about this?! My Truckroid will attack Speed Warrior!\" Her monster revved forward straight towards him. \"Oh, and guess what? When Truckroid destroys a monster, its instead equipped to him. So which means my Truckroid will soon gain a boost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Sylene, but its not that easy.\" Sylene looked shocked. \"I activate the trap card Scrap Iron Scarecrow!\" His trap flipped up, and soon a rusty imitation scarecrow stood in the way. Truckroid crashed against it and skidded back to his side. \"Now, because of this card it can be set back down. However, I can only use it once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylene smiled a bit, \"Then that means I can still destroy him! Ambulance Rescueroid, attack!\" Sirens blaring, her monster charged, slamming into Yusei's Speed Warrior and destroying it. Soon Yusei's life points dropped to 2600. \"I...I landed a hit?! I landed a hit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYusei smiled, \"You see, you're deck is good. You just need to make the right choices. However, its not good enough to beat my deck.\" He drew his card, \"First I'll summon Junk Synchron!\" The famous Tuner monster appeared before them. <b>Junk Synchron ATK: 1300</b> \"Next I'll activate the card Double Summon, which allows me to summon another monster this turn. And I think I'll summon Nitro Synchron!\" In the summoning flash, another Tuner joined the field. <b>Nitro Synchron ATK: 300</b> \"And because I summoned Junk Synchron, I get to summon a level 2 or below monster from my graveyard. And I choose Speed Warrior!\" His monster returned from the grave. <b>Speed Warrior DEF: 400</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylene looked scared, \"Uh oh...prepare yourselves you two!\" Her monster seemed to nod, but it could just be a trick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now, I'll tune my Speed Warrior with my Junk Synchron, to Synchro Summon Junk Warrior!\" With a pull of his cord, Junk Synchron soon burst in a surge of energy, three rings encircling Speed Warrior. Two stars appeared from him, and soon a new monster appeared. Junk Warrior appeared, posing in the way he always does after being summoned. <b>Junk Warrior ATK: 2300</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylene panicked, \"I-Its okay Sylene...h-he can only destroy one monster...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, but first, Junk Warrior's ability activates. You see, since Nitro Synchron is a Level 2, that means Junk Warrior gains the attack power of him.\" Soon Junk Warrior's attack points raised to 3100. \"And now, Junk Warrior attack Ambulance Rescueroid! Go Scrap Fist!\" Junk Warrior charged in for an attack. \"Oh, and before he destroys a monster, I'll activate this card, Domino Effect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlyene looked scared, \"W-What does that do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I discard a card from my hand for every monster you have, I can destroy them all in one move. So by discarding one card, Truckroid goes down with him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!\" As Scrap Fist made contact, Ambulance Rescueroid toppled over and landed on Truckroid. They were both destroyed, much to Sylene's disappointment. However, due to the initial attack, Sylene only lost 800 life points, dropping hers down to 2400. \"And now, my next attack will commence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylene looked at him, \"How? Nitro Synchron doesn't have enough attack points to take me down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but I'm not attacking, I'm tuning.\" Sylene gulped in fear. The meter on the monster's head hit the end, and soon Junk Warrior was encircled by two rings. A new monster soon appeared, a massive and scary monster. \"I Snychro Summon, Nitro Warrior!\" Nitro Warrior roared in fury. <b>Nitro Warrior ATK: 2800</b> \"And now Nitro Warrior's special ability activates, since I used a Spell card this turn, his attack points increase by 1000. But since I used two, that means he gains an even bigger boost.\" Nitro Warrior's points added up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-N-No way...4800 attack points?!\" Sylene nearly screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, now Nitro Warrior attack! Dynamite Crunch!\" Sylene could only panic as Yusei's monster rocketed towards her with all those points. The sheer result knocked her back, causing her deck and hand to fall. She laid there in a slump, Life Points now at 0. The duel ended, Akiza running up to Yusei.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yusei, what happened to giving her a confidence boost?!\" she asked him angrily. \"You didn't have to pull a move like that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylene laid on the ground as they argued, crying. Her tears hit the cards below her. She whimpered, \"I-I'm a failure...to all of those before me...I-I don't deserve you guys...\" She cried a bit more, trying to hide herself from the world. Footsteps approached, and she was well aware who they were. Yusei bent down and picked up a card, a card that was in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could have won you know...\" Sylene looks up to him, confused. \"One you could have attacked with that fusion of yours first, and then used your Truckroid to steal Speed Warrior. The other is that you could have saved yourself with this card.\" He held it up, showing it was her monster Kiteroid. \"This card was in your hand, and when you discard it to your graveyard with no monsters...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...it negates all battle damage for the turn\" Sylene added on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sylene, you're not a bad duelist, and your deck is not bad either. You just need to look in your cards and start adapting to the duel as it progresses.\" He put his hand out, \"We can help you if you life.\"</span></div></div>",

She ran off, not even looking back. Yusei and Akiza were both surprised. As she ran off, the others came by. Crow was the first to speak up, \"Hey, what was all that about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYusei began picking up her deck. Jack and Crow came closer. \"Yusei, who was that girl you just dueled?\" asked Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her name is Sylene\" he said. \"She was a classmate of Akiza's who she asked me to give her some confidence in her deck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack huffs, \"That sure didn't look like confidence to me. Don't you think Yusei would be a bad choice for an easy win? He's not one to throw a duel for a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just thought...\" Akiza went silent as Yusei stood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's right Akiza. I should have went easier on her than the way that I did. But I thought she would know her own deck well enough to put up a good fight.\" He placed the deck back into her duel disk. He faced Akiza, \"We should return these to her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins, Leo and Luna, soon approached. \"Hey Akiza, wasn't that Sylene?\" asked Leo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did something happen?\" asked Luna. \"She didn't look to happy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkiza just sighed as a response. The two told everyone to enter the garage so they could explain. The reactions were all mixed; Jack felt like Sylene really was a wimp who couldn't duel, Crow felt sorry for her, Luna was concerned for her and her deck, and Leo was just too interested in her deck and the battle. \"I never even heard of a Vehicroid Deck before!\" Leo exclaimed, \"So cool!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's because the Vehicroid's were one of the first fusion decks to be created back when fusion monsters became a big deal\" Yusei explained. \"Not many duelists use a fusion deck anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo nodded, \"Yeah, hardly any good duelist uses them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack faced the boy twin with anger, \"I use some Fusion monsters you little brat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they argued, Luna approached. \"I listened to her cards, and they say that she's a really good person\" she explained. \"But she is always pressured by her family and friends to be replaced.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkiza shook her head, \"That deck has been passed down since her great grandparent Syrus Truesdale used it in Duel Academy before the city was redone. If I was her I couldn't imagine replacing this deck.\" She faced them, \"I know where she lives, so we could probably return the deck to her, along with her duel disk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYusei nodded, \"Mind if I tag along?\"</span></div></div>",

Even though they were fast, the boy recognized them. \"Yusei...Akiza?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown the street, they stopped in front of a really tall and luxurious building. Yusei took his helmet off, \"Sylene sure lives in a nice place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its no wonder\" Akiza replied, \"She's a Truesdale. They're one of the richest families here in Neo Domino. They're not the wealthiest, but their up there.\" Akiza placed her helmet down in her duel runner. She managed to glance down to what looked like a garage. Outside looked like a scooter, but it seemed to also look like a motorcycle. \"I never knew Sylene had a license for those.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Yusei could looked, a voice caught his attention more. \"Yusei? Is that you bro?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned and smiled, \"Adam, nice to see you again.\" They shook hands as they approached. \"Thanks again for that part I needed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After everything, it was the least I could do.\" He looked to his friend. \"And this must be Akiza. I must agree with you Yusei, she is quite fetching.\" This caused both Yusei to give Adam an angry look, and for Akiza to turn from embarrassment. \"So, are you two trailing that girl too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, tall, beautiful, glasses, long gray hair, crying a lot...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's Sylene\" Akiza spoke, \"And we're trying to return her deck.\" She held it up, \"She dropped it and ran from losing against Yusei.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I lost against Yusei before\" he spoke, \"I never really wanted to do that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but you don't have the constant taunting\" Yusei added. \"Sylene is taunted by others, and even her family that her deck needs to change.\" Adam instantly looked saddened by this statement. \"I was hoping a duel would help show her that she could win, but it seems like I only made it worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam looked at her deck, the one in Akiza's hands. \"Yusei...let me talk to her.\" Both Akiza and Yusei looked up to him from that. \"If anyone understands this girl its me. I was once at the bottom with my deck, but now I'm a good duelist and I hardly use any of those new Synchros...let me.\" Yusei nodded, asking Akiza to hand him the deck. After Adam grabbed the deck, he leaned in, \"You know...there could be something else you could do to cheer her up...\" He glanced back at her motorcycle.</span></div></div>",

Her hair was a mess, glasses setting on her desk, and dressed in messy sleepwear. She kept sobbing, crying out even though her tears ran out a while back. <i>I'll never become a good duelist...even with a new deck, I'll never be on top...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a knock at her door. She turned away, \"Go away dad...I know you want to give more deck suggestions...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...sorry, I'm not your dad.\" Sylene was shocked because she knew that voice just recently, and no one usually knew where she lived. She approached her door and opened it, seeing the boy from before. He glanced down but smiled, \"Uh, did I come at a bad time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylene looked down and blushed, covering herself up with a blanket. \"What are you doing here?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought I'd return a deck...\" She looked down, seeing that it was her deck. She turned, \"That deck isn't mine...it belongs to someone else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's funny, I could have sworn that this was your deck. I mean, not many Fusion decks still exist, and this one is pretty good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its not...\" Sylene slumped back onto her bed, \"Nothing of mine is ever good. That deck may be good, but I'm not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam walked over and sat on the edge of her bed. \"Look Sylene, I know you hardly know me, and I'm probably invading like three rules of your personal space, but I do know a couple of things. People set yourself shorter than what they think. You are a good duelist, you just need to look at your cards and not be nervous. If you learn your deck inside and out, then you wouldn't have to worry about it.\" Adam stood, but placed the deck on her dresser. \"Just, think about it.\" He walked out, closing the door as he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hour passed, and Sylene never moved from that spot. However, it was almost like some of her cards were speaking to her. She finally got up, went to her dresser, and picked up her deck. She drew the first card, her favorite one too, Gyroid. She looked at the burned edges, seeing as how she saved that card after some bullies tried to burn it. As she looked at the card, it seemed like the picture moved. Gyroid blinked at her, which scared Sylene slightly. She looked down at him, smiling, \"Well, if you guys think I can do it...\" She nodded, \"Then I will!\" She was soon on her bed, her deck spread out with all of her cards out and about. She spent the night, looking over each one.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next morning was a bit of a rough one. Sylene never went to sleep, and when she did, her cards were everywhere. Then, her alarm went off loudly, startling her. She fell on the opposite side of the bed, slamming her forehead off the ground. She held her ears, \"Why did I set it on a Saturday?!\" Then, without cause, it went off. She got up, looking at her clock. Usually her clock only stopped whenever she slammed it. The only thing near her clock was the burned Gyroid card. Again, she picked it up. The card winked at her once more. She smiled, \"Looks like you're looking out for me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the weirdness going on, she pushed it aside. She studied her deck all night, every card she ever got. In truth she had more than a Vehicroid deck, she had a few other cards from her friends at the academy. So, she put them in there and they seemed to work. She walked to her closet and looked at her wardrobe. Besides her school uniform, she did not have much else. She pondered, \"I wonder...maybe I should...make a new statement for my new confidence...\" She grabbed several of her other clothes and ran off out of her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the garage, Yusei was still working on his project. It was hidden underneath a white tarp for secrecy. He, Bruno, and Adam were inside helping. Adam wiped his forehead of the sweat and grease, \"I never thought you would actually do this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYusei stood next, \"Well it's a good idea. Giving her that talk of yours was a good start to get her interested. And maybe if she could Turbo Duel she could become even greater.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruno nodded, \"You're just lucky that we had enough scrap and such to make this. Though, I doubt I would ever make this again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other two nodded. Adam shuffled through his deck, \"I'm just hoping my talk was enough. I'm ready to show what I'm made of to this girl. Though, I told her I didn't use Synchro Monsters...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYusei placed a hand on his shoulder, \"That was nice of you, and knowing you, Sylene probably is better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She must be with what she's wearing...\" Bruno pointed out to the entrance. There stood Sylene, however she was far off from the quiet schoolgirl she was yesterday. The outfit she wore revealed it. It was obvious what she wore was a collage of different pieces, but it fitted together nicely. She wore a blue vest with a black undershirt but with short sleeves and a V neck that showed a bit of her chest, but only a bit. She wore a slacked white skirt with free falling frills of pink fabric that drifted down near the ground. Her hair was kept together in front of her face over her left eye, and in the back of her head as two separate ponytails coming from the same point in the back. She still wore her glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello boys\" she spoke with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sylene?\" asked Yusei. \"What...are you wearing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylene blushed, \"Uh, well, I figured since all of you guys have signature looks...I though I could too...\" She twirled around, \"What do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look nice\" Adam said as he approached. \"However are you ready to face me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Face you...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Yusei told me about yesterday, so I figured you might as well duel someone else. What do you think?\"</span></div></div>",

A few moments later, Adam (who was dressed in a black vest with a Blue Dragon Emblem on his back, showing off his arm muscle and was wearing a pair of black fingerless gloves, which matched his dark denim blue jeans and black and blue high top sneakers and was also wearing a sliver necklace, but she couldnt see was hanging on the chain, since it was hidden in the vest and the shirt under the vest.) and Sylene walked outside the garage and walked 20 paces distance and prepared their decks by shuffling them as Bruno and Yusei walked outside and being watching them prepare until both Sylene and Adam were ready and said, \"Let's Duel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylene: 4000 Adam: 4000<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylene drew her first card, \"The first move is mine!\" She looked at her hand. \"First, I'll summon a monster in face down Defense position!\" The card appeared, \"And now I end my turn.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam spoke before he drew his card, \"A fine first move, my draw.\" Adam looked at his hand. \"I summon Axe Dragonute in attack mode. *2000/1200* Now, Axe Dragonute, show us what the face down is, with Flying Axe Fury. Axe Dragonute jumped into the air and it's giant axe landed on the face-down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe card flipped up, showing it was Des Koala. *DEF 1800*\u00a0Sylene smiled, \"You shouldn't have done that.\" Before the monster was destroyed, he swiped his claws towards Adam. \"You see, Des Koala has a flip effect. For every card in your hand, you take 400 points of damage for each one!\" Since Adam had five, he was hit with 2000 points of damage. She smiled, \"Not a bad way to start if I do say so myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylene: 4000 Adam: 2000<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam chuckled, \"Nice trap, Sylene, I wasn't expecting that. So, now my effect of Dragonute activates and moves him to defense mode, and I'll place two face downs and end my turn.\" Adam smiled and got ready for Sylene's next turn. *DEF: 1200*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylene drew her next card. \"I summon Submarineroid in Attack mode!\"\u00a0\u00a0\"And now, I'll activate his special effect! He can attack you directly!\" With that her monster dove into the ground. A upheaved trail of dirt traveled his way, knocking another 800 points of damage off. \"Then, thanks to his special ability, he is switched into defense mode!\"\u00a0\u00a0\"I end my turn with two face downs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylene: 4000 Adam: 1200<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam chuckled and said, before he drew, \"Alright, time to change it up, my draw.\" Adam looked at the card and smiled. \"I summon Alexandrite Dragon in Attack mode. *2000/100* But I'm not done yet, I play a spell card, Dragonic Tactics. By tributing two dragon monsters on the field, I can special summon one powerful dragon from my deck.\" Both Axe Dragonute and Alexandrite disevaperated and their dust took the form a dragon, and then Adam smiled again and spoke, \"I special summon the Blue Eyes White Dragon!\" *3000/2500*<br>\r\nThe great white dragon gave a mighty roar and Adam smiled turned to grin and added, \"Now I play my other face down spell, known as Forbidden Lance and put it on my Blue-Eyes White Dragon, it might cost him 800 attack points, but he is immune to Spell and Traps for the rest of the turn, now Blue-Eyes, attack the Submarineroid with Forbidden White Lighting.\" After Submarineroid was destroyed, Adam placed two more face downs and ended his turn, wanting to see how Sylene could beat his Blue-Eyes White Dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylene lost a bit of confidence, but she drew and looked at them. \"Before I do anything, you activated my face down card, Supercharge! This allows me to draw two cards.\" She drew them both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I place another card in face down defense, then activate the spell card Double Summon!\" She looked at her hand. \"This spell allows me to normal summon another monster this turn. And I choose, one of my favorites, Gyroid in Attack Mode!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe summoned her helicopter.\u00a0\u00a0Sylene looked shocked at her monster. Instead of the normal design, this Gyroid had scorch marks on it's body and a few dings in it. It's rotor spun in anger as it stared up at the dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...I end my turn with a face down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam thought, \"I need to get her confidence up or else she may not duel again.\" Adam then spoke, \"My Draw.\" Adam drew his card and said, \"I play Trade-In, so I ditch my Darkstorm Dragon to draw two cards and I end my turn with a face down.\" Adam saw the Gyroid's body and he felt something with this card as he glared at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylene looked surprised, \"Wait, why didn't you attack?\" Gyroid's rotor spun, looking back at her. She nodded and understood, \"Okay Adam, I'll go offensive then! I draw!\" She looks at her hand. \"Now it's time for me to show you another card given to me, I summon a girl with firepower, its Elemental Hero Burstinatrix!\" The heroine came out in her blaze of glory. *ATK 1200* Adam was shocked to see that specific card and backstepped. \"An Elemental Hero card? Those cards are really old, Sylene,\u00a0But now, Let's see what you are planning Sylene, it is still your turn.\" Adam shocked turned into a smile. \"A friend gave her to me. I have a bunch of powerful female monsters in my deck, but I managed to balance them inside. And since you won't attack, I might as well show you what my face down is. Come on up Sonic Jammer!\" *DEF: 650*  The card was revealed, and a small cricket-like machine appeared.\u00a0\u00a0\"Now, Sonic Jammer's flip effect activates! And thanks to this effect, that mean you cannot activate any Spell cards until the end phase of the next turn!\" The monster's wings vibrated, and cascaded a shrill sound onto Adam. \"But Sonic Jammer isn't sticking for long, because I'm sacrificing him to summon, UFOroid in Attack mode!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic Jammer burst into energy, and out from the center formed UFOroid. *ATK 1200*\u00a0\u00a0Sylene smiled, \"And now...Gyroid...time to get a power boost.\" However before she could activate the card, the monster shook his head. She was surprised, but confused. The gleam in his eye showed that he wanted to take that dragon down all by himself. She smiled, \"Alright then, time to change tactics! I activate my face down, Call of the Haunted!\" The card revealed itself, \"And with it I can summon a monster from my Graveyard, so say hello again to Des Koala!\" *DEF: 1800* As the smoke cleared, the cuddly koala appeared.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm not done! I'm activating the Equip Spell, United We Stand! And I'll equip it onto Gyroid!\" Soon, the helicopter started to glow. \"Now, Gyroid gains 800 attack and defense points for every monster I have on the field, and since I have three, that gives him 2400 points!\" Gyroid *ATK 3400* spun his rotor as his Attack increased.\u00a0\u00a0\"Now Gyroid, attack Blue Eyes White Dragon!\" Rotor spinning fast, Gyroid lifted off of the ground and charged towards the dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry to end an amazing turn, I play a trap called Draining Shield. Now, Instead of your Gyroid hitting my dragon, It hits my shield, giving me Life points equal to your monsters attack points. The shield cut off Gyroid from Blue-Eyes White Dragon and Adam's life points go up from 1200 to 4600. \"That was a great move, Sylene, It seems you took my advice.\" Adam was really happy now that she studied her deck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlyene: 4000 Adam: 4600<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGyroid came back, looking a bit angrier than ever. Sylene sighed, \"I...I lay a face down and end my turn.\" She placed it down. Now she had only two cards in her hand, and four monsters out. Three in Attack mode, and one in Defense mode. Gyroid's power up was good, but the other three could be better. Sylene looked to her monster, \"Sorry Gyroid, I failed you again...\" Gyroid looked back, looking concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTO BE CONTINUED.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He still believes in you, just like you should believe in yourself and your deck.\" Adam then took a breath and added, \"It's my turn, I draw. I summon Golem Dragon in Defense Mode *200/2000*, now you can only attack Golem Dragon since I control one other dragon.\" Adam was thinking very hard, he had one card where he could just make it hard for a comeback, but he thought it would shatter her confidence, and said, \"I place one card face down and Now, Blue-Eyes, attack Des Koala with White Lighting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylene looked hesitant, but she performed. \"I activate my face down, Switch!\" Her card revealed itself. \"This allows me to switch the attack target of your monster's attack, and I choose UFOroid!\" The attack hit UFOroid, making her Life Points drop to 2200. \"This activates UFOroid's special ability, which allows me to summon a Machine-type Monster with les than 1500 ATK points! And guess who's making a reappearance? Submarineroid!\" The Monster appeared, armed and ready.\u00a0\u00a0\"And now, my Trap Card activates, Supercharge! Which allows me to draw two more cards.\" She smiled at what they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam: 4600 Sylene: 2200<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam remained silent to see what she was planning and had a big smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, its my turn!\" She drew her next card and smiled. \"Okay, I'll activate the spell card Vehicroid Connection Zone! Which now, I can fuse monsters in my hand or on the field. So I'm fusing Submarineroid, along with Drillroid and Steamroid that's in my hand, and so to create Super Vehicroid Jumbo Drill!\" Her monsters appeared but disappeared, and soon the massive vehicle appeared.\u00a0\u00a0\"The best part about this monster is that when it attacks a monster that's in Defense mode, then the difference is dealt to you as damage. Go Jumbo Drill! Attack Golem Dragon!\" Her monster buried itself in the ground and charged towards his monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam didn't activate any of his facedowns and his life points dropped to 3200. Adam was smiling that she brought out a fusion monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylene smiled, pumped up with new confidence, \"Now, I think its time for round two! Gyroid, attack Blue Eyes White Dragon!\" Gyroid lifted off and charged straight towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it is my turn to counter, I play a spell card, Forbidden Chalice, here is how it works, The monster it equips to gains 400 attack points but loses it's effect, so I'll give the cup to my Blue-Eyes, making our attacks even ground, and I wouldn't say goodbye to Blue-Eyes yet, cause I play the other face down, Impenetrable Attack, now my Blue-Eyes can't be destroyed this battle phase. The Blue-Eyes growled as his tail crashed into Gyroid, but neither moved or shattered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate Gyroid's ability! Once per turn, Gyroid becomes invincible in battle! So he's not going anywhere!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGyroid landed back in his spot. \"I switch Burstinatrix into Defense mode and lay down one face down. I end...\" she now had three face down cards, and one card in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam: 3200 Sylene: 2600<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam smiled and drew his next card, \"My draw.\" Adam looked at his four card hand and said, \"I play a spell card known as Foolish Burial, now I get to place one card from my deck to the grave, which shall be another Blue-Eyes White Dragon. And I'll summon my favorite little dragon, Decoy Dragon in defense mode. DEF: 200 Now I reveal my face down, Raregold Armor, and equip it to my Decoy Dragon, now you can only attack him. And I'll lay one face down, to finish my turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYusei could tell Adam was toying with her, but he also knew that it was all for confidence building and that having his top monster out would give her a lot of confidence if she could destroy it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDecoy Dragon...I'm not familiar with the dragon cards, but I do know what a decoy is. Attacking with Jumbo Drill could be risky...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My turn\" she spoke as she drew her card. \"I first activate my face down, Ring of Life. By send a monster to the Graveyard, I can gain Life Points equal to that monsters Defense points. So I'm choosing DES Koala, so I gain 1800 Life Points.\" Her points raised to 4000. \"Unfortunately, because of United We Stand, Gyroid's Attack points drop by 800.\"\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGyroid looked back, but saw that she was only being cautious. \"Now I switch Burstinatrix into Attack mode, and she'll attack Decoy Dragon! Go!\" The heroine shot flames at the small dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam interrupted, \"Sorry to disappoint, but my dragon's effect activates. Now I get special summon a level 7 or higher Dragon from my grave, and he becomes your new attack target, so guess who is making an appearance, Rise! Blue-Eyes White Dragon in attack mode! A second Blue-Eyes White Dragon appeared next to the first and used his tail to deflect the fireball back at the female Hero, causing Sylene's life points to drop down to 2200.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam: 3600 Sylene: 2200<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(TO BE CONTINUED.

My draw.\" Adam drew his next card and frowned since he had three to her two. \"I just play a face down and end my turn.\" Adam then thought, \"I cant trust those face-downs, I better play it safe, at least Jumbo Drill can attack Decoy Dragon and she will have the lead in points.\" Adam had one card in his hand, waiting for it to be used.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylene was confused,\u00a0Why would he just lay a face down?

I won! I WON!\" She did a small cheer, happy as can be. However, Gyroid never disappeared. He looked to Adam with a small glare. But, he nodded, bowing a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYusei and Burno looked astonished, but Yusei had a smile on his face. Adam then put his cards back into his side pocket, and his duel disk on his back, and walked over to her and extended his hand, saying, \"That was a good duel, Sylene.\" Adam then had a grin on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylene shook hands with him, \"Thanks for dueling with me Adam. You are a good duelist, and I am sure that...\" She sneered at him, \"Wait, did you just let me win?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all,\" Adam began, \"my facedowns were bluffs and my card in the hand was missing the last piece of the puzzle. And let me show you the next card on my deck.\" Adam pulled out his deck and flipped over the top card, which was Polymerization, and Adam's hand card was the last Blue-Eyes White Dragon. \"If you didn't use De-Fusion, I would of taken the match.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylene looked surprised, \"Oh...\" She smiled, \"Well, I'm glad I did what I did.\" She shook his hand, \"May we duel again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It may be sooner than you think,\" Adam smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments of talking between both Adam and Sylene, Yusei and Bruno walked back into the garage, knowing Adam was going to take a while. Sylene had now a closer look at Adam's necklace, but still couldnt see the whole thing, but saw a blue eye. Adam kept his smile the whole time as they spoke about the duel and how she felt after she won.</span></div></div>",

It wasn't until later that Jack and Crow showed up as well as the twins. The whole gang was together, and everyone was getting used to the new face. Sylene never knew that she could make any friends, let alone friends with the famous Team 5D's. The whole team was equally balanced; Crow was the heart, Jack was the backbone, Bruno was the brains, Akiza was the willpower, the twins were the spirit, and Yusei was the soul. Everyone seemed to balance out each other's weak points.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the boys were working on something, Sylene was chatting with the twins and Akiza. \"You see\" she started, \"My deck may be a hand me down from my great grandparent, but I also picked up a few cards along the way. Some are actually almost as old as the Vehicroids. It took me till now to see that these cards are still cards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkiza smiled at that statement. She was happy to hear her friend was feeling better. The twins were looking through her deck. \"These cards are so cool!\" Leo commented, \"I never knew older cards could be so amazing! I only wish I was here to see them duel!\" He looked up to her, \"You have to duel me some time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled, \"Maybe later. I think I had enough excitement for one day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey!\" Leo ran over to his Duel Board and got his backpack. He opened it up and pulled a few cards out. He ran back over, \"I know you like your deck, but here.\" He placed the cards in her hand, \"I thought that you might like to try what we try.\" Sylene took the cards and looked over them. They were Tuner monsters, all of them. They were cute, at least to Sylene. And they were all Machine monsters too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, you can have one of mine too\" Akiza spoke as she gave a card to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped them. \"Please, I cannot take these. I hardly have any Synchro Monsters...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet.\" The small group turned to see Jack approach. Sylene's face lit up bright red as he did. Jack handed down two cards, \"Picked up a card from some scumbag, thought you might want to have it instead. And I threw in one of my Tuner monsters too.\" Her hands were shaking, but Sylene did manage to take them. She could not believe the kindness she was receiving. Tears were forming in the corner of her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" spoke Leo, \"Why are you crying? You aren't sad are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head, a smile forming. \"No...I'm happy...\" Sylene spoke with heavy tears, \"I never been treated with such kindness in my life...thank you.\" The others around her gave off an expression of proudness and content. \"I...I don't know how this day could get better...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the sound of an engine roared. This caught the attention of everyone away from the bike. Yusei, Bruno, Adam, and Crow each wore a smile, and Jack was smiling too. \"We have a good idea...\" Yusei spoke as he took the tarp off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was underneath caused Sylene's heart to race. It was her scooter, or what used to be her scooter. It was now a supped up speed machine. It still held its scooter-like structure, but it had parts more of a Duel Runner now. It shimmered with a glossy new coat of paint. Closer inspection saw that it was the same color scheme as Gyroid, her signature card. She shakingly approached the Runner with uneasy steps. \"Do you think she likes it?\" asked Luna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylene suddenly fell over; she fainted from the excitement. \"I believe she does\" Akiza spoke.</span></div></div>",

She spent the rest of the day learning the basics of her new Duel Runner. Since she was also a Fusion Monster user, Jack gave her some Speed Spells that would help her whenever she gets used to it. Yusei helped make a helmet for her so it would be easier on her. Everything was set and seemed right, but now all she needed was to get a Duel Runner License. The sun began to set and the city's lights began to glow. Sylene pulled her runner out. \"You sure you want to ride that tonight?\" asked Akiza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How else will I get home?\" she asked. \"But don't worry Akiza, Yusei said that my runner is exactly like my scooter, which means I already know how to run it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scooters don't go as fast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be fine Akiza, don't worry, I'll call you when I get home to prove it.\" She got on her runner and placed her helmet on. A rev of her engine she rode off from the garage and into town. Sylene was lying slightly; the speed was a bit overwhelming. But she got the hang of it after a few minutes. The feeling was wonderful; the adrenaline, the wind through her hair, it was wonderful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut all good things come to an end. Someone rammed into Sylene's runner, causing her to swerve and wobble. She quickly got back her bearings and looked back. Another Duel Runner, and a punkish one at that. The guy on the runner did not look to friendly though. \"Well well well, what do we have here? Nice Runner there girly\" he spoke in a heavy accent. \"Looks brand new, and that will make it even more expensive when I sell it!\" He tried to ram her again and again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylene quickly hit the intercom on her helmet. She tried to take each hit as the call went through. \"Hello?\" it was Yusei's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yusei! Please come help me!\" she shouted. \"Some lunatic is trying to ram my Runner! He wants to sell it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds a lot like Syd. Be careful Sylene, you don't want to mess with this guy.\" With that the feed was dropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSyd was now evenly paced with her in the streets. \"Hey girly, tell you what. How 'bout we Turbo Duel for the Runner? If I win, you give your sweet little Runner ta me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as she wanted to disagree, she knew the kind of person Syd was. He would not leave her alone if she backed down. A new confidence arose in her. \"Okay, but if I win, I get to pick some of the cards out of your deck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smirked, \"Oh, that won't be a problem girly. I accept your little wager, but I hope you won't live far away after I beat ya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach duelist touched their screen. \"Duel Mode Engaged. Auto Pilot standing by.\" Each Runner set itself up for the duel. Sylene watched as her new put together deck was shuffled. <i>Let's hope this deck is as good as I can make it. Otherwise me and my runner are done for.</i> \"Let's Duel!\" they both shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Sylene: 4000 Syd: 4000</b></span></div></div>",

Sylene got all of her cards out and looked through them. She did not have a bad hand, but she knew she would have to get her Speed Counters up to use Speed Fusion. Sylene got one, \"I summon Patroid in ATK mode!\" Her police car Vehicroid came out rolling on beside her. <b>Patroid ATK: 1200</b> \"I then lay two face downs and end my turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the turn end, each one gained a Speed Counter. Syd smirked again as he drew a card, \"Ya call that a monster? Please, I've seen children's drawings that were scarier! And probably more powerful too!\" He looked to his card and smirked, \"Like this guy for example. I summon Assault Wheel in ATK mode!\" <b>Assault Wheel: 2300</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylene gasped, \"T-T-Twenty three hundred Attack points?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, that's right girly, this is a REAL monster card. And now I will attack your little Patroid! Only thing is, my monster causes yours to switch to Defense!\" Patroid folded up in response. <b>Patroid DEF: 1200</b> \"But don't think your safe girly! Whenever Assault Wheel attacks a monster in DEF mode the difference in points is directed at you as damage!\" With the destruction of Patroid, Sylene's points were reduced by 1100. <b>Sylene: 2900</b> Also with that, her only speed counter was now lost. \"But some good news to ya Girly, my Assault Wheel's ATK points drop to 0 until the standy phase of my next turn. So I put a couple of face downs and call it a move.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylene grunted as she drew a card. It will be hard to take out that monster of his. Along with the two face downs he had, she was afraid of losing. But she could not lose, not when her friends gave her so much. \"Its my turn you scumbag! And because you destroyed a Vehicroid monster I can activate Supercharge! Which allows me to draw two more cards!\" She drew the amount. One of her cards was Gyroid, and again the card picture moved slightly. He looked like he wanted to tear that guy apart. She smiled, \"I think I'll star by activating my other face down, the Trap card Call of the Haunted!\" Her card flipped, an eerie mist poured out of it. \"This card allows me to summon a monster from my graveyard, and guess who's making a comeback? Patroid!\" The police car made a reappearance. \"And now I summon Gyroid in ATK mode!\" Her favorite monster came out flying high beside her. <b>Gyroid: 1000</b> \"Now Patroid attack Assault Wheel!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so fast! I activate my trap card! Plunder Decoy!\" The card flipped up, and immediately hands reached out. \"Now since you targeted a monster on my field, I can gain control of a monster on your field. Hehe, and it seems like there is only one card to take.\" Sylene gasped as the hands grabbed Gyroid. Gyroid fought but was dragged to his side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Patroid stop!\" The monster skidded to a halt whenever Gyroid appeared in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong girly? Afraid to attack your own monster?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but I can still attack your Assault Wheel!\" Patroid sped up one more time. \"I don't think so, I have another trap! I activate Nightmare Wheel!\" A sinister looking wheel fell from above and landed hard onto Patroid. He stopped moving and came back to a halt. \"Thanks to this card, your monster cannot change battle modes or attack. But the best part is by each of my standby phases you get 500 points of damage dealt to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylene looked infuriated, \"First you steal my favorite card, and now this! Oh, you will pay for this Crome Dome!\" She threw down three cards face down, \"You're move you jerk!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally...\" he drew a card, \"Oh, and now since its my Standby Phase, Nightmare Wheel activates and you get 500 points of damage!\" <b>Sylene: 2400</b> \"Oh, and guess who's getting their ATK points back?\" Assault Wheel's points go up back to 2300. \"But that's not all that I am doing, I summon the Tuner Monster Cannon Wheel!\" <b>Cannon Wheel ATK: 500</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylene looked devastated, \"Don't tell me you will...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right girly, I'm going to modify my Assault Wheel!\" Sylene could say she was a bit relieved that Gyroid was not who he was going to use, but still she would be in trouble. She watched as the two monsters disappeared and in a flash a new monster appeared. \"I Synchro Summon Combat Wheel!\" The hideous monster appeared before them. <b>Combat Wheel: 2500</b> \"Now you're probably wondering why I didn't take your lousy monster to use eh? Well, I think it would be very ironic to be destroyed by your own monster! But first, Cannon Wheel's effect activates, and since it was a part of a successful Synchro Summoning, you get 500 points of damage!\" <b>Sylene: 1900</b> \"And now Combat Wheel will destroy your pathetic monster!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so Syd!\" she shouted \"I activate Magic Cylinder! This turns all of the ATK points of your monster on you instead!\" Syd grunted as his points dropped by Combat Wheel. <b>Syd: 1500</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er...I place a card face down. You're move.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you...\" She drew a card, and was shocked at what it was. It was Sinister Sprocket, the monster Jack gave her. She smiled, \"I summon Sinister Sprocket!\" The Tuner Monster came out right beside her. <b>Sinister Sprocket ATK: 400</b> \"And now I'll activate the Speed Spell Summon Speeder!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you don't have enough Speed Tokens!\" Syd looked at his monitor, and saw she indeed had four. \"What?! How did you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activated Slip Stream right before I activated Magic Cylinder. Whenever I have lesser Speed Counters than you, I can use this to gain the same amount. And since I have four, I am able to summon another monster from my hand! And I choose this guy, Truckroid!\" The Vehicroid monster came onto the field. <b>Truckroid ATK: 1000</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you planning with that?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll see, now Sinister Sprocket! Tune with Patroid and Truckroid!\" Nightmare Wheel was destroyed as both monsters rose into the air. Sinister Sprocket formed his chain around them, gaining all of their stars. \"I Synchro Summon, Mist Wurm!\" A massive worm monster came from the ground, spewing out clouds of purple. <b>Mist Wurm ATK: 2500</b> Sylene looked at the monster in awe, as well as Gyroid. \"And now I activate my Wurm's ability! Since he was successfully summoned out, I can choose up to three cards on your field and return them to your hand! But in this case, its also my hand! I'm getting rid of your face down, and your two monsters! Gyroid, time to come home!\" Mist Wurm spewed out his mist onto Syd's field. His face down and Combat Wheel came back to his hand, as Gyroid came back to her hand. He looked relieved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSyd, on the otherhand, was terrified beyond what he's ever been. \"You got to be kidding me! You were supposed to be a rookie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I'm not! Mist Wurm, attack him directly!\" Syd screamed as the monster dove onto him and crashed, turning all of his Life Points to 0. His runner stopped as he crashed. She came to a halt too as everything settled down. Sector Security came in on time, along with Yusei and Akiza. Sylene stepped off of her Runner before Akiza nearly tackled her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WE TOLD YOU NOT TO GET INVOLVED!\" she yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Akiza! I won!\" she made her settle down, \"I did fine, I won. And I performed my first Synchro Summoning! Thanks to the cards Jack and you guys gave me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYusei wore a smile, \"Good work Sylene. You just may be able to have others change their opinion after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut once again, the good feeling was ended as a police officer came. \"Mam, do you have the license to run this Due Runner?\" She gulped in fear, hoping she wasn't going to be set away. Yusei however talked to the man before he spoke again. \"Well, seeing as how you helped take down our escaped convict, I'll let you off with a warning for today. But make sure you get your license.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir!\" She ran towards Syd, \"Officers wait!\" They stopped and turned to face her. Sylene wore a smirk as she approached Syd, \"A deal's a deal...\" She took his deck and took a few cards out. \"I am sure these guys will be better off with me...take him away boys!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe officers did so with a nod. Sylene walked back to her friends to tell them about the duel. Syd looked back at Sylene as he was being carried off, \"I'll get ya Girly, if its the last thing I do...\"</span></div></div>",

It was her Gyroid Card, and the picture of him was moving. He looked worried. \"Gyroid\" she spoke, \"You don't have to worry. I can become a Turbo Duelist, and I won't forget about you guys.\" He cocked an eyebrow at her as he gestured the door. Sylene blushed, \"Wait, me, him? N-No no no...\" She turned from the door just as it opened. \"Gyroid, me and Adam are not a thing. B-Besides, I-I don't think he would go with someone like me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why wouldn't I?\" the voice surprised Sylene, causing her to turn suddenly. Adam walked in and stroked through her hair. \"You are just as beautiful, if not more than any other girl in New Domnino City.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylene blushed and smacked his hand away. \"C-Can we just prepare for my t-test please!\" She walked out of the door with Adam following behind smiling. He followed her out of the door. Sylene's runner was already at the Academy, which means all Sylene had to do is get a proper outfit. The two went to different stores around New Domino. Several stores had a selection, but not many of what Sylene was looking for. Adam even suggested some high ranking stores, but still, nothing really looked good on her. She sighed, \"Adam, can't I just duel in what I have?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sylene, not all duelists where what they do in public on a Turbo Duel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yusei, jack, Crow, Leo, Luna, almost every member in that World Grand Prix...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay\" Adam spoke up, \"But Akiza does not. And I can almost guarantee you that half of those members in the race don't wear those uniforms constantly. The thing is, you need some kind of outfit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylene snapped her fingers, \"Wait! That's it! I know who I can go to!\" She ran out of the store, leaving Adam slightly dumbfounded. He got up and followed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, the duo went to the civilian district of New Domino. Sylene and Adam were standing in Sylene's friend's room. \"I tell ya girl, its about time you get to me\" she spoke as pieces of fabric went flying. The room they were in was filled with the latest in fashion and clothes making technology. The girl approached Sylene with a measuring tape. She had dark skin, blue eyes, and shoulder length black hair. The outfit she was wearing looked like a modified version of the Duel Academy uniform, customized to be sleeveless. \"I have designed many clothes myself\" she spoke, \"But finally I can have a real challenge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for doing this on such short notice Crystal\" Sylene replied as she was measured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girl, you know I would do anything to help ya. Now don't you worry, I can get this thing done before your test is! Now just chat with ya boyfriend as I work my magic!\" She gave a wink to them before walking off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylene's face was red, \"H-He's not my boyfriend!\" As her friend left, the two chatted. \"So, any idea what I'm facing with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To get your Duel Runner License you need to do two things\" Adam explained. \"One, you need to complete the training course under a certain amount of time. If you do that, all you need to do is beat the Duelist that they put you against.\" He turned his head with a scowl, \"And beat him down to a pulp...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pardon me?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oh...\" He looked back surprised, \"Nothing...\" A hand was placed on his shoulder. Adam gave a sigh, \"The Duelist you'll need to beat is Officer Trudge. He's a Sector Security Officer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He thinks he's a father of mien or something. He neglects and counters every decision I have ever made. I don't like that man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Done!\" Sylene and Adam looked up to see Crystal holding a outfit, \"I am finished!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam was surprised, \"That...was fast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylene got up to change into the outfit her friend made. Crystal was trying to get Adam's measurements, asking for him to take some of his clothes off. But Adama disagreed. \"So?\" the two looked up, \"How do I look?\" Sylene's outfit was the same material as any other Duel Runner outfit. The style she wore was different. The outfit cut off the upper sleeves, but then she had sleeves from the lowest part of her upper arm. The sides of her stomach were shown, as well a bit of her chest. The colors she wore were black, silver, and a dark blue. The three colors collided nicely. Adam's eyes were wide. \"Wow...\" is all he spoke. She blushed as her friend walked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dang girl! You look good!\" she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylene gave her a hug, \"Thanks Crystal, I'll pay you back somehow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrystal returned the hug but then looked into her eyes, \"Sylene, you do not have to do anything, but whoop that test and get that license!\" She stopped, \"Oh, and before I forget.\" She gave her a card, \"Take this, for some help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylene grasped the card with a smile, \"Thank you.\" She walked off with Adam to get her test done.</span></div></div>",

She along with several other students were there to receive their Duel Runner Licenses as well. However, when she rolled hers up, the others started to laugh. \"Seriously?! Who let her into this thing?\" one spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Turbo Duels are way out of your league, so why don't you just go home?\" another shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's...so hot.\" Everyone looked to that student, including Sylene. She quickly walked over with her Runner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was at the end, so she had plenty of time to get ready. Sylene watched as the others went on their tests. Some went to slow as others went to fast and crashed badly. She gulped, <i>Oh man...all I did on my first duel was just go in a straight line...if these guys can't do it, how can I?</i> She heard a small whirl, and looked to where she held her deck. She took it out, and once again the card that stuck out was Gyroid. He nodded to her, showing his trust. She smiled, <i>If my cards believe in me, then I can do it</i>. She held the card that Crystal gave her. <i>And now to add someone new.</i> She slipped the card into her deck and took another card out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally!\" the instructor spoke. \"We have one that qualifies!\" Sylene looked out, it seemed to be a male student. She couldn't see much else of him though. Out of the three others, only two qualified. It was her turn now, \"Alright missy, let's see if you got what it takes!\" She got on her runner and put her helmet on. \"Go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment he said that she revved the engine and sped off. She was slightly amazed by the rush. The wind through her hair, the speed of her runner. She never felt that in the duel against Syd. She was almost too amazed, but she snapped out of it. She took the first turn, the side of her runner sparked against the ground. But she made it through without crashing. She continued along the course, maintaining speed. She sped through the course and crossed once she started. \"You were a little slow on those turns missy!\" she heard the instructor through her helmet intercom, \"But you made it up in those quick bursts in the straightaways! You qualifiy! Barely...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylene raised her hands, \"Yes! I-WHOA!\" She forgot to grab on and she crashed into the barriers. She got up, \"Ooh...I'm okay.\"</span></div></div>",

Yusei made some slight modifications to her runner to make it run more smoothly. She readied her deck, adding a few cards and learning new things. She practice dueled with her friends to get into the hang of things. She lost against the others, but she did hold out pretty good. That built her confidence up; if she could hold out long enough with some of the best Turbo Duelists in New Domino City, then she could easily pass the test. And Adam, he has been beside her the entire time. She was often curious on his friendship at times, but it seemed very official now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other runners went before her. Officer Trudge, just like Adam said, was the one to beat. Half of the students could barely make it in one draw. It seemed they only focused on the course for the first part, not experiencing to duel just the same. The only one that passed was the same who passed with flying colors before. He winked at Sylene as he went by. His handsome face was hard to not stare at, giving a flush of red to her cheeks. \"Sylene Truesdale\" he spoke out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe became focused again and rolled her runner up, \"H-Here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOfficer Trudge gave a smirk, \"Well, that's some getup you got. But Turbo Duel's aren't all about looks, you have to duel good too. And seeing how I saw you with Adam earlier doesn't impress me much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave a scowl, knowing the experience she had with him earlier. She and Adam were just talking before the test, and the kind officer just had to talk with him. Adam was right, he did act like a father. But he was definitely not his father. Sylene smirked, \"I'll keep that in mind Officer Trudge, I'll also keep in mind on the many times you lost in Turbo Duels against...what did you call him? \"Satellite Scum?\"\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrudge frowned, remembering about Yusei. The embarrassment. \"You know what Truesdale, you just earned my attention. Now let's see if you got what it takes.\" He climbed onto his runner before putting his helmet on. As Sylene did it, she heard a few cheers from the stands. Her friends were there, and the one cheering was Crystal. She waved before putting her helmet on. The two lined up at the starting line, engines revving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>If I can just take the first turn, then I can have the first move. And I need that first move if I am going to win.</i> As the green light lit up, Sylene's runner revved loudly. She started off much faster than Trudge. Even she was surprised by the jolt of speed. However, thanks to it, she had the first move. \"It's my draw Trudge, so you better hope I draw a dud!\" She looked at her hand, a decent start. <i>I don't know what strategy Trudge has for me...but I better play it safe. Good luck out there buddy...</i> \"I summon Cycroid in ATK mode!\" Sylene summons the littlest Vehicroid she had. The little bike looked cute pedaling beside her. <b>Cycroid ATK: 800</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrudge huffed with humor, \"You call that a monster?! I never knew you could ride a bike without training wheels!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylene grunted a bit, and even Cycroid made a seemingly angry chime on his bell. \"I end my turn with a face down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrudge cracked a smile, \"My draw!\" Both of their speed counters increased to one. \"I summon Gate Blocker in Defense mode!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the stands, Yusei looked worried. \"This is what I was afraid of...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the duel, the newly summoned monster appeared in front of Sylene. Gate Blocker <b>DEF: 2000</b> She panicked and swerved a bit before getting back into things. \"Hey!\" she shouted, \"I thought you summoned him! Why is he on my field?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's still my monster, but gate Blocker has a very handy ability\" Trudge replied. \"You see, when Gate Blocker is face up on the field, you cannot gain any Speed Counters during your standby phases.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylene was shocked, \"Wait, what?!\" Trudge placed two cards down before ending his turn. Sylene looked at her screen; like he said, she was still stuck at 1 as his counters were up at 2. She needed to defeat that monster before anything bad happens. She drew her next card, and she was exuberant on what it was. \"Sorry Trudge, you're monster may be tricky, but its not going to stop me! I summon Drillroid in ATK mode!\" The monster came from underground, and looked ready for battle. <b>Drillroid ATK: 1600</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's a monster like that going to do?\" he asked with a sly expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, except whenever Drillroid attacks a monster in Defense mode, the monster is automatically destroyed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...what did you just say?\" Drillroid charged at Gate Blocker. He smashed straight through it, but Sylene suffered the difference in damage. <b>Sylene: 3600 LP</b> \"Ha! That was foolish of you to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe...\" she responded, \"But now I can gain Speed Counters, and now a little buddy of mine will attack you directly! Go Cycroid!\" The bike turned before pedaling hard towards Trudge, handlebars held high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Sylene, but you're not getting off the hook that easily. I activate my Broken Blocker Trap Card!\" Trudge smirked as his card was flipped. \"This allows me ti bring out two for the price of one, and now two Gate Blockers join the field!\" Two of those monsters appeared, but one flew in front of Cycroid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cycroid stop!\" The little bike hit the brakes hard as he came to a halt. Both of them sighed in relief. The Gate Blocker went back in front of Sylene. \"I end my turn with another face down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe duel was getting upstarted, but sadly Sylene was getting nowhere. Trudge now had three Speed Counters, and she only has one. Trudge drew his card, \"As much as you love my Gate Blockers, I'm getting rid of one of them to summon Handcuffs Dragon to the field!\" A blocker flew past her, and disappeared in a flash. However, his new monster appeared from the same one. It roared as it spread his wings. <b>Handcuffs Dragon ATK: 1800</b> \"And now, Handcuffs Dragon attack Drillroid!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylene was surprised as his monster too command. With a two pronged clutch, Drillroid was squeezed into pieces. <b>Sylene: 3200 LP</b> \"Why attack Drillroid when Cycroid has less ATK points?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't try that on me missy\" Trudge replied. \"If that overgrown drill of yours was still around, he could take out Gate Blocker and you would be home free. But I am not letting you escape that easily. And I mixed all of the decks I have every used, just for this soul purpose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylene gulped in fear. <i>Oh no...if I don't find a way past Gate Blocker now, I'll never get my license!</i></span></div></div>",

Things looked grim, but she believed in her cards. \"Trudge, since you destroyed a Vehicroid monster I can activate my Supercharge Trap Card! Which allows me to draw two cards!\" She drew those cards from her deck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get all the cards you want, nothing can help you now\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see...\" She drew her next card. She gasped at what it was. It was not Crystal's card, but another friend of hers. She completely forgot about this card. \"I summon Amazon Swords Woman in ATK mode!\" The monster she summon posed dramatically with her mighty weapon held high. <b>Amazon Swords Woman ATK: 1500</b> \"And now Amazon Swords Woman, attack Gate Blocker!\" The female warrior grasped her sword and jumped to ready her attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The exhaust from your runner must be affecting your brain Truesdale!\" shouted Trudge. \"That Amazon has 1500 ATK points! There is no way she can destroy my Gate Blocker!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not trying to destroy your monster!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then...what are you attacking for?\" he asked with confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll see...\" Amazon Swords Woman came down onto Gate Blocker, but her sword bounced off and out of her grasp. But then the sword came crashing down in front of Trudge. He dodged it, but his life points still took a hit. <b>Trudge: 3500 LP</b> \"You see when Amazon Swords Woman is in a battle, any Battle Damage that is dealt is dealt to my opponent, and that one is you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smirked, \"Very clever girl, I have to hand it to you your tricky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I set two more cards face down. Its your turn Trudge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrudge drew his next card. His speed counter raised to four. He smirked, \"Oh Sylene...I think you'll enjoy what I'm going to do next.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Are you going to give up?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrudge put three cards into his graveyard, \"Sorry, but I am not. By sending three monsters to the Graveyard, I can special summon Montage Dragon to the field!\" Three beams of light shot out, colliding into one before his monster was unleashed. It roared at her, making Sylene very nervous. \"And, since the combined levels of the monsters I sent to the Graveyard was 9, Montage Dragon has a heaping 3000 ATK points!\" <b>Montage Dragon ATK: 3000</b> \"Get ready Sylene, because you do not want to miss the destruction of your monsters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me Trudge...you'll regret attacking me.\" Her voice seemed dull, almost like she's given up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see, Montage Dragon, destroy that stupid bicycle with Power Collage!\" His dragon took aim at Cycroid. The little bike grew nervous, very nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so fast Trudge! I activate my face down! Shift!\" As the card activated, she looked to Swords Woman. The Amazon nodded, understanding what was going to happen. \"I can switch the attack target of your monster, and I choose your dragon to destroy Amazon Swords Woman!\" Montage Dragon blasted his attack at her. She was destroyed, but her sword flew up once more. \"And because of her special ability, the Battle Damage I would have taken becomes yours!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrudge was slammed by the sword once more, getting the full effect of the monster. <b>Trudge: 2000 LP</b> \"I don't know why you're so protective of that little monster of yours, but there is nothing you can do now to win this duel. But now Handcuffs Dragon, attack Cycroid now!\" His dragon flew in to clash with Cycroid. Sadly, Sylene did not have any cards. \"I'm sorry...\" she spoke to him before he was destroyed. <b>Sylene: 2200 LP</b> \"Look at you\" he spoke with a smile, \"Two face downs, no monsters, and only 2200 Life Points left. Next turn, you're finished.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But not yet!\" This caught Trudge by surprise as a face down card was flipped. He was even more surprised by what it was. It was Slipstream, and he was all too familiar with its effects. \"Now thanks to my Trap Card, I gain Speed Counters equal to yours!\" Her counters increased to 4. Her runner sped up down the track. She turned the course before drawing. \"And now that I have four Speed Counters, I can now activate the Speed Fusion Speed Spell!\" Energy began to swirl around her. \"This allows me to summon a fusion monster, and I have a special monster for your Trudge!\" She looked to her hand, seeing Gyroid. he nodded in approval. \"I'm going to fuse Gyroid, and Steamroid that's in my hand and summon, the ultimate engine, Steam Gyroid!\" Her fusion monster came out, blades whirling. <b>Steam Gyroid ATK: 2200</b> \"But I am not finished, I now summon Mecha-Dog Marron!\" A toy-looking robotic dog joined the field. Immediately she heard her friend Crystal's cheer. <b>Mecha-Dog Marron ATK: 1000</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is that card going to help you?\" asked Trudge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll show you! Mecha-Dog Marron! Attack Handcuffs Dragon!\" The little dog turned, rolling at Trudge's dragon barking angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I definitely know the exhaust if affecting your brain. You're sending that monster to its doom!\" Handcuffs Dragon smashed Marron in one swift blow. <b>Sylene: 1400 LP</b> \"And now you're even closer to defeat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Mecha-Dog Marron's effect activates!\" Sylene shouted, earning Trudge's attention. \"Since he was destroyed by battle and sent to the graveyard, now both of us take 1000 points of damage!\" Both duelists grunted as they were each hit with energy surges. <b>Sylene: 400 LP Trudge: 1000 LP</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may have dwindled my Life Points, but your Life Points took a hit too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And its all according to plan. Now Steam Gyroid, attack Handcuffs Dragon! Train Twister!\" Her fusion monster became hidden within a swirling column of wind. The two collided, Trudge's dragon now destroyed. <b>Trudge: 600 LP</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not good enough Sylene...\" he spoke. \"Because you destroyed my monster, you now activate my Handcuffs Dragon's ability!\" In a flash, the monster returned. But now, it latched onto Steam Gyroid. Her monster tried to fight against its grip. <b>Steam Gyroid ATK: 400</b>  \"Now you're monster is finished!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylene cracked a smile, \"Trudge, I came this far, but I am not going down. I reveal my face down, Equip Shock!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!\" he shouted as it revealed. The card glowed onto her fusion monster, freeing it from Handcuffs Dragon. However, his monster now went to his side. It grabbed Montage Dragon, binding it tightly. It roared in all directions as it tried to break free. <b>Montage Dragon ATK: 1200</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And...you know the rest of the effect of this trap. Steam Gyroid chuckled as he looked onto Montage Dragon. <b>Steam Gyroid ATK: 2200</b> \"Steam Gyroid, finish this!\" her fusion charged, engines revved and propellers spinning. He slammed straight into Montage Dragon, destroying it. Trudge's points dropped to 0, his Duel Runner stopped. Slyene drove off in a victory lap, her friends cheering. Trudge took his helmet off, looking out to her. He smiled at her enthusiasm. <i>I hate to admit it, but she did impress me with that deck of hers. Not a single Synchro Monster either.</i> Sylene stopped when she passed him once more. She got off her runner, took her helmet off, and shook her hair free. \"Congratulations Sylene, you have earned your Duel Runner License.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bowed, \"Thank you Officer Trudge. Now...if you would excuse me...I feel...kind of...\" She suddenly fell over. She seemed very exhausted. Trudge helped her over.</span></div></div>",

She pulled out Gyroid, Swords Woman, and Mecha-Dog Marron. \"Thanks to you three, I won my license. You will always have a special place in my deck.\" Gyroid winked at her, and the other monsters seemed to move as well. Sylene was shocked by this, too shocked to see someone enter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's the new Duel Runner rider!\" Sylene was hugged by Akiza. The two girls shared a giggle as Adam walked over. They all got settled on his couch as the meal was in the oven. Akiza looked at the two cards, \"I never knew that you had these cards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said before that some of my other friends gave me some of their cards to try and get me into something else\" she replied. \"Amazon Swords Woman was given to me by Bremusa.\" Akiza held back a laugh, completely aware of the name. Adam was still lost. \"Uh...who is this Bremusa?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bremusa is probably one of the biggest students in Duel Academy\" Akiza answered. \"She uses an Amazon Deck, plus she looks like she would belong on one of the cards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyebrow raised, \"She's really that big?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylene giggled, \"Well, if I remember correctly, the highest level Amazon is Amazon Queen. Bremusa would be bigger than her, by a long shot.\" Adam's face could be read with shock. But Sylene continued to pull some cards out. \"I got a bunch of cards from my friends.\" She was confused as there was an extra one. She gasped at it, \"WHAT?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" Adam asked as he went beside her. His face became the same level of shock as hers. It was Montage Dragon, the same card Trudge had. There was a small note on it. <i>I was told you like to collect cards from people you duel. Here's a small reminder of the challenges you overcame. Trudge.</i> \"I never knew Trudge had a heart...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was actually my doing\" Akiza spoke. \"I asked Trudge for that card so she could have it. Also before the duel, we made a wager.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would have happened if you lost?\" asked Sylene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, forget about that.\" Her friends gave her questionable looks. Akiza shrugged, \"I knew Sylene would win, she's my friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Last time I remembered, friends don't make bets on friends.\"</i> Sylene looked around, trying to find the new voice. \"Hello?\" she spoke out loud. Akiza and Adam looked to her. She kept looking around. <i>\"Wait...she can hear me now?\"</i> Sylene looked more, \"Okay, who's in here? Its not nice to try and pull pranks on someone...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkiza and Adam exchanged glances before they turned back. \"Sylene...no one else is in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then who-?\" Suddenly the image of Gyroid appeared in front of her. \"AH!\" She fell back, completely surprised.

She looked to Gyroid, \"Please tell me you guys don't hate me.

That just left Adam and Sylene. Adam gave her a smile, which caused her to blush and look down to her food. Gyroid's eyes rolled and his rotor spun slightly. He understood Sylene for a while, but sometimes he wished that she would just stop being so confined. Decoy Dragon could only laugh. \"What? Really?!\" The two humans, as well as the two Duel Spirits, looked over. \"That's great Yusei! I'll be right over!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up?\" asked Adam after swallowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure if you guys know, Yusei works as a researcher for New Domino research facility. He says he may have found a new power source even stronger than the Ener-D!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-?!\" Sylene had her mouth stuffed, she looked shocked. Gyroid huffed again as Adam and Decoy Dragon laughed. She wiped her mouth off, \"You're not joking are you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem excited\" Adam spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I always like new advances in technology. If the energy is more powerful than Ener-D, then New Domino could reach the next level in no time at all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam had to smile at her enthusiasm. It was nice to see her so upbeat rather than Miss Sad Sack that he knew a week ago. The trio of duelists soon set off to the research facility. Yusei met them at the entrance, dressed in a lab coat. Akiza complimented him on his looks before they went in. The facility was furthering the advances of every known thing; transportation, education, manual labor, and yes, dueling. Sylene stopped at the new Duel Runners, eyeing them with great desire. Adam had to drag her off just for them to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, they came to Yusei's station. They stopped and admired the work. The machine was a large pillar, glowing with this strange yellow energy. \"This is the containment unit\" Yusei explained. \"It collects and stores the energy. We discovered it while we were furthering the readings of Ener-D. It was almost like this thing is not from this world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam was tapped by his Duel Spirit, who looked behind him. Sylene was now shaking; not of excitement, but of fear. \"Sylene?\" he asked. \"You were excited before you came here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just realized...this stuff is more powerful...\" she gulped, \"So...w-what would happen if...if the Reactor blows?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not worry Sylene\" Yusei spoke. \"The containment unit does not contain that much energy at this point. Right now, we're going to hook the containment unit to a small generator, seeing how this energy handles.\" As he spoke, a couple of men brought in what looked likea common-sized generator, used for power failures at facilities such as hospitals. They began to hook the wires in, Yusei approached the control panel. He handed each of his friends a pair of goggles, slipping his on before activating the controls. The yellow energy from inside the unit could be seen flowing down through the tube and into the generator. The generator instantly sparked to life, glowing the same yellow as the pod. At first, things seemed fine. However, a buzzer went off on the control panel. Yusei looked down, \"oh no! The energy is overloading the generator! Everyone get back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men around it cleared as the generator buzzed. It exploded right next to the containment unit. No one was hurt, but that was the least of their worries. The generator was placed too close, and when it exploded, it damaged the containment unit. Another buzzer went off, bring even dire news to the young scientist. The unit began to crack, \"Everyone out of this room, now!\" The workers began to file out, but the four duelists were left. They just reached the door before the unit burst open. The yellow energy backfiring causes some of the energy to return to its origin, causing a small portal to form. The energy output was unstable, it began to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The portal began to swirl and suck, bringing anything and everything into it. The four friends held onto whatever was closest to them to prevent their escape. Yusei looked to the control pad, slowly trying to make his way over to it; making sure not to lose his grip. The force of the portal was getting stronger, pieces from the wall and ceiling began to get effected. <i>\"Hey!\"</i> Sylene heard Gyroid speak to her, <i>\"Heads up!\"</i> Sylene looked up, seeing a pipe from the air vents. It was on its last support, right overtop Yusei. It fell with a snap, the young duelist acted quickly. \"Yusei watch out!\" Truesdale managed to push Yusei out and prevent herself from getting crushed, but the force of the portal soon took her. She was flying straight into it, holding her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a while, she felt herself stop turning. Sylene opened her eyes, seeing Adam hanging onto the edge of her dress. He grunted as he held onto both her and the railing. \"Hang on!\" Yusei called out, \"I think I almost have it shut down.\" For a while, it was working; Sylene was not going anywhere. But, they soon began to hear the tear of fabric. Adam tried to get a better grip, but the more he moved the more her dress ripped. The gray-haired girl looked to him with sadness, \"Just let me go...you'll be sucked in too...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a risk I'm willing to take!\" Adam tried one last time to pull her in, but he lost his grip, and soon he went tumbling into the portal. Yusei slammed on the controls to kill the energy feed. His attempt was too late. Both duelists entered the portal just before it disappeared. Both Yusei and Akiza looked horrified at the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yusei...\" Akiza managed to say after what felt like a eternity of silence. \"Where...where did they go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I don't know\" he spoke. He looked at the control panel, barely made it through the energy feedback. \"They...the energy went back to where it came from. So...they...Sylene and Adam, they must have went with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...where is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do not know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two duelists groaned into consciousness in a dark alley. They sat up, rubbing their heads and other sore spots. Sylene cried a bit, \"Aw...my dress...my custom made dress...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam smiled, \"You'll fix it...\" However both her and his clothes were now damaged and torn. Their faces even have a few cuts. They would both need to get fixed up. He took the moment to look around, \"Did we just...get teleported?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light shining down on them gave the impression that it was daytime, but nothing else. The ground they were on did not feel or look like the same as Neo Domino City. The walls of the surrounding buildings also had a different material, and a different shape. Sylene took the first few steps to the end of the alley. She gasped as she went into the light, \"Adam...you need to see this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy duelist followed his friend out, but he too was shocked. The city they were in, it was no longer their own city. The buildings were higher, differently shaped, and more colorful. they could see a monorail system above them as well as a few blimps. A piece of loos fabric fell from Sylene's dress, floated in the wind, and landed on the sidewalk in front of them. They were both surprised as this blue and white pod-shaped robot came to it. \"TRASH IDENTIFIED.\" A hand reached out and took it, placing the fabric inside its body. It rolled off soon after. Sylene looked up to one of the blimps, reading what was on the panel. \"Welcome to...Heartland City?!\"</span></div></div>",
