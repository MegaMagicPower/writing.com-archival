You had just finished a particularly long game session of Disgaea, trying to grind a single character to have just the right stats and skills. You paid little attention when your mom called you down for dinner with your 9 year old sister Susie and your 16 year old sibling, Jake and Samantha (Sam for short).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough hungry and tired, you managed to persist until 10 pm, where you decided to go get late night snack to help you power through the rest of the evening. Quickly downing a glass of milk and taking a jar of peanuts, you looked forward to the rest of evening. However, as you reenter your room, you almost immediately collapse on you bed and pass out due to exhaustion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaking up the next day was a chore but, you were able to eventually open your eyes. However, something strage struck you. There was this huge transparent text box in front of you. You could only tell it was transparent since you could see your wall behind the text, it read:<br>\r\n[Your Life!:The Game:The Reality]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What the?' you groggily squeaked out as the text box disappeared only to be replaced by an all too familiar UI.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had your name listed with a couple of drop down menus titled [Jobs], [Skills], [Titles], [Stats] and [Relationships].<br>\r\nWith a tap from your finger the Stats menu opens up and it is huge. Though you were listed as level 1, There seemed to be a stat for everything, health and the usual stats were there but coupled some obscure ones: Physical Age and Mental Age, Masculinity and Femininity, etc. it was nuts!</span></div></div>",

Re-spec will re-roll all of your stats and relationships randomly however you will be given several prompts throughout your life and be given what choice you made previously at that time.

The person in this rapidly evolving scenario doesn't sound like you at all. The family is the same, but every concern they've had in their life feels different. Every relationship they've had is different, their interests are different. Your almost six feet tall, enjoy playing videogames, and occasionally work out. You can't imagine yourself as the person this 'Respec' character generation is describing. Your sense of horror slowly gives way to a more resigned shock. This thing can't really change anything, can it? This is starting to seem unreal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut despite the denial, you know its all too real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour click through to yet another scenario, watching as your younger self - or what this interface is claiming your 'new' younger self will be when the respec finishes - focuses more and more on figure skating, dancing, art, fashion and other traditionally feminine activities, even going by a girl's name. With horror, you realize he...she?...is even enrolled at school under a girl's name, and you wonder what your first girlfriend would have thought of that, let alone the guys you hang out with. Would they even be caught dead with you in this hypothetical new reality? You wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe newest scenerio has you doing more and more figure skating, first on a state level, then a national level. With mounting disbelief, as you continue to make choices and click through - you notice your younger self is competing in what appear to be, if your reading it properly - international events, albeit at the 'junior' level. Under the girl's division. How can that even be possible?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try and pull up the stats screen. Your current stat screen shows you as you are now; with some changes. Apparently some changes have slipped through, like the skill changes and some mental effects, but most mental and physical effects are pending the completion of the respec process. You think. Its hard to tell now; presumably because your former videogame skills have been deleted. With a few minutes of fiddling, you manage to get the 'new' status screen to pop up. And you just stare in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe image is of what appears to be a young girl, tiny and delicate, looking more like an elf or the most graceful and elegant of ballerinas then anything you ever remember looking like. She's wearing makeup, the sort that dancers and figure skaters and other women and girls wear for performances; but it seems to enhance the delicate, elven look rather then detract from it. <b>How can this be you?</b> No. No. No, nononononono.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn complete panic, you look over the physical stats. She...he...it...you...should have hit puberty by now. But she's significantly shorter then you were at that age. Much, much shorter. She doesn't have an adams apple, she lacks any shoulders or masculine bone structure. How can this  be possible? How?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, under 'medical history' you find it. Hormone Therapy- Age 11.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge 11. You never went through puberty as a guy. They stopped it. And that was already several years ago in the respec process. If you allow the respec process to continue as-is, your going to turn into some older version of this delicate, artsy, graceful creature. Could you be her? Could you somehow gain the chance to do another respec? And if so, how long could your willpower hold out against her life and the changes?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps...you reflect. Perhaps if you minimize the respec window...and just never finish the Respec, perhaps you can just ignore it indefinitely. Or perhaps it will time out. Some games do that. On the other hand, it might try and autofinish it for you. Its a risk either way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You've already had a taste of it as an 8 year and 12 year old, but now it was time to see what it mean for teenage you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit up from your bed and glance down at your pajamas. Instead of your normal t-shirt and boxers to bed, you're now wearing something that maybe your sister would have worn. The light weight, soft purple flannel felt great against your skin. You skin feels softer and even the sheets on your bed are softer too. Before you explore your room, you open up your stats to investigate yourself:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start off with the [Jobs] tag:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&gt;Jobs<br>\r\n-Crossplayer (active)<br>\r\n- Jobs Available:<br>\r\n-- Candy Striper - Obtain: Volunteer at a hospital<br>\r\n-- Host/Hostess - Obtain: Get a job at a restaurant<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two new jobs were different, but the Crossplayer wasn't a surprise. Given how much you dove into anime and the conventions, along with your increased feminity, it was liekkely to your main job for a while.

The Fencing was new, and you didn't experience the life event for that -but thinking about it now you recall asking to do something other than Gym at school and your parents approved of Fencing. You glane around your room to see your foil and know your uniform is in the closet. You are getting better at it and know Natalie loves to go to your matches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie as your girlfriend was still awesome. Thinking of her brought new memories of other dates and tenative exploring each other. You had started to coordinate your cosplay outfits too, though you always seemed to be in the more feminine of the outfits - not that either of you complained. You realized in this spec you liked being Natalie's girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull your pajama pants up to see the white panties you wore to bed, and a quick tug of those indicated you still were a boy. Standing up, you felt the shift in your gravity and you realized that you have breasts growing. They weren't very large, but they were growing. Given how big your mom and sister go, you could grow to that size (or not) - another memory of a doctor talking about the breath growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie loved them though, and enjoyed pushing you to wear more revealing tops as you got older. A walk to your closet showed you owned several low cut tops to highlight your growing attributes. There was even a mirror to check yourself out more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour image showed almost no boy. If you hadn't checked your panties, you wouldn't have thought you were still a boy. You hair is now just past your shoulders, brushed out and fluffy - much like your sisters. You have very noticeable curves, and a turn shows you have a tight tush too. You wonder if your body changed as a result of the increased femininity. You almost look like a girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erik, you better get ready,\" your mom called up. You stop your introspection and realize you need to get through the day. A screen pops up, letting you know you've gotten a quest to continue as you are or make some changes. If you go about your daily morning routine, you'll keep down this path. it doesn't say what type of changes, so you don't know if you what the outcome could be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You watched screens appear and disappear to confirm the increased femininity scores with each completed task. By the time you were done, you were dressed in a black skinny jeans that seemed to make your butt look bigger. You had to wear a pair of panties and the bra to support your growing breasts. You work a light blue t-shirt, one thick enough to hide your bra, and grabbed a jean jacket that only reached your stomach. You slipped on a pair of flats - you only owned one pair of tennis shoes it seemed - and headed down the stairs to start the rest of your day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning Erik,\" Samantha greets you with a hug. Whereas before you were taller than your sister at 14, you're now about the same height. \"Ready for today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, not quite sure what today is and follow your sister down to the kitchen.

You tried to remember how Susie played them and attempted to emulate her. You started with a two of the Barbies talking to each other about boys and makeup and how they were to meet up with a friend. It was pretty simplistic, but after about 10 minutes, you heard 'ding' go off in your mind. Checking, you found that you had leveled up a skill, 'Playing with Dolls' in the 'Child at Heart' Job class. 'That's weird.' you thought. However another window popped up titled TUTORIAL at the top:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Welcome to Your Life:the game:the reality! Noting your confusion. We decided to give you a couple of tips to better understand. Leveling up skills is super important! It affects everything! Leveling them up not only makes you better at the skill but it also gives you stat changes and goes to leveling up your job class. Your overall level is affected by the total of all your job class' levels plus one. Leveling up job classes also stat changes as well unique abilities. In order to level a job class to level one, you need to have the total level of all skills in that class to be 3. Of course, requirements to level the class further will a higher total level. If you want to boost your skill exp gain even more, equipping items associated with that class can boost you exp gain, just be careful of the other stat changes they cause. We'd tell you more, but we find it more interesting if you found that out for yourself. Have fun!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That was bizarre and who is this'we'?' You thought before taking a look at skills. Sure enough, 'Lifting weights' was at level one in the 'Workout Bro' class, as was 'Playing with Dolls', checking your stats you noticed some changes, your mental age was not listed at 13 and a half years old rather 14 years old and your femininity went from 4 to 5. 'Interesting', you didn't feel any different from before at the moment but what those stat changes did to you made you curious. 'Maybe, I could try equipping something to boost my skill exp until I level up my job class, just to see what happen.</span></div></div>",

Eventually a light bulb went off in your head, and you left your room. You looked around to make sure nobody was around when you went to the clothes hamper. It didn't take long to find what you needed, you found a shirt belonging to Susie. Grabbing it, you rushed back to your room with your heart beating. You look at the shirt you took, it is white and pink with a pink flower in the middle of it. You took a deep breath and equipped the shirt by putting it on. \"This is short, tight and embarrassing.\" Hopefully this worked, you didn't want to go through this for nothing. With nothing left to lose you went back to playing with the dolls. This time you got a little more into it, as you gave the barbies names and crafted more intricate stories for them. It went on for about 6 minutes before you heard that 'ding' again that signaled that you went up a  level.  \"I have to get it to 3 though,not 2\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was back to playing with the dolls, you were certain that leveling up the skills really did have an effect. You brought some of the plushes into the tale and weaved a complicated story. You did this for 5 minutes until you heard that sound again, when you looked though it you saw that instead of \"playing with dolls\"going to 3, you instead got to 1 in \"playing dress up\". Since you had at least 3 in skills that were part of the \"Child at Heart\"job class, you were sure to get a level in it. Sure enough you heard a loud 'ding' in your mind. This time you felt something strange in your mind, you could tell that something had changed at least a bit. A couple notifications appeared in front of you.It told you that you had gained a level in the \"Child at Heart\" job class. \"It looks like a got an ability as well\" you saw a new ability called 'Childish Connection'. You were curious about how these abilities would work so you examined the description. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChildish Connection: You understand and get along better with kids. Gain exp bonus when leveling skills while playing with children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strange\" you think, trying to make sense of all this. How much farther would it go. You decide to look at your stats to see what changed. Between the skills and the job change, it was clear your stats went up a bit more than last time. Your mental age went down from 13 and a half to 12 and a half. Femininity from 5 to 10, which didn't surprise you with all the girly things you were doing. This time your masculinity also went down from 90 to 87. \"I guess it's still to early to really feels the effects yet.\"  You knew that messing around with this stuff could have serious effects on you, but you were so curious. \"I really want to test out that new ability, maybe I should go visit Susie.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Since wearing my shirt made it more fun, then wearing an entire outfit should be even more fun!\" Susie than ran out of the room bringing in some clothes that seemed slightly bigger than Susie's, maybe Sam's when she was closer to Susie's age. She gave a simple pink dress, white panties, white stockings, black mary janes and small pink hair band. \"Hurry, hurry! get changed so we can play!\" She urged as she left you alone in her room to change. A little reluctantly, you put the outfit on, curiosity overpowering your shame. The shirt gave you a times two exp bonus for \"age appropriate female activities\" but this set gave you ten times the exp and plus five to femininity as long as you wore it. Susie giggled excitedly as she looked at you dressed in outfit before getting started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then spent the next two hours playing with Susie. First, you played with dolls you found you were having a lot fun playing, even happily giggling along with your sister as you dressed the dolls in cute outfits. Your 'Playing with Dolls' skill level was rising rapidly but you found it harder and harder to concentrate as you had fun playing with the dolls. Eventually you transitioned to a tea party with you, Susie and several dolls which also became a blast. Susie took the role as host while played the role as her well-behaved daughter, Miss Pennywinkle and Sir Doyle found the tea to be Delicious! Lastly, Susie managed to convince you to try on some more clothes, which slowly began a long process of finding poofier and cutesier clothes for you to wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the two of you decided to stop for the day. You got changed back into your old clothes and skipped back to your room. You finally remember to check your stats and skills after being so engrossed playing for so long. Checking you found:<br>\r\n'Playing with Dolls' had gotten to level 11<br>\r\n'Playing Dress Up' had gotten to level 14<br>\r\nand the newly unlocked 'Tea party' had gotten to level 6<br>\r\nJob class 'Child at Heart' got all the way to level 3 meaning you had unlocked another ability called 'Hyperactive Head-Start'-Once a day, never feel tired for an hour but feel doubly tired once finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Femininity skyrocketed from 10 to 30<br>\r\nYour Masculinity plummeted from 87 to 79<br>\r\nYour mental Age had gone from 12 and half to 7 years old which according to the prompt was the lowest it could go from leveling up 'Child at Heart' skills.<br>\r\nHowever, your dexterity did go up by 1<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't majorly concerned with stats anymore, just having fun thanks to your new mental age.</span></div></div>",

You definitely felt a lot more cheerful and hyperactive. The smile on your face never seemed to disappear and you kept getting distracted by things in your room. It seemed much more interesting to your new childish mind. Your thoughts turned to how smart you were now that you had the mind of a 7 year old. The knowledge was still in your head, but it was difficult to understand it anymore. Plus you struggled with concentrating and you didn't really feel like thinking hard anymore. You turned the tv on and when you tried to watch your old programs, they seemed to be so boring to you now. You kept changing the channel to find something to watch before you stopped on a children's cartoon. it seemed s engrossing to you now. \"This is amazing!\" Hours passed by while you were busy watching cartoons, they were much better than your old shows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you looked at your stats you saw that you had unlocked and gained level 4 in 'Watching cartoons'. It wasn't long before you had to go to bed, but something was still on your mind. You could tell how your new mental age affected you, but what about your increasing femininity. It was going to be harder to notice the differences so you focused hard on what you were doing. You noticed quickly that you kept girlishly skipping about and every once in a while a girly giggle escaped from your mouth. Looking around your room,you couldn't help but feel that it could be redecorated a little. The clothes you were wearing were okay, but you kinda missed the cute outfits like Susie had. \"It was so much funner doing stuff while wearing those clothes!\" You really missed playing with those dolls, you wished you had some of your own. Maybe  you could convince your mom or Sam to take you and Susie shopping. It would be tons of fun to spend time shopping with her, and she could help you get some great stuff. It was getting late so you started getting ready for bed, thinking of how much fun you had with your sister today, and what you two should do tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She'd said that if you felt still felt like hanging out with her she was going to invite some of her friends over to play with too!  Your currently stat reduced 7 year old mind couldn't wait!  But your thoughts off playing dress up and other games with your sister and her friends went on hold for a minute as your mother opened the door.  \"Erik, I need you to come down to the kitchen and get your chores finished before I can cook dinner.  You've had enough time to play around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chores?  But I don't wanna!\"  You said as you stopped your foot and crossed your arms in frustration.  Normally you would have just shugged and reluctantly done your chores as quickly as you could, but your current mind was in no mood for anything but playing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now listen hear young man, when we agreed that you were allowed to have an allowance you agreed that you would do all of your chores without complaints.  Now you get a move on or not only will you not get any allowance this week you'll be grounded.  Understand!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou almost wanted to cry.  No allowance?  But that would mean you couldn't by new toys and dolls to play with!  You couldn't have that, and you wanted your mom to think of you as a big boy.  So you hold back the tears you almost cried and went to the kitchen with your mom.  As you walked you were brought back to (your RPG related) Earth with a loud <i>Ding</i>.  You looked up and saw that you'd gotten a skill point in \"Listen to your mother\" under the \"Obedient Child\" job class.  'Well, it won't be as neat as dress up, but I guess doing the chores won't be all stupid' you thought to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you got to the kitchen your mom told you, \"Go do the dishes from earlier while I start cooking.  And make sure to wear the rubber gloves as you scrub.\"  You put on the big yellow rubber gloves that were by the sink and felt something click.  It looks like the gloves were going to give you an xp boost.  Feeling kind of excited again at the idea of hearing the ding go off more you began to scrub.  Sure enough after a few minutes a <i>ding</i> went off in your mind and you accessed the tabs before you to see that a new job class and set of skills had opened up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJob Class:  Homemaker<br>\r\nSkill: Dishwashing- Level 1<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes lit up seeing that you weren't even a 1/4 through the dishes.  You might be able to get a new skill!  Now with a new found passion for cleaning you'd never had before you finished all of the dishes and sure enough as you put away the lash glass you heard the third <i>ding</i> and sure enough the dishwashing skill had leveled up to 3.  Looking at the skills menu you saw what you were looking for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJob Class: Homemaker Level 1:  New Ability Unlocked.  Without Asking 1- 20% XP bonus on household activities done without being asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcited at this new skill you also looked at your other stats.<br>\r\nYour Femininity had elevated from 30 to 32<br>\r\nYour Masculinity went from 79 to 78<br>\r\nYour mental Age had gone shot up to being close to your normal mental age going from 7 to 10<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that you'd finished your chores you could go back to your room and play video games or something.

Topics varied from  makeup tips to fashion styles. It was usual girly stuff that you tried so hard to avoid. After thinking about it you decided that you might as well give it a try and see what changes. You focused your sight on the screen and tried to take in as much information as you could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first it was getting rather boring. Women on the screen where showing different outfits and clothes that complimented one another. They also were describing how to match them together. You were close to falling asleep after 5 min of watching but then you heard a loud ding in your mind. You leveled a skill called \"Clothes matching\" in the \"Fashionista\" job class. Before you could think about it, a tutorial window appeared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leveling up skills is super important! It affects everything! Leveling them up not only makes you better at the skill but it also gives you stat changes and goes to leveling up your job class. Your overall level is affected by the total of all your job class levels plus one. Leveling up job classes also changes stats and provides unique abilities. In order to level a job class to level one, you need to have the total level of all skills in that class to be 3. Requirements to level the class further will require higher total skill levels. If you want to boost your skill exp gain even more, equipping items associated with that class can boost you exp gain, they also affect how fast your stats change and provide bonuses/lower certain stats.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen window closed and you were left processing given information. You saw that show moved on to makeup part. Right now women were giving tips on how to properly paint your nails. At this moment you finally spotted that Sam left her portable makeup kit on the table in front of you. Pink nail polish was one of the many items she had in there. You decided that since you already were watching tips on painting nails you might as well give it a try. You picked up the bottle, focused your attention on the show, and begun applying glossy pink nail polish on your fingernails. You made sure to follow every instruction given by the show. Before long the color of your fingernails matched that of the bottle. You didn't know what to think about it. You checked your equipment in game tab and saw that nail polish gave you 2x bonus to exp while doing activities associated with femininity stat. It also boosted your overall femininity by 3 which made your overall feminity to go from 4 to 7. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShow's host stated that after short commercial break they would focus on makeup tips for beginners. With that you wondered what do next.</span></div></div>",

By telling other people about this game you are able to try and recruit them into your party. If recruited, as long as they are near then you can see their stats. They too have full access to the menu and are part of the game, but only when with you. The benefits of party members are special abilities obtained by increasing your relationships with your party members. Party members also give you exp bonuses for skills and jobs related to them. Lastly they have unique abilities that support and affect you while they are in the party, the potency of these skills increase with your relationship with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was strange thinking of other people being involved in this weird game. It seemed like it could be really interesting and useful. On the other hand if you weren't careful it might backfire against you. \"I need to pick the right person.\" You really wanted to try this out and see how it worked. \"Who to pick though?\"</span></div></div>",

You had also learned spells that let you enter the top and entrance of the tower at will to avoid the traps. With that, you only had to decide what to do next.</span></div></div>",

I should remove my armor to cool down\" Another thought was placed into his head, while another heat wave hit him. He couldn't deny that he was really hot and needed to cool down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He first went to a shaded alleyway in order to cool down, but it didn't help much. He was still cooking in that armor of his. \"I need to get out of this armor.\" The boy was finding it hard to resist. Eventually he caved in and started stripping out of his armor. Metal fell to the floor as he took it off piece by piece. When it was all gone, he was embarrassed having forgot about how little he wore under his armor. He just had a somewhat long tunic and some underwear. \"I don't need my armor.\" With another thought whispered to him, the boy knew that putting back on the armor wasn't an option. Meanwhile You were watching and could barely contain your laughter. The magic was working and now the boy was no longer a knight but rather some half naked boy. You wondered if you should go further messing with the boy.</span></div></div>",

Heading to a local store, he meant to turn at the more normal looking clothing shop which sold pants and shirts at cheap price. But another thought came, \"I should wear nicer clothes from a fancier shop.\" the thought said. \"I'm a hero after all.\" it continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\", he thought. \"Maybe I should buy something better, I am risking my life after in this heat.\" he thought indignantly. He looked for a more expensive looking store when the thought came back, \"I should go here, this looks just fancy enough for me.\" When the boy looked at the store, it was clearly a dress store. The outfits clearly feminine and girly and not designed for combat. \"Why would I go in here, I'm a man!\" he thought in protest, trying to resist the thought's words. \"No, I'm the hero and I should shop here.\" His thoughts were mixed with confusion and embarrassment as he felt his own mind telling him to go in when he also believed he shouldn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was something you never really understood about human culture. Gender was a fluid concept in the demon world so it was never holistically as important but teasing humans about was one of the greatest forms of entertainment out there. Succubi and Incubi were known to sometimes play with their victims in such a fashion, forcing them to dress as the opposite sex to humiliate them as they craved their bodies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the boy entered the store, struggling against his own judgement. The selection was wide and fashion was Feminine as a thought came once again.</span></div></div>",

The boy blushed with embarrassment looking at all the girly dresses and clothes surrounding him. In the middle of looking around, the thoughts came again. \"I should get those, they are perfect for a hero like me.\" The boy got even more conflicted when he saw that his thoughts were pointing him to an area filled with Lolita clothing. Frilly dresses and all kinds of accessories surrounded them not a single one even remotely useful for combat. The boy blushed in embarrassment wondering why he would even think of wearing such girly clothing. \"I'm a man, and men don't wear frilly dresses!\" The boy thought again in protests. \"I am a hero and heroes deserve to treat themselves\" The thoughts told him shutting down his protest. The boy thought he did deserve some nice treatment as a reward for risking his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite his doubts and worries, the boy walked over to the section staring at all the girly clothing. \"That dress would look perfect on me\" The thoughts told him, and the boy went into shock as he looked at the dress before him. It was a frilly and lacy black and white  knee length dress. It had tons of petticoats giving it a wide skirt, while tons of little black bows went across the circumference of the skirt with white ribbons connecting them. The hem of the dress was multiple layers of white frills with each one a bit longer than the previous one. The dress had a white strip going down the middle of the top to the skirt with tiny black bows in it. A couple of white frills formed a large outline of a heart in the center of the dress. Finally there was a black ribbon bow at the collar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy couldn't believe that he was considering wearing the dress, it was the girliest thing that he had ever seen. \"I should get this dress, every hero should have something as pretty as this.\" The thoughts spoke up to quell his protests.The boy wanted to resist, but it was his own thoughts telling him to do it. The boy thought he might as well listen and what happened. The boy picked up the dress, feeling the incredibly soft fabric in his hands. He hoped that that was it, but the thoughts came again. \"I should get some accessories, a dress like this deserves some extras.\" The boy kept trying to protest in his mind, but the thoughts always seemed to win out. The boy picked up a pair of elbow length black gloves with white frills at the ends, and black stockings with white hearts on them. The process continued as he grabbed black mary janes with 2 inch heels and a frilly white headband. Finding himself holding a ton of incredibly girly clothing, the boy was becoming more confused than ever. \"Is this me? Have I always had this side of me? Why else would my thoughts be so determined to wear these?\" The boy wondered trying to make sense of why he was doing this. Finally he picked up a pair of black panties that were adorned with frills and bows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that done, the boy went to go pay for the clothes. He had an embarrassed look on his face while the female clerk giggled giving him a compliment on his great taste in fashion. A good bit of the money that the boy had was being eaten for his new clothes. The moment he had payed for them, the boy scuttled into the changing room to change into the outfit. When it finally all on him, the boy didn't know how to feel. \"I love how soft this dress is, a hero should always wear a pretty dress\" The thoughts told the boy. He had to admit that it was soft and in a sense comfortable although also constricting. \"I shouldn't wear this though, I can't fight in this!\" The boy tried another attempt to protest despite knowing it was near futile. \"A hero like me doesn't need to fight. Hero's just need to be pretty and beautiful.\" The thoughts threw back at him. Honestly, the boy didn't feel much like a hero at that moment. He felt more like a dainty doll.</span></div></div>",

First the lady helped fix his posture and the way he walked. She told him to saintly pick up his skirts whenever he walked. Next she focused on the way he spoke, first helping him speak in a softer,feminine, and more elegant sounding voice. Then she taught him a lot of new vocabulary and stopping him from using any crude language or slang. Finally was lessons about proper greetings with him learning things such as how to curtsey and what to say and when.

Normally she was dripping with lust, but now she was pretty low by her standards. She invited him to come with her for the night after he was done drinking, but she began doubting if she should. Later the mercernary put his hand on her ass, and the succubus reeled a bit at the touch. She didn't know why she was acting so strange.</span></div></div>",

'How is this even possible?' she panicked in her head. She needed sometime alone to think and calm down, so she snuck out the back door and headed back to her room at a local inn. Removing her disguise, she looked in the mirror to see nothing wrong, her body was not sickly looking, no deterioration or weakness in her appearance. Her tail still lively swaying, her horns undamaged and her breasts were still plump and sensitive. She took a deep breath as she tried to relax calling it quits for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't really surprised by how fast she had progressed, except for the running away part, A demon that can control people's lust was bound to have triggered the spell quite frequently in the beginning.

Corruption can affect area's that will twist and transform from what they original were with plant and wild life mutating into dangerous and aggressive creatures with toxic and poisonous plants sprouting out like weeds, snuffing the life out of the healthy plants nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n With Human it has a variety of afflictions all of which eat away at their will around demons, however corruption comes with a price when humans are influenced by too much, such afflictions include from mental instability to pure raving madness on those weak minded, others are more susceptible to demonic influence and possession with corrupted humans even going as far as to offer themselves as willing vessels to demons and other dark entities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n However it wasn't necessarily a bad thing as corruption did have it's benefits in both the appearance department, allure and spell power departments. Spell power is increased and altered depending on the level of corruption and original stats of the spell, for example a simple arcane bolt will pack twice the power from a high level corrupted mage then on a normal one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Plus an enchanting allure radiates off of those with an acceptable amount of corruption, prime examples being dark witches and succubus who use this ability to enchant unsuspecting and defenceless men, add by the change in appearance with enhanced benefits to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Humans who have been possessed for too long may either become soulless husks or take on the twisted personality of their controller where they become loyal servants to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n however there are most cases where sorcerers and witches are able to shrug off the usual aliments of corruption and use the dark magic they possess to their will however they are unable to cast any purity/ holy and healing spells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n If a human becomes overwhelm by too much demonic energy such as absorbing so much at once from possession or casting ritual then they will transform into hulking abominations with a primitive mind-set of destroying anything in their path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It was good in a way for your current host to being corrupted by your presence within her as it will make possessing all the more easier later but you had to be careful as to break her mind and turn her into a raving mad woman or worse an abomination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b> \"Level Up!\" </b>again the voice cried out and you saw another status window open up to show your states<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <b>Level 5 &gt; 7<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Title greater Imp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Health 400 &gt; 520: the character's heath points, increased by the number of endurance points and with each level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Mana 1400 &gt; 1580: The character's Mana points, Increased by Willpower and with each level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Strength 18 &gt; 21: Increases the Character's physical attacks and defence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Endurance 24 &gt; 29: Increases the character's health points with each level as well as resistance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n magic 42 &gt; 49: Increases the potency of the character's magical attacks and spells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Cunning 32&gt; 40: Increases the character's chance to score critical, skills and tactics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Willpower 50 &gt; 61: Increases the character's mana pool by each level and spell absorption.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Mission complete (test out your first spell): Exp 2000 Gold Pieces 400<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Mission complete (successfully possess a person) Exp 1500 gold Pieces 320<br>\r\n<br>\r\n New mission Infiltrate the village reward: Exp 1700 gold pieces 420<br>\r\n<br>\r\n new mission explore your body reward: Exp 900 gold Pieces 200<br>\r\n<br>\r\n New Mission stay within your host for one day without being discovered: Reward 1500 Gold Pieces 300<br>\r\n<br>\r\n New Mission Arm your self (note: buy your first weapons and armour): Reward: Exp 900 Gold Pieces 290<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Secret Mission a day and the life as a Hero's Wife (live the life of your host): Reward: Exp 2000 Gold Pieces 290<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Secret Mission Nightly passion (successfully have sex with anyone.

It should be easy.\" Gore took the piece of paper and stared at it for a second, then waved Elize off as he left for the Class. 'Rude to the end.' She thought in a huff as she left for her class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGore moved to the white building and then through each floor, slowly glancing at each of the room numbers until eventually he found the room 3410 that he was looking for. Gore opened the door to find a middle aged woman with grayish hair and a step-mother like scowl on her face, there were several woman sitting at desks in front of her. The middle aged woman looked at Gore and raised an eyebrow at his entrance. Gore, however, took this as a challenge and confidently walked in, \"I was told the class would be perfect for me.\" He grunted with a primal snort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe middle-aged woman, still stone-faced, spoke, \"Quite. Well, perhaps you were told that for any number of reasons but if you intend to stay then I will be your teacher, my name is Ms. Edelweiss. In order to finalize your decision and take this course you will need to take on the Maid Sub Class to begin my training. Are you prepared to do so?\" She explained coldly and succinctly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young women in the room looked on at Gore with worry and concern that he would do something rash or dangerous. But, Gore took Edelweiss's tone as a challenge, he would not bend so easily, especially not to woman. \"I am always ready, for I am strong.\" Gore boasted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well. Take this crystal.\" Edelweiss continued showing a silvery gem. \"And crush it in your hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A simple challenge.\" Gore smiled as he took the gem in his palm and closes his hand, quickly turning it to dust. A soft energy began to enter Gore's body, he was a bit disappointed by it. The women behind him whispered behind seeing this, unsure what to make of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good. Now take a seat so we may begin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why should I follow your orders? I only take orders from those who are stronger than me and I have never met anyone who could. I've played your game now show me your power.\" Gore demanded, what little patience he had wearing thin as he began itch for a fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe women gasped and became worried while Edelweiss let out a deep sigh, \"Sp I have another rowdy one this year too?\"</span></div></div>",

The other women in the class tried to avert their eyes as the attack landed. To Gore's surprise though the attack did nothing to Ms. Edelweiss who dusted off her clothes from the attack. \"Why did it not hurt you?\" He asked in confusion and shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maids are not meant to attack their superiors. Now that you have the maid subclass your attack drastically weakens when you try to attack someone of higher status than you such as myself,\" Gore was shocked by her words but wasn't going to let that stop him. He used the berserker skill 'mad frenzy' to relentlessly attack her some more. However each blow amounted to nothing but agitating Edelweiss further.\"I have dealt with many an unruly student and each one learned their place eventually. And you will be no different.\" Suddenly Ms. Edelweiss began to use a high class maid skill on Gore. All of her cleaning and serving skills had given her incredible dexterity. Using this she danced around him and gave a very special massage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-why do I feel so weird?\" Gore wanted to fight but his body refused to. It began to relax before going entirely limp. Edelweiss placed him down in a chair where he could barely move let alone fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The first and most important part of being a maid is that a maid always obeys and serves without question. You will have this drilled into your head by the time we are finished.\" The other girls couldn't help but laugh at Gore's humiliating defeat. Being defeated and mocked like this was a  huge blow to his pride. Even so he swore to himself that he would rise to the challenge and not let this woman beat him in the end.</span></div></div>",

I do not want to hear you laughing at your colleague. That can be an even graver sin a maid could commit compared what this man attempted.\u201d She warned sternly. \u201cNow can anyone tell me why that is? You, miss\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, um, Loretta Davis, ma\u2019am.\u201d The blonde woman responded with a slight stammer as she attempted to readjust her glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss Loretta, can you explain to the class why laughing at a colleague is worse for a maid to do than a bout of disobedience?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman was confused, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t know the answer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdelweiss let out a sigh, \u201cVery well. I shall explain. The reason is a maid\u2019s misbehavior can be forgiven and fixed quickly. However, if a maid shows little respect for her fellow maids, then how can she be expected to show the respect and reverence for her superiors and her orders that are required of her? That, my dear students, is far greater problem for a maid to possess. Maids share a unique devotion and respect to their craft, it is this devotion that allows us to serve the lords and ladies that employ us while also helping us protect them from the evil surrounding them and extinguish the malice inside their hearts. I want you all to keep this in mind as we continue your training.\u201d Gore listened unwillingly as his body continued to refuse his commands, unable to move from the chair as the effects of Edelweiss\u2019s massage continued. \u201cRegardless, Today\u2019s class is mainly an introduction of things to come. You have all received your Maid subclass and the reading material had been provided for you. You are expected to read all of it by tomorrow, were you will be given your maid uniform\u2019s and we will properly begin your training regarding manners and posture. You are all dismissed for today, be sure to arrive at class by 9 in the morning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young woman all rose from their seats and trickled out of the classroom one by one, leaving only Gore and Edelweiss. \u201cNow then, mister\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGore!\u201d His nostrils flared as his anger boiled over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, her face showed no change, \u201c\u2026Quite. Now then Gore, judging from your attitude and actions you seem confused as to your predicament. However, as of now you are a maid under my tutelage and unlike your colleagues who have already left, you will need extra special attention to make sure you keep up and not cause harm or embarrassment to your fellow maids or lord or lady you will eventually serve. So, let me start off with some questions: What do you want out of life?\u201d Edelweiss stared at Gore as he angrily snarled incoherently at her. \u201cMoney, Women, Power. Greed, Lust and Wrath. Well, we can take of that in time. Next, what are your strengths?\u201d She stared once again. \u201cJust good at fighting. A tepid berserker, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Edelweiss spoke fast and fluidly, using an advanced vocabulary that Gore lacked. \u201cHmm, Lastly, can you read?\u201d Her last question took him off guard and, briefly, his expression changed to surprise. \u201cSo, you can\u2019t? Well Gore that would make this reading assignment impossible for you. Very well, I shall instruct you on the reading assignment personally and then teach you how to read.\u201d Edelweiss concluded as she moved to pick up the small book containing the readings. Finally Gore was beginning to regain control of his wrist and fingers but little else.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Edelweiss had somehow managed to cross the entirety of the room in the space of a single blink. Gore\u2019s rage subsided for a split second to be replaced with awe at this woman\u2019s speed. It soon reappeared, however, as the tapping grew stronger and he found himself unable to so much as lift a hand to stop the pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour mistake, Mr. Gore, is rudimentary. You are afraid.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Berserker began to roar his disagreement, Edelweiss\u2019s free hand shot to his throat, The contact felt like the gentlest caress, but the effects were obvious. Gore strained against his useless muscles, spittle flying as he tried to roar out in explosive disagreement. All that came out was a guttural, strangled wheeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, afraid. You hide from true strength, from improvement. The very thought of the unfamiliar turns a man who bathes in blood into a coward that hides behind his blustering pride.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGore glared at Ms. Edelweiss with a rage that would break any weaker will. Ms. Edelweiss merely stared back in kind, face as composed and unreadable as stone. She tapped his head again, harder this time to make sure the point was made, and then lowered the book away from his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMr. Gore, are you a strong man?\u201d Edelweiss stared at her newest pupil with something close to distaste flashing in her eyes. Gore nodded his head the slightest fraction of a centimeter, all he was able to do. His returning glare made the message clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood. You will need strength for what comes next. You can no longer solve your problems with brute force. No amount of howling or abuse will convince this to share its secrets.\u201d Edelweiss opened the book with a single hand, flipping through its pages with her thumb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving closer to her pupil, Edelweiss drew a chair up next to Gore to sit down with a delicacy that belied her power. Gore\u2019s fingers twitched as he continued his futile straining to attack and maim as he always had before. Edelweiss laid her hands on his, messaging hiss knuckles for the smallest fraction of a second, and then only his eye were left able to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need you to focus now, Mr. Gore. Observe.\u201d Edelweiss opened the book to a woodcut illustration, pointing with one perfectly manicured finger to direct her pupil\u2019s attention. Gore stared at the page, eyes slowly losing their fury as he gazed into the artwork. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA young woman stood expressionless with perfect, submissive posture. Wearing a simple dress of pure black, accented with frills and lace designs of a lighter color, the woman held a tray of assorted fine wines and gourmet dishes. A smiling man, dressed in the unmistakable extravagance of aristocracy, sat in a throne-like chair just to her right, feet kicked up on an ornate stool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is the essence of our profession. The act of serving. Selfless, humbling, at times even nearing slavery. A maid is not bothered by this. She understands that it is through sacrifice that the goal is accomplished. The goal of all maids, that is. The happiness of the master. The satisfaction of the mistress. It is through this that order is maintained, that all is right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGore stared at his teacher with a gaze boiling with disdain. A warrior has no concern for the actions and doings of his servants. Why in all the Hells was this woman telling Gore all this? This could not help him smash skulls, nor could he use this to better dominate the weaker beings that surrounded him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdelweiss did not ignore her pupil\u2019s stare. Lips tightening, she tapped her finger back on the illustration of the woman to grasp his attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis, Mr. Gore, is <b><i>you.</i></b>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGore strained once more against his own body in his urge to rip this woman into shreds. He was no servant. No maid. No lowly, begging bitch. He tried to spit on Edelweiss, but the drool only caught in his frozen mouth and dribbled down his chin. Edelweiss cleaned him before continuing, patting down his mouth with a handkerchief as she sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have much work to do. We must begin at once. I do not enjoy teaching one in a few hours what others learn over years, even with the aid of magic. This will take some time. And, I\u2019m afraid, it will very likely be painful. Time to prove you are strong, Mr. Gore.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Although many never reveal it, all Coquettes possess a limited but powerful magical ability to compliment and augment their natural powers of beauty, seduction, and persuasion. Coquettes use these abilities, their uniquely extravangt fashion senses, the power of their direct flirtation, and an occasionally primal sensuality (among many other tools) to capture the attention of whomever they please.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn combat, a Coquette keeps their target too distracted to be effective, often placing herself in danger to maximize the distraction and give herself the chance to seduce her opponent and remove them from the fight completely. As such, a Coquette requires proper teamwork to survive most combat situations, healing her when an opponent ignores her advances and attacks, or saving her when an opponent responds to her minxish wooing with more excitement and enthusiasm than expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of combat, a Coquette truly shines. Using their carefully created beauty to lure and tease their targets into doing almost anything imaginable, a skilled Coquette can create allies over a single night, topple local administration, or even go her entire life without paying for a drink. At  best, a Coquette is a force of nature, a paragon of temptation that can do as they please at the cost of everyone save themselves. At worst, even the least talented Coquette possesses the supernatural abilities that allow her to make good on the class\u2019s reputation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs with many subclasses, Coquettes have choices in specialization. The Path of the Nymph, inspired by the nature spirits famous for their unattainable affections and untouchable beauty, teaches its followers that nothing is more powerful than frustrated desire. The abilities gained from this path reflect this philosophy, giving a Coquette powerful options to bring attention to herself while simultaneously being a nigh-unattainable target. Those that find that they work best in crowds, are considered adorable, and prefer to seduce from afar with a focus on teasing rather than actual contact often follow this path. The Path of the Seductress, born from the long history of the courtesan and the \u201cworking girl\u201d, teaches its followers how to utilize the power of movement, temptation, and desire to completely enrapture their targets and remove them from reality to the realm of pure lust. The abilities gained from this path reflect this philosophy, giving a Coquette powerful options to control and stimulate their targets to the point of changing threats into tools. Those that find that they work best with single targets, easily seduce even the stoic, and prefer to seduce up close and personal until their target is left helpless with desire.</span></div></div>",

Utilizing their own psychic energies to turn their ornate and complex dances into rallying cries for their allies, the Danseuse is an expert who has specialized in a single field to the point of awe-inspiring perfection. Danseuse, by utilizing both their physical dexterity and grace in conjunction with their internal psychic beauty, utilize their ascetic dedication to their craft to make the world a truly beautiful and good place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA Danseuse takes a psychic pledge to never willingly directly cause harm or death, allowing her to access the deep wells of positive energy that rest inside her ritually prepared soul. As such, they take a strictly support-based role while in combat. Using her dance to make allies powerful beyond nearly any other class\u2019s ability, a Danseuse is a force multiplier for whatever group is lucky enough to have her. However, she is likewise an extremely fragile combatant that can only hope to have time to make a magic-assisted retreat from any threats that slip past her teammates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside of combat, a Danseuse has great freedom in how she can achieve her goals. Driven to make the world a better and more beautiful place through their permanently binding pledge, a Danseuse\u2019s first priority in any interaction is to use her beauty to bring hope to others. As such, many Danseuse spend the majority of their time either doing good deeds and giving away any wealth they\u2019ve accumulated (Danseuse require very little in way of equipment), or performing in public to any crowds they can find. Such performances are very popular, as they have a psychically positive impact that can last for quite some time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs with many subclasses, Danseuse have choices in specialization. The Prima Rose Style, taught to those Danseuse who show great psychic skill and ego strength, is inspired by the beauty of the rose and the striking elegance of the lead dancer.  This style provides its users with several unique dances and techniques, giving them the ability to temporarily stun opponents with displays of awe-inspiring grace, provide allies with psychic powers that improve their greatest strengths, and even bend the rules of space and time with pure psychic willpower. Those who are confident in their ability to display beauty and utilize their inner beauty to improve the world often dedicate themselves to this style. The Tulle Lily Style, taught to those who show the greatest level of delicacy and grace in their movement and psychic expression, is inspired by the grace of the meek and the martyrdom of the innocent. The users of this style focus completely on those who their dances effect, providing even stronger offensive and defensive support effects while creating psychic auras of peace where opponents and allies alike are unable to cause harm. Those who seek above all else to save and to protect, using the perfect grace and delicacy of their movement to turn beauty into a shield, often dedicate their lives to the mastery of this style.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is NOT recommended for heroes who have begun their careers as warriors or any combat-based class to enter the Danseuse class as the majority of their skills and abilities become useless. Likewise, emotion-based effects such as a berserker\u2019s frenzy or a bloodrager\u2019s bloodrage are permanently inaccessible while a Danseuse (not, of course, that any such hero would ever willingly become a Danseuse) as a result of their pledge.</span></div></div>",

A subclass for those have dedicated their lives to the pure power of love and the complicated magics that revolve around this force, it is synonymous with the joy, romance, and endless playfulness that gives them their name. Undergoing intensive training to connect to the oft-ignored unique energies of love magic, Sweethearts use their enthusiasm to foster the love and desire that is the underpinning of the world. From their often outlandish fashion to their unique song-and-dance based methods of professing and encouraging love, Sweethearts dedicate themselves to lovemaking and the furthering of romance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn combat, a Sweetheart will always be found doing something that might at first be construed as counter-productive\u2014making love, not war. However, as the allies of Sweethearts can attain, they are often so skilled at this task that the enemy is so distracted any allies have an opportunity to sweep them off their feet (so to speak). In addition, love magic has an extremely wide variety of uses, including extremely powerful healing, defensive augmentation, and rendering combatants useless by manipulating romance and affection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside of combat, the Sweetheart is an agent of love. Their immediate priority in any interaction is to encourage the other being to love as fully and positively as possible. This often leads to awkward situations where the Sweetheart is the target of affections, but Sweethearts are enlightened and see these merely as opportunities to generate more love (opportunities they always selflessly pursue). Using their magic and inherent charisma to encourage love and adoration for one another, Sweethearts are often found in populated areas leading impromptu parties and hosting unannounced concerts. These can often dissolve into purely bacchanal parties, but so long as love is had and harm is avoided, a Sweetheart does not necessarily have any issue with that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs with many subclasses, Sweethearts have choices in specialization. The Inamorata Idol Heart, a type of love magic ritual training taught to those who focus on expressing love through their performing talents, is deeply tied to the primal affecting power of love as expressed through music and movement. This training enables Sweethearts to utilize their love magic to simultaneously affect multiple targets with different effects, allowing for greater battlefield control, as well as greatly improving their ability to encourage large crowds to feel the power of love and adoration during performances. Sweethearts who view themselves as a conduit for love to reach the entire world often are drawn towards this path. The Moonbeam Amor Heart is a type of ancient love magic ritual training taught since the discovery of love magic to those who focus on the power and energy of true, wild love between individuals (and the situations and emotions that encourage such love). This training intensifies a Sweetheart\u2019s natural Romance Aura, causing them to effect enemies more strongly with their attacks, and enables them to better control the psychic element of love magic. Sweethearts who are focused on ensuring that they facilitate true and powerful love are often drawn to this path.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A subclass for those who are willing to shoulder the responsibility and the restrictions of the Fairy Princess Pact to use powerful and ancient Fae magic to protect allies and fight for goodness, the Fairy Princess is the image of proper, ladylike righteousness. Born of the ancient Elven traditions of Fae Pacts, Fairy Princesses make personal pacts with extremely powerful Fairies, giving up a portion of their free will and agreeing to a list of conditions that they are permanently bound to. In return, the Fairy becomes their Wardmother, an omnipresent guardian and the source of their power.  Under this protection, the bonded being becomes a Fairy Princess, fighting for the specific issues agreed upon in their Pact with absolute determination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFairy Princesses do not actually control their powers, but during the initial pact writing they discuss how the Fae magic will manifest. In many senses, the Fairy Princess is little more than a vessel for Fae influence. Fae magic requires physical elements, or \u201cfairy heirlooms\u201d (such as wands, tiaras, etcetera), to be activated. As such, Fairy Princess are famous for the complicated, regal, and irremovable costumes they wear (normally created by the Fae as part of the Pact), which normally transform and grow even more extravagant during the usage of more powerful Fae magics. During combat, a Fairy Princess will use her magic as the Pact commands, normally to confuse or immobilize foes while protecting and supporting allies. Fae magic is very powerful, but as a Princess has no direct control over it the results can be unpredictable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside of combat, Fairy Princesses are normally able to converse with their Fae benefactor whenever they need to achieve a specific goal through magic (otherwise pursuing mundane ends). In most situations, a Fairy Princess is going to be bound by her pact to act in a certain manner. Even when otherwise, she will still be compelled to follow the general philosophy of the pact. The nature of a Fairy Princess Pact can vary widely, but there are always a few guarantees: they will always act a Princess, they will always save the innocent, and they will never commit an evil act. More specific focuses, from fashion to sword-fighting, will determine how a Fairy Princess is driven to interact with others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs with many subclasses, Fairy Princesses have choices in specialization. The Queensguard, a group of like-minded fairies who use their bonded Princesses to follow the Fairy Queen\u2019s commandments of prim, ladylike conduct in the face of any threat, are particularly popular. The Princesses tied to this organization typically pay great attention to proper conduct, whether in a court or on a battlefield, and as a result possess a great deal of tactical magical abilities. Princesses who are driven by the ideals of the Fairies and who seek to be a paragon of their cause often flock to this path. The Pale Maidens, a loose association of like-minded fairies who seek to help Princesses pursue true love and a happily-ever-after, are a common choice for those who wish to live the magical life of their dreams. Such Princesses possess strong magic, much of it tainted with love and psychic influence, at the cost of their ability to participate in combat beyond supporting. Princesses who do not believe in violence, want true love, and care about beauty often see the importance of this philosophy.</span></div></div>",

It seems that you can barely ever win in an argument. Your little sister Anna is 9 years old and your typical bratty girly girl. She is always playing dress up, and having tea parties while trying to drag anyone she can in. Your little brother Tim is 11 years old is always hyper and loves to play loudly with his toys. Then you have your twin sister Jennifer who is quite mischievous and loves playing planks. She constantly tries to get you roped into her schemes that never work out well for you.

Taylor had done you a favor a while back and in return she got you to do her laundry yesterday while she was studying. You were tired and not really paying attention. You were about to respond when something strange happened. Everything around you started to look like an 8-bit video game being made out of pixels.

I can also help clean your room tomorrow to make up for it.\" You were shocked by what you were forced to say. \"Alright, i guess I will forgive you this time little bro.

You remember that yesterday you were forced to ask Anna for ballet tips and the game like interface said you would practice ballet for a week. Confirming your fears, you told Anna you were ready for the ballet tips and she excitedly rushed over to start. It was mostly just an hour of learning stretches and exercises. When it was done though, Anna was looking over you carefully. \"You can't wear that for ballet practice, you need to wear a tutu \" she told you, not approving of your regular workout clothes.

You didn't want to do anything risky as you might lose all your points. You had no idea what would happen then, and you weren't going to find out.

Also I would love to watch some of your ballet shows with you\" You told Anna. She smiled big and replied \" That would be great, thank you!\" With that you returned to your room and thought about what happened. It appeared if you lost badly you had to do something related to the original argument plus something extra. It made you really worry about what would have happened if you lost all your points. \"This is only going to get worse, isn't it?\" You thought to yourself right before you took a nap.</span></div></div>",

It was the next day and you woke up with your body moving against your will again. You knew that it was time to practice some ballet while later that night was more ballet show watching. You entered your sisters room where she greeted you with a smile. \"Ready for another day of practice sis?\" you asked your sister. She was so excited to have one of her brothers spending time with her and being so interested in ballet.  Having to wear a girly tutu and tights was incredibly embarrassing and quite hard to get used to. Now your sister was starting to teach you some basic stuff for ballet. It wasn't too bad, but you knew you still had a lot more to by the time the week was over. Your sister was constantly critiquing your moves and you tried your best to avoid disagreeing with her.  It was going well until it ended and your sister suggested that you practice a couple hours on your own time to get really good at it. The thought of having to spend even more of you time on ballet made you lose control for a second. \"I don't have time to do that\" you told your sister. This of course dragged you into an argument battle with your sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&gt;Anna asks you about extra ballet practice<br>\r\n&gt; Anna gains 5 points for knowledge of ballet<br>\r\n&gt;Anna gains 5 points for prior instructing you on ballet<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&gt;Argument Commencing!<br>\r\n&gt;Current Persuasion Control: 40% You 60% Anna<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time you didn't have a major disadvantage like the other times. You thought about maybe trying to press Run Away again, but if it failed than you were going to waste your turn and get stuck in a worse situation. \"Maybe if I win, then I can reverse all of this!\" you thought. The hope of being able to turn everything around drove you to keep going as you wondered what to do.

You went to click on it hoping that it would work. A text box appeared besides you as your action took place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou:[I don't have time to waste on a stupid sport like ballet, I am too busy with school]<br>\r\nIt was a bit harsh, but you didn't want to lose again. Another text box came up telling you how it went.<br>\r\n&gt;Attack successful. You gain 5 points<br>\r\n&gt;Current persuasion control: 45% You 55% Anna<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting some points for the first time was making you really happy. it was giving you hope that you could win this time.

Maybe your lack of debating skills was the reason you had such limited and weak choices. You certainty couldn't plead like your little sister could. It was clear to you that you would need to learn a technique of your own that could really convince and sway people into doing what you wanted. The situation had turned bad very quickly and now you had to make a decision. If you compromised now, then you wouldn't suffer a total defeat, but it was still a guaranteed loss. \"It might not be over yet\" you thought. You had never used the Item tab that you have seen before. It could be your hope to winning, but you could lose completely. After some thought, you decide to...</span></div></div>",

That made you nervous more than anything else. 'What could she be planning?' you wondered as you came back to your room some time later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing Jennifer, with that big grin on her face was never a good sign and your fears were confirmed when you looked at the room, Jennifer's side looked normal for the most part, normal for a girl her age. Your side, however, was not so fortunate. Your bed sheets and pillows had been replaced with Disney princess theme, your side of the wall, which had formally been blue, had been painted a pastel pink that now finally matched Jennifer's side. The bed side table was now white with wooden flowers crawling up the legs with a pink music box on top and she had even gotten you your own girlish vanity table, though yours seemed more tailored to a younger girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned to Jennifer, giving her a big stink eye before sighing, \"You let Anna redesign the room, didn't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep\", she replied as she burst into one of her laughing fits. You wanted to yell at her but like before, the results from that weird argument battle were holding you back. At least, she didn't mess with your clothes.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Steven held up the box like a knight, holding aloft his trophy, or remarking upon his great conquest. He was quite tall and thin, often referred to as gangly by those who saw him. Despite being almost 18, his facial hair was still quite patchy, and his complexion wasn't perfect. He kept his brown hair long and tied back in a ponytail, and his female friends agreed that he'd be pretty cute once he left his awkward teen years behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr really fat once his metabolism crashed, given how much he ate and his refusal to work out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reaction he received to his news was fairly lackluster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... seriously, bro? You brought us out here for this?\" Steven's sister, Samantha (<i>\"Because Heaven forbid our parents choose a name with a different letter...\"</i>), all but rolled her eyes at her brother's purchase. Like her brother, she had brown hair, though of a considerably lighter shade. Puberty had been far kinder to her then to Steven, and it was widely agreed that Sam was one of the top beauties of their high school. In particular, she was considerably more active then her brother, playing for both the volleyball and basketball teams, giving her a trim, tight figure that left many a high school boy dreaming in class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This from the girl that owns and has beat every Disgaea game ever made.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I love strategy games. I also like humor. And plot. And story. When has Anatal ever had any of that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven set the game on the table and cracked a can of coke. \"Oh, come on, Sam. The first game was a classic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, the <b>FIRST</b> game,\" said Jacob, one of the twin's good friends. He was shorter then the two beanpoles he was next to, only standing about 5'5\". He kept his curly red hair short, and was a bit on the heavy side. \"Seriously, what are they even up to by now? 27?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is game 6, jackass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not helping your case here, dude.\" This time, the one who spoke was Sylvia. One of Sam's closest friends from the moment the two met in elementary school, she'd gone through the most drastic changes over time out of any of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Steven had met Syl, she'd been an excitable and talkative little girl, gabbing non-stop, always wearing pink dresses and ribbons, and obsessed with everything cute and fuzzy in existence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now, she was the most depressing goth who'd ever walked the planet. The only articles of clothing in her closest that weren't black were grey. Her hair, naturally platinum blonde, was dyed black. Her fingernails, her lipstick, everything about her save her skin was black. Most people found her moody or non-responsive, and she generally only opened up to her closest friends in private, like now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one in the room was really certain why she'd had such a personality shift in middle school. Sam's running theory was that Sylvia's early development had something to do with it, and even now she was probably the bustiest girl in school, though the heavy sweaters she favored did make it hard to tell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvia continued, \"Honestly, every game after numero uno was just a cheap cash in on the cult following of the first one. What makes you think attempt #: 6 is somehow going to be any different?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, unlike you lot, I've been doing my research. For starters, \"GAMER$\" went bankrupt, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why no, Steve. We knew nothing of the endless lawsuits and predatory business practices and their multiple failing products, as we don't have the internet in our Amish community.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be an ass, Jake. Gamer$ had the rights to Anatal, but when they folded, it was bought by Blackstone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And who are they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the company that was founded by Pan Twardowski and Richard Obsidian.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat got the attention of the other three people in the room. The aforementioned duo had been the creators of the original game, but had been fired by Gamer$ almost immediately after the title launched. Rumors abounded as to why, but the most likely reason was, with their contract with the company coming due, Gamer$ wanted to get rid of them before they had to pay them more. The two had tried for years to purchase the rights from the company, but Gamer$ wouldn't let it go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvia picked up the non-descript black box. Her voice was more reverent then sarcastic now, and she forgot to keep slouching, stretching out her shirt far more noticeably then before. \"So, this is a new Anatal made by the original creators themselves?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven only smiled. \"Better. This is a beta copy they sent me to play test.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus. Who'd you have to blow to score that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Classy, Sam. And no one. I put my name in their draw and won one of the beta copies. And guess what? It has multiplayer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake was already breaking out his lap top. \"Well, what the hell are we waiting for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*** *** ***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed. What are we waiting for?</span></div></div>",

Should give us plenty of time to get you guys set up and grab some food n'stuff before we start.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good to me,\" Jake said as he started to set up a folding table. \"We're just doing this in the garage, I'm guessing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Dad's still got the basement all tore up, so this is the only spot that's big enough. Sam, could you grab an end of this table?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin short order, the garage was set up for the marathon gaming session to follow. The folding tables had been arranged in a square, and a few extension cords allowed them to power up all their machines. Steven brought his tower down from his bedroom, leaving him panting heavily from moving that monster. As he wiped the sweat from his brow, he heard his sister cluck her tongue behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously? Why can't you just use one of our laptops? That'd have been way easier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way. I want to see this baby at max graphics.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not like you're going to see much of a difference, anyway,\" Jacob said as he read through the various provided documents. \"Says here that this is not the final graphics set. Jesus, these settings. This could halfway cripple my machine as is, and they're trying to make them <i>better</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What else does it say?\" Sylvia asked. She'd just gotten back from running home for her laptop which, despite her monochromatic wardrobe, still remained pink and flowery, much to the private amusement of Samantha. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Standard NDA stuff. Can discuss on our private site forums, but nowhere else, blah, blah, blah, game is not yet fully balanced, experiment with everything, especially the new multiplayer feature. Honestly, the list goes on and on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSyl leaned over Jake's shoulder and let out a low whistle. \"Wow. Is my comp even going to be able to run this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got a spare in my truck if yours won't, but it should be fine if you put your graphics to minimum.\" Steven was unquestionably the tech junkie out of the four, and seemed to have the latest of everything, and often multiples to boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kay, cool. Is this me over here?\" Syl pointed to the sole empty table and began setting up without waiting for an answer. As she set her stuff out on the table, she kept talking. \"Not sure if making it so graphically intense is such a good idea. That'll really limit their pool of buyers, won't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hard to say. Anatal has always been a blend of RPG and turn based tacticu-holy shit...!\" Steve had turned towards Sylvia while speaking, and was greeted with quite a sight. It was already a bit warm in the garage, and undoubtedly would only get worse. Because of this, Sylvia had decided to take off her sweater, and he just so happened to look at precisely the moment she pulled it over her head. Underneath, she'd been wearing a white spaghetti strap top, which did nothing to hide her lacy blue bra or the titanic assets it was trying to restrain. She was firmly an E cup, if not an F, and given her slim build and petite frame, her breasts looked absolutely huge on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvia slowly became aware of Steve's unblinking stare, his jaw moving wordlessly. Already regretting her decision, she slowly pulled her sweater in front of herself. She'd been fairly self-conscious of her body for a lot of years by this point, and was quite uncomfortable with just how well endowed she was. Sam had always been telling her to loosen up, but that was easier said then done. She figured she'd be fine around her friends, since she'd always seen Steve and Jake more like brothers, but apparently she could even have an effect on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven eventually found his voice. The two blushing teens couldn't look at each other as he picked up from where he left off. \"A-anyway, as I w-was saying, Anatal has always been a blend of RPG and turn based strategy, so it's kind of a niche market to begin with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that niche market just so happens to have the most powerful PC's on the planet, do they?\" Jacob was currently trying to funnel the extension cord to the outlet under the work bench. He grunted and finally let out a sound of triumph as he felt the plug connect. \"You might have the latest thing on the market, but my stuff is generally mid-range, at best.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We got power,\" Sam said as she walked over and plucked Sylvia's sweater from her hands. Despite the petite woman's wordless protests, she placed it up on the top shelf, well out of her reach. She turned around and mouthed to her, <i>\"If you can't get comfortable around them, you can't get comfortable around anybody. Trust me. Relax.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides,\" she continued aloud, \"maybe they'll have better optimization at launch. Alright, now for those of us who haven't played any Anatal games since the third, what do I need to know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't worry. Blackstone reset the time line to the end of the first game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha just rolled her eyes. \"Steve, it's been like, six years since I played ANY of the games, let alone the first. And unlike you, I don't replay the original every summer like a religious ritual. Just humor your older sister and give me a rundown of the story.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're only older by, like, 19 minutes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, ah, ah, 13 years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh for... I don't age a quarter of your speed because I was born on February 29th!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, guys, could we focus a little here? Backstory? Details? Sam's not the only one who needs a refresher,\" Jake said, eager to avoid the twins wasting most of the night bickering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright, alright,\" Steve said, turning towards the other two. \"What do you want to hear about first?\"</span></div></div>",

The details will be in the game, so keep it to broad strokes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll try, but I make no promises. Alright, so, the formerly biggest human realm was the Immortal Empire. At the end of the first game, they'd fallen to civil war, and had broken into three chunks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, the Gothic kingdom had risen in the west. They'd been a reaver clan of the Halogalanders, and the last ruler of the old Imperial dynasty had given them land and titles if they swore fealty to him. He thought it was a win-win. He'd get a powerful subject to help his wars, a depopulated and poor province would be made productive, and since the Jarl was on the coast, any raiding would happen in his lands instead of Imperial ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, what happened was the Goths took the land and told the Emperor to get stuffed. The childless Emperor got himself killed trying to bring them to heel. His death set off the civil war, and the Goths took the lion's share of the Empire for themselves. They even took the ancient Imperial capital, Khorshemish, for their own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, in terms of feel, the Goths are medieval Normans, the Halogalanders are the Vikings, and the three Imperial factions are the Byzantine Empire, with some variations between them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha had to interrupt. \"You mean the divine marriage ones, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve could only roll his eyes as Sylvia shot a confused glance at Sam. \"Oh, of course that's what you'd remember. Yes, the one branch sees themselves as being divinely descended, so they try to keep the line pure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvia scrunched up her face. \"Oh, ew. Why don't I remember that from the game?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It only made an appearance in the first game. Gamer$ dropped it from their subsequent titles, and even in the first game, it was only mentioned in passing. Anyway, moving swiftly along, the Empire's implosion actually really helped out the non-human races. In the centuries since humanity showed up on the continent, many of them had been pushed to the brink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Orcs especially needed the breathing room. A race of nomadic hunter-gatherers, they'd followed the reindeer herds of Ghurtha for countless generations. Famed archers and spearmen, Orc ambushes were a constant fear for those traveling in the wilds, and their reputation as cannibals was well deserved. That said, they really didn't have the numbers to deal with the vast, organized armies of humanity, and had been pushed almost to extinction. They kind of got a Scottish caveman feel to them, really. I know they used Irish Gaelic for their language.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Dwarfs had fared far better, overall. Their mountain holds would have been suicide for any army to attack, and the humans figured out pretty quickly that they made far better trading partners then enemies. They're obsessed with perfection, seeking it in everything they do, even if it will kill them. They're really pessimistic too, believing their own god is the cause of all their misfortune and misery. They've got a well deserved rep as a bunch of angry, grumbling drunks. They got a very Slavic feel to them, and I think they used Russian as a stand in for their language.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there's the Elves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvia let out a grin as she checked up on her download. \"Oh, I love Anatal's Elves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam looked between her friend and brother. \"Really? The hippies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, these aren't hippies,\" Sylvia said. \"They're bloody psychotic. They're a family of interdimensional energy beings, exiled to this world by the rest of their species. The bodies you see are the shells of kidnapped human children, their souls devoured and physical form reshaped to fit the desires of the Elf in question. They can inhabit them for about a millennium before they need a new one, though that timeline can be shortened if they use a lot of magic. And in terms of spell casting, they're second to none.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Polish, actually.\" The other three turned towards Jake. \"Sorry, looking up details on line.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But yeah,\" Steven continued. \"The Elves are the very definition of evil, with a capital E. About the only thing that can threaten them one v. one is a dragon. Or another Elf.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam frowned a little. \"Isn't that a little broken?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah. It was one of the big weaknesses of the original game. Originally, they weren't supposed to be playable, but Gamer$ forced Obsidian and Twardowski to make them so. Even in the later games, Gamer$ really struggled with their balancing. They're a god-like heavy magic faction in a game where most of the factions have zero magic. Fact is, in the lore, no one can directly threaten the Elves. And in the first game, if you couldn't hire on a dragon, you just had to resign and start a new campaign; there was just no way to beat them without one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven turned and looked at the clock. \"Well, I don't want to keep rattling on all night. There's a bunch of new features in the game. They're using a hex based map now, instead of the old squares. The Orcs are properly nomadic now, instead of having settlements. Oh, and they got the new barbarian factions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already like the sound of this,\" Sam said with a predatory smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you might. They don't have any cities or settlements. Given they have no constant source of gold, they instead hire themselves out to other factions. They can raid or tithe the areas they're in. They also have drastically reduced upkeep to help with survivability, thought Blackstone did say the balancing is a little tricky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how do they recruit new units?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It depends. Human barbarians are generally mercs, so you can recruit in human territories. Ogres, on the other hand, are purely nomadic. Their tribal pop slowly increases each round. Bulls with clubs can always be built if you have spare pop, other units need certain loot to be present in the tribe's stockpile. So, given the extreme cliff notes version, any idea what all you want to play? Many factions have multiple playable characters, so we can double up, if we want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm definitely going Elf,\" Sylvia piped up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not even surprised by that. Well, what about you two?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*** *** ***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a typical afternoon in the Maluable household.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're such a bitch!!\" \"Well, you're an asshole!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is to say, it was host to a screaming match between the two children of the Maluable family. Sam and Jinn Maluable got along like oil and water. Sam was a bit of an introvert with interests in sports, video games, comedy slice of life shows. Jinn was more of an extrovert with interests in fashion, visual novels, and action-packed comic books. As children, they got along well enough but school-life caused them to become highly aggressive toward one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened to cause this kind of aggression? Lots of little things driving a bigger and bigger wedge between them. This fight is no different, at least, almost no different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just asking you to keep quiet, I know you just got dumped but you don't need to scream the FUCKING house down!!\" Sam yelled as he stomped back into his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really liked this guy! So excuse me if I'm a little upset over the fact he dumped me BY TEXT!!!\" The only response she got back from this was the sound of a door being slammed. After a few minutes passed Jinn collapsed onto the living room couch, she ran the shouting match through her again and realized that this time it was her fault. Sam did just ask for a bit of quiet, albeit quite curtly but she was the one who started shouting and slinging insults first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinn sighed as she ran a hand down her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It shouldn't have to be like this.' Jinn thought as she looked about the nearly quiet house. Their parents often had to travel for work which left the two teens home alone for the most part. A sudden feeling of loneliness washed over her as she thought about how most of their days after school ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This has to change.\" Jinn murmured to herself but how? Even if she tried to apologize now, Sam wouldn't take it all that seriously and they don't exactly have any hobbies that could bond over... Wait. Jinn walked over to the games room and rummaged around in the cupboard until she pulled out two VR headsets. Mum and Dad had gotten them as gifts just last month, the tech for these games had improved dramatically over the last couple of years. Even to the point where people could use them while they slept!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Maybe if I use this on Sam while he sleeps, he'll think it's a dream and we'll be able to start reconnecting over the experiences he has in the games I like. Or maybe I should just ask if he wants to play so games together.' Jinn thought hopefully to herself, but a still bitter part of her mind whispered 'Fat chance of that'. Steeling herself, Jinn set about her mission to reconnect with her brother.</span></div></div>",

He was blaring some metal music as he worked on his motorcycle. He would occasionally stop to rev his engine, checking something beyond your understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy would speed up and down the street, his muffler-less ride startling or annoying everyone, but it happened just infrequently enough that no one had lodged a formal complaint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, tonight... You just wanted to sleep. With a mix of desperation and venom, you typed, \"My neighbor and his GODDAMN motorcycle\" into the empty space and clicked send before retreating to your bed, collapsing as your consciousness faded... along with the sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, you awoke surprisingly early without your alarm, all the best for you since you needed to head out early too. You quickly got changed and just scarfed down some trail mix to tide you over for the morning. Once outside, you noticed someone leaving out of your neighbor's house. Someone... unfamiliar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would have to be several years older than you, maybe her early twenties, dressed in a white skirted blouse and a grey pantsuit that hugged her figure, a mix of casual and business chic, riding a silver bicycle that was gradually picking up speed. She wove to you, \"Morning, Andrew. Heading to school?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... yeah?\" You barely manage to answer as she whisks by you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool, have a good one.\" She shouted back as she made a turn out of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat woman wasn't here...before. Is she his girlfriend or...\" The thought dawns on you as you immediately run back to your room to see your computer screen triumphantly say,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><b>Trade Complete</b></font></span></div></div>",

Doing actions or using items can affect characters stats which can affect their behavior. When making up status effects for objects, they can be outrageous as you like but try have them make sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Try to stay away from making the characters into hardcore criminals: stealing is fine, but don't turn people rape or kill crazy, please.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Respect the pathway you are contributing to!
