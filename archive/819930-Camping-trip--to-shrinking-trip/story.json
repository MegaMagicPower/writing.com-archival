After comparing yourself to some plants and rocks it is quite plain that you're pretty small, one inch in height actually. Looking back at the town you were about to casually stroll of out you see it stretching endlessly onward to the horizon and the forest behind you does equally so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing so small it would probably be fun to explore familiar areas now turned foreign to you in your newfound size. The town has it paved roads and many adventures just waiting to be taken while the forest would grant you the camping trip of a lifetime! Where do you go? </span></div></div>",

She has long brown hair that gently brushes against her bosom.  Her breasts are AMAZING, easily big enough to completely smother a little guy like yourself!  But she is married, and getting her attention is a little risky.

Her slender fingers are highlighted by a 36 carat diamond ring to you!  \"Oh my God!\" she whispers.  \"Are you for real?\" she asks.  You nod slowly, sort of overwhelmed by her sheer size.  \"Wow, I wonder how small are you?\"  You say 1 inch, but to her it sounds like a little squeak.  She giggles like a school girl at you r feeble attempt at communication.  \"I know how to check.\"  She then moves a 6 foot long thumbnail right up next to you.  It is a beautiful shade of red, and from base to tip it is exactly the same length as you!  \"Looks like exactly 1 inch.\"  A sinister smile sweeps across her face. \"I guess a guy as small as you is completely helpless and totally at my mercy.  But don't worry!  I think you're kinda cute.  And by the way, my name is Heather\"  Just then her husband says \"Who are you talking to dear?\"  She decides to.....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It works great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good!\" The male giant boomed. It sounded like a train going by. \"So how much did you want to sell it for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, $45? That is a good deal!\" She says. You can feel her heart beating behind her breast, and hear it like a drum. It begins to beat faster, and she looks down at you. She smiles, showing her car sized teeth, which is a little bit scary, but comforting at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of the day, you feel very squished anyway, but the giant and giantess say goodbye for the night.

Now looking into the store you can see a large island to the right of a lane running all the way back into the store. It probably contains patterns or yarn for sewing.

Indeed, as you brushed against those taste buds the doe caught a salty taste which resembled something heavenly. Her memory returns to that time when she gained the chance to taste one of those salt-licks which humans would give their horses. A delicious taste. Now, this morsel inside her mouth tastes just like one. She links you with food! You are assaulted by her massive tongue. Saliva soaks your entire body. The doe presses you against the roof of her mouth and sucks at your puny, but delicious form. She decides to let her guard down and expresses her enjoyment through small vocalizations. This moment is too good for her to let pass in a whim. For you, the experience is far from great. The tongue tosses you around, slime gathers around you and one time you even scrape against her rear incisors, cutting your arm, but not seriously. You scream and squirm, but your efforts are nothing against the doe's mighty tongue; your puny screams nothing against the bursts from her vocal chords. Quickly, the torture (ecstasy to another) comes to a climax as the doe sucks on you hard one last time before flicking you into the confines of her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- GULP ---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doe has a quick look around her.

Her scent is strong in your nostrils, but then again you probably don't smell any better to her. The doe breaks into a hop. The trees and creepers swish past you. If it weren't for your position you would probably enjoy the ride, but the constant jumping makes you feel sick. Just when you feel like vomiting the doe stops. She once again attempts to lick you out of her nose (without doubt, it must be uncomfortable for her) and actually manages to dislodge you. Your brief joy is quickly gone when she pulls you into the confines of her mouth. The hopping continues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doe's mouth is hot, humid and, of course, very wet. Though you can't see you can feel strings of saliva wrapping around you like rope as the hopping makes you fly about in the disgusting maw. As if that were not enough, the doe begins tasting you. She pushes you around, presses you against the roof of her mouth and once she even placed you between her incisors and gently squeezed your puny form. You are too overwhelmed to scream, but you quickly gain the strength to fight back. You squirm with all your might, but this causes you to slip under her tongue. The doe seems to find this good and leaves you there. Saliva pools around you and you must strive for breath. Yet, this only fills your nostrils with the stench of the doe's own breath which, though not so bad, still isn't something you would like to smell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you lay there you cannot prevent questions from filling your head. Where was the doe taking you? Why did she take you? Was she going to eat you? If so why hadn't she already done so? Did she know you are a human? Was she planning to torture you for revenge? Your thoughts are interrupted as the hopping stops and you find yourself being spat out. As you tumble out of the doe's maw you prepare for a hard landing, but instead you land on soft moss. It takes you time to get yourself together. You try to stand up, but the moss is too soft to do so. You tumble backwards and your vision is filled by a huge muzzle. The doe's muzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Enjoy the ride? she asks mockingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are taken aback. Did that doe just talk?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- You can... talk? you ask with shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doe pulls back with surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- You can talk? she asks with equal shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Of course I can talk, you say insulted. - It's you who is..., your words are cut off. Indeed, you are not talking in any human language. You were talking... talking... what you were talking goes over your head. Something... deerish you guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Awww... my little human can talk. And has a temper as well, the doe says with awe. She presses her nose against your body and nuzzles you gently. You roll to the side and shout at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Hold on! What do you mean 'your little human'? I'm not your's! I belong to myself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doe pulls back a bit insulted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Very well little human. I won't force you to be mine. In fact, if you wish, you may leave. Go ahead, leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe allows you to have a look around. You are in a small clearing. From all sides you are beset by dense trees. Who knows how far the nearest humans were. You still think the hike is worth it. You manage to scramble to your feet and head for the trees as doe adds;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- By the way. You tasted delicious and that's saying a lot as we deer are picky eaters. I'm sure there are many, less picky eaters, in there who would gladly offer you a cozy place inside their stomachs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour blood runs cold. The thought of predators had not occurred to you. At your size you are sure to attract predators as an easy meal. The choice was yours. Would you stay with the doe who would make you a pet or even a slave or would you risk your dear life in those woods. After some thought you decide to...</span></div></div>",

You watch for a moment, a literal fly on the wall, before you start to think about where you should set up camp.  Do you want to go left, by the sleeping bags, or right, by the gear?</span></div></div>",

These two, and probably their friends, must be intending on staying in the woods for quite a while, as you can see nets, fishing rods, and what look to be hunting snares, tangled in among the backpacks, one of which fell open without being noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Survivalists, maybe?\" you question, but decide that it doesn't really matter. For right now you are going to be stuck here with them, and heck, after a while you fully intend on trying to get their attention, and trying to reverse whatever it is that happened to you. Thinking about that you set your own pack down right next to theirs, fully aware of the slight difference in size between what you brought, and what they did, both in proportion and in truth, and wihtout thinking about it you being to pull at the top of your pack, which is the rolled up tent you intended on sleeping in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a second, what am I doing?\" you ask yourself, looking around. As big as the tent around you is, it's still a tent. Heck, in point of fact this tent is better even that the one you had, with a bug net over the entrance and everything. You had just been lucky enough to get in before either of the two had pulled the net together, and would have to exit with them later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, this all meant that your tent was kind of superfluous, and so you set it aside without even unrolling it, and then pause again as you begin to get out some of the provisions you brought with you. Seeing as how those things you originally intended on catching and eating out in the woods will now see you as food, saving what you brought probably isn't too bad an idea, and scavenging some from your unknowing hosts might not be a bad idea either, and the backpack is sitting open right next to you.</span></div></div>",

Luckily for you most of the traps and lines the campers brought with them are still curled up, and so pose little threat to you as you enter the pack, though you do get your foot slightly tangled in a loose fishing line for a moment, but it comes off with just a bit of wriggling, and so you continue on deeper into the pack, past the stuff on top to what laid at the bottom of the pack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, maybe I should have thought this through some more,\" you admonish yourself as you get around the traps to the stuff beyond. Being a city boy you aren't too much of a camper, but you did pack the food you brought in sealed containers and bags. Having done that you should have realized that these people, who even brought their own animal snares and traps compared to you who just brought a fishing pole, would have sealed their stuff as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd they did indeed, as you now stare at what amounts to you to be a sandwich the size of a small house, but is double wrapped in plastic so much that you doubt you could even get at it. Not without some major wriggling anyway, and then all you'd get is to end up trapped inside the snack until someone unwrapped it and ate it, with you along for the ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right then, time to head out,\" you tell yourself, and begin to make your way back out of the pack. Having been inside the pack you hadn't been listening to the couple, who had finally finished their fun and had set some corner points to their tent, which would force it to keep it's shape even in strong wind, and they checked every piece of the tent's structure just to make sure it was good, which gave you time to get nice and deep into the pack, before its owner decided to pick it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly and without any warning that you could have recognized the whole world turns ninety degrees, and you find the floor you had been walking on is now just wall, and that the new floor is far down and away. Falling through the space littered with various junk you know you can find something to grab onto, and you begin flailing about, trying to do just that, coming to a very painful stop as one of your legs catches something and you do a slight pendulum swing before coming to a full stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world, however, has not stopped, and you can feel everything shifting around as whoever grabbed it is pushing stuff around searching for something. You know that if you remain where you are you will probably be crushed, and so you quickly being to search about, but with everything moving around light begins to play tricks on you, and you can't see anything too promising, besides a small opening in front of you, which is what your foot caught on.</span></div></div>",

The drop is actually longer than you expected it to be, and so you know the landing, whatever you hit, will be rather painful, and considering the opening had been made of some kind of hard plastic it indicates that whatever you jumped into, it was made of similar stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~SPLASH!~ you are startled for a second and just float where you are, not sure what the heck is going on, and not really too intent on finding out as the water you landed in churns and throws violently, and in sync with the world outside, where the person continues to go through the backpack looking for something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AH HA!\" comes a thunderous voice, and you are thrust under the water as the container rockets skyward. You are blinded by the light entering through the hole in the ceiling, though you are now forcefully shown that the walls of the container in which you float are opaque, however even when in reverse and in the low light you recognize the lettering on the walls, which you have written on a similar container in your own pack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"32 Ounce Canteen,\" you read allowed, and you realize the true extent of your situation. Somehow the cap on the canteen inside the pack had come off, and now you were stuck inside it, unbeknownst to the person who had withdrawn it from the pack, quite possible to take a drink from it. Having already pictured being eaten alive on a sandwich but minutes ago you don't even want to imagine getting drunk the same way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In here! Don't take a sip!!!\" you scream out, but as the echo reverberates inside the canteen you realize that your cry is being buffeted by the insulation in the walls, designed to keep water or other liquids cool or hot depending on what temperature they were when they entered the canteen. Of course that means all the screaming in the world won't save you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man, looks like the top came undone,\" came the voice of the guy, and you suddenly feel the world move about violently as he shakes it about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still a bit of water left though. You want it?\" offers the guy, an you feel the world move about again as he probably hands out the canteen to the girl.</span></div></div>",
