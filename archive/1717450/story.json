Mike stopped running and turned around yelling, \"Come on, I don't want to miss the bus!\" \" I know, i been waiting so long to see this movie to, but man i'm just not as fast as a runner than you are you know that\" Jake Replied back.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few blocks down Jasmine walked out of a building a little sad and depressed after what seems to be a disappointing search, as she needed to return home that night, without finding the person she was hoping to find...  Without realizing she is now walking across the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, a Girl is about to get run over\" Jake yelled, and without thinking he bolted towards the girl pushing her out of the way, But unfortunately got hit by a car instead in the process.  <br>\r\nJasmine got up and turned around and found a boy lieing on the ground bleeding, and instinctivly she casted a small freeze time spell that froze time, the world around her is frozen in time as if they were statues..  and then she walked towards the boy speaking softly \" Could you be the person i was searching for?\" Then she looks up to the sky and summons her father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \" Yes, my child?\" Drake said.  Jasmine says\" Father, can you save this human, i think he is the person I was searching for\"   Drake looks at the boy lieing on the ground, then looks back at Jasmine and replies\" Are you sure that this is the person? if he turns out to be the wrong one it could be very devastating to any possible alliance with the humans, after all it was a bad choice that ended the last alliance that we had with humans..\"  Jasmine replies back \" Im sure father\"    Drake nods, and then moves towards the boy and casts a spell, a glow started to surround Jake and Jasmine...    Drake Said \" its now done, i have linked your spirit with this child's he will now live as long as you do and will allow him to heal the link will disipate when he reaches 17.. although you are still not mated with him yet, unfortunatly he is too young to take on this reponsibility yet, so i will lock this memory of the event in his mind...  and wipe any memory of this event from all humans involved in this incident, You must not approach him while this link is active ok?\"  Jasmine replied \" Yes father\"  Drake said \" dont worry though he will vaguely remember you, as in his memorys place i will fabricate a memory that you simply just bumped into each other and talked for a while\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrake towards Jake and now incants a few more words, and with that Jasmine and Drake disappears leaving Jake sitting on a bench located on the side of the road.. With Mike sitting beside him waiting for bus. Jake having no memory of what transpired except for meeting a girl that he enjoyed talking to.</span></div></div>",

He was hoping not to bump into him today... unfortunately he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell if it isn\u2019t that same loser I beat up yesterday!\u201d he says, then as he laughs, \u201cOr more like every day!\u201d Jake backs up, and says \u201cLook, don\u2019t you think we\u2019re a bit too old for this now? I mean, this has been going on for 7 years! And wouldn\u2019t you think it gets boring to just pick on the same person every day?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walks toward him, Ted simply explains, \u201cTrust me, I tried. But it seems that you\u2019re the only one who never fights back. And so it\u2019s fun to pick on you because of that.\u201d He lifts his fists up, \u201cNow, please have your stomach in good view so it\u2019s easier to do this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n That fact got to Jake. He realized that whenever he\u2019s in this situation, he never really tries to do anything to stop it. At this moment, he is now cornered at a wall. Ted raises his fist, \u201cTake this you pipsqueak!\u201d he says as he throws his fist towards him.<br>\r\nFor the first time in history, Jake actually dodges his attack, making him hit the wall. Ted realizes that he dodged his attack, and so he tried again. Jake barely dodged his second attack, making himself stumble afterwards. \u201cHey!\u201d says Ted, \u201cStay still so I can hit you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to hit him again, but he ducks, and attempts to take him down. Unfortunately, Ted is too big for him to do that. He kicks Jake off of him, making him fall to the ground. He rolls to evade Ted, and gets up to run. \u201cHey! Get back here!\u201d says Ted as he runs toward him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike finally finishes using the restroom. But when he comes out, neither Jake nor Ted is anywhere to be found. Meanwhile, Ted is still running after Jake\u2026 until someone certain saw them\u2026</span></div></div>",

Jake yelled\" hey mike why didnt you wake me up..\"  Mike replied\" Sorry Jake, i had to leave early i forgot something at my home that i needed to pick up.. \"  Mike then said\" You know Tammy is returning back to school today after 1 month being in the hospital?\"  jake replied\" oh<br>\r\ngreat now i have to deal with her teasing now too..\"   As Mike and Jake arrived at school, Jake looked around and already noticed Tammy on top of the stairs and seemed to be looking for someone. Jake didnt want to take any chances and decided to keep out of Tammy's view and managed to slip past her as he entered the school...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt lunch time Jake and Mike headed out to the hall way and got their lunches from their lockers... as they started towards the cafeteria Tammy appeared from around the corner right in front of Jake.. as Jake tried to avoid her Tammy grabbed Jakes arm and said\" Jake, we need to talk..\" Jake looked at Tammy as she looked at him with a sad look as if she done something wrong.  To Jakes knowledge Tammy never looked at him in this way ever, it was always a mean look, or laughing at him. But this look was definatly a first.  Jake replied\" Ok, what is it.\" Tammy looked at mike then looed back\" Can this be in private please...\" Jake looked at mike and then back at Tammy,\" Well Ok.\"  Tammy then looked at mike and said \"Don't worry about him, Im not planning on hurting him\" with that Tammy started to lead Jake to the chearleading office set up for the chearleaders to have their discussions and planning.   \"Jake, I feel I have something to get off my chest...  First off im sorry for the way I treated you ever since the beginning of high school.\" Tammy said while still heading down the hall, she then stopped at the door to the office. She then said\"Ever since my accident it left me alot of time to think about my life, and everytime i did i started to think about you..  I got to the point where i couldnt imagine my life without you in it.\" Jake looked at Tammy and replied\" What are you tring to say?\"  Tammy responed\" I think i am....\"  Before Tammy was able to finish a commotion started in the hall way..  As Jake and Tammy turned around in the direction it was coming from a girl came into view...  Jake had a look of surprise as Jake recognized the girl to be Jasmine, Jasmine was heading towards Jake, Tammy looking back at Jake asking\" Do you know her?\"  Before Jake was able to reply Jasmine grabbed Jake by the shoulders and kissed Jake on the lips...</span></div></div>",

Jake said \"She's my girlfriend\" then looked at Tammy and continued\" Can I have a monent alone with Jasmine?\"  Tammy reluctantly nodded and said \"Ok, ill continue this discussion later.\" Tammy then turned around and headed off to class.   \"Jasmine, i think it would be best not to let anyone here know we are to be mates.\" Jasmine looked at Jake and replied\" Ok, if you say so..\"  Jake said\" As far as they know you are my girlfriend and i am your boyfriend, I just dont think they would be ready to know what we really are to each other at least not yet.\" Jasmine and Jake started to head to the next class.. Jake asked\" I'm going to guess that you got yourself in the same classes i am taking?\"  Jasmine responded \"Yep, except for physed we are taking the same classes..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jake and Jasmine reached the door of the next class which was chemistry, Jake can already see mike was already there along with Tammy in the back corner which unfortunatly for mike was his assigned lab partner for the course.. Jake didnt have a lab partner so he knew that Jasmine would end up being his partner for the course.  Jake opened up the door and entered the classroom,  as he did everyone looked towards the door noticing the female from earlier following Jake into the room. She then handed a note to the teacher letting him know of her late addition to the class..  Mike noticed Tammys reaction to the girl.  Tammy was looking at her with suspicion.  In her mind she already determined that there was something fishy about her.. and how could Jake which was pretty much a loner up to this point suddenly have a girlfriend.  After all the teasing she done in the past made it next to impossible for him to get a girlfriend... and every time a girl started showing interest in him Tammy told the girl exactly what was needed to change her mind about him.. It was then that Tammy decided to herself that she will find exactly who this Jasmine is and try to get her separated from Jake so she can take Jake as her boyfriend.</span></div></div>",

Then went to her last class of the day.  Jake and Mike then went to get ready for phys ed.  Jake and mike was always the first 2 who entered the mens change room.  As Jake removed his shirt Mike noticed some patches of dragon scales on his back..  Mike said\"Woah,  you might want to get your shirt on fast, i doubt you want people to see that.\"  Jake looked at mike then looked at the mirror behind him, seeing the scales very visible.  But after a few seconds freaked out by the sight they seemed to vanish in good time too as other students started to enter the change room..  Jake and mike quickly finished changing and then went towards the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Johnston was already in the Gym waiting for everyone to be ready to start, .  As soon as everyone was in the Gym Mr, Johnston said\" Well class what we are going to do today will be playing a game of baseball, but not just any game of baseball, you will be playing against our last years championship team.\"  Mike sighed and said quietly to Jake\"Oh great looks like Mr, Johnston is looking to recruit for this years team\"   Jake was kinda excited though baseball was his favourite sport and he kinda does want to take a shot of making the team  but he knew personally he wasnt any good at it and most likely be laughed at for trying so he never did.<br>\r\nMr. Johnston then continued\" It will only be a 4 inning match and those who does well against the other team would be offered a chance to be a part of this years team, and i have invited Tammy and her chearleading squad to cheer you guys on\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the game started it was pretty much boring, the other team already scoring 3 runs in the first half of the inning, when it was your turn up to batin the last inning you noticed Jasmine now sitting in the stands at the back of the field.  Tammy was also looking at Jake.  The other cheerleaders were mocking him knowing full well he would strike out... especially now when it would end the game as it was the last out and bases loaded...  still behind by 3, it all depended on him...the pitcher made the first pitch,,  Strike 1 ,  the pitcher made the second pitch...  Strike 2..  Jasmine spoke to Jake telepathically \"Jake, just focus you can do it.\"  Jake nodded, as the pitcher made the 3rd pitch  everything around jake seemed to slow down, he didnt notice but his eyes has changed to be like a dragon, Jake began to swing the bat with more strength that he ever had and hit the ball hard to the outfield.. as soon as he finished swinging everything went back to normal as he now seeing everyone looking at where the ball is going..  and it was high...  the ball was hit with enough force that not only it went past the wall in the back of the field it was high enough to actually hit one of the light posts that was a few feet away from the back...Everyone was surprised even Tammy, for someone who was known not to be good in sports just won the game..  Which was a first,  as Mr. Johnston every year always arranges a game with the previous years championship team to play a game with his students.. and this was the first time the championship team lost..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Jake headed off back to the changeroom to get his normal clothes back on Mr. Johnston asked to see him in his office.  Mr. Johnston said\" Well after 10 years running this class I have never seen anything close to what you have done today.\"  Jake said\" I know\"  Mr. Johnston continuted\" Well im going to get to the point...  I want you to consider trying out for this years baseball team... if your perofrmance in todays game is any indication you will do very well in the team, infact ill write you in for the tryouts next weekend, dont worry if you dont want to just dont show up and i wont hold it against you.. \"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake said \"ive already decided.....\"</span></div></div>",

Jasmine and Mike both asked at the same time. \"What did Mr. Johnston want?\"  Jake replied\" he wants me to come to tryouts next weekend..\"  Mike said\" Thats great\" Jasmine agreed also, but jake couldnt help but notice a concerned look on her face.Jake asked Jasmine \"Whats wrong?\"  Jasmine replied\" Oh nothing, just be careful, you will find that you will be able to do stuff that you were not able to do before, and well quite frankly could give you an unfair advantage if you dont learn to control it.\"<br>\r\nAs Jasmine Mike and Jake walked by the edge of the forest Jasmine stopped and then said \"Here we are.\"  Jake and Mike turned around and Jake asked\" You mean this forest?\" Jasmine nodded yes and then Jake replied\" But this forest is haunted and cursed... anyone who enters there always ends up lost and then turns up 10 minutes later back where they started.  Jamine giggled and then said\" Thats because they dont know the correct path to walk to get to the other side let alone a clearing in the middle of it... as you see I have decided to teach both of you how to ride a dragon right now.  Mike asked \"why me?\" Jasmine looked at Mike anbd replied \"I have been in contact with the dragon council and they expressed interest into meeting you also.. \"  Then both Jake and Mike looked at each other then decided to follow Jasmine into the forest, who was showing them the correct way to go...<br>\r\nAs mike being the last to go into the forest Tammy walked up to the edge of the forest and decided to.....</span></div></div>",

Jasmine pointed towards the entrance and said \" There lies the portal into the dragons realm\" With that they see another human emerge from the cave entrance heading towards them...<br>\r\n\tTammy just arriving at the edge of the clearing watched in awe as she was looking at the statues.. which bared a striking resemblance to the images that was drawn in her fathers journal.  Tammy's father was a explorer, and had quite an interest in dragons, even though dragons were no longer around as they once were there was evidence of their existance found in remote areas of the world..  Tammy even had a interest in them... hell she even has some dragon plushies at home.  Tammy then looked down noticing where Jake, Mike and Jasmine was and also noticed a person heading towards them, she then quietly as poosible moved to the base of the statue that was closest to them without getting noticed...  <br>\r\n\t\"Mike, Id like to introduce you to Samara, She is my closest friend and she will serve as your dragon for as long as you wish\", Jasimine said, Mike responed \"My dragon?\" . Jasmine smiled then replied\"Yes, much like being mated dragons choose only one human to be allowed to ride them. by becoming a rider you will also be gifted with some abilities, you will gain a telepathic link to samara, and with training you will also be able to cast magic if you so wish\" Mike responded back\" But i wouldnt be mated with her right?\"  Jasmine replied back \"Yes, you would not be considered mated with her, well unless you wish to be, as you see just because you become her rider doesnt mean that option is closed to you.. if the time comes that you do wish to be mated with her all you have to do is ask. As you should know the only reason why a dragon would choose a human, especially one of the opposite sex is that they do have a interest in becoming your mate. And trust me, Samara isnt easy to impress alot of men approached her tried and failed.\" Mike noticed Samara was blushing a little.  Jake said\"Men, you have humans living with you in the dragon realm\"  Jasmine looked at Jake and Replied\"Yes, we do,  when we put ourselves into self imposed exile, some humans who believed in the alliance with the dragons chose to come with us. To this day there are still human colonies living in the dragon realm, but thats enough with that its time to get to what we are here to do, to teach you 2 how to ride a dragon...\" Jasmine and samara now distanced themselves from Jake and Mike and started to transform...  Tammy looked in awe of what became of Jasmine and samara which ended up with her .....</span></div></div>",

Mike and Jake looked at each other. then said \" But the barrier said not to enter.\"Jasmine replied\"Don't worry about that, it was fake really, as you see my family is sort of eccentric and prefers to keep their privacy, they bought the park and set a portion of the park where they can have their privacy. while keeping the remainder of the park open to the public\" After a short walk in a passage that was between to cliff faces it opened up to a yard with what seems to be a house built right into the cliff face at the other end of the yard..  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Jasmine looked at Jake \" I want to show you something, but whatever I show you don't be afraid ok?\"  Jasmine said...   Jake replied \"Ok\" Jamsine then looked at Mike and asked\" Ok? mike\"  Mike nodded.   With that Jasmine started to walk towards the center of the yard then turned back to face Jake and Mike.   Jasmine then started to transform into her dragon form.   Jake and mike looked at each other with shock then back at Jasmine who is now a huge red dragon looking back at them...   But at the same time they were not scared at all, shocked yes but for some reason they didnt feel that there were in danger in any way..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine then looked at Jake and said\" Jake, as you see I am a dragon, and as you should know your dreams you been having was a side effect of the link we shared for the past 7 years\"  Jake asked with a puzzled look \" A link?\"  Jasmine replied\" Yes, to be honest our chance encounter 7 years ago didnt happen as you remember it.\"  With that she uttered a few words causing Jake to remember everything that happened 7 years ago.    Jake now remembering everything said \" Wow, I suppose I owe you my life\"<br>\r\n\"Jake, ever since that day I fell in love with you, and the whole main reason for this meeting is that I want to ask you if you want to become my mate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake now looking at Jasmine surprised then replies......</span></div></div>",

Jasmine relpied \" It i to my knowledge that your parents is out of town for the next 2 weeks and you will be all alone for 2 weeks right?\"  Mike replied\" Yes\"  , Jasmine continued\" The favour I want to ask you is that I need you to take Jake's place for the next 2 weeks while Jake stays here with me to prepare for the mating.\"  Mike replied\" Sure, but how i don't look like him nor sound like him.\"  Jasmine replied \" Don't worry about that, I can cast a spell that will temporarily make you look and sound like Jake for 2 weeks..\"  Mike replied\" Ok , do it,  but I would like something in return later\"  Jasmine looked at Mike and said \"Of course there are many other honours a dragon can bestow on a human, but we can talk about that later\"  Jasmine now closed her eyes and uttered a few words that Jake or Mike cannot unerstand and then a cloud of smoke surrounded Mike then dissipated revealing Mike which now looks like Jake.  Jasmine said\" It is done now... but for now you must leave Mike, as this is now a private matter between me and Jake,\"  Jasmine gives Mike a jewel..  then says\" Come back here in 2 weeks with this jewel, this jewel will grant you passage back into this area.. ok\"  Mike nods then heads back the way he came..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine now motions Jake to take her hand as she now heads to enter the house.... and then takes him to her room.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine then said\"  First in order for a human to mate with a dragon you must first become a dragon, keep in mind even though you can change your mind about mating with me once you become a dragon you will always be a dragon.. what is one cannot be undone, Are you sure you want to do this?\"   Jake looked at Jasmine and said\" I'm sure\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine smiled and then decides to .....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nchoice 1:   \"Thank\" Jake for his brave act 7 years ago before taking him through the process to turn him into a dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nchoice 2: Takes him directly to a huge room big enough for a dragon in order to turn him into a dragon</span></div></div>",

And always teased about the strange dreams he has.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Mike</b></u>: Jake's only friend age 18 , often saves him from being beat up by the bullies, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Jasmine</b></u> A female Red Dragon princess, very kind, Stong believer in a prophecy that fortells a new alliance between humans and dragons, and believes she will be the one to find the human... and as with all dragons  she can take a human form <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>Ted</u></b>  A school bully who always picks on Jake<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>Tammy</u></b>  The schools head cheerleader, always picked on Jake, however due to a accident that nearly ended her life she realized that she has feelings for Jake, and is determined to make Jake her Boyfriend regardless of how futile it may be<br>\r\n<u><i><b>Rules:</b></i></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.  No killing of main characters(although can be brought close to death), new characters can be introduced and killed off as necessary<br>\r\n2. No One line chapters, Each chapter must at least contain a paragraph, I will permit a chapter merely for giving more choices provided you choose 1 of the choices yourself.. <br>\r\n3. When the time comes for the mating it can be either willing or unwilling but if its unwilling it must be done in effort to save the persons life.. the process either willing or unwilling will end up giving josh the ability to transform into a dragon form at will<br>\r\n4. Mike can either know about jake's new role in the world or be unaware of it..<br>\r\n5. Story progression must be logical, for example, if a character at the end of the chapter decided to take a ride on a bus home, the next chapter should reflect that he was on the bus, <br>\r\n6. and have fun :)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI should also note that for the sake of the story the mating wont happen till after  a couple chapters,  and the first chapter will be in the past<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI will randomly reward 150 points for good additions...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</td>",
