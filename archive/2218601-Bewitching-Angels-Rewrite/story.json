It wouldn't be so bad if if weren't for the fact that you\u2014dressed in tattered and now soaked clothing\u2014were being forcefully escorted to the castle by a pair of unfriendly-looking soldiers. Trying to strike up any small talk was meet with threats of violence so much of the long trip to your destination was silent. When you had finally arrived at the castle gates you were met by door guards, and after a few words exchanged between the men the guards slowly pulled the grand doors open for you and the two soldiers.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The entire way in you had caught more than a few steely glares from the many knights and domestic servants who you assume just happened to be there; unwarranted as it was, you did nothing to upset the others and held your head with some semblance of dignity. That was met with a near-immediate reaction when one of the soldiers clapped you upside your head, warning against looking so proud for a wretch. It wasn't too much longer until you found yourself standing before the throne itself, and even more than that was that the Queen and Princess themselves were sitting in their seats. The King himself was strangely absent, leaving his throne to the right of the Princess empty, but you didn't get much time to ruminate on it before the soldiers harshly shoved you forward onto your face. You'd have cursed them for their being inhospitably but restrained yourself in the presence of the young Princess and her Queen. Slowly you tried to stand before the two royals before one of the soldiers barked at you to remain kneeling before their highnesses, and so on your knees you remained, waiting for one of the two to speak first and avoid any further abuse.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You are certain that he is the one,\" the Queen had asked of the soldiers.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Just so Your Highness,\" one of them replied. \"We had found this wretch collapsed in a tavern alleyway, stewing in a puddle of his own gruel.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Fortunately the rain washed away most of it by the time we found him,\" the other soldier quipped. \"Our apologies for bringing him to you in such an unsightly display.\" The Queen nodded and turned her attention back to you.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I assume that you have no inkling as to why you have been brought here before us,\" the matriarch asked you. You responded in kind, having no clue as to what was even going on. \"Very well then, I shall state it plain: my daughter here wishes for you to attend Saint Adelaide's K Through Eight Royal Academy.\" Your eyes couldn't have possibly been wider, though you're sure you couldn't be any more surprised than the soldiers who had brought you to the Queen and Princess. To confirm if this wasn't some sort of jest, you asked the Queen if she truly meant that; though her eyes narrowed she did so in a way that looked like she saw your doubt coming. \"I mean every word of it. Of course, I must stress that your position at the academy is to serve as the groundskeeper; the academy is in dire need of one, and according to what my daughter has spoke of you that makes you more than qualified for the position.\" You spared a confused glance at the young Princess who was simply beaming at you with her radiant smile.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh how true that is,\" the girl exclaimed. \"The way you tended to that graveyard I happened upon was nothing short of immaculate if I must say so myself. I can only imagine how well you will tend to the academy grounds!\" The way the Princess's eyes lit up and stood out even among the lights in the throne room was awe inspiring to say nothing of her smile. The glowing praise she heaped on you did soothe your nerves somewhat but you were still unsure about all of this\u2014you were effectively a nobody, and surely there had to be someone more qualified than you at tending to the garden. You voiced these concerns to the Queen, careful not to put down the Princess's praise of you and disrespect her, earning an almost exasperated sigh.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Personally, I must agree with you,\" the Queen coolly said. \"If I may be so blunt, had it not been for my daughter here insisting that you be appointed as groundskeeper you would not even be here standing before us. So, considering that, you ought be very grateful that you were selected by my daughter to serve the royal academy.\" It was supposed to be a high honor sure but a part of you felt like the Queen and Princess were leaving some important details out, like what even was the academy to begin with. Regardless, the Queen made it clear that you were to accept this position with grace, and with a respectful bow you thanked the royals for extending their generosity to a wretch like you. \"That is a most good thing to hear. Know that both my daughter and I have high expectations of you.\" Once you were certain that the Queen was finished speaking, you asked her forgiveness for speaking out of turn before you raised your question: you had no idea how to get to the academy\u2014you were a vagabond who had nothing to your name and thus you had no idea how to get to the academy. You hoped that someone would be kind enough to give you directions, and just when it looked like the Queen would open her mouth the Princess had already spoken up.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"It is not far from here,\" the princess answered. \"When you leave the castle but not before you leave the castle town gates, the royal academy will be just a few blocks down to the east, and there you will encounter the Saint Adelaide's K Through Eight Royal Academy. Classes do not begin until the next week, so it would be a boon to you if you familiarized yourself with the academy's layout. If you have any trouble with the staff members regarding your unique situation, I am certain that the guardsmen will happily plead your case as a direct request from me and my mother.\" The Princess seemed so pure in her desire to have you as the academy's groundskeeper and so determined to make it happen\u2014perhaps <i>too</i> <i>much </i>so for the Queen's liking as evidenced by her resigned grimace.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"If my daughter wills it, so shall it be,\" the Queen sighed. \"I trust that you will perform to the best of your ability so as to not disappoint us both or give us reason to regret this act of charity.\" You responded that you were ever grateful for the second chance at life and that you would forever be indebted to the Queen and the Princess for this kindness you were done. You didn't mean for it to sound so pitiful but your circumstances prior were that pitiful and kissing up to them seemed to be for the best in the meantime. \"Now that we have established your new purpose, our business with you has concluded for the day. If you make haste, you should be able to make it to the academy before it closes its gates for the day and explain your circumstances to the staff. If they do not believe you then you are to return to us and we will assist you. Are there any more concerns you wish to voice before you are dismissed?\" You wanted to raise the question of where you would be staying to accommodate your new position but kept quiet, telling the Queen that you had no further concerns. \"Then I bid you a fare rest of the evening. Gentlemen, please escort our academy's new groundskeeper outside of the castle with no issue. I trust that he should require no further assistance to reach the academy from there.\" The two soldiers obediently took you by your arms and were leading you outside of the throne room until the Princess called out to you one last time.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I look forward to seeing how well you tend to the academy. Fare thee well until then.\" Despite yourself, you smiled and nodded at the Princess's words; it would be nice to spend more time with someone as kind as her. With that all out of the way, the soldiers led you through the many halls you passed through before, and even with the earlier warning against looking proud for yourself you kept your head up high, thanking whatever powers that be for giving you another shot. Soon you found yourself shoved roughly outside of the castle doors and back into the frigid rain, but you were in a good mood so you didn't feel the need to curse at the soldiers; for now, all that mattered was that you found this academy and that hopefully they were still open. Remembering the Princess's directions, you made your way out through the castle gates and headed eastward. A few blocks down the Princess said, and soon you'd find yourself before the gates of St. Adelaide's K\u20138 Royal Academy.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Before you started worrying about if you took a wrong turn somewhere, you could see the building coming up in sight, but much to your general misfortune the front gates had been locked closed. You didn't think that there'd be anyone who would have any sort of reason to be here during this weather, and you weren't really ready to jeopardize your standing with the Queen or Princess by trying to sneak inside the academy some other way. You needed a safe place to stay for the night, that much was certain, so your best bet was to find somewhere nearby to rest up until tomorrow. In the middle of your thoughts and with the rain continuing to pour down on you (but you were already thoroughly soaked as it was), you almost didn't notice that something was tugging on your rags before a voice called out to you.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Excuse me, mister?\" At the sound of the voice you turned in the direction you'd heard it, and before you was a lone girl who looked no older than ten years of age, wearing thick winter clothes under a wide umbrella. You didn't know why, but looking into the girl's shining eyes captivated you in a way you didn't understand\u2014right there you knew that the girl had something special about her\u2026<br>\r\n</div></span></font></span></span></div></div>",

Despite the general mistrust of the institution's staffing and the lowly position you were offered, you took this second chance at life without a second thought. There you acquaintance yourself with all kinds of girls going about their daily lives, and if you kept up the good work as a model groundskeeper then you would surely enjoy your time there. However, strange events begin to happen in your fair kingdom, and they all seem to revolve around a handful of the girls and woman at the academy. Soon you'll learn that there is far more to both the students and staff members than meets the eye\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelow are the general set of rules and, fair warning, they may be strict:<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0If you start a route, be sure to leave at least one empty slot for another person to start their own routes\u2014mark your routes that you do not wish to be disturbed as \"reserved\", especially if you can add up to three or more extra routes, and respect others' \"reserved\" routes by not hijacking them. However, if you have a \"reserved\" route and it has not been worked on for at least a month or two (or I suspect that you have been inactive for that long a period), I will free it up to the best of my ability for others to use it.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0If you are going to end a route, please do so on a route you \"reserved\" for yourself and not on others were there is no such \"reservation\". I myself will write a \"main\" route of sorts, and as such they will be \"reserved\" to some degree.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0While I will not disallow any sort of sexual fetish, <span class=\"clred\">I will <b>not</b> tolerate out-and-out rape made out to be \"enjoyable\" for the victim in any fashion (disregarding any physical stimulus that naturally comes with the territory); if I see such writing <b>it will be trashed immediately</b></span>. Rape fantasy thus should be written <i>very carefully</i> to make sure that it is <i>entirely consensual</i> on <b>both</b> parties' ends.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0While not a \"rule\" per se, please take care to write with proper grammar, though I understand that sometimes it can be difficult especially if you do not speak English or some other language you're writing in as your first language.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Another thing is that while this isn't an outright rule it should still be considered; I enjoy stories with heart put into them; even if it is just about the groundskeeper \"conquering\" all the girls in the kingdom I would like to encourage all of you to put some care into it to make it enjoyable to read. Short entries will be allowed on a case-by-case basis; chapters should be at least five sentences long if you are writing short sentences, and chapters with very low amounts of sentences should be written out extensively.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Since this is an interactive story from the reader's perspective it would be expected that most entries and choices are written from the reader/writer's point of view and what actions they will take next; the groundskeeper will be male by default but changing his sex and/or gender is still perfectly acceptable for those who do not identify with a cisgendered male protagonist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdditionally, I will add gift points for entries that I find satisfactory for as long as I have gift points. The rules may change and be adjusted to entries added here and there but that should be about it for now\u2014I bid you all a well writing experience.<br>\r\n</div></div></span></font></span></td>",
