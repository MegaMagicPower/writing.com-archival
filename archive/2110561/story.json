            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Buchanans were getting ready to set out for the day.  The weather outside was absolutely beautiful and the rain had finally stopped falling from the sky.  \"So does anyone have any suggestions on where we should go today?\"  Richard asked as he started to gather the needed items for them to leave the house for the day.  His keys and wallet were the main things that he needed, but also grabbed his cell phone just in case somebody from the office needed something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis son, Jason, was finishing up his breakfast of pancakes and juice.  After stuffing the final remnants of the breakfast in his mouth he turned to his father and with a mouth full of food he said.  \"You know what, we could always go hiking today.\"  He continued to chew his food as he looked around the table to his siblings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or you can finish up your chewing before you answer.\"  Sarah answered back as she continued to text her friends about her busy social scene.  Being a sophomore in college, she was always trying to do her best to balance a decent social life with her academic studies.  Majoring in education, Sarah was hoping to, at least one day, teaching history and social studies to middle-schoolers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Jason.\"  Julia agreed as she tried to shield her own plate from any flying projectiles coming from Jason's mouth.  \"I'm trying to eat too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason swallowed the contents of his mouth and looked at his sisters.  \"Sorry, I was just trying to give a suggestion on where we can go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah sighed as she locked her phone and replied to her father's earlier question.  \"Well Dad, we could go to that shopping center on highway 64.  Richard tried to remember what she was talking about.  A couple weeks earlier when they were going to one of Julia's basketball games, the family saw a shopping center that seemed to be really busy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, honey.\"  Emily agreed as she put her arm around her husband and embracing him.  \"It's only a half an hour away and it will be a great drive.\"  She motioned to the cloudless sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you're right.\"  Richard agreed as he looked around the table to his family.  \"Well what do you guys think?\"  Jason really had his mind set on hiking and really didn't want to do any shopping, but Julia seemed interested.  \"Well, finish up, go change, and we can go.\"  The girls talked excitedly as they brought their plates to the sink and made their way to the door.  Richard put his hand on his son's shoulder. \"We can go hiking next weekend.  I mean, it's supposed to be nice next weekend too.  Hmm?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess...\"  Jason replied back to him as he got up to clear his plate from the table too.  \"But can stop somewhere for lunch today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When are you not thinking about food?\"  He answered back as he tussled his son's hair.  Jason, groaning is displeasure, haphazardly fixed his hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf an hour later, everybody was ready to go and they started to pile into the SUV.  Richard wore his usual khaki pants, a light blue polo, and on his feet he wore his usual grey trainers.  Emily was next in the SUV with her light yellow sundress with black flats.  Sarah decided to take it easy and wore her purple university tank top, pink short shorts, with pink flip flops on her feet.  Jason sat in the back seat with his favorite black Call of Duty T-shirt, blue jeans, and black trainers.  Julia climbed in last, but decided to follow Sarah's example and wore a simple white blouse, jean shorts, with light brown converse sneakers.  Richard turned on the vehicle and turned to look at everyone in the back.  \"Did everyone grab their allowances so that you all won't bother us for any money?\"  Richard asked as he looked in the rear view mirror to see everyone nodding their heads.  He then turned his attention over to his, who was busy looking at something on her phone.  \"Do you know what time they open?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis wife turned her hazel eyes to her husband and replied back to him.  \"I was just checking that.\"  She chuckled as she looked back over at her phone.  \"Hmm...  That's odd.  I can't find anything on the internet about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That certainly is odd.\"  He agreed.  \"I hope they didn't close down.  So let's go by and check it out.\"  Everyone let him know of their agreence.  \"Well there we go.\"  He chuckled as he put the SUV into reverse and backed out of the driveway.  Richard turned the radio station to the 'oldies' station to help relive his childhood in Cincinnati.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad, can you change it into something more upbeat?\"  Sarah wondered as she started to look for her earbuds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweety, why don't you just put in your ear buds and listen to the music you want to.\"  Emily asked as she giggled at the way her husband acted when he heard his favorite songs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is going to be the longest 20 minutes of my life.\"  Sarah complained as she finally found her earbuds and put them into her ears to listen to some 'good' music.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trip was over in a matter of no time and the kids were eager to get out of the SUV.  Emily got out too and stretched to her full extent.  \"That wasn't too bad was it?\"  She asked her kids who were getting out of the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason got out and looked around.  \"It looks like it closed down.\"  He stated as he noticed the lack of cars in the parking lot.  \"Are you sure they're still open?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard walked up to the main store and cups his hands over his eyes to peer inside the window.  \"It looks closed, but...\"  He walked closer to the door and gave it a yank and found it quite easy to open.  \"But the door is open.\"  As he opened the door wider a distinct chime rang out to announce the presence of visitors entering the dusty shelves of merchandise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome!\"  A gravely voice called out to them as they filed in one by one through the door.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe family looked in the direction of the gravely voice and waved their hands at the old man who seemed to be having an intensive conversation with a mouse sitting on the desk.  \"Err... Hello.\"  Emily replied as she tried not to pay too much attention to the conversation the two of them were having.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man looked up from his conversation and pointed around the store.  \"You're free to roam the store, just don't read anything out loud or it could be life changing.\"  The old man cackled and the mouse that was sitting on the counter seemed to be letting out rhythmic squeaks to.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'If I didn't know better, I would say that mouse is laughing too</i>.'  Emily thought to herself, thinking it odd with such behavior.  \"Now kids.\"  She said out loud as she looked over to see all three of them going off in different directions.  \"Don't go too far and if you make a mess, I will make you clean it up.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok.\"  All three answered back to her, since they knew that she indeed meant it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho should we follow?</span></div></div>",

You're on vacation!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard groaned as he locked his phone and put it back into his pocket.  \"I was just checking a message.\"  He replied back to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just want one week where you're not having to check your phone.\"  She said as she turned to her husband with her eyes starting to tear up slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Em.\"  Richard replied as he embraced his wife but was soon interrupted by a voice from behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat greater thing is there for two human souls, than to feel that they are joined for life\u2013to strength each other in all labor, to rest on each other in all sorrow, to minister to each other in silent unspeakable memories at the moment of the last parting?\u201d  A woman's voice replied to them.  Both Emily and Ricard turned their heads to see a young woman around the age of 25 and looked a lot like Richard's young intern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You nearly gave us a fright.\"  Emily replied.  \"Do you work here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jennifer?\"  Richard asked.  \"Aren't you supposed to be at work working on the Taylor account?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark eyes of the young woman seemed to entrance the both of them.  \"Oh is that who you see me as and yes, you can say that.\"  She replied dreamily.  \"I see that you're having a little trouble with your marriage.  The love is still there, but the trust is waning away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How dare you.\"  Ricard declared as he started to put his wife behind him, as if to protect her from an unknown force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right.\"  Emily answered back to her.  \"I don't know how you know, but do you know of a way to help us fix it?  We're doing therapy, but I really don't think that's working.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you asked!\"  The young woman announced with great pleasure.  \"If you follow me over to the counter, I think I have a couple of things that might help your marriage.\"  She happily skipped to the end of the aisle and waited for the two of them to meet her at the glass counter.  Emily eagerly followed the young woman and dragged Richard behind her who was still trying to figure out why the young woman looked like his office intern.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you have something that can help us?\"  Emily asked as she eagerly hoped for a cheaper and more efficient fix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That I do.\"  The young woman replied with a grin on her face.  \"First I give you the fabled Medallion of Zulo.\"  She put a coppery medallion on the counter, but for safe keeping, she had it in a plastic bag.  \"With this, you will be able to literally walk in another person's shoes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does it work?\"  Richard asked as he carefully prodded the medallion with his finger as if it was an eerie biology experiment waiting to be dissected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really can't tell you that until you purchase the item.\"  The young woman answered.  \"We have to protect our ideas, after all.\"  Her eyes sparkled slightly as she looked at the two of them.  \"Hmm...  Let's see what else we have here.\"  She pulled out a brown card board box with no letters or words written on it and like everything else around it, had dust all over it.  \"Inside this box you will always find new games that will certainly help put a spin on your marriage.  Plus there will always be a family appropriate game too, you know, for the kids\"  She then pointed over to the left wall and they found a large, antique mirror.  \"That is the mirror of Guinevere.  You see it's said that this mirror was made by Merlin himself and given to Guinevere on her wedding day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And let me guess, you won't tell us what it does until we buy it?\"  Richard asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be correct.\"  The young woman replied once more with a smile.  \"And the last thing I will have to show you is this pair of rings.\"  She held up another bag with 2 rings, one silver and the other gold.  \"I will tell you about this one though.\"  She said with a wink of her eye.  \"These are the rings of Ali Shar.  You see Ali Shar was once a rich and powerful Caliph in olden Arabia.  One ring will the Master and the other will be the Subordinate.  The Master will be able to change the Subordinate, within reason of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hardly believe that.\"  Richard scoffed as chuckled at the thought of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do you have an idea of what you would like to buy?\"  The young woman asked as she put the last bag down and waited patiently for an answer.</span></div></div>",

As they were looking over the items, the young woman heard a vibration and a muted ring tone.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily's face grew redder with frustration as she looked at her husband and sighed.  \"Go ahead and answer it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\"  He asked before he hurriedly ran outside to take the call to make sure that nobody lost any important accounts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young woman seeing the frustration on Emily's face, turned to look at her.  \"You know, while he's gone.\"  She motioned down towards the counter.  \"You should go ahead and pick.\"  Looking down, she picked up the bag containing the necklace.  \"May I suggest the Medallion of Zulo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily frustrated face soon calmed down by this suggestion.  \"Why would you suggest that?\"  She asked as she started to reach for it, but found that path blocked by the young woman, who had her hand on the bag and pulled it just out of reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the Medallion of Zulo will transform the person into the last person wearing a piece of clothing.\"  She exclaimed as she looked over to Emily and noticed that she had a perplexed look on her face.  \"Silly me.  I will explain it a little better.  You see if you want to change into let's say your husband, all you will have to do it put on the medallion and touch it to a piece of his clothing.  After touching, you will feel a small spark.\"  She continued to explain the secrets of the medallion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So here's the real question.\"  Emily asked as she feared the answer.  \"How much?\"  She brought her gaze over to the young girl's face and saw a slight twinkle coming from her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you're certainly in luck.\"  She replied with a huge smile.  \"We're having a special today and that will only be $45.09.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's an odd amount.\"  Emily replied as she began to dig through her purse and noticed that's the exact amount that she had in cash.  She got it all out and handed it over to the young woman who gladly gave her the medallion and a quick guide how the medallion wored.  As she put it into her purse, Emily had several ideas on how she was going to use it on both her husband and her kids.</span></div></div>",

As Richard drove through the countryside, Emily thought about what she would be able to do with her newest purchase.  Looking over at her husband, she couldn't forget how he stiffed her and left her alone in the store to answer the phone.  <i>'All he wanted to do is talk to that bitch of an assistant that he has.'</i>  She fumed as she thought back to the store.  She, however was brought out of her thoughts by her kids arguing behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jason will you stop touching me?\"  Sarah complained as she glared at her brother how wasn't really doing anything, but playing on his PS Vita.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not touching you.\"  Jason quickly responded as he glared back at her.  Emily looked at her son and noticed that his head seemed to move rhythmically.  Turning around and looking at his little sister, Jason also complained.  \"Julia stop kicking my seat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout skipping a beat, Julia glared back at him.  \"Well, stop humming while you play your game.\"  Jason always had a habit of getting too engrossed into his game and had a tendency to hum the music as he played.  While he had his own room, the family always had to tell him to stop humming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry that I have something to do.\"  He replied back to her.  \"You're just jealous that you didn't bring anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough.\"  Like a lion roaring, Richard yelled from the driver's seat.  The 3 teenagers instantly calmed down and returned to what they were doing.  He then turned to his wife.  \"You know I hate being the bad guy, why didn't you say anything to them?\"  Emily always had to watch the kids, play with them when they were younger, and cook for them every day.  Richard always came home and started to watch sports after eating his supper.  Just then, she had an idea on how to use the medallion and hopefully it will help put a new perspective on the family's life.  She decided to use the medallion to ________.</span></div></div>",

All the kids had something to do, whether it was Jason playing his favorite video game or Sarah and Julia listening to their favorite music on their phones.  So it was appropriate to say that it was quiet on the way back to their home.  Richard looked over at his wife, who seemed to be entranced by an item in a plastic bag.  Richard, while keeping an eye on the road, looked over at what his wife was seemingly entranced by and noticed that it was a metallic disc.  \"What's that?\"  Richard asked as he gestured toward the object in his wife's hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chuckled when he saw his wife shake her head slightly to bring herself back to the real world.  \"Huh?\"  Emily asked seemingly bewildered by the question.  Richard pointed back down to the medallion.  \"Oh, it's what I got at the shop back there.  The lady that I bought it from said that it would change our lives.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis seemed to surprise Richard, not that the claim that it would change their lives, but the fact that somebody was there to help her.  \"Sorry that I had to take a call from the office.  I'm fully on vacation now, the account is now done and closed.\"  He couldn't help but smile as he watched his wife's eyes grow bigger with excitement.  This would be the first time in several years that he was able to take a vacation.  \"So what does that thing do exactly?\"  He wondered as he came to a stop at a red light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From what she said, it can change a person based on the clothes they touch it to.\"  She explained with great exhilaration and seemed to be ready to try it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So if you were to touch it to, let's say, your cheerleading uniform.\"  He asked thinking about the cheerleader outfit that she wore when they were both in college together.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I would look like I was in college again.\"  She replied with a great smile on her face.  \"But I will have to stay that way for 12 hours at least, if I remember correctly.\"</span></div></div>",

Julia instantly sat back in her seat, Jason turned his game system to sleep and looked out the window to make it seem that nothing was going on, and Sarah turned off her phone from texting with her boyfriend, Peter.  She finally made up her decision on how to teach her entire family a lesson on how to respect each other.  \"When we get home we're going to have a family meeting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard, not wanting to piss off his wife much more, didn't say a word and kept driving.  As they grew nearer to their home, he heard his phone going off once more.  Reaching down to pick it up and answer it, he soon realized that he was a little too slow and his wife had already reached down and grabbed it before he was able to.  \"What...\"  He asked as he looked over at his wife who turned his phone off and threw it into her purse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already told you.\"  Emily griped as her red, irritated face look back at him, almost as if to say,  '<i>Go ahead and mess with me, I dare you</i>.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichard sighed, as he knew when his wife was in one of her moods, not to add any more fuel to the fire.  Plus he knew he could always call them back to see what the problem was.  \"Yes dear.\"  He muttered as they pulled into the driveway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe family filed into the living room and sat down on the furniture and waited for their Mom to come in.  \"What do you think we will have to do?\"  Julia wondered over to her brother as she remembered the last time, where they were grounded for a week and had to clean the house from the basement to the attic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah, pulling out her phone and started to text to her boyfriend, looked as if nothing was the matter replied.  \"I don't really care, I have to leave in a couple days anyhow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For what?\"  Jason asked as he thought it was unfair that she got to leave early even if they had to spend time at home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I promised Kim that I would go shopping for school with her.\"  Sarah answered, not putting her phone down once.  Even though school didn't really start back for another month, Sarah wanted to get a jump on the crowds and go shopping for the needed supplies.  The three of them heard the front door close and turned to see their parent's walking in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that will have to wait.\"  Emily stated as she and Richard sat down on the love seat near the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"  Sarah wondered as she put her phone down on the couch, trying to get a straight answer from her parents.  \"We've been planning this for the past month.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but I feel that we, as a family, have grown apart over the years and need a reminder of how to treat each other.\"  Emily told the family as they were growing more annoyed with everything.  \"So, we will draw names from this bag and will use this medallion to take that person's place for the weekend.\"  She held up the odd looking metal medallion, still sealed in its plastic bag and the bag that they used for designating their weekly chores.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia chuckled as she looked around at the perplexed family.  \"So if Jason draws my name, then he will have to wear my clothes and be me?\"  She nudged her brother to emphasize the fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yes and no.  From what I read, you will have to use this medallion and touch it to the clothes.\"  She instructed.  \"Then the magic from the medallion will do its work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey.\"  Richard replied as he brought his hand over to cup hers.  \"Are you feeling okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily looked over at her husband and smiled.  \"I've never felt better, honestly.\"  She held out the bag to her husband.  \"Now I will give you the first chance to pick.\"  Richard dug down deep to reach down into the bag to, at least humor his wife, and pick a name out of it.  He felt a crumpled piece of paper and grabbed it to pull it out.  Looking at it, he chuckled as he gave it to his wife to show her the name that he drew out.  As she looked at the piece of paper, Emily couldn't help but chuckle.  \"Awe you get to be me.\"  She replied as she showed the crumpled piece of paper to the others.  \"Now, since I already have the bag right here, I think I'll go ahead and draw too.\"  She reached down into the bag and felt around the brim, where she stuck a piece earlier.  \"And, I got.\"  She announced as she pulled out the name of her husband.  \"It looks like we'll get to know what it's like to be each other.\"</span></div></div>",

Richard, not surprisingly, had to go back to the office to help Jennifer with the Taylor account.  Emily and the kids decided to take it easy that night and not have to worry about going out anywhere or doing anything.  \"Mom have you seen my soccer uniform?\"  Julia asked as she stuck her head out her bedroom door.  \"I've looked everywhere and can't find it.\"  Emily was walking down the hallway when she heard this and  looked inside Julia's room and noticed that it looked much like a tornado passed through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jules.\"  Emily replied with an exasperated look on her face.  \"I need you to pick this room up before you go to bed tonight or you will be grounded for a month.\"  She turned to look at her daughter.  \"Do I make myself clear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia looked at her Mom with look of defeat.  \"Yes, Ma'am.  Have you seen it or do you know where it's at?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily sighed.  \"Have you checked the car?\"  Julia shook her head.  \"Well then I suggest you get the keys out of my purse and check the trunk.\"  Emily went back to work putting clothes away and not realizing that she forgot to take out the medallion from her purse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia hummed a song that she was listening to earlier in her room and found her Mom's purse sitting on the kitchen counter, where she left it earlier.  As she was looking for the car keys, Julia found an odd looking necklace in a plastic bag.  \"What's this?\"  She whispered to herself as picked up the bag to get a closer look at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey squirt.\"  Jason said as he ruffled his sister's hair, much to her chagrin.  \"Hope you have fun cleaning your room.\"  He went over to the refrigerator to get a much deserved soda.  \"I just got mine done and now I'm going to go play Call of Duty.\"  He chuckled at his sister's misfortune as he left the kitchen to go back up to his room to start his little video game beat-down on some unsuspecting noobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really hate it when he does that.\"  Julia said as she tried to fix her hair.  Even though she classified herself as a tomboy, she still liked to keep herself looking decent.  She kept her hair longer so that her Mom wouldn't care too much on what she did, but still like to play in the sports that the school offered.  She sighed as she looked closer at the medallion and noticed a note near the bag and opened it.  Her eyes grew bigger as she read the note and what the necklace allegedly did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reread the note to make sure she knew what was going on, but soon had her attention interrupted by her Mom calling down to her.  \"Jules, were you able to find your uniform?\"  Julia quickly put the medallion under her shirt to hide it from view and grabbed the keys from her Mom's purse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet, I'm about to go outside to check on it.\"  She called back to her as she went out to the car to check the trunk of the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack upstairs, Emily got a message from Sarah who was visiting a friend of hers and needed a ride back home.  Even though she was old enough to drive, her parents didn't trust her with driving any of the cars.  She picked up the phone to text her telling her that she was on her way when she heard the front door close.  \"Jules, I'm going to go get Sarah.\"  She called down to her other daughter.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, can I stay here?\"  She asked as she walked up the stairs carrying her sport's bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't really see the harm in it.\"  Emily replied back to her as she walked by the messy room.  \"But I want this room at least half way picked up by the time I get back.\"  She scolded as she waved good bye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia chuckled slightly as she opened up her bag and pulled out the medallion.</span></div></div>",

Being the weekend, their parents really didn't mind them staying up until midnight and she had to wait awhile.  She looked over at her phone and noticed that it was almost time.  She smiled evilly and waited for her chance.  With her door open, Julia watched with great anticipation for Jason to walk past her room to his room.  \"Night Jason.\"  She called out to him, trying to act like nothing is out of the ordinary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason leaned his head back into her room.  \"Night squirt.\"  He replied as he chuckled to himself about his little joke and went to his room and closed the door.  Julia, with her room right next to his, waited for the noise drowning fan to get turned on before she got everything ready.  Almost as if on queue, she heard the faint drone of the box fan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent.\"  She whispered to herself as she reached for the medallion, which was still in the plastic bag, and a bundle of clothing.  After waiting for another 10 minutes, Julia was ready to go.  She cautiously snuck out of her room and next door to her brother's.  Quietly opening the door.  Julia heard the rhythmic breathing coming from her brother's bed and knew that he was asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking her way over to the bed, Julia certainly had to step over several things, a game remote and a couple books.  \"I thought he cleaned up.\"  She whispered to herself, knowing that he wouldn't hear her over the constant drone of the box fan.  With her plan in mind, Julia opened the bag and turned it inside out to keep herself from being transformed by the medallion.  She then got the small bundle of clothing that she brought with her and made her way over to her brother.  Laying the medallion on his shirtless body, Julia then touched the small bundle of clothing to it.  As it lay on him, the small bundle of clothing, unbundled itself showing that it had her bra and panties.  She watched in wonder as her brother's usually manly chest started to puff up slightly until it resembled her chest.  Waiting for another 5 minutes, Julia took the clothing and the medallion off of her brother's body and made her way back to her room.  She could only imagine her brother having lost his manhood, waking up the next morning in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's going to be a great morning.\"  She chuckled to herself as she hid the medallion and went back to bed.</span></div></div>",

He'd obviously discovered the 'gifts' she'd left him with last night, duplicates of her pre-pubescent female chest and vagina. She pulled on most of her clothing and then ran to her brother's room, barging in. \"What the hell Jason, what's wrong?\" She asked, feigning ignorance and wiping some of the sleep from her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason immediately coiled back onto his bed, grabbing the bed sheets to cover up his shirtless body. \"Shit, get out of here, there's not-- nothing wrong, just... leave me alone.\" Jason said, clearly in a hysterical condition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't just scream for no reason, what's happened?\" Julia pressed her brother. \"I'm surprised nobody else heard you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason peered down at himself under the sheets, the small, puffy feminine nipples on his slightly inflated chest was NOT normal for a boy his age, especially considering only yesterday he had been normal. But that wasn't the worst thing bothering him, his dick was GONE. And he had what looked like a fairly young pussy in its place. \"I've.... I've changed, somehow, I don't know... fuck!\" He grumbled, grimacing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Changed how?\" Julia inquired, folding her arms and arching an eyebrow in her brother's direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason seemed too embarrassed to tell his little sister what was wrong. But eventually he swallowed his 'manly' pride and told her. \"My dick isn't there, its gone and I've got a-- I've got a vagina.\" He said, using the proper word this time since he was addressing his little sis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What???\" Julia frowned, keeping up her act<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And these,\" Jason mumbled, letting the sheet drop and exposing his AA-cup breasts, that were really nothing more but nubs, \"these aren't mine, this is a girl's chest I'm sure.\" Jason continued, prodding himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie just stood there for a moment, then she...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As she grew closer, Jason brought his only form of protection closer to his chest effectively covering it once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't touch them, they feel weird.\"  Jason complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well of course they feel weird.'

It looks a little girly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I am a girl and it will help you hide them a little better.\"  Julia pointed out as she was also wearing one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will keep it just in case.\"  Jason relented as he grabbed the plain, pink encasement and hid it under his pillow.

Even though the possibility of using the medallion to somehow become her mother did briefly enter her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she made sure her mother wasn't looking as she made her way through the house, and she slipped it back into her mom's purse. And it was just in time too, for her mother Emily soon appeared. \"Morning sweetie.\" She greeted Julia. \"You're up early.

He put his shirt back and and looked in the mirror and noticed that the new underwear he wore now seemed invisible.  '<i>You would have to know it was there to see it.</i>'  He thought to himself as he went back down stairs to have some breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There.\"  His Mom replied as she saw her only son coming back into the kitchen and looking better.  \"You look so much better.\"  Julia looked over at her brother and couldn't seem to find the training bra under his clothes.</span></div></div>",

They could hear faint music coming from the bedroom of her brother Jason, and both of them had the same thing in mind. \"You thinking same as me?\" Jessica asked Megan, who grinned cheekily and then nodded in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, lets go.\" Megan whispered loudly, hopping off Julia's bed and heading for the door. Jessica followed and the two girls paused outside Jason's room.

The music in the bedroom went to a lower volume and then the bedroom door opened, and Jason saw his sister's two best friends standing there, with silly smirks on their faces. The alarm bells instantly went off in his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Jason, er... can we come in a second please?\" Megan asked politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It... won't take long, we promise.\" Jessica added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason sighed, still wearing the clothes he had put on to cover his pre-teen feminine chest. His mind was telling him to tell the girls to get lost, but he couldn't help but wonder what his sister's two friends, 11 and 12 years old (Megan and Jessica respectively) wanted from him. \"Huh, I guess, but what's this about?\" Jason asked, as the two girls walked past him, into his bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan and Jessica turned to face him, stood side by side and smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" Jason asked, as he grabbed his can of coke and took a sip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan and Jessica glanced at each other, then the former spoke up. \"So what's it like being a boy with a vagina?\" She asked, causing Jason to spit his pop out and look at the girl in shock.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Megan, unlike Jessica and Julia, was an abrupt and to the point person.  \"I want to see.\"  She said as she made a leap towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa.\"  Jason yelled as he dodged the attack from the girl in front of him.  \"What are you doing?\"  He demanded as held out his hands to hold off the attack once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We just want a little looksie.\"  Megan replied as she tried to jump over the bed and flank Julia's brother, but was caught off guard by Julia, herself, running into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two need to leave now.\"  She demanded as she grabbed Megan by the arm and literally dragged her out of the room.

And as she looked down and patted her AA-Cup boobs through her chest, she imagined having a boy's chest too, her brother's to be exact. She'd made up her mind, she was going to find out, and mess with Jason at the same time some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading downstairs, Julie raided the pile of clean clothes in the hamper, and as she walked past her mother in the living room carrying a pair of Jason's boxer shorts and one of his t-shirts, Emily just smirked. <i>\"Enjoy sweetie!\"</i> She winked at her young daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce back in her own untidy bedroom, alone now, Julia took off her top and then slid off her own training bra and her panties, so apart from her ankle socks, she was now butt naked staring into her full length mirror. Julia had the the average appearance of a girl her age, the promising curves just starting. \"Okay, lets start up here.\" Julia took a deep breath as she slipped the medallion on over her neck. Then she touched her brother's t-shirt to it, wondering if it would change only her chest or her entire torso including her shoulders. As it turned out, it was mainly the former, but as her tiny boobs melted completely into her chest and she acquired her older brother's male pectorals and nipples, her shoulders did broaden ever so slightly as her chest muscles expanded. \"Holy crap!\" Julia giggled, looking down. There was a slight coating of hair on her new, teenage male chest, and she patted herself and grinned, biting her lower lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fascination lasted a good few minutes, before Julia decided to waste no more time before doing the next swap. She had to admit, this one scared her a little, she had no idea what having Jason's penis would be like, particularly since her brother was sixteen years old, and she was only eleven years old. She knew it would probably be out of proportion on her smaller frame. But that didn't deter her, and she quickly touched her brother's boxer shorts to the medallion next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strange tingling sensation began to run through her nether region, and she took short, slightly panicked breaths as her still immature clitoris began swelling into a small nub... that slowly increased in length and girth until there was a recognizable, flaccid penis hanging between Julia's young legs. As her new shaft was still developing into a fully functioning male member, Julia winced slightly as she felt two 'pops' underneath as her ovaries dropped out and formed into her new testicles, wrapped in the scrotum that her labia had become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooh...\" Was all Julia could mutter as her new cock sprang to an immediate erection... 6 inches long... standing out at a 110 degree angle from her body. \"Holy shitballs!\" She then uttered, not usually one for swearing. As she wrapped her dainty hands around her new meat, a pleasurable sensation like no other shot through Julia, and her body shuddered in ecstasy as she immediately began pumping her new dick right there in the bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, just when Julia thought the sensation couldn't get any better, her balls tensed up and her eyes rolled up into her head in bliss as she had her first ever orgasm... ejaculating her warm jizz all over her set of drawers and on the carpet. A loud squeal emanating from her lips, while not heard by her brother (because of his music), was definitely heard by her mother downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily just chuckled to herself, smirking. \"If it feels that good, I can't wait to get my own.\" She said to herself, as she continued watching TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter her orgasm, Julia's legs gave way beneath her and she was breathing heavily, her little hands covered in sticky cum, not that she was bothered. She'd just had her first orgasm ever, and it had been a male orgasm. <i>Wait until I show Megan and Jess this.</i> She thought, a silly grin plastered on her flushed face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later, Julia then took the medallion off and got dressed in her own clothes, for the most part. She decided she had to wear her brother's elasticated boxer shorts to give her new 'friend' room to breath.

I was thinking about changing Jason a little more, you know to mess with him.  I think it would be a great payback from when we were younger.\"  She thought back to their childhood and thought about the time when Jason put an R/C car close to her ear and told her to listen to it.  Being the gullible kid she was, she did as she was asked and put it up to her ear.  As she did, he turned on car and caused her hair to be entangled on the wheels.

That was when she had over half of her hair chopped off just to get her separated from the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What were you thinking about doing, exactly?\"  Emily wondered as she continued to sweep the kitchen floor.  \"Just tell me it won't be anything too dangerous?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not too dangerous.\"  Julia replied back as she grinned.  \"I was thinking about seeing if a couple of my friends could sleep over tonight.\"  Since it was a school holiday, she didn't think it would be too much trouble in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a little last minute don't you think?\"  Emily wondered as she looked at the clock and noticed that it was already mid afternoon and she hadn't heard from her husband all day.

Jessica just wanted to see what it looked like in real life.  After seeing some photos on the internet, she certainly grew curious at what it looked and felt like in real life.  She looked over at the item that she brought, the pair of <a class=\"duLink\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.kohls.com/product/prd-235921/converse-all-star-sneakers-for-kids.jsp?color=Pink&amp;prdPV=1\">Pink Converse</a> \u00a0<a title=\"New Window\" href=\"https://www.kohls.com/product/prd-235921/converse-all-star-sneakers-for-kids.jsp?color=Pink&amp;prdPV=1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a>.  Looking at them, she couldn't wait to see Jason's cute feet to match hers.  Before she came over, Jessica took the time to paint her toe nails a lovely shade of light purple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan looked at her friends newest addition with a bit of jealousy.  For the longest time, she felt that she had been born in the wrong body and was meant to be male instead of this wimpy female body that she currently had.  But now was her chance to rectify the mistake that was made.  Looking down at her <a class=\"duLink\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.kohls.com/product/prd-2749883/juniors-amethyst-embellished-denim-capris.jsp?prdPV=27/\">Capri pants</a> \u00a0<a title=\"New Window\" href=\"https://www.kohls.com/product/prd-2749883/juniors-amethyst-embellished-denim-capris.jsp?prdPV=27/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a> that she brought with her and thought about making a swap about herself.  \"Jules.\"  She asked with an inquisitive manner.  \"Do you think that I could match you and your you know.\"  She motioned down towards the bulge in the crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia couldn't help but chuckle at the question.  \"Wait, are you serious?\"  She asked with a sense of wonder.  Both Jessica and Julia looked a little shocked at the request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... yeah.\"  Megan replied back to them both as she nodded her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care, but the only problem I see is well, the noticeable bulge.\"  Julia quickly responded.  \"So you will have to think about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will take my chances with it.\"  Megan confirmed as she started to look a little more excited.  Looking over at the alarm clock on the dresser, they noticed that it was already starting to get late.  \"So can we go change him now?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia looked over at the clock and noticed that it was late.  \"Hold on, let me go check first.\"  She left the room to go next door to see if her brother had fallen asleep yet.  Putting her ear next to the door, she heard the constant drone of the fan which signaled that he indeed had already fallen asleep.  Grinning, Julia made her way back to her room where she got her friends things.  \"You two wait here and I will get it started.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we want to see.\"  Jessica responded, but soon stopped when she saw Julia shaking her head.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I don't want to make too much noise where he will wake up and think somethings up.\"  Julia pointed out.  She grabbed the medallion that was on the dresser and took hold of the shoes and pants.  \"I will be back in about 5 minutes.\"  The girls nodded as they watched the door close behind their friend.  Julia quietly made her way into her brother's room and silently tiptoed across the floor, careful as to not make a noise.  After nearly stepping on several items, she finally found herself over at her brother's bedside and noticed the rhythmic exhales on his chest and knew that he indeed was asleep.  She put the pair of shoes and capris down on the side of the bed and carefully put the medallion over his chest, making sure to warm it up slightly as to not have a cold metal touching his warm body.  As she lay the medallion down, she couldn't help but notice her new crotch starting to stir with the anticipation of the change.  She bundled up the three items and lay them on top of the medallion and knew that it worked when she saw Jason stir slightly when the initial shock came from the magical item.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia looked down at the foot of the bed where she saw her brother's right leg sticking out from under the blanket.  With his normal boxer shorts on as pajamas, James' right leg started to lose it's hair.  Smiling, Julia looked down at the end where she saw his feet starting to shrink slightly until it looked like it belonged to an 11 year old girl rather than a 16 year old boy.  Not wanting to take the items yet, Julia brought her gaze back up her brother's legs and noticed that his hips started to widen a bit.  Looking closer, Julia saw the magic doing it's work as the skin on Jason's body started to look like Megan's as it made it's way up his mid section.  '<i>Crap</i>.'  Julia thought to herself as she gently grabbed the items and the medallion from her brother.  '<i>That was close</i>.'  She looked at her brother's body and saw that if she left it on there a couple minutes more, most of Jason's midsection would look like Megan's.  She carefully tiptoed her way back to her room where she found her friends waiting for her eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, did it work?\"  Jessica asked as she looked at the bundle that Julia was carrying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah it worked, but I think that he now matches Megan from the belly button down to the feet, where he has yours.\"  She replied.  \"I think I left it on there a little too long.\"  She then turned to Megan.  \"So did you still want to do it?\"</span></div></div>",

More precisely her still developing clitoris was lengthening and becoming phallus shaped as it popped into view from under the hem of her top. Jessica... and even Julia who had experienced the exact same thing... could only look on in astonishment as a teenage cock and balls formed on Megan's 11-year old frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, oh shit!\" Megan squealed, as her new appendage instantly became hard... rising into the air as the cool air caressed it. \"Wow... this feels awesome!\" She moaned, taking her meat in both hands and starting to rub it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica was speechless, while Julia began rubbing her own erection through her clothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, Jessica began to feel like the odd one out, and secretly was thinking about trying out a penis herself.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The girls instinctively quieted down and looked towards the door.  She stuck her head inside the door and looked at the group of girls.  \"It's bed time girls.\"  She replied as she noticed that 2 of the girls now had a bulge coming out from between their legs.  \"Looks like you girls are having fun tonight.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Mrs. B.\"  Megan agreed as she felt her new appendage stir between her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm going to need to take it for now.\"  Emily replied as she picked up the medallion and looked back over at the girls, who didn't seem to be too phased by it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Mom.\"  Julia answered back to her as she stretched her arms, almost as if to signal that she was getting tired too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing Mrs. B.\"  Megan and Jessica also answered back to her as they waved the hands good bye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily closed the door behind her and curious at whether or not her son was already asleep or not, stuck her head inside.  Inside, she saw that her son had kicked off all the blankets off of him and was sleeping soundly.  Looking closer, she noticed that his legs were definitely more shapely and hairless.  She also noticed that his feet were smaller and had a light purple polish on the toes.  \"That should be interesting in the morning.\"  She closed the door softly behind her and made her way to her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly put her plan into action.  Looking through her chest of drawers, she found what she was looking for.  A corset from a Halloween from several years ago.  She saved the corset after her husband urged her to for their '<i>Alone Time</i>'.  She picked up the medallion and made her way over to her husband's sleeping form.  Getting the medallion out of the protective bag, Emily carefully put it on her husband and placed the corset on her husband.  She watched in wonder as the magic did it's work.  His normally chiseled, muscular chest started to grow more supple, his waist turned inwards, and his hips expanded slightly as it started to look much like her own.  \"Let's see how if he will be able to take some time off now.\"  She chuckled to herself silently as she carefully picked up the medallion and the '<i>Alone Time</i>' corset and put them away for later.</span></div></div>",

Megan however, awoke only after an hour or so... and it was a raging hard on tenting the pair of Jason's boxer shorts she was wearing that woke her. Peeking under the sheets at Julia's crotch, she noted that her penis was flaccid, but there was a still a notcieable bulge in her borrowed underwear too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmirking mischievously, Megan got to her feet and looked down at the obvious protrusions from her groin, giving it a poke before glancing back at a sleeping Jessica too, who was still completely normal (unswapped). Megan slipped quietly out of the bedroom and into the bathroom, quietly closing the door and sliding the lock into place. Taking heavy breaths, Megan then discarded the boxers she was wearing on her still pre-teen frame, and wrapped both of her little hands around her meaty cock. A pleasurable thrill shot through her and the penis throbbed at her touch, causing her to moan again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe remembered the time she'd walked in on her own brother, Luke, when he was masturbating one time. Copying the motions he had been doing that time, Megan began slowly wanking herself off. The sight of an 11-year old 'beating her meat' would have been a weird sight to anyone. It was a learning experience, but it wasn't rocket science either, and Megan was soon a pro at male masturbation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could feel her balls churning as they swayed underneath her pulsating shaft, and after a few minutes... she let out a girly squeal that she feared would wake the whole household... as she ejaculated. A gasp escaped her lips as her cock sent a thick white rope of cum across the bathroom and spattering on the wall. As the orgasm wracked her body, Megan's young legs buckled beneath her and she collapsed in ecstasy, one hand still gripping her penis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if Megan hadn't have thought been a boy would be fun before, she was completely convinced of it now. <i>Oh wow...</i> Megan moaned, as she descended from her high and looked down as her cock started going limp in her little hand, cum dripping from the tip.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You just wanted a copy of his penis right, like me?\" Julie frowned, responding quickly to her friend's question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan smirked, wielding the medallion and then slipping it around her neck. \"I think it would be more fun if I swapped bodies with your brother, then we make him live as me and I get to be your big bro.\" She grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For how long?\" Julia asked, not sure about this new plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, just long enough to mess with his mind.\" Megan giggled, as Jessica and Julia glanced at each other. \"Besides, I think being a teenage boy is gonna be so much more fun than being a young girl.\" She grumbled, gesturing down to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia thought it over a minute, then agreed to it. \"Okay, but this isn't permanent remember. And I get the medallion back after you've swapped.\" She told Megan, who eagerly agreed to the conditions. She was so excited about becoming a 16-year old boy, not to mention the older brother of one of her best friends. \"Just creep into his room, and touch a part of him that is still normal, you should start changing completely into each other.\" Julia explained to Megan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your brother's halfway there already.\" Jessica giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then lets get him turned fully into me.\" Megan beamed, setting off quietly into Jason's room, where he was still sound asleep. Her heart increasing, she outstretched her arm and touched Jason's left shoulder as he lay there, while at the same time looking at one of Jason's now exposed, 11-year old girl's legs. Megan recognized the lef as an exact copy of her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oooh, it's starting..</i>. She thought in excitement, looking down at herself.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Julia was lucky enough to secure the back seat to her self and was eager to open her new possession.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia looked around the old and musty tome to find a way to open it, but soon became frustrated when she wasn't able to find anything.  \"How am I supposed to open this thing?\"  She said quietly to herself but heard a small 'click'.  \"Huh?\"  Julia looked back down at the tome and found that it wasn't locked anymore and eagerly opened it.  She watched in wonder as the words started to form on the pages.  At first it seemed to be in what looked like Spanish, but soon the shimmer happened once again and the words changed to Modern English.  \"Wow.\"  She whispered as she continued to read.  <i>'This is going to be interesting.</i>'  She thought to herself.  '<i>Life swaps, Trait swapping, and other stuff.</i>'   \"Hmm Life Swap would be really neat.\"  She whispered to herself as she didn't notice the shimmering as she closed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was soon brought out of her own thoughts by her Mom saying something to the family.  \"Alright guys. We're going to have lunch and go back home.\"  Julia heard her own stomach grumbling.  She put the book down and placed an old jacket over it to hide it while they went inside to eat.</span></div></div>",

Out of all the things, the urn seemed to be quietly calling her name.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I will take the Urn of Aladdin.\"  Julia replied as she pointed over to the tin urn sitting near the edge.  \"How much?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, first off.\"  The young girl said as she cleared her throat trying to sound a little more intimidating.  \"If you want to purchase the urn, you must be able to say its name correctly.\"  She grabbed the Urn and held it up.  \"This, my dear, is the Urn of Alulu.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Urn of Alulu.\"  Julia responded back to as she followed along with the pronunciation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good job.\"  The young girl congratulated as she put the urn back down.  \"Now, lets talk about the cost.\"  Julia could feel her heart beating faster as she looked at the urn.  \"I was thinking $31.56.

As she pulled it out and counted the money, Julia rejoiced as she pulled out the exact amount that the young girl was requesting.  \"Ha...\"  She celebrated as she put it down on the counter and eagerly grabbed the urn.  For some reason, she felt a great attachment to the item.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now.\"  The young girl said as she broke Julia's concentration.  \"Let me tell you how it works.  Before you start any game, each player will put a trait about themselves in the urn.  Then the players will play a game.  Any game really, a board/card game or even a race, and the winner will get the traits that are in the pot.

She sighed when she found out that nobody had sent her anything.  \"Not even Peter.  You would think if I'm gone for a week to visit my family that my own boyfriend would send me a message.\"  She continued to look at her phone while she walked down the aisle and certainly didn't notice the cart full of merchandise that was in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey watch out!!\"  A male voice called out to her.  Sarah turned around to see Peter, her boyfriend, grabbing her by the shoulder to stop her from running into the cart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Peter?\"  Sarah asked as she tried to make sense of it all.  \"I thought you were back at school?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man looked down at his current form and chuckled.  \"So that's who you see me as, hmm?\"  He pushed the cart closer to the wall and out of the way from others having an accident.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah looked back at him.  \"What do you mean that's who I see you as?\"  She nearly screamed.  \"You've been my boyfriend for the past 6 months.\"  Sarah's breathing started to get faster and faster, and in a matter of moments she would start to hyperventilate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, young lady.\"  'Peter' replied as he casually put his hand on her shoulder, as if to comfort her.  \"I may look like Peter, but I assure you I'm not him.\"  This simple assurance seemed to comfort Sarah and her breathing started to return to normal.  \"There you go.  Now let's see what we can do for you, hmm?\"  He knelt down to gaze into her eyes.  \"Ah yes, you want your parents to see you as an adult and you want your siblings to respect you more too, but you want to have some fun..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you know...\"  Sarah asked flabbergasted, not really knowing what to say for what seemed the first time in her life.  She watched in awe as the man who looked just like Peter, right down to the mole on his left earlobe, started to pull items from the shelf.  The first item was a box with an odd looking remote pictured on the front, then a strange looking necklace in a plastic bag, an odd bracelet with what looked to be chinese symbols on the beads, and lastly an old book.  \"What are all these?\"  She wondered as she watched the man smile an odd smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First, we have the remote from Blarg Industries.\"  He motioned to the remote still in its original box.  \"Next we have the medallion of Zulo, which will certainly help you walk in another's shoes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, aren't you going to tell me what they do?\"  Sarah wondered as she tried to pick up the remote box to get a closer look at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry.\"  The young man replied as he got the box and pulled it back toward him to keep it out of her reach.  \"But if I told you then we will give away all our secrets.\"  He smiled as he watched Sarah nod.  \"Now we also have the Bracelet of Shin Zao.  This bracelet comes from the Ancient warring factions of China.  And lastly, we have the Hispanic Book of Life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, just like the movie?\"  Sarah asked as she tried to get a closer look of the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but this is actually the original one that somewhat inspired the other one.\"  The young man replied.  \"Now since I like the way you're so intrigued with all these items, I will explain one of them, which one will it be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think the bracelet.\"  Sarah replied to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good choice.\"  He replied with a wink of his eye, that almost always turned Sarah to jelly on the inside.  \"The Bracelet of Shin Zao will help out with the world around you.  Each bead represents one envy that you may have.  When the bracelet senses an envy about the person around you, it will transfer it to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, like if I think somebody has a larger bust and I wish that I had it on me.\"  Sarah replied trying to get a grasp on what was said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you will find your chests swapped and then one of the beads will disappear.\"  The young man answered.  \"But all swaps are final, so please try to keep your emotions in control.  Now, which item would you like to buy today?\"</span></div></div>",

He looked further down the way to see if he could find the end of the aisle, but found the darkness that continued.  \"How big is this place?\"  Jason wondered as he tried to wrap his head around everything.  He soon had somebody behind him willing to give him the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA female voice answered back to him.  \"Only the size of your imagination.\"  Jason quickly turned his head to see a young blonde lady who looked a lot like a girl from his school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry?\"  Jason asked as he tried to make sure that he heard her right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, never mind.\"  The girl giggled as she nudged Jason's arm.  \"So what brings you in here today?\"  She asked as she started to look into his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...  I'm here with my parents and sisters.\"  Jason replied as he tried to back away slightly, since the girl started to get too close for his comfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, everybody has a reason for coming here.\"  She looked closer in his eyes and Jason gasped as he seemed to see a small shimmer in her eyes.  \"Ah yes, I see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, did your eyes...\"  Jason stammered, but was soon cut short by the young woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're tired of trying to be the perfect child.\"  The young girl replied.  \"You want to see what it would be like to be yourself and not what your parents and girlfriend expect you to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you know that?\"  Jason wondered in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said.\"  The young girl giggled.  \"Everyone has a reason to come in and that seems to be yours.  Let's see what we have to help you with that.\"  She turned and motioned for Jason to follow her to a near by counter that had several items already on top of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are those?\"  Jason wondered as he reached for an odd looking stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl snatched the stone away from his grasp and placed just out of his reach.  \"One of these items is why you came here.\"  She picked up the first item, which looked a lot like a deck of cards.  \"First you have the Cards of Black Beard.  They were blessed by a shaman in West Africa.  The winner of each hand would be swap something about themselves with the loser.\"  She put down the deck and picked up an old board game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that game, I used to play that with my family when I was younger.\"  Jason pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may have, but not like this.\"  The girl giggled once again.  \"Not like this, you did.  You see once a person placed their token on the bored, you will be transported into another person's life.  It could be somebody you know, but it will always be nearby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you win?\"  Jason wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All you have to do is finish the game's commands.\"  She pointed out.  \"Or perhaps you're here for the Stone of Avalon.\"  She held up the purple and gray stone.  \"This stone will grant any wish, but the effects are permanent.  So the wisher needs to be sure of what they want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what's that?\"  Jason wondered pointing to the clothes soap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The soap of Jin Lao.\"  She pointed out to him.  \"You see anything washed in this soap has an enchantment.  Who ever puts on the clothing that was washed in the soap will find that whatever they are wearing to match the previous person.\"  She looked over at Jason and instead of a look of wonderment and awe, he had a look of unknowing.  \"Well let's say if I wash my pants in the soap and you were to try them on.  After a few minutes, you will find that your bottom half, which is touching my pants, to look much like mine.\"  She did a half twirl to show Jason what she meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long will it last?\"  Jason wondered as he tried to discreetly reach for the canister to get a better look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only until you put something else on.\"  She casually replied back to him as she pulled back the canister to be just out of reach again.  \"But be warned if you keep the form for more than 48 hours, you will keep that form.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like that will happen to me.\"  Jason scoffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More than one man has been caught off guard.\"  The girl exclaimed as she motioned towards the items.  \"Now which will it be?\"</span></div></div>",

Nicole was Julia's best friend from a couple door down.  While they were good friends, they were also complete opposites.  Julia was a tomboy with shoulder length hair, while Nicole was one of the girliest that Jason had ever known.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\"  Jason replied as he looked around at his sisters.  \"Mom and Dad will be leaving around 6 to go to the movies.  So if we meet up around 6:30, we should have enough time to play.\"  Both of his sisters nodded their heads in agreement.</span></div></div>",

Since almost everyone knows how to play.\"  He looked around and noticed everyone nodding their head.  \"But before we start we should let everyone know some of the games rules.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we all know the rules for Poker.\"  Peter said as he grabbed the cards out of Jason's hands and started to deal out the cards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait.\"  Jason called out but it was too late since the game had already started.

She finally stopped her gaze on her brother Jason.  \"I want to swap my height with Jason.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean you want to swap...\"  Peter responded but was cut short by a strange sight.  Sarah's brother, Jason was shrinking in height and his sister Julia was gaining.  He quickly got up and backed away from the table.  \"What kind of black magic is this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason looked over to his right and noticed that he only came up to his girlfriend's shoulder.  He then looked over to his left and also noticed that he was the same height as Nicole.  Both of them seemed shocked at what had just transpired.  \"What the heck Julia?\"  Jason yelled over to his sister who seemed happy with her new found height.  \"Why did you do that?  I mean, you could have swapped with Peter.\"  He motioned over to Sarah's boyfriend who was a little too freaked out to realize what was just said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could have, but I didn't want to be a freak.\"  Julia replied back to him as she continued to check out her new perspective.  \"I will surely be star of the team now.\"  Jason couldn't be too mad at his sister and decided to start the next hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Peter are you going to join us or what?\"  Jason wondered as he started to deal the cards for the next hand.</span></div></div>",

As he looked he felt a surge of happiness well up deep inside him and looked around the table to see if he could see if he actually had a chance.  Being over a foot smaller than when he started the beginning of the game, Jason didn't know how to take it.  He moved his cards in his hands to get a better look and found 3 Queens smiling at him.  \"Are you guys ready to show your cards?\"  Jason wondered as he tried to keep his happiness to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\"  Marie replied to her boyfriend's request and lay down her hand to show the pair of 5's.  \"I don't think I have anything good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Julia and her friend, Nicole, didn't seem to have anything since they threw down their cards in a matter of disgust.  \"I didn't get anything good this time.\"  Julia smiled as she still looked around to marvel in her new found height.  She was ready to go back to school and play a game or two of Basketball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So did I win?\"  Marie asked as she smiled from ear to ear and started to look around to see what she wanted to get.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\"  Jason replied back to her as he lay down his 3 Queens.  \"Not if my 3 ladies have anything to say about it.\"  He groaned slightly as he looked over at his girlfriend's crestfallen face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know what you want to get?\"  Nicole wondered as she hoped to be included in the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I think I do.\"  Jason proudly announced as he looked over at Julia.  \"I want to swap my height with Julia.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia seemed horrified as she looked around and noticed that nothing really changed.  \"What's going on?\"  She asked as she seemed relieved that nothing really changed and she still was the tallest person in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\"  Jason answered as he got out the card box out and tried his best to read the smaller rules.  With only 20 seconds left, he finally found the rule that he was looking for, but only after having the rules nearly touching his nose.  \"Well crap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"  The 3 girls asked together as they grew closer to him to see what he was looking at.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems that I can't swap back for another 2 days.\"  Jason sighed after thinking about how he was going to deal with being short for the next couple days, at least.  Then, remembering the other rule about the time limit, Jason did a quick look around and quickly stated.  \"I want to swap umm...  Hair with umm...  Marie.\"  He felt up on his head to see if the swap took place, but found that his hair was still the same length.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it broken?\"  Marie asked as she hoped to see her boyfriend with her long dark hair framing his face, but was disappointed to find that it didn't happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, he didn't make the swap in time.\"  Julia made quick to point out to her.  \"So according to the rules, he got a random swap.\"  Hearing this, the group looked down at themselves to see if anything changed without them knowing.  \"I don't feel any different\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neither do I.\"  Nicole agreed.  \"Let's do another hand and we might find out what happened.\"  They all agreed and Jason started to deal another hand for them to play.  What they didn't know was that Jason had his gender swapped with Nicole.  Everyone would treat him like a girl and Nicole like a boy until they swap back.</span></div></div>",

Deep down he knew something odd must have been swapped with one of the other players, but he just couldn't see what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you done shuffling them?\"  Julia asked asked as she watched her brother continue to shuffle them.  \"I think we're ready to get this game going, shorty.\"  She found it amusing that her older brother was now over a foot smaller than herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awe, leave him alone.\"  Marie chuckled as she leaned down to give Jason a kiss on his cheek.  \"I think he looks cute the way he looks right now.  Almost like he's funsize.\"  The group, even Jason, couldn't help but laugh at the comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\"  Jason said with an authoritative tone.  \"Here we go.\"  He started to hand out the cards to the remaining participants.  Making sure to watch their faces as they picked up their cards.  Jason was pretty sure that he would be the one to come out on top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meh\"  Nicole said with disgust as she threw them down in front of her.  \"I literally didn't have anything.\"  Jason looked around at the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I have a pair of 10s.\"  Julia replied as she lay down her cards to show the group.  \"I'm sure you all can beat that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I have 3 kings.\"  Marie answered as she lay them down in front of her and watched both Jason and Julia's smile fall from their face.  \"What should I pick?\"  She asked herself as she looked around the table and stopped on her boyfriend, who shook his head in defiance.  \"Oh, it's alright.  You know how you're always wanting to touch my chest?\"  Jason blushed as he heard his sister and her friend giggling much like the schoolgirls that they were.  \"Well, I want to swap chests with Jason.\"  Marie looked down with wonderment as she watched her own chest starting to deflate, much like a balloon losing it's air until it resembled Jason's much more muscular one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look funny.\"  Nicole chuckled as she looked over at Jason, who didn't know what to do with Marie's B-cup breasts now resting on his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah.\"  Jason replied as he rubbed his new mammaries and instantly felt turned on.  He turned red again as he felt his penis starting to rise up like a soldier standing at attention.  Marie, seeing this, leaned over to her boyfried and whispered into his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you would like them.\"  She whispered seductively.  \"Maybe I will win again and make you a complete woman.\"</span></div></div>",

Looking down, he was meant by the globes of flesh that were only a few moments ago on his girlfriend.  \"Is something wrong?\"  Julia asked her brother who looked more and more feminine with each hand he lost.  Marie's breasts looked absolutely huge on him with his smaller stature and he looked out of place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason shook his head as he looked over and up at his sister, with her height that she got from him.  \"I was just getting used to having these things.\"  He gestured down to his new expanded chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm sure you'll get used to it.\"  Marie insisted as she motioned down to the cards.  \"How about you go ahead and deal the cards out and you might get a smaller chest.\"  She then nodded her head over at Nicole's and Julia's smaller chests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you can have mine, Jason.\"  Nicole eagerly replied as she giggled.  \"I would love to have a bigger chest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason shook his head as he started to deal out the cards.  \"We'll see about that.\"  He once again looked around the table as the girls looked at their hands, to mainly see if they had a good hand or not.  He noticed Nicole's eyes becoming much bigger as she picked up all the cards.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you all have?\"  Nicole eagerly asked as she looked down at her hand.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your face says it all.\"  Jason replied as he threw down his hand showing that all he really had was a 10 high card, so nothing really good to write home about.  \"So how about you go ahead and show us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\"  Nicole said grinning from ear to ear.  \"I had a full house.\"  She showed the group her hand and indeed, just like she told them, she had a full house of 3's over 2's.  Marie and Julia sighed as they threw down their hands.  She looked over at Jason with a look of predation, much like a snake looking over at a mouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason gave a gulp of fear as he saw her looking over at him.  \"Well, what are you waiting for.\"  He replied with his deep baritone voice as he gestured down at his chest.  \"Take them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, all in good time.\"  Nicole giggled as she looked around the group.  \"I think I will take your puberty.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My what?\"  He asked as he gasped in surprise.  \"Why do you want to take that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just think back.\"  Nicole instructed him.  \"Back when it first started, how awkward you must have felt.\"  Jason did as she instructed and certainly did feel awkward, with the growing of hair in strange places, the changing of the voice, and the growing.  He certainly didn't want to go through that again, but he was at the mercy this 11 year old girl.  \"So I want to swap my stage of puberty with Jason.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this muttered, Jason heard an audible gasp coming from everyone else and felt a wave of change hit him.  He looked down at his chest and noticed that they matched his sister's AA cup.  \"Wow.\"  He froze as he heard his much higher voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sound funny.\"  Nicole replied with a much more mature voice.  She looked over at her and noticed that her AA cup was now a C-cup and she seemed to have grown to meet Marie's height.  \"You look so skinny.\"  Jason looked down at himself and noticed that his chest was certainly smaller, but so was his arms and legs.  All the muscle mass that he got with the puberty was now gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Jason, if I didn't know better, I would have thought you were a girl.\"  Marie giggled as she nudged her boyfriend.  \"I mean with longer hair and clothes, you could certainly pass for one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah.\"  Jason said with his much higher voice.  \"Should we get another hand or two before we quit for the night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all nodded as they waited for Jason to deal them out a couple more hands.</span></div></div>",

As he sat in the seat of his family's SUV staring out the window watching the landscape go quickly go by, Jason could only imagine what would happen with the cards. Looking back down at his lap, he read the back of the box to see a small amount of rules written there. He started to read them, well the best he could since the font of the letters kept getting smaller as the words went down the back of the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i><b>Congratulations to you the owner of this magnificent and life changing deck of cards.

She always felt protective for her kids and always wanted to make sure that they weren't being made a fool of.  Jason sighed as he gave her the deck of cards.  She looked them over and handed them back.  \"I think you were had, honey.\"  She laughed as she turned back to the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, they're real.\"  Jason protested as he put the cards back into his pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, when we get back home, we all can spend time together and play a game, hmm?\"  She put her light purple sunglasses back on her face as she looked out the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess.\"  Jason replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay.\"  Emily celebrated with a clap of her hands</span></div></div>",
