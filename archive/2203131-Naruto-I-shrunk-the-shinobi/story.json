Kakashi couldn't do much to deduce the identity of the titaness with his eyes, but his sense of smell was being flooded by the vastly amplified and familiar scent of his comrade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Kakashi had kept his cool against the approaching giantess, Naruto was not quite as collected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHHHHHIE!

The light coming into the alley is too bright for me to make out who that is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crushing footsteps that vibrated the ground beneath the shrunken duos feet came closer before stopping a few feet away from them.

He turned his gaze from his old sensei up to Ankos face high above him, focusing on the side of her head. He zeroed in on the bottom of Ankos earlobe which was peaking out slightly from inside a cascade of her short violet hair. That was quite a height to reach, but with chakra it should be a piece of cake for the elite 15 year old...um...genin... and his jonin friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey sensei! Seems to me that the best way to go is up to her ear, dont you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. Or at least high enough for her to hear or recognize us. Though that wont do us any good if we cant catch up to her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Catch up to her?... AHHH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to Naruto, Anko had started to turn around and exit the alley, giving up the search for her comrades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well. If they dont want to be found I'll just leave them to it.\", she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakashi began to run after her, calling to Naruto to move it. Right away the ninja noticed something was different with their chakra. Like instead of their full chakra being made to fit proportional to their new tiny bodies, only enough chakra to fill the tip of a normal sized persons finger was made available. Kakashi figured that they could only rely on their chakra for five straight minutes before they completely exhaust themselves and would have to rest to recharge. Add to that, that they couldnt perform most of their jutsu in their arsenal as most would take more chakra than was available to them right now. For the foreseeable future, all they could do is weak mini versions at best. Kakashi was thankful that atleast they were in the presence of a trusted comrade who could help them.. so long as they could get her to notice them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny ninja ran forward after Anko, managing to catch up thanks to the little chakra they had. Kakashi called back to Naruto as they sped along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Naruto! We need to get as high as possible before our chakra runs out! Lets use the objects lined up against the wall to gain higher ground and jump on Anko from there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked over at the objects in question, seeing that they were piles of junk, trash cans and dumpsters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey ran to they wall and parkoured up a slope of trash, onto a discarded cardboard box, leaped from the box onto the rim of a trash can and from there, jumped onto the closed lid of the dumpster. This course had drained a considerable amount of chakra. The distance between Anko and the dumpster was a good two feet, if they were to make the jump, that would be it for chakra for awhile.</span></div></div>",

Her hand swayed back and forth as she stepped out of the alley making Naruto nervous he would miss and get seperated from Kakashi. However, his worries were washed away when Ankos hand grew larger and larger to his point of view as they soared through the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Narutos entire field of vision is taken up by the skin of Ankos hand as he and Kakashi slam against it and cling tightly to avoid falling off. Naruto pressed hard against her hand, feeling the warmth of her flesh against his hands and face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnko had remained unaware of the tiny Kakashi and Naruto on the ground, and was still unaware that they were now latched onto the back of her left hand. Her arms continued to sway as she exited the alley and joined into the crowded streets, making Naruto feel a little motion sick before summoning the will to calm his nerves. Naruto looked at the area of Ankos hand ahead and worried when he didnt see Kakashi at first, but once again, his nerves calmed when he saw Kakashi had just landed below him a little bit above Ankos knuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man...\", he groaned as he recovered. \"Uh... ah! Alright, we made it! Come on Kakashi sensei lets get to climbing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto halted when he felt Kakashi tug on his leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because Im sure you noticed that our chakra has been drastically reduced. If you want to climb all the way up Anko now, you'll have to do it by primarily using your muscles. Which would be difficult enough, even if we werent on a living mountain and already winded as it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was right. Naruto knew that. But he still had enough faith in his abilities to believe that he could make the journey to the ear, even without a chakra boost. He could get all the rest he wanted after he and Kakashi were restored to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see your point sensei. But the sooner we get Anko to help us the sooner were no longer pip squeaks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakashi released his grip on Narutos leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just hear me out here. Look up ahead on Ankos wrist.\", Kakashi said while pointing his finger past Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto followed his direction and looked up along Ankos hand to her wrist. Up ahead, in her coat, hidden beneath the shadow of her sleeve, Anko was wearing a black wrist watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Her watch? I dont get it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we can stick around here long enough for me to regain the right amount of chakra, I can try to use the metal in that watch to amplify my lightning style jutsu and shock Anko. With the end result hopefully getting her to look down here and spot us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave it to Kakashi to come up with a plan\"., Naruto thought to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thought it over and.. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Yeah. Okay sensei thats the plan. But what do we do in the meantime while your building up chakra?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, i suppose we cant just hang out here. We might as well make our way to that watch now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto nodded and the two of them began crawling up the warm wall towards the watch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be careful not to dig into her skin to hard Naruto! We dont want Anko mistaking us for just an itch.\", Kakashi warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought sent chills down Narutos spine. The image of him and Kakashi being grinded into paste by giant fingernails was definitely not a way Naruto was comfortable going out too. Though keeping his grip against such a smooth surface was hard, especially without chakra. Not to mention today was quite breezy and Anko was swaying her arm. He would have to rely solely on his physical training to get to that watch. Their climb continued further up the back of her hand until they crossed the threshold between Ankos sunlit skin and the shaded area beneath the sleeve. They had entered the arm of her overcoat and were near the crown of the watch. Upon getting so close, Naruto realized that climbing over it from the crown to case would be borderline impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Argh! Dammit! That watch is too big for us to just climb onto!\", he exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see what you mean. Hm... come on. We'll move to the side and use the strap to get to the other side.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they were busy on her hand, Anko was now in sight of the village gate, where she saw the team the Hokage had assembled for her already waiting for her there and talking to the two gate guards, Kotetsu Hagane and Izumo Kamizuki. Anko sighed, she wasnt really in the mood to get into a conversation with those guys. As she got closer, the first to notice her was a woman with long purple hair dressed in Anbu gear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anko! Did you find Kakashi?\", Yugao asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure did. For about a second before he up and vanished on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<br>\r\n\"Did you hear that Sensei? Sounds like she was looking for you in that alley!\", said Naruto, as he crawled to the top of the watches strap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakashi had reached the top of bezel and was standing vertically, waiting to pull Naruto up with him.<br>\r\n\"Well, she may not have found me but we sure found her. And it looks like Im going on this mission anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<br>\r\n\"Kakashi just vanished? Really? I know he likes to do that to his students but...thats not like him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnko chuckled. \"Yeah thats what I thought. But if hes too \"busy\" for us then it cant be helped. He just wont be treated to lunch by Yamato when we get back like the rest of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Me? I never said...\" Yamato started before being interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Yamato its the gentlemanly thing to do.\", Kotetsu chimed in. \"Ofcourse, if...if he doesnt feel like it I would be more than happy to take you out sometime Anko.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what a kind offer Kotetsu. Unfortunately, Im going to be busy avoiding you so I wont be able to make it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKotetsu slumped over his desk in defeat, while the last member of the squad, Kurenai, began to talk once she was done laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway Anko. I hope you dont mind me saying but I had to bend over backwards in order to free enough time to go on this mission for you. Could you go over the mission one more time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Sigh)... okay okay one more time. Listen up people! Our mission is to check out some intel regarding one of Orochimarus hideouts. Its unlikely we'll find him there but theres reason to believe hes left behind some of his research. Needless to say we dont want that to fall into the wrong hands so its up to us to retrieve it. And thats about the jist of it. Now then, lets get this show on the road!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right!\", the other squad members shouted in unison. </span></div></div>",

Though once we get Ankos attention I imagine she'll be pretty annoyed we interupted her mission.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Sigh)... cant be helped now  I guess. How much longer until you build up enough chakrrrAAAAAA!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe arm Naruto and Kakashi were on suddenly moved as Anko and her squad took off into the trees, compromising the little stowaways stance on her wrist watch and causing them to uncontrollably lurch forward, land on the smooth dial and slide until they flew off the watch and landed back on Ankos hand. They continued to slide at high speeds along the back of the hand until they bounced off her knuckle and entered into a zero gravity state, where they now found themselves hovering slightly above the fleshy platform below them as it continued moving forward. If they didnt grab onto to something soon, Anko would be out of reach and they would be not only on their own, but also thousands of feet high in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakashi had managed ro scrape together enough chakra to allow him to stick to surfaces again, so he reached out and planted his hand on Ankos fingernail. Kakashi then reached out and grabbed Narutos ankle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAAAHHH!!! Pull me in pull me in pull me in!!!\", Naruto howled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKakashi dragged the boy over to him until Naruto could grab hold of the nail aswell. For the next few minutes, they stayed there. The wind smashing against their faces as Anko glided through the trees. This surface was too smooth for Kakashi to have confidence in as reliable. He gazed forward along the length of Ankos arm towards the back of her head. Damn. That was quite a distance to travel. If only Anko had stayed still, Kakashi could have shocked her watch and gotten her to find them. But whats done is done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly thing to be done now is come up with another plan...</span></div></div>",
