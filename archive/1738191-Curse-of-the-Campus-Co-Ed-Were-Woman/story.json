Your high school sweetheart, <b>EMILY</b>, is acting a bit disappointed in you right now, although the reason for this escapes you.  Lately, she has been spending less time with you and more time with her best friend <b>AMY</b>. What Amy sees in Emily is beyond you.  Although you see something in her, so it is not beyond the possibility that others do as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing a two night cramming session for some important tests, a stressful day of academic ailments has finished and you are left to celebrate in the Friday night ritual of bar hopping.  Tom has already started without you, and Emily has promised to talk to you, if she ever manages to find you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt has been a cold Fall night, and your dark windbreaker jacket is beginning to prove insufficient to the dropping temperature as you walk towards your girlfriend's dorm on the opposite side of campus.  Wind blows through the leafs as shivers suddenly climb up your spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt then dawns on you how empty the campus grounds are at 10:00 P.M. this night.  Usually, there is the odd couple, or group of rowdy frat boys making motions in the distance, but tonight, there is nothing.  Odd, there is that shiver again, and this time no wind.  You turn the corner on a path, only see a young woman standing there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first you're not intimidated, because she is at least a foot shorter than you, in fact, you are more concerned that you scared her.<br>\r\n\"Excuse me.\" you say as you try and pass her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman does not budge.<br>\r\n\"Excuse me.\" you repeat, as you attempt to step around her.<br>\r\nBut the female's action mirror you as she stands right in your path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wind blows again, and you feel that shiver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, you feel a mix of concern, and annoyance.  You did not want to have to show your strength, but something is wrong here.  You powerfully walk straight at the woman.  But to your surprise, she places both of her hands on your chest.  Not sure what to think, you instinctively try and brush them off.  However, before you can do that, one of her arms makes its way behind your neck, as she pulls herself up to kiss you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPartly do to shock, and partially do to the unexpected weight of her on you, you fall backwards to the ground, as the woman jumps away.<br>\r\n\"Sorry.\" she says as she dashes off into some bushes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"What just happened?\"</i> you wonder.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You're deciding if you should tell of this incident to Emily, your girlfriend, when a sudden cramp hits you.  As a cloud passes over a crescent moon, you collapse in pain.  You try and scream, but all you can let out are some grunts.  The cramp seems to move up, through your stomach and your chest.  Your eye's are blurry, are you crying?  There is enough pain to cry, but you haven't cried since you lost your pet in high school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try and peer down are what is causing you pain, but something graces your eye. You try and clear what is in front of your face, but just feel hair, long silky feeling hair.  There is a pain in your hips,  Not only does your skin in the region seem to be stretching, but the bones in that area seem to be becoming thicker too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grunt again, but this time, your grunt comes out at a higher pitch, that's not good.  You remember a time when you strained your vocals while trying to sing that high.  (You were really drunk that day.)  The pain you had in your throat seems to be returning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, your mind is constantly thinking up the worst case scenarios to what is causing this.  Some deadly disease that you never heard of, strange experiments from that old lab building that no one but the uber-nerds visit, fate hating you just for the hell of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next part seemed the most bizarre, there was a clear deflating feeling between your legs, while there was a simultaneous swelling of your chest.  These don't cause pain, as much as they cause pressure, a sensation you are not used to feeling.  You try and hold in the noises, but your mouth lets out a feminine sounding \"EEEE.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou attempt to hold your lips together, only to notice that they feel different as well.  They almost feel fatter.  Afraid of drawing unwanted attention from the non-existent passers by, you cover your mouth with your hands, only to feel that your jaw is much smoother.  That was odd, you did shave just before you left, but your razor with pretty cheap.  You should have at least felt something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last sensation you feel on the ground is your nipples.  They're much more sensitive than usual, and every movement of your shirt is immediately noticeable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about a minute, you find the strength to stand, only to realize that when you do, the world seems a bit larger than it did before.  You look down at your windbreaker and jeans.  You find yourself leaning forward more.  Not only is your center of gravity feeling different, you need to bend your neck forward just to see your stomach.  Your windbreaker is tight on the top, as it seems you've developed some noticeable mounds on your upper torso.  That said, your jacket's arms are much roomier than before.  Your jeans also seem longer than before,  They are pinching your waist, as your pant legs drag beneath your feet.  Your feet, they feel odd too, not only do the socks keep falling to your heel, your shoes seem like they're going to slip off with every step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour head seems a bit fuzzy, and you are not currently thinking straight.  The idea to head your place, or a health clinic never occurs to you.  All that is on your mind is getting to one of the destinations.</span></div></div>",

While opening the building's main door, you catch your reflection in the doorway.  It's not what you expected.  Your hair looks uncombed, and is going every direction, plus, you have hundreds of smaller stray ends sticking out of the top.  Your face looks thinner than before, and your eyes look larger and rounder.  Your lips look like they're pouting, so instinctively, you try and suck them back in, but stop once you realize you just look stupid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour wondering what you're going to do with your voice on the intercom, when you call up Amy and Emily to let you in, but quickly realize that the inside door has been propped open, and you just head inside.  The girls is in better shape than the guy's, but that is not saying much.  You think for all the money that students pay to use the place, they'd fix up the crumbling drywall, or get some matching curtains for the hall windows.  (Wait a minute, you never thought about curtains before, unless your thoughts involved a fake ghost.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring the uncomfortable feeling in your chest, you finally make your way down to the girls' room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnocking on the door, you hear some quick chattering inside.<br>\r\n\"Quick, he's here.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm not ready, I don't want to see him until I am ready.\"<br>\r\n\"You look fine, I am opening the door.\"<br>\r\n\"No, don't! I haven't finished with my hair.\"<br>\r\nYou hear a door inside the room shut.<br>\r\n\"I'm letting him in, it would be rude to keep Alex waiting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door then opens and you see a girl your height look at you straight in the eye.<br>\r\n\"Hi, who are you?\" asks Amy in a surprised manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just realized, in your current state, Amy and Emily would have no idea who you are.</span></div></div>",

Those observations never happened before.)<br>\r\nFinally, after a grueling 20 seconds, Amy smiles, opens the door and lets you in.<br>\r\nEntering the dorm room, you feel like you're an intruder, something just doesn't feel natural on you being here in your current condition.<br>\r\nWalking towards the couch, Amy notices you having to keep pull up your pants.<br>\r\n\"Emily is just getting ready for her date tonight with her boyfriend.\" says Amy.<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're not the one dating my cousin?\" you say innocently.<br>\r\nAmy seems to be contemplating again about how to respond, but before she can, Emily comes out of the bathroom as she is brushing her hair.<br>\r\n\"Who is this?\" she says with some authority.<br>\r\n\"I'm Alexandria, your boyfriend's cousin.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"Oh that's weird, he never mentioned you.\" responds Emily.<br>\r\n\"He never mentions any of us.

You continue: \"I got off the train, and on my way to see my brother, someone stole my luggage and my purse.\"  I spent most the afternoon in the police station filling out forms.  When the officer called Alex, he came and picked me up, he even lent me some of his old clothes to wear.\"<br>\r\nHolding back from sobbing, the girls act like they genuinely believe your story. You even got Emily to recognize your clothes, and bring some authenticity you your relation with, well, yourself.  (Wow, you just realized how conniving you were.)<br>\r\n\"Oh you poor thing.\" says Amy as she puts her arm on your shoulder to try and make a connection.<br>\r\n\"And you're cousin just sent you here to us, without any word of warning?  Is he outside, I need to talk to him.\" stated Emily.<br>\r\nQuickly, a thousand different excuses pop into your head.  None of them are good.  \"His cell died, and---he had to leave because of of the campus police was going to ticket him for parking illegally.  He said he'd meet up with us and Tom at the local bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis lie was weaker than the first, but the girls seemed to believe it.  Then after giving some non-verbal communication to each other, Amy and Emily return their focus to you.<br>\r\n\"I think I know why your cousin sent you here.\" said Amy.<br>\r\n<i>\"You do?\"</i> you think, but all you can do is swallow your spit as you smile.<br>\r\nEmily nods her head and puts her hands on they sides of your stomach.  \"We're roughly about the same size.\" she smiles.</span></div></div>",

Plus Amy seems genuinely interested in helping you, and to refuse would be a huge insult to her hospitality.<br>\r\n\"I don't want to be any bother.\" You instinctively say, but Amy sees right past the false modesty.<br>\r\n\"nonsense, after what you went through today, I want to put your faith back in human kindness, she says as she looks through her closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy takes out a pile of skirts, blouses and pants, half of them pink of frilly.  That's when it occurs to you that this place looks more feminine than it did last time you were here.  The window shades had designs on them.  There are frilly pillows everywhere, even the lamps produce a pink glow.  This is Amy's doing, she was slowly taking over your girlfriend's apartment.  Emily looks at you, with what you could swear is pity in her eyes, then she walks back into the bathroom and shuts the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next half hour is composed of you standing in front of a mirror trying on different types of outfits, that before tonight, you would rather have faced exile before wearing them. Thankfully, your (still somewhat) legs stop Amy from getting you to try on shirts, that is until she finds an extra pair of nylons, which you can never get to fit right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the 7th try, you and Amy both decide that tight jeans (because Amy owns no other kind) and blouse exposing your mid-section fit your personality best.  You'd prefer something more conservative, but as your host, Amy is silently not allowing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily even starts to loosen up and comes out of her bathroom looking gorgeous, with a Hollywood live flare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you look in the full length mirror, and could all pass as lifelong friends.

Amy even let you get away with borrowing a black pair of running shoes.  (That was nice of her.) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the three of you walk down the campus, Emily and Amy start to walk ahead of you, and get in a conversation about men.  That cold wind blows, and a gust blows onto your stomach.  It has just hit you how cold it is out, and how under-dressed you are for the weather.  The wind causes your nipples to freeze, as you realize that Amy never let you borrow a bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing the ridiculousness of the situation, an impulse to show off your athletic abilities hits you.

It is still instinctual, but there is nothing hanging out in your leg area that you have to avoid hitting to protect.

You feel insulted at this man's judgment on your abilities...that is, until the ball hits you.  OUCH! That hurt more than you expected.  It wasn't too bad of a catch though, you were just not used to the current sensitivity of your skin, and the lack of upper body muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've thrown a football with friends before, you know what most girls don't, the technique.  This will show them.  (Who are you kidding, this will show you.)  You take the ball in your right hand and spread your fingers around the bumpy grips.  You then toss the ball forward, only to find that you didn't adjust for your wieght, and almost fall forward.  The player that you talked to quickly wraps one arm around your stomach to stop you from falling.  The ball itself goes about five feet before hitting the pavement and bouncing out into the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a good start.\" says the guy holding you, as he releases his grip to let you get your balance back.  The other guy quickly runs out into the street to pick up the ball before a car hits it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Why does this happen to me?\"</i> says a voice inside of your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You had the grip about right, it was your release that was all wrong.\" says the jock.  \"I can quickly teach you if you'd like.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at Amy and Emily standing about ten yards back.  Amy's motion is suggesting you take the guy's offer.  Emily is looking impatient.</span></div></div>",

Plus if you screwed up a throw that badly, and just walked away, the guys might think you're being a dick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, step one.

You don't like this at all, but the shock of his hands does get you to stand up straight.<br>\r\n\"Now move your left leg forward.\" says the jock, and you immediately put it in the proper position to stop him from trying to move your leg for you.

Then, in a sentence that she seems to have added for the sole purpose of making life more difficult, adds: \"You're welcome to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guys seem more than pleased to join your trek to the bar, as they follow you.  In the guy's defense, the jock that showed you how to throw a football seems to have gotten the hint that he crossed a line and invaded your comfort zone.

I don't want to cause my cousin any trouble, or go missing on him.\" you answer.<br>\r\n\"Speaking about your cousin, I think I just saw him go out the back.\" says Emily as she stands up and leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo minutes pass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to the bathroom, I'll be just a second.\" says Amy as she leaves.<br>\r\nAbout a second after she gets out of sight, the jock that showed you how to throw a football comes to your table and sits down.<br>\r\n\"Hi, I am Ed.\" he slyly says, which triggers your fight or flight response.</span></div></div>",

Your mind races until it thinks of the one safe place that the jock can't follow you.  <br>\r\n\"I have to use the ladies room.\" you blurt out.<br>\r\nBoth Ed and you seemed stunned at how inelegantly you phrased that.  Ed just sits still as you leave and try to find washroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about a minute of searching, you come across a door with a small line up of women in front of it.  This must be the place.  Single file, the line gets shorter and shorter until you arrive inside.<br>\r\nYou realize you've never been into a woman's washroom before.  No urinals, but the lighting is better, there is a soiled couch in the corner and a missing door on one of the stalls.  The paint is a faint pink, and there a broken tampon dispenser next to the giant mirror.  At least two women are using the mirror to apply their make up, and one of them is Amy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Amy.\" you say cautiously, having no clue how women communicate in here.<br>\r\n\"Oh, what are you doing here?\" asks Amy, noticing that you aren't going to the free toilet.<br>\r\n\"I'm here to get away from Ed.

And I think you're his type.\"<br>\r\n\"My type?\"<br>\r\n\"Ya, jocks like two types of girls, the weak sissy ones that they can protect, and the tomboys that can keep up with them.  You mademoiselle, are the second type.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking about it for a moment, you realize she might be right.  A lot of jocks are narcissistic, and you are acting like a guy, (at least acting more like one than most women do.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what should I do?\" you ask her.<br>\r\n\"Well, try on something that goes against type.\" she responds taking out a lipstick tube.</span></div></div>",

Then maybe you'll be able to think of a way to change back, and meet up with Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy takes out a bright red tube and hands it to you, only to have you stare at it, until she realizes you have no clue what you are doing.  Then holding the tube up to your lips, she presses it against them, and applies it for you.  You look into the mirror, only to find that you don't like what you see.  The shade of red is too bright, it seems like your seeking attention, or are too needy.   At least it directs peoples eyes away from your chest.  Maybe if they start reading your lips, you'll feel more like your old self again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now go out there.  And good luck.\" says Amy as she pushes you out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk through the bar, feeling peoples eyes on you.  A lot more eyes then before.  Every guy's stare is creeping you out, every women is looking at you with the slight hint of hate in their eyes.  You try and give a very mild smile as you return to your table.  Where Ed is still sitting and talking with Jerry.  Upon seeing you, Jerry pats Ed on the shoulder and walks off.  You carefully sit, trying to compose yourself and sit more upright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about the wait.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"No problem, I bought myself a beer to pass the time.\" said Ed.<br>\r\n\"Oh, I don't like beer very much.\" you say, trying put some barriers between you.<br>\r\n\"Neither do I.  I just drink on special occasions.\" he responds, looking at your face.  (It's better than him glaring at your ass.)<br>\r\n\"Is there a special occasion?\"<br>\r\n\"I met you.  That should count for something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, wow.<br>\r\nYou look around the bar frantically.  This guy is coming on too fast.  Either he has no experience with women, or tons, either possibility will be a problem.  You then see that Amy is flirting with Jerry, she doesn't notice you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Emily returns looking annoyed.  This could be just the distraction you needed.<br>\r\n\"I can't find your cousin anywhere.\" she says to you.<br>\r\n\"Oh, I can help you look.\" you say.<br>\r\nShe pulls you aside, then softly says, \"no, it's fine, I see your busy.  That color suits you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily then quickly leaves.<br>\r\nThere is one last chance, you look around for Tom.  If he is here, maybe he can save you.<br>\r\nNope, no luck there.  Finally, you just flat out tell him:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ed, I'm sorry, I don't know what I am doing.  I think I'm giving you signals that I don't mean to.  I got taken here with my friends, who left me and now I just want to head back to my dorm room apartment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd looks at you, and is a bit disappointed, but understands.  He then asks your address, and wouldn't you know it, he lives in the same building.  In the floor right above you.

It's not that you like him or anything, but currently, you're in one of the most vulnerable positions in your life, and having someone who can help stop potential dangers before they start is comforting.  Still you don't know to much about this guy, although your intuition tells you that he's not much of a threat once put in his place.  (Intuition, huh, you never really had that working in your favor before.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a pretty quiet walk home, as you don't feel like initiating a conversation, and Ed isn't that persistent.  You don't know why he keeps following you, is he really that chivalrous?  (You never were to any girls.) Maybe he is hoping for a last minute change of mind from you, or perhaps he's just gay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a long and chilly walk home, and the wind hitting against your diminished body mass isn't helping matters either.  Thankfully, you eventually make it back to your building, and Ed holds the door open for you.  (What a gentleman!)

The softening of the skin, the subtle re-arrangement of the face.  All that you can think of is that you caused this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat flight or fight reflect kicks in, and you have the option of leaving and disappearing into the campus, or staying and explaining the situation to him.</span></div></div>",

There is a strong pain coming from your hips, causing you to bite your lip.  You peer at them to see that they've expanded out.  Suddenly, the lip that you're biting pushes out slightly, like it is getting rounder, or fatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel an incredibly itchy sensation on your chin and neck, as you instinctively scratch it, you are horrified that the minuscule hairs of your five O'clock shadow are falling off like they weren't even attached to you.  (Do you have some sort of disease?)  You look down at your legs, to see that they're reforming.  They seem to be getting smoother, but also reforming so that they're wider on top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think 'Am I losing all my hair?' but as if fate answered your question, a few strands from your head fall down and block your vision.  You try and brush them aside, but as you do, you feel a pain in your chest.  (That's never a good sign.)  You cross your arms, and tightly press back, hoping that this somehow will stop the pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body works harder than you do.  A mound pushes its way out, above your left ribcage.  You squeeze it to see if it is some sort of illusion, it's not.  But you don't have time to register that feeling, because the area between your legs feels like it is deflating.  You quickly pull down your pants, and see that the tip of your penis is being absorbed into the bottom of your waste, and creating a little slit to replace it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHorrified, you pull the pants back up, maybe it will return if you don't look.  You now notice that your hair has touched the top of the mound that has formed.  And their is now a matching mound over your right ribcage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around and see that something has happened to you.  You lift up your hands in front of your face, and notice that your fingers are now thinner.  You try to move them, just to see that they're yours, and they thankfully respond to your commands.  Your arms look smaller too, a lot of the extra muscle you gained at the gym is now gone.  There is still hair on your arms, it is smaller, and more peach-like, but it is still there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly feel cold, and see the hair rise, and goosebumps form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make the short trip to the bathroom, your shirt feels tighter, but your mounds are still bouncing around in there.  Saying that it felt unusual would be an understatement.  You're so focused on those that your (now shorter) leg hits its knee on the bathroom door's frame.<br>\r\n\"OUCH!\" you say with a high pitched and girlish voice.  Your mind is still trying to take in and process all of this information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pain takes about a minute to go away.  So you hobble to the mirror, and see a woman looking back at you.<br>\r\nYou take off the shirt releasing the two breasts that were (barely) hiding underneath.  They flop down, and slightly weigh you down.  (Stupid gravity.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raise your arms to see if that affects them at all.  You notice that you still have arm hair. (How very European of you.)  The hair seems a bit different.  It sticks much closer to your skin than it did when you had a Y-chromosome. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou place your hands on the edges of the sink as you take a closer look into the mirror.  Your eyes look rounder, the lashes above them are thicker.  Your eyebrows seem a lot more curved than they used to.  Your nose also seems a bit thinner, and shinier than it did.  Your jawline is also less squared than it used to be.  There are also no hairs on it, any hint that you could have once grown a beard is now completely gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour lips look fuller, and you seem like your partially sucking in your cheeks.  You hate to be self conscious right now, but you look stupid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou push yourself back, and have your breasts jiggle some more.  You decide that you need to do something about that.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Brian runs and closes the shades on the windows.  <br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" you ask.<br>\r\n'Controlling the environment.\" Brian responds and he turns off his lamp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both stand in a mild darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is going on?\" you sigh.<br>\r\n\"I wanted to see if it was lack of light that triggered the metamorphosis.  Apparently it is too light outside.\" says Brian.<br>\r\n\"Or there could be another trigger.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"Or you could be lying to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can respond, Brian throws his unwashed bed blanket over you.  The blanket is black, and heavy, very little light can get through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remain standing for thirty seconds, but can't take it anymore and try and lift the blanket off.  It's barely noticeable, but it takes just a bit more effort to lift the thing over your head than you expected it to.

They both look smoother and shorter now.<br>\r\n\"It looks like my suspicions on this were right.\" says Brian as he examines you and the pictures of you.<br>\r\n\"The lack of sun and light seems to trigger the transformation.\" Brian continues.<br>\r\n\"So? What's that mean? you ask.<br>\r\n\"Are you familiar with the concept of Yin and Yang?\" asks Brian.<br>\r\n\"Barely.\" you reply.<br>\r\n\"Well, you can sum the whole concept into a symbol of that black and white circle.  The one that has one side black and the other white.  In the black side, there is a tiny white circle, and in the white side, a tiny black one.  The idea is that opposite sides exist with each other, and have a bit of the other inside their own force.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian takes a breath before continuing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yin and Yang is usually representing good and evil, chaos and order, but it can also represent masculine and feminine. Male and Female.  The female half is usually shown as being darker and more chaotic.  It is the darkness that triggered your change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So there is some sort of logic you can use to fix this?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"Well, we don't know all of the factors involved in this.  I mean, the best examples I can come up with are werewolves.  But in historical recordings and folklore, if they changed after their initial transformation, they could change at their own free will.  None of that moon cycle garbage, that was all added by Hollywood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian now looks like he is pondering, lost in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what does this mean?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"Simply, it means I need to do more research.  I'm not a scientist, or a doctor, maybe one of them could help you more.  But I'm sure there is a book or two in here that mentions a similar situation, and through that, I might find some answers.\"<br>\r\n\"And how long would that take?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"See me in a day or two, maybe I can find something by then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Brian looks lost in thought again, and you feel like it is your time to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps you should go about your day and not pay any attention to your changes, or maybe you should go see a scientist or a doctor.</span></div></div>",

They feel more sensitive and perk up.  The hairs on your chest seem to recede, and your skin becomes noticeably smoother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chest inflates and you let out a quick moan.  The change is noticeable less painful and quicker than last night.  You feel your hips widen as your penis recedes and is replaced with a slot.  Your legs remold themselves to better fit your new hips, and your hair falls down in front of your eyes.  You brush it away, and notice that it feels silkier than the night before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make it to a mirror, and notice that you are inhabiting the same body that you did the night before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are some minor changes though.

Two hours pass and you realize that you can't fall asleep.  After trying every position you can think of, you take off your shirt to see if that helps.  It turns out that it does help a bit, but you do feel colder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get up to try and drink some milk to help you sleep.  You get some out from your miniature fridge and pour it into a glass.  As you pour it, your eyes can't help but wander down and look at your chest, theoretically, your body can produce its own milk; that thought disgusts you as you drink from the glass.  As you walk back to your bed, you notice that your body is moving quite differently.  the weight on your feet is near your toes, your heel is barely touching the ground.  It feels like you're sneaking around, but there is no one around to be quiet for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing this, you try walking like a man, and find that you can do it, but it feels weird.  You try and think of what other manly thing you can do, and decide to let out a belch.  You open your mouth to release the gas, and the sound that comes out is more like a hiccup than a burp.  It sounds high pitched and sort of dainty.  (A reaction that does not help your self-esteem.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lay back down over the covers and turn on the radio.

It turns out that male-to-female transformations are normal within most mythologies, and in many cases, they are eventually reversed.\" Brian says.<br>\r\n\"Eventually?\" you say with a suspicious tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian says before going on, \"Well, in most cases, if a man is not willingly transformed he usually changes back after a couple of years...\"<br>\r\n\"I couple of years?!\" you interrupt.<br>\r\n\"...After he, or she has kids.\" Brian finishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou almost fall back in shock after hearing this, but Brian steps in and catches you.  \"Easy there.\" he says as he sits you down on the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this is kind of reversible?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"In most cases yes.  In many, it is brought on as a punishment, to teach a person humility. Once the person learns the lesson, they change back.\"<br>\r\n\"But I am humble.\" you protest, with just a hint of a pout.<br>\r\n\"Probably, again, I don't know you or all of the situations that well.  But I have narrowed down your situation to a few tales.\" he says.<br>\r\n\"How did you manage that?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"I thought about your arm, and focused on the gradual transformation.  We've established that you only change outside of the sun.  And that you seem to have not fully transformed back during the day.\"<br>\r\n\"That's sounds about right.\"<br>\r\n\"And did you change again last night?\" he asks.<br>\r\n\"Yes...and then some.\" you say as you take of your sweater to reveal your new pair of breasts.<br>\r\n\"Incredible.\" Brian says, as he lifts his phone.<br>\r\n\"No pictures.\" you say as you grab his phone away from him.  You then put on your jacket and return his device to him.<br>\r\n\"Right, sorry.\" says Brian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian than opens a book laying on his desk and begins to speak again.<br>\r\n\"There are two tales I found in the library that match your description.  One is the tale of Gawapa, a small jungle village that had only sons.  One day they realized that none of the neighboring villages would lend them their daughters.  Desperate, the chief made a deal with Okil, their local night god, (or night demon, it never really explains,) that the young men of his village could find mates.  The night god agreed, but wanted all the treasures in the village.  The chief was reluctant, but desperate, and agreed, but only if Okil came back the next day to get the treasure. Okil was patient, so he agreed.  But the chief knowing that his village would become weakened by the loss of the treasure, he hid half the treasure in a nearby stream.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okil came by the next night and realized he had been tricked.  The chief was proud, because it was not every day that you can out-trick a trickster god.  Okil laughed and said it was a good trick, and that he would still uphold his end of the bargain.  He told Okil that he young men of his village would be ready for marriage the next night, and ready for their honeymoon by the end of the week.  Okil left with half of the treasures, and the chief bragged to everyone the next day of how he beat a trickster god.  The men all laughed and went to ready themselves to receive their brides that night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you can probably guess where this is going.  Once the sun went down, there were moans and cries of pain throughout the village.  The elders checked all of the huts and realized that every male under 23 years of age had become female.  Furious, and terrified, they prayed and sacrificed to their sun god.  The next morning, they found that their young males had mostly changed back, a few changed back completely, but others still had random female body parts.  They thought that their unnamed sun god had changed them back, but really this was just part of Okil's trick.  The next night, they all turned female again, and when the sun came up, most had turned back into men, but all had more female parts than before.  By the seventh night, almost all were completely female, even during the day\"  Brian finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I'm scared.  Was there anyway for them to change back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, said Brian.  \"There is a story about a young man from the village that beat the curse.\"<br>\r\n\"Great.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"I don't know.  The chapter about him is missing.\" Brian admits.<br>\r\n\"So there is a possible cure.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"Yes, but there is also something else you should know.\" says Brian with a reluctant tone.<br>\r\n\"<i>I'm not going to like this.</i>\" you think.<br>\r\n\"It's what happened after the first week in the village.  The deal with Okil was that the men in his village would find mates.  After the first week, the women of Gawapa started running into men that seemed like their past selves.  They weren't the same guys of course, just people that they would find good suitors.  Of course the females were reluctant to pursue their newly found womanhood and rejected the men's advances.  But the chief's deal was that the women find mates.  After a month, not only did the new women of Gawapa have totally female brains, and biological cycles, they also had dark suitors show up.\"<br>\r\n\"I really don't like where this is going.\" you interrupt.<br>\r\n\"No, you shouldn't.  By the end of that year, all of the women had born children.  They tried their best to care for them, but could never really get down the proper way to raise a kid.  Half of the offspring died.  Whenever this happened, the dark mates would show up and knock up the women again until they managed to raise a kid to the age where they could have children of their own.\" Brain says before pausing.<br>\r\n\"And that's the story?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"That's most of it.  It still doesn't say that the curse is transferable.  So how you got it requires further study.\" says Brian.<br>\r\n\"And you'll look into that for me?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"Sure, it''ll be good research for my doctorate.\" says Brian<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" you say as you run out the door.<br>\r\n\"Where are you going?\" asks Brian.<br>\r\n\"To patch things up with my girlfriend.\" you say as you race to your next class to meet Emily.</span></div></div>",

You are managing to hear her at a better level, and despite the fact she's not talking about your relationship, you seem more interested in the trivial stuff she is saying, despite the fact that it is boring.  Very boring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you get to the theater, you're glad they have matinee's, not only do they help with your financial situation, but the film should be over by 7:30 at the latest, enough time to bring Emily home, before night can bring any changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get there, only to find out that the comedy you wanted to see has been sold out.  \"Sorry sir,\" says the ticket holder, \"but we do have one other film playing, <i>City Wolves</i>.\"<br>\r\n\"Do you want to see it?\" you ask Emily.<br>\r\n\"I don't care, lets just see something.\" she says, as she wraps her arm around yours.<br>\r\n\"I'll take two for...\"</span></div></div>",

As a bonus, Emily gets scared pretty easily, so she might turn to you for comfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take two for City Wolves.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"Very good sir, here are you tickets.\" says the theater employee.<br>\r\nYou walk into a very well lit theater, with almost no one else in it.  There is a couple in the corner, who will probably start making out the second the film starts.  And there are a group of nerds in the front row who are commenting on the directors past failures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ask Emily is she likes the concept of werewolves, and she outright says that she gets creeped out by the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can go into too much of a discussion, the trailers start, and some of them actually look really fun, there is an action movie about exploding cars that you'd be pretty pumped to see.  There is also a preview for a spy thriller and some war film.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe movie starts off, with a poorly lit scene taking place in what is clearly a studio lot.  Some guy dressed as a wolf is chasing a girl, it looks like something that would be more at home in a porn film than a horror flick.<br>\r\nThe next twenty minutes of the movie are about an idiotic girl trying to find her missing roommate.<br>\r\nOut of boredom, you turn to Emily and whisper, \"you know what is more interesting than this film, the feel of your lips.\" (Why are you acting like this?  This is completely out of character.)<br>\r\nThe line might have sounded romantic too, if your voice didn't crack halfway through the sentence.<br>\r\nEmily smiles, not being sure what to make of what just happened.<br>\r\nYou decide to give it a minute, before going in and kissing her, but before you can, the film completely changes the atmosphere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a bad transition, the film goes from taking place sometime at noon to a scene set in a cave after midnight.  The film is so poorly lit, it seems almost pitch black.  The nerds are laughing at the incompetency of the director, but all you notice is a sharp pain.  The lights in this theater are too dim, it's mimicking nighttime, and you can feel your body shifting.<br>\r\nThere is a pain in your stomach.  As the wolf on the screen lets out a howl, you let out a short, almost orgasmic moan.<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" asks Emily with some concern.<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, excuse me.\" you say are you stand up and rush towards the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leave the screening room and head towards the mens room.  The lighting is better there, and you stare at the mirror.  There are some definite differences.  You hair is longer, and your face seems sleeker.  Your hips are a bit wider too.  A lot of your body hair has receded, and your chin is as smooth as a baby's bottom.  You could still pass as a guy though, just a very effeminate looking one.  Maybe Emily won't notice.  You put your arm to your chest and lightly squeeze, they've defiantly grown a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's not too bad.  You might be able to finish the date with Emily.  Or you could cut your losses, leave now and call her the next day, telling her you went to the emergency room.</span></div></div>",

Still, if you transform anymore in the dark, it might cause Emily to become aware of your condition, and you're not sure if you want her knowing yet.  You wait at the end of the screening room and walk in when there is a daylight scene.  You whisper that you need to go, and drag her along with you.<br>\r\n\"What's the matter?  Did the film scare you?  I wasn't even scared of that movie.\" she says.<br>\r\n\"It's not that.  I...I am just not feeling well.\" you respond.  \"I'll walk you to your place, but then I have to turn in early.\" you say.<br>\r\nEmily kind of looks disappointed, and you feel bad, it is obvious that she was looking forward to having an evening with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry.\" you sigh.<br>\r\n\"No, it's okay, I can see it in your face, you look more frail than usual.\" she says, putting her hand on your cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily holds out her hand beside her, as you walk back to her place, an invitation to take it.  You sadly look at your feet, you don't want her to notice how your hands have remolded themselves, so you keep them in your jean pockets.  Things seem awkward until you get to her apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, Amy's out for the night. You could rest here if you wanted too.\" she says.<br>\r\n\"I really think that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can finish the sentence, Emily lifts herself up and kisses you.  It's a quick kiss, but much more than a peck.  At first you're stunned, your lips felt more comfortable while kissing her, but there was something missing, like kissing Emily was no longer natural for you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before you can really ponder this, it hits you that you received your condition from a kiss, maybe your condition in contagious.  You try to hide your worry in your eyes, but you are almost sure Emily sees it and is putting on a brave face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, I needed that.\" you say to her.<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you won't have some soup with me?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut all you can think about is what if you did something to her with that kiss.</span></div></div>",

It's not night yet, but it seems to be getting dark sooner than you expect.  You walk through the campus, as your eyesight starts to fade.  Thinking that you may need a drink, or a place to sit, you go into one of the buildings with a cafeteria.  It seems empty, but there are some seats and tables to lean on, as well as a pair of open washrooms.  Feeling like you might black out again, you wander into one of them, not even bothering to look at the sign on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stumble into the urine soaked room.  While it smells bad, the mirror seems to have been recently cleaned.  Not that you notice.  You quickly turn on the cold water and drink out of the tap.  Maybe that would hydrate you enough.  It actually seems to help, you have your sight sort of back, but now seem to have tunnel vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body seems to be getting instinctively used to this now.  You know the change it going to come, but this time, you can witness it in front of the mirror.  Your breasts expand a tiny bit more, creating a squeezing feeling from your nipples.  Your hips expand, and you quickly unzip your tight jeans to stop them from ripping.  Realizing what comes next, you lift your underwear forward to see your penis start to deflate, you'd never gotten a good look at this part of the process before and are horrified to see it go back into the bottom of your torso.<br>\r\nDesperate to stop this, you think of Emily, Amy, supermodels, all making out, in an attempt to get the blood circulating down there, in hopes to reverse the effect.  No luck, it disappears, into a slit, that forms lip-like things around it.  Even the hair down there has been altered slightly, it's shorter, and fuller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snap back the undies and zip the pants back up, but can't manage to get you top button to snap into place.  You look up and and notice that you face has already started to morph.  Your eyebrows are becoming more curved, and your hair is growing two inches a minute.  Looking into the mirror, you see that your eyes are becoming rounder, and the lashes longer.  You chin slightly recedes as you lips pout up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at the mirror, this is the first time you've seen this face in good lighting.  You'd hate to think it, but if this face didn't belong to you, you'd think it was hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.\" you say in a higher toned voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are about to leave, when the suddenly, the door swings open, and one of the nerds who was watching the movie walks in.<br>\r\n\"Excuse me miss, you're not allowed to be here.\" he says in a whiny voice.<br>\r\n\"I have just as much right to be here as the next guy.\" you snap at him.<br>\r\nHe just stares at you for a few seconds.  You can feel his eyes looking you over.<br>\r\n\"Well, are you going to piss or leave.\" you say in a surprisingly harsh tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nerd cautiously walks past you, and heads towards a urinal.  You lean against the counter and smile, as he stands there for a minute without any sound of piss coming from his area.  This guy can't pee with you there.  Maybe he has an erection.  You almost lean to the side to see if your theory is correct, but suddenly stop yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat are you doing?  You're in the guys bathroom trying to look at dicks.  Wow, this is a major identity crisis that you've gotten yourself into, and you don't really like where your new attitude is going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly move out of the room and head towards the outside.  The sun had just barely set over the horizon.  It's still light out, but that's only going to last another five minutes.  More time must have passed since you dropped Emily off than you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are about to go back to your dorm room, when you realize that Tom will be there tonight.  Which means that there is only one place open on campus that you can hang out in until he falls asleep.  The campus tavern.</span></div></div>",

You realize that you'll probably have to hide your vest somewhere, since no real women on campus wear vests that thick.  After thinking about throwing it into some bushes, you realize that something inside of you won't let the vest go.  You wrap it around your waist as best you can.  It looks stupid, so you just keep the windbreaker jacket on, hoping to hide it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you approach the bar, you defiantly notice that you are walking differently than you did early, there is a slight sway in your hips, and your legs are stepping right in front of each other as you walk.  You don't move too gracefully, though, as your shoes are now too big for you.  Your feet seem to have become significantly smaller, and you feel like you're about to step out of your shoes with every step you take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes some time, but eventually, you make it into the tavern, and it is surprisingly busy.  It's not crowded, there are lots of seats, but for a weeknight, there are twice as many people here as you thought there would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try not to draw attention to yourself, you just want to enough time to pass before you can sneak back into your room without Tom noticing.  Going up to the counter, you order one 'diet sprite,' for some reason, the fact that it is diet seemed important to you.  Which is odd, since you never thought about that stuff before.  The bartender returned with a glass mostly filled with ice.  You take a sip, and realize that the drink it watered down.  Whatever, as long as you bought something, they can't kick you out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find an empty table in the corner and start slowly sipping the drink, hoping that the guys there won't notice you.  Thankfully, there are a lot of hotter women there who seem interested in getting attention.  You seem safe for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout ten minutes pass, and you've finished a third of your drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you look up at the bar and see</span></div></div>",

Her hair is brushed, or gelled, you're not sure which.  She's wearing heels and a blouse that shows off her cleavage. She's still got that strange aura about her, you can't quite place it.  But she's smiling now.  You're not sure if she is wearing make up or not.  She's crossing her legs as she sits on the bar stool.

At least you hope that feeling is disgust, it couldn't be jealousy, could it?  No, it's disgust, it has to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't know whether to talk to her, or walk up and slap her.  (Wait, you mean punch her, right? Guy don't slap!) But it looks like she makes the choice for you.  Out of the corner of her eye, she sees you, but she must of looked at you at least three times.  Maybe she's having trouble recognizing your new figure.  She eventually swerves and waves at you, beckoning you to come over as she pats to stool beside her.  A smile escapes from her lips, but you can't tell if its genuine or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cautiously get up, as you take your drink and walk over to her.

And I'm pretty sure most guys can sense it, but can't really comprehend it.\"<br>\r\n\"And other girls.\"<br>\r\n\"No effect that I know of.  Of course, other girls tend to avoid me.

You have no idea how lonely it is just getting hit on guys all of the time.\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see what she's doing, she's trying to emit her dominance over you, and control the conversation.  You realize that if you're going to get any information out of her, you're going to have to start getting more aggressive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on, before you start gossiping about your love life, I want some answers.\" you say.<br>\r\nThe mysterious girl seems to think to herself for a few seconds, then pulls back her head as she takes a drink of whatever was in her glass.<br>\r\n\"Go ahead.\" she says with her eyelids half closed.<br>\r\n\"Who are you and what did you do to me?\" you ask.<br>\r\nThe girl raises her hand at the the bar tender and points to her empty cup, indicating she wants another drink.<br>\r\n\"I'm Alice, at least that's who I am now.\" she says fondling her breasts, \"About a month ago, my name was Alan...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice stops mid-sentence and looks at the bartender.  \"Who do you have to screw to get a drink around her?\" Alice yells.<br>\r\nAlice looks back at you, \"Sorry, I'm going to need to be a bit more drunk before I start telling you this whole story.\"<br>\r\nThe bartender comes with another drink, and Alice continues her story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was six foot five, ex-quarterback of my high school.  Didn't make the same position here, so I stayed off the team.  Girl friend and I separated, but I saw her with another guy, in a video on the internet, please don't ask for specifics.  Heartbroken, I went after the first chick to walk my way.  Her name was Jenny.  Invited me to her place, took a drink, whatever she had was strong, and probably illegal.  Woke up outside the buildings lobby, feeling sore.  Like something was missing.\"<br>\r\nAlice takes another long drink.<br>\r\n\"First night, I wrote off what happened as a fevered dream.  When I woke up with my manhood missing, I immediately went to the emergency room, but found by the time the doctors got around to seeing me, it had returned.  Threw me out for wasting there time.  When I turned in this, er, Alice, I returned to the hospital asking for help.  The nurse at the counter took one look at my wallet and called someone outside the hospital.  Either called the cops or the psych ward.  Got the hell out of there fast.  Next day I had returned to my previous self and reported my wallet stolen.  Unfortunately, the next day I had these, and it got more difficult from there.\" said Alice as she again points to her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you infected me because you thought you needed company?\" you say.<br>\r\n\"Not even close.\" says Alice, smiling seductively, \"I changed you to escape this life.\"<br>\r\n\"What?!\" you yell.<br>\r\n\"Trust me, I'll get to that, just let me continue my sob story...So there I was, with my new predicament, and I figured the one woman who could help me was my girlfriend.  Who after showing her my newly acquired breasts, told me a was a sick abomination, and threw me out of her life.  Apparently she was more religious than that video on the internet suggested.  But like any man, I tried everything in my power to find out what was going on.  After some embracing scientific experiments, that went nowhere, I turned to old magic.  Turns out that there is a way to get rid of the curse...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice stops for a minute, seeing how much you want to hear what comes next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have the cure, at least what I know if it, but that's going to cost you.\" says Alice.<br>\r\n\"What's it going to cost?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"A few things, first tell me you name.\"<br>\r\n\"Alex.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"Is that your male name or female one?\" Alice asks.<br>\r\n\"Both, I guess.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"That will make things easier for you.  Nice you meet you Alex.\" says Alice, as she reaches out her hand to shake yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hesitate, no clue what a handshake with her could mean later one.<br>\r\nSeeing your hesitation, Alice looks up at you and says, \"The handshake is part of what the cure is going to cost you.\"<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you. Alice.\" you say.  The handshake feels limp, like neither of you put any effort or force into it.<br>\r\n\"Please, you'll be calling me Alan soon.\" she says.</span></div></div>",

This is magic, and a powerful type, as far as I can tell.  I've read some stories that dealt with this situation, but nothing less than direct contact with a Greek God seems to cure it.

When you're friend abandoned you, you looked like you could use someone to talk to.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, she's not my friend, and she didn't abandoned me.  She's just talking a long time in the bathroom.\"<br>\r\n\"Actually, your friend left the bathroom, and gave us the thumbs up thirty seconds ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn around, to see that the door to the outside has just finished closing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Son of a bitch.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"Don't get you panties in a bunch, I think she was just trying not to ruin your groove.\"<br>\r\n\"I don't have a groove.\" you say in an awkward manner, caught off-guard by the comment.<br>\r\n\"Woman, you have so much groove that you don't even know it.\" says Dale in a sly manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Did he just call you woman? How degrading, he knows your name.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDale notices that the comment seems new to you, and shuts up for a second, giving you time to respond.<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the drink.\" you say, breaking the silence.<br>\r\n\"No problem, I'm a medical student, if you ever need a drink, come to me and I'll fix you up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Wait, what does that even mean, there are at least three ways you can read into that sentence. Whatever, at least he is trying to be nice.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at the clock on the wall, only five minutes seems to have passed.  Wow, when you're not a guy, talking to them is hard.<br>\r\n\"Do you like sports?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"I prefer theater.\" says Dale.<br>\r\n\"Ever been in a play?\"<br>\r\n\"Once in high school, was never good at it.  Plus I think I was the only straight man in it.\"<br>\r\nThis conversation seems to go on for an hour, but when you look up, you just realize that another five minutes has passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(This is getting pathetic, why are you still talking to Dale?  Maybe because you just need someone to talk to.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, Dale, I...\"<br>\r\n\"Have to go?  No worries, I can tell you're feeling a bit off tonight.\"  Tell you what, if you're feeling better tomorrow night, maybe we can go get a bite to eat.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, I...\"<br>\r\n\"You don't have to answer now, but here, I'm going to write down my phone number on this napkin,  if you change you mind by four o'clock tomorrow, give it a call.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay, but...\"<br>\r\n\"Ssshhh, no buts,\" Dale says softly pushing his index finger on your lips, \"sleep on it, then give me a call later.\"<br>\r\nDale then stands up and walks towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe's smooth, but maybe a little to smooth, almost like he rehearsed that last part.  How many woman did he get with that act?  He's probably not even a medical student, but a loser that hangs around campus, picking up young girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at the napkin disgusted, and crumple it up before sticking it into your back pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take your Shirley Temple and quietly sip on it for forty minutes until it disappears.  You look at the clock, maybe Tom turned in early.<br>\r\nYou don't have much time to think about that though, because the second your eyes are off the clock, the bartender is over to you again.<br>\r\n\"Rum and Coke, miss, courtesy of the gentleman in the other corner.\" the barkeep says.<br>\r\n\"You look at that corner to see an fat Korean waving at you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, looks like it's...</span></div></div>",

You quickly do some basic research on bra sizes, and find out what you'll need to look for when getting one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk down to the store, which is only three doors down from the bar you hung out in last night.  Trying to remain inconspicuous, you hold down your head and make your way towards the ladies section.  There is not too many people there, the store is very overpriced, and everything costs more, just because your campus logo is on all the items.  Eventually, you find a sports bra on sale for twenty-five dollars, and snatch it up.  You don't know the exact size of the thing, and if it will properly fit you, but it looks the least-frilly out of all of the clothing there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter paying for the thing, you slip into the janitors closet, and close the door.  You do your best to put it on, (you saw Emily do this a few times,) and once satisfied that it's secure, you put on a very thick sweater to hide the outlines of your new undergarment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start racing to class, and find that the bra is actually working.  Not only are you moving easier, your nipples are no longer bugging you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly you make it to class on time, and even manage to write a quiz you forgot you had.  Despite some small talk with your peers, there is very little or importance that happens.  The rest of your classes have a similar feeling, as you take notes, but your mind is clearly occupied elsewhere.  Despite thinking of so many different subjects, you actually manage to take good notes.  (Strange, you were never this good at multitasking before.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way back to your room, you have a feeling to check in the buildings lost and found, going with your feeling, you go over to it, and find an ugly green dress, which looks more like a table cloth than a piece of clothing.  Taking a quick look around to make sure no one sees you, you quickly stuff it in the bag you were given when you bought the bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn returning to your room, you slip the dress under your bed, and make dinner.  For some reason, you find making dinner is easier today, it's not more fun, but your putting more effort into it than usual.  You even have vegetables and fruit nicely chopped up.  Eating is a new experience too.  You notice that you are chewing more, and taking care not to get anything stuck in your teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems to be six thirty when the transformation happens.  And it happens fast, since most of you is already transformed.  You feel like someone is pulling your facial skin back, and rubbing your waist.  In less than a minute, you can pass as looking fully female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are still tired from the classes, but maybe you could try and find Alice tonight,  Of course you have enough problems without going out and finding more, maybe you should just stay in tonight.</span></div></div>",

You don't need to take your delicate petite figure out on campus after dark, and wander around aimlessly.  That's a disaster waiting to happen.  After taking off your sweater, you get out some ice cream, sit yourself down on your bed, and eat as you read through a paper you're supposed to hand in in a month.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout an hour passes, and you find that you're getting a lot of research done, but suddenly you're studies are interrupted as Tom opens the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" asks Tom in shock.<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" you let out. <br>\r\n\"Alex!?\" <br>\r\n\"Ya.\" you let out with a squeak.<br>\r\n\"Do I even want to know?\" asks Tom with a roll of his eyes.<br>\r\n\"I lost a bet.\" you say, with some pride in your lie.<br>\r\n\"That explains the wig and the bra, but not the voice---or the curves.\"<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your big answer is, yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n\"So are you secretly going out at night and getting hormone treatments, or trying a new drug?\"<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n\"Are you gay?

Pull it.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"You want me to pull on this?\" he says touching the loose ends of your hairs.<br>\r\n\"Be gentle, but yes.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'm pulling.\" he says with a yank.<br>\r\n\"Ouch.\" you say with a high pitched voice.<br>\r\nTom continues to pull.<br>\r\n\"Are you convinced yet?\" you say after the third tug.<br>\r\n\"How the hell do you keep this on, glue?\" Tom says before letting go.<br>\r\n\"It doesn't just pull off because it's natural---supernatural--I mean it's real.\"<br>\r\n\"And the bra?\"<br>\r\n\"It's for the breasts.\"<br>\r\n\"But we went swimming together once, you don't have breasts.\"<br>\r\n\"Then what are these?\" you say lifting your shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately regret lifting your shirt, you seemed to have done it completely on impulse, something not at all in character for you.  Thankfully is seems to have shocked Tom into believing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit! Are those real?\"  asks Tom.<br>\r\n\"Ya.\" you say as you blush.  (This is so humiliating.)<br>\r\n\"So your condition, is it---contagious?\" asks Tom.<br>\r\n\"I don't think it's airborne.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"And you're fixing this?\" asks Tom.<br>\r\n\"I'll be fixed soon.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"Good.  But I'm staying the hell away from you until then.\" Tom says.<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" you say getting up to hug him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom seems to jump back in terror.<br>\r\n\"I'll be with my girlfriend for the next two days. Just get better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't tell anyone.---Please?!\" you whine.<br>\r\n\"Just fix this before I return.\" says Tom in a more serious manner, as he exits your dorm room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, Tom took that better than expected.  You try to go back to get the assignment, but find yourself too distracted to accomplish anything.  You eventually give up, and turn on the radio, where you try your solitary version of karaoke with your new, more feminine voice.  You're pretty bad, at it, so you give your ears a rest, and sit back down, only to realize you've left the ice cream out and it has melted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stick what's left of the ice cream back in the freezer, clean up your side of the room a bit, and try looking up your condition on the internet.

You scratch the back of your head and notice that you have a lot more hair than you did yesterday morning.  You quickly feel it and find out that it goes down to your breasts.  A bit longer than it was last night.  You'tr kind of surprised, but not really, you're starting to get used to this routine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk to your mirror and find that your face now seems much more feminine than it was yesterday morning.  You rub a bit of dried drool off the side of your mouth and find that your skin is as soft now as it was when you were a baby.  You mind wanders to babies, they're so cute.  You realize where you mind is going with this and you throw some water on your face to stop it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou check out the rest of your body and find that your ass, has also changed.  In fact, everything about you is female.  Well, everything except for a noticeable bulge in your boxers.  But you're allowed, after all, you just woke up, and still having that part of you is understandably comforting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately as you turn the radio on, you hear that it will be unseasonable warm today.  As you look outside, you see that almost everyone is wearing shorts.  You try and all your pants but none of them fit your new hips.  They're too tight on the top, and too lose on the bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you look under bed to the ugly green dress.  It does look light enough, and you are already wearing a bra, so it's not like you're going to lose anymore self respect by wearing it.   After biting your lip, you decide to try it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe process is embarrassing, you squirm around in it inside, and eventually fit everything through the proper holes.  You then lean back to try and zip up the zipper at the back of the dress, and fall onto your bed.  You return to the mirror, and try to force yourself to smile.  You can't quite pull off looking sweet though.  Your hair is a mess, and even though the dress is long and hides them well, your legs are hairy.  You lift up your feet to see that your toenails are uncut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look more stressed out than anything.  It's official, you suck at being a woman.<br>\r\nYou try brushing your hair with your little comb for 20 minutes, but eventually give up and put it into a ponytail, using an elastic band.<br>\r\nYou put on some socks to hide your hairy ankles, and then throw on some sun glasses and a baseball cap.  This should stop anyone, even Tom from recognizing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab your books, that you put in the bag you got from the campus store and throw on some tennis shoes as you leave your room and head outside.</span></div></div>",

Did you just get an erection?  Realizing that if anyone else sees this, you'll look like a freak, you quickly run to the front of the line, past the place selling tickets, and into the cafeteria bathroom.  You wait for about two minutes in the stall for the erection to die down.  Once it does, you realize that your penis is smaller and has less feeling than usual.  You then figure that if you're in here already, you might as well pee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding your dress up while shaking your boxers down, you pee, but notice something odd.

Oh no, you must have instinctively went into the boy's bathroom by mistake.  \"I banged that chick so hard.\" one of them says.  \"Oh man, I could have sex with the women I see.\" says the other.  \"Even the fat ones?\" says the first guy, coming closer. \"Especially the fat ones.\" says the other friend.<br>\r\nWow, these boys must have just graduated high school, and are waiting for maturity to come in.  You don't ever recall talking like this when you where a male on campus.<br>\r\n\"I call bull, you never even kissed a girl.  Unless it's your sister.\" says the one guy.<br>\r\n\"Hey man, my word is good.  You just haven't seen me with the right woman yet.  I bang those things like crazy.\"<br>\r\n(Things?

Looking at your reflection, you now find yourself thinking that you look kind of hot.  It's much easier to appreciate your new figure now that you know it's not permanent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, there is a knock at the door.  You quickly throw on a shirt and answer.<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" you say opening the door.<br>\r\nA shocked looking Emily is standing there.

Also, that bulge at your waste has now disappeared, the sun must have gone down.<br>\r\n\"Look, I'm sorry.  It just hit me what this looks like.  Trust me, it's not.\" you say as you force yourself to laugh.<br>\r\n\"Then what is it?\" she says.<br>\r\n\"I'm his cousin.\" you say.  desperate that she'll believe it.<br>\r\n\"His cousin?\" she asks.<br>\r\n\"Can't you see the resemblance?\" <br>\r\n\"Now that you mention it, you do look a lot alike.---Sorry. I jumped the gun.\" she says.<br>\r\n\"It's okay, I'm just here for the night, one of my friends stood me up, and this is cheaper than a hotel.\"<br>\r\n\"Wow, I mean, I was ready to claw your eyes out.\" Emily says as she sits down.<br>\r\n\"You probably love me...I mean him, to do that.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"I guess, ya.\" says Emily.<br>\r\n\"I think he loves you to.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"You think so?\" she says, there is a sad look in her eyes.<br>\r\n\"Oh ya, your all he talked about once he picked me up and drove me over here.

Go!\" you say, trying hard to match her excitement.<br>\r\n\"You should come! and get ready with me tomorrow!\" she says.<br>\r\n\"NO!\" you yell out without thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe atmosphere has calmed down a bit.  You just realized what happened, and that you probably insulted her.  You try and look at her with understanding eyes.<br>\r\n\"I'm leaving tomorrow morning, and there's only two tickets.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"Oh, can't you just stay, and extra night?\"<br>\r\n\"No, I've got an important meeting tomorrow.

Don't.  Do me a favor and don't tell him I was here.  I want to seem more surprised tomorrow.\" she says, as she leaves.<br>\r\n\"I enjoyed getting to know you a bit.\" you say waving.<br>\r\n\"Me too.  You're one of the few girls I don't feel I have to be defensive with.\" she says as she walks down the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou close the door, and lay back on your bed, looking up at the ceiling.  You can't believe what a close call you just had.  That conversation could have become so disastrous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at your breasts; they are nice when they're temporary, and still.  Still, you won't miss walking around with them, or wearing a bra.  You look out the window, the sun has gone down.  You can smell the night air though, which is odd, since the window is closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh well, if Brian was right, you could defeat this curse by morning.</span></div></div>",

But first, you have to call Emily with the good news that you're taking her to the dance tonight.  Emily acts surprised and very pleased that you bought the tickets.  You know she knows, but she's putting a bit of effort into putting on a show for you, so you play along.  Last things she says before she hangs up is that she'll make it worth your while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leave to meet Brian, at his room.  You're beginning to think that he doesn't ever leave that place.<br>\r\nAfter exchanging niceties, you try several experiments with the lights, to see if you can force a transformation.  Nothing.  The second you realize this, a state of ecstasy temporary comes over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try and think if you've learned anything from the situation, and realize that all you learned was how great it is to have a penis.  Something that if you've read Emily's signals correctly, you'll be making some good use of before tomorrow's sun comes up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking of this, you get dressed up, and since you're a guy, getting ready takes under a half hour as you prepare for the dance.  Walking to Emily's place, you come across the spot where you ran into Alice.  strange enough, there seems to be a rose growing very near where she kissed you.  Not liking the rose there, you pick it up.  And since you already have the rose, you figure that you'll give it to Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk to Emily's room, you knock on her door, as Amy answers. \"Alex, wait here.

Wearing a knee length skirt, with a slit up the side, and nice leather pumps, It looks like this is going to be a good night for you.<br>\r\n\"Hey handsome.\" she says with a wink.<br>\r\n\"Hello gorgeous.\" you respond.<br>\r\n\"Ready to blow this dump and steal the night.\"<br>\r\n\"Am now.\" you say as you grab her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you start walking, but before you hail a cab, you prick yourself on the rose.  \"Ouch.\" you say.  You look at it and don't see any thrones.  But nevertheless, you find yourself sucking blood from the figure you cut cut.<br>\r\n\"I got this for you. but now I'm thinking it might be dangerous.\" you say to Emily as you hold out the rose.<br>\r\n\"No girl has ever regretted taking a rose.\" she says as takes it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch.\" she says as she also cuts herself on the rose.<br>\r\n\"Alright, screw this thing.\" you say as you throw it into the bushes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen suddenly, you look up in shock...</span></div></div>",

(Ew!) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou keep looking, you see one of the nerds from the movie theater.  Wow, even they have girlfriends.<br>\r\nEventually, you come across Brian, who is dancing with some girl you've never seen before.<br>\r\n\"Brian!\" you say.<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, I'm in the middle of a dance.\" Brian replies.<br>\r\n\"It's me Alex!\" you say.<br>\r\n\"Who is Alex?\" asks the girl dancing.<br>\r\n\"Aaaand, you ruing the moment.\" says Brian to you.<br>\r\n\"Sorry.\" you reply.<br>\r\n\"So you're...\"<br>\r\n\"Alex.\"<br>\r\n\"With the...\"<br>\r\n\"Gender issues.  Ya.  Look, I...\"<br>\r\n\"Wow, you clean up nice.  I didn't even recognize you.  In fact, I thought you were cured.\"<br>\r\n\"Who is Alex?\" asks his date.<br>\r\n\"Student I'm tutoring.\" he replied.<br>\r\n\"Look, I'm not me, I'm Emily, my girlfriend.\" you reply.<br>\r\nSuddenly, Emily, catches up with you.<br>\r\n\"Hey Alex.\" says Brian.<br>\r\n\"Um...hi.\" Emily giggles.<br>\r\n\"Can you help us?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian thinks for a moment.<br>\r\n\"Probably, but not tonight.  This just sounds like an overused plot device. Body swaps happen in fiction all of the time.  99% of the time they're temporary.  Come see me at noon tomorrow, and I'll help you out.\" he says.<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" you say hugging him.<br>\r\n\"Okay, cut that out.\" says Brian, \"I still find this whole situation creepy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian than walks up to his date, and continues dancing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what do we do now?\" asks Emily, as she looks down at you with your body.<br>\r\n\"I don't know, Brian says he can probably fix it tomorrow.\" you tell Emily.<br>\r\n\"That's good, but what do we do until then?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, you did seem to want to be at this dance.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"A new slow song is starting.\" says Emily.<br>\r\n\"And no handsome guy has asked me to dance yet.\" you respond light heatedly.<br>\r\n\"Oh, where are my manners, you delicate young goddess.\" Emily says, holding your hand up, as an invitation to take it.<br>\r\n\"Why thank you sir.\" you say, as you accept.<br>\r\nYou put your arms around Emily's neck as she grabs your hips and pulls you closer.  Your breasts squeeze against Emily, as her penis grows, pushing out her pants against you.<br>\r\n\"Sorry.\" she says.<br>\r\n\"It's okay.\" you say as you rest your head on Emily's shoulder.<br>\r\n\"Whose leading?\" she asks.<br>\r\n\"You are.  I don't want people coming back from this dance thinking I'm gay.\" you say.<br>\r\nYou start to sway to the music, as you close your make up heavy eyes.<br>\r\n\"Alex?\" says Emily.<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" you say.<br>\r\n\"You look pretty.\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" you reply as you continue dancing with your eyes close.<br>\r\nIn your head, you imagine that you're at this dance in your appropriate body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it could be worse.\" you think, as you see Dale going home with Alice out of the corner of your eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Even Tom is there with his girlfriend of the week, you talk to him, and tell him that it's safe to move back in with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA week later, everything goes back to normal, except that Amy now dating that fat Korean guy who hangs out at the campus tavern.  You even say Alan once or twice walking around campus.  Turns out he's mostly male during the day, but has a higher voice than most. (And you're too polite to ask him why that is.)  He still has girl issues at night, but he's getting better at dealing with them, and is taking prescription testosterone medicine.  With any luck, he'll be cured by the time he graduates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat guy you dealt with in the incident in the washroom, apparently dropped out of school the next week, but there is a woman who looks very similar to him who is known for calling everyone 'bitch.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for you?  Well, life isn't bad, you find yourself occasionally crying at sappy movies more than you should, but otherwise it's like this whole thing never happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA year passes, and the adventures of that week seem like little more than a bad dream, and you have no psychological scars to show for it.

She still hasn't started breathing properly.<br>\r\nYou nod.<br>\r\n\"The idea of negative and positive energies.  Masculine and feminine energies.  Mine were being transferred to you.\" she continues.<br>\r\n\"I notice that part.\" you say in a bitchy voice as you push together your breasts.<br>\r\n\"My feminine energy was steadily draining since I met you.  I could almost pass as a male during the day again.---Now they stopped.---What did you do?\"<br>\r\n\"I kissed a guy.\"<br>\r\n\"Why?  Why? would you do that?\"<br>\r\n\"He was asking for it, it felt right, I was scared, why do I do anything?  Take your pick of an excuse.  Point is it's done.\"<br>\r\n\"But I had maybe a day left before I was normal again.\"<br>\r\n\"If you didn't play all coy and mysterious, maybe I'd have been understanding and gave you that extra day.\" you say as she sobs.<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry.--I'm so sorry.  It's this curse, the longer you have it, the more it takes control, the less sense you make of it.  The less it lets you tell people about it.\"<br>\r\n\"So at the tavern, what were you doing?  You seemed to be enjoying yourself.\"<br>\r\n\"You'll never understand now, but I have my reasons for that.\" she manages to see before breaking down into tears again.<br>\r\n\"You want some water?\" you say.<br>\r\nAlice nods her head as you get her a glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you return from getting the glass, Alice is nowhere to be found.

You open your eyes, feeling a noticeable change.<br>\r\nSuddenly, you whip off the covers to find yourself fully naked.  (Strange, you don't remember falling asleep that way.)  however, you're happier to find that you're your old self.  You feel around your external anatomy, and find out that everything is back where it should be.  (Everything!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk to the mirror, and notice that even your walk is back to normal.  You stretch in front of the mirror admiring what is there.  Finally, that nightmare is over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou call Emily, and 'surprise' her with the news that you got two tickets to tonight's dance.  And you love the sound of your deeper voice.  Emily reacts the way she did last night, squealing and putting on a show for you.  You know the excitement and surprise is faked, but you play along.  After all, she is doing this to try and make you feel better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at your schedule.  No classes today, you can do whatever you want.<br>\r\nLife is treating you well.  You feel great, like you could punch through a wall for the fun of it.  You don't know if you're overcompensating or if your body is dealing with a sudden re-emergence of testosterone, but you want to do something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you do.  Going out for a run, which quickly becomes a jog, that devolves into a walk, you come across Tom.  \"I'm back, so you can move in.\" you say to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day is pretty boring.  Most the girls are out getting ready for the dance, and you stay outdoors, soaking up all the sun you can, just to be on the safe side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost the afternoon is spent trying to find the right set of clothes to make you irresistible to Emily.  Once you get a set that you're satisfied with, you grab a breath mint, and head down to Emily's place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knock on the door, as Amy answers.  \"Alex, wait here.  She'll be ready in a minute.\" she says as she closes the door in your face.<br>\r\n\"Thanks Amy.\" you think yourself, with a hint of sarcasm.<br>\r\nThree minutes later, Amy opens the door a crack and whispers, \"Sorry, she just wants this night to be magical.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" you say as she opens the door.<br>\r\n\"Your date!\" shouts Amy as she sweeps her arm towards Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWOW!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily looks like three hundred bucks, probably because she spent around $100 on hair and make-up.  Wearing a knee length skirt, with a slit up the side, and nice leather pumps,  It looks like this is going to be a good night for you.<br>\r\n\"Hey handsome.\" she says with a wink.<br>\r\n\"Hello gorgeous.\" you respond. <br>\r\n\"Ready to blow this dump and steal the night.\"<br>\r\n\"Am now.\" you say as you grab her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a cab across campus, (ya, you're splurging tonight,) you reach the line and wait in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce into the dance, you find that it hasn't really started yet.  The lights are dim, but on, the music is quiet, and a lot of people are just chatting with each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Tom.\" you say after running into your friend.<br>\r\n\"Hey Alex.  Find the cure?\" he asks.<br>\r\n\"Ya, doctors cleared me.\" you lie.<br>\r\n\"That's good, so, you're back to normal?\"<br>\r\n\"Ya, and I'm going to need the room to myself tonight.\" you tell him.<br>\r\n\"It's cool.  I'll just stay at Katey's.\"<br>\r\n\"Is she you're girlfriend I haven't met yet?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"One of them.\" Tom jokes.<br>\r\nThe conversation devolves from there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the music stops and the DJ speaks into the microphone, that can be heard all across the gym.<br>\r\n\"Thank you all for coming on such short notice.  But the sun is about to go down, and it's time for out first slow dance of the night, so ladies grab your man, and we'll start to get this ball rolling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you know it Emily grabs to and pulls you right up against her.  She presses her breasts against your torso.  You're not used to being this tall again, not that you're complaining.  she then presses her groin against your own, as she wraps her arms around your neck.  You make eye contact, and the song begins to play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't quite recognize the song, but after the second verse of it, the lights start to noticeably dim, as the sun goes down behind you.<br>\r\nYou it didn't enter your mind all day, (it was probably full of too much testosterone) but Alice looked fully female at night, even after she kissed you.  However, she was cursed longer than you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you look into Emily's eyes, not is the moment of truth, are you finally rid of this thing, or are you still under its influence.</span></div></div>",

If Alan is telling the truth, this is some information that you don't want to pass on.<br>\r\nAfter what seems like fifteen minutes in line, standing next to a man who is twice your size, you hear the person at the ticket counter yell that the event is sold out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell that was a waste of fifteen minutes.  You walk away from the cafeteria area, as you see Alan giving you an evil grin.<br>\r\nNow what?<br>\r\nThere's always Dale, but you sense there's something off about that guy.  You could always try and find another way to win tickets though.  The campus is always holding crappy little events to give away prizes.</span></div></div>",

Thankfully, the guy keeps to himself.<br>\r\nYou lift up your armpits and take a whiff. Yuck.  It didn't really bother you last night, but today, your body odor is really upsetting you.<br>\r\nGoing into your bathroom, you decide if you should put on some cologne, or take a shower first.  You decide against taking a shower, because that could risk waking Tom.  Looking at the mirror, you feel bad about how messy your hair is.  It's all over the place, there are some loose ends, and you don't want to walk outside like that.  Other girls would probably think you spent the night as a strange man's house, and for some reason, you don't feel like getting that sort of reputation.  (Seriously?  Why do you care what other girls think?!  You're not going to stay like this for long, right?  Right?!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter brushing the ends of your hair, you find another elastic band, and try hard to put it into a ponytail.  After about thirteen minutes of failing and making a fool of yourself, you decide to look presentable enough to be seen in public.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking back to your bedroom, you look at your 'borrowed' dress, and purchased sports bra.  Holding them both up to you, you can't bring yourself to put them back on.  You tell yourself that it's because you are still a man inside, and you reject those items of clothing.  But really, you just don't feel like wearing the same outfit two days in a row.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab a light white dress shirt that you used to wear to job interviews.  It may be cold, but at least it's not made of wool, and will make your nipples will be slightly more comfortable when they rub against it.  You then throw on a pair of black pants, and hold them up by tightening your belt around them.  For warmth, you put on your windbreaker, as you head out, silently closing the door, so that you do not wake up Tom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second the door shuts, you realize something, Tom isn't in your room.  You quickly reopen the door and take a peak inside, there is no one there. (What the hell?) You have a sudden urge to get as far away from your room as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk out of your building, you begin to notice something, your body seems to be guiding you.

After a short ten minute wait, the bus comes and you all get on.

You don't know why, and are now beginning to think that there might be something wrong with the way you look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, signal you want off the bus, stand up, and start pressing against people to make your way towards the exit.  You brush against five people before finally leaving the crowded piece of public transit.  As you exit the bus, you find yourself in the run down part of town.  Looking around, you see that in walking distance is a dollar store and a Goodwill location.  Your body starts walking towards Goodwill.</span></div></div>",

You try to stay in the woman's section, not because the stuff there interests you, but more because there is less of a chance one of the weirdos would walk towards you.<br>\r\nPretending to be distracted, you look through the one piece dresses.  Many of them look like prom dresses from the nineties.  One of them looks like it came right out of the seventies, complete with satin flowers folded into the torso.  One of the dresses was a colour that could only be described as puke green.  They all look stupid.  And they're all around 30 dollars, a price that you could probably afford.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing your eyes, you randomly pick three, and race to the change room so that the weirdos have less of a chance to look at you.  After finally figuring out how to slip into the one piece dresses, (turns out you slip in through the bottom,) you find out that only the blue one fits you.  You look at the mirror, in the tight room, and agree that you look presentable.  Which is fine, as you probably don't want to draw attention to yourself, either by looking to good or bad.  Blue is a safe masculine colour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting the other dresses back, you browse through the shoe section, and notice some lovely sandals.  (They look comfortable.)  But something inside of you won't let you buy them to wear with the dress.  Instead you find your eyes wandering over to the heeled footwear.  (Oh look, blue ones!)  A pair of shoes in the corner actually look like they were made to be worn with the blue dress in your hand.  You look at the five dollar price tag and sigh.  (Although a little voice in the back of your mind lets out a joyous squeal.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn line, you wait in front of an old woman who is close to being blind and cannot remember her card's PIN, and are in front of a tall, dark, and fat man who is breathing heavily.  Finally, you are about to buy the dress when the cashier looks at you and says \"Oh, I bet you will look so lovely in this.\"<br>\r\n\"It's for my sister.\" you instinctively lie.  \"But thanks.\" you finish, trying to be polite and seem like you weren't offended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe total of your purchase comes to under $40.  You pay for it with some money you had kept hidden in your closet from Tom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run to catch the bus until you realize that the cashier didn't give you a bag.  Walking onto the bus, you feel like a fool holding onto the dress and shoes with one hand, and holding onto a poll with the other.  You feel the eyes of everyone looking at you, as they're probably imagining how dorky you'll look in that dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make one more unimportant stop before returning to your apartment.</span></div></div>",

You keep glancing at other girls' hairstyles and thinking which one would look best on you, and how practical some styles might be for you to try out for tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you catch yourself about what you were thinking, and attempt to stop it.  You notice other people giving you weird looks as you carry the dress to your building.  You start trying to think of manly things like football, and baseball, and fixing cars, but find yourself having to stop when you mind starts to focus on how good their bodies look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you give in, and start judging other women as you go back towards your room.  Some other girl starts walking beside you, and you notice that she is examining your dress.  You look her over, and notice that she is wearing blue nail polish, that's the same shade as your dress.

Looking to the side, you notice that Tom isn't there, and hasn't really been in your life much lately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back at the spread out dress on your bed sheets, you wonder why you keep looking at this thing.<br>\r\nYou look at the time and realize that the dance starts in three hours.  Elsewhere, girls in the campus are getting together and helping each other get ready.  Here, you are by yourself, with no real clue what you are doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is an empty feeling inside you, and you can't explain it, you just put the dress up to the mirror, and decide that now is the best time to get ready.  You don't even want to, but you decide that you should probably practice wearing and moving around in this thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, you throw on the dress, and look in the bathroom mirror.  You look incredibly gay in this lighting.  You force a smile, but still come off looking more masculine than you should in this thing.  (It's got to be the lighting.)  You stop yourself, when you just realized how scary it was that thinking of yourself as masculine was a bad thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at yourself in the mirror, you noticed that this dress was designed to be worn without a bra.  Thankfully, your breasts are small enough that they fit loosely in the dress, however, they aren't held well in there.  If you're not careful, they'll move around all night, and bring some unwanted attention to you.  Just something you note to yourself, before you try on your shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you put on your newly bought shoes, you take a minute to get your balance.  High heeled dress shoes are probably one of the stupidest inventions that mankind ever made.  As you stand fully erect, you wobbled a bit, and put your arms out to the side to balance yourself.  This changes the weight distribution of your body again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter three failed attempts to walk in the things.  You realize what your problem was, you are trying to walk like a man.  Feeling stupid, you give it another shot, and sway your hips a bit as you walk.  Heel, toe, heel, toe.  And much to your disappointment it works.  If you practiced long enough, you'd probably look elegant moving in these.  However, you don't care enough to practice anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext step is deciding what to do about your ankles, they're hairy.  But you shaving really seems more of a hassle than it's worth.  Initially, you decide to wear long socks, as you pull them up to the midpoint of your calf muscle.  But as you look down at them, you realize that they look stupid.  Even you wouldn't be seen wearing these things with your heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide it'll probably be easier to go unshaven, since no guy is going to focus on your legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter stealing some of Tom's gel to keep your hair from going all over the place, you decide that you look presentable enough to call Dale.<br>\r\nLooking at his number, you take a deep breath and phone the guy.</span></div></div>",

A black substance leaks out, and the man falls backwards on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKicking the stranger in the testicles, (which feels very weird and dirty when you don't have shoes on,) you leave the piece of trash as you go to see if Tom is alright.</span></div></div>",

This is wrong!  Stop!</i>\" you think as you start to lift the covers.<br>\r\n\"Jesus.\" says Tom pulling the covers away from you and wrapping them around himself.<br>\r\n\"You're not joking.\" he gasps as he jumps up on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Judging what I saw under there, you don't want me too be...just...joking.\" you say in a seductive voice.<br>\r\n\"<i>STOP ME TOM!</i>\" you think.<br>\r\n\"Dude, I will punch you.\" says Tom.<br>\r\n\"<i>DO IT! PUNCH ME HARD! TIE ME UP!</i>\" you think. You're not sure if your body is getting aroused by those thoughts.<br>\r\n\"You can't hit a girl. Especially not one that wants you.\" you say, crawling across his bed while licking your lips.<br>\r\n\"You're not Alex!  What have you done with Alex?!\" Tom shouts as he circles to the other side of the room.<br>\r\n\"You can call me Alex, you can call me sexy, you can call me lover, or even bitch!  For you, handsome, I'll be whoever you want.\"<br>\r\n\"Just for the record, this is SOOO wrong man.\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn hearing the word man, you slowed down, if just for a second.  You then pounce, on Tom, as you try and tear off the sheets around his waste.  <br>\r\nBut as you land, Tom flips the light switch on as he bangs himself against the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the light goes on, you regain most your control.<br>\r\n\"Holy crap! Are you okay?\" you ask sincerely.<br>\r\n\"Just stay away from me!\" shouts.<br>\r\n\"No, I'm me again!  I mean I've got my self control again! It was the darkness!\" you promise him.<br>\r\n\"You expect me to believe that BS about darkness?\" he asks rubbing his head.  <br>\r\n\"Look at me! It's not the strangest explanation I've given this week!\" you say pointing to your breasts and underwear.  In the light, you realize that you're topless, and there is a wet stain on the bottom of your briefs.<br>\r\n\"What happened to you?\" Tom says in disgust.<br>\r\n\"I...I don't know.\" you say breaking down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs this what you're destined to become?  A sex-craved slut with little self control?  You don't know if you could live with yourself.  You don't know if being intimate with others would alter them as well.  You feel unsure, weak, and in the back of your mind, you hear the stranger's laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrying on the floor, you see that one of the knifes in the kitchen had fallen during your episode.  You look at it, at your wrists, and at Tom's underwear.  You go back to looking at the knife and your wrists.  Finally, more tears bust through, as the second wave of your emotional breakdown hits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold me Tom!  Hold me!\" you sob.<br>\r\nTom does, and for a moment, you feel comforted being held in his arms.  For a second, you don't know if it's the curse's doing or your own.  But a moment later is when you realize, you can no longer tell where the curse ends and you begin.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cry harder, as your toes begin to rub against Tom.</span></div></div>",

The first time I felt compelled to do my hair in a bun.

Located on the main floor of your building.  You lock the door from the inside, and lay down to cry.  This explains why Emily seemed so distant over the last week, and why Tom was almost never around.  They were cheating on you behind your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou eventually cry until you have no more energy to cry, and pass out from exhaustion.<br>\r\nYou wake up to a light passed it's way through a window and onto you through the open door.  As the warmth of the sun moves its way over you, you feel your body slowly changing, until your chest is as flat as a pancake and there is a bulge sticking out of your waste area.  You feel the dried drool on the side of your mouth as your eye's adjust to see that the janitor is taking a picture of you with his cellphone camera.

And about after five seconds of starting to struggle, something kicks in in your brain, and you just go with it.<br>\r\n\"What was that for?\" you ask, trying to act defensive.<br>\r\n\"To keep your mind off the pain.\" says Dale.<br>\r\nDale then leaves to call a taxi, and pays for your ride back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning you wake up in your bed, hiding under the covers as Tom snores on the other side of the apartment.<br>\r\nNoticing that you haven't changed back, you realize the reason why your body didn't transfer the curse; you had feelings for Dale.  You shudder as images of the erotic dream you had last night start to come back to you. (Oh please let it just be a dream!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if you manage to pass the curse after this, you'll never be able to look your reflection in the eye again. Sore, sweaty, and humiliated, you accept defeat for today, as feelings for the relationship you had with Emily start to fade from your mind.</span></div></div>",

It made you feel humiliated, vulnerable, like a weak little girl.  You mind floods with strange thoughts as you walk outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk outside in the rain, you hear the sound of someone repeatedly getting punched in the stomach.

And it didn't have the desired affect at all\" you say. \"It's all part of being a woman I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny looks up at you.  \"You honestly can't tell.\" she says.<br>\r\n\"Tell what?\" you ask.<br>\r\nPenny grabs her chest.  \"These are fake.\" she says.<br>\r\nJust then, it suddenly clicks in your head what's up with Penny.<br>\r\n\"But you're skin looked so smooth, and I didn't see any sign of facial hair.\"<br>\r\n\"Hormone treatments.\"<br>\r\n\"And down here?\" you ask, pointing towards your own waist.<br>\r\n\"Pre-Op\" admits Penny.  \"But the guys can still tell, they can always tell.

It's not just playing dress up.\"<br>\r\n\"I know.\" she says with a sob.<br>\r\n\"You have to judge each stranger as a possible threat, you can't walk home alone most the time, other girls are totally bitchy to you behind your back, and only the strange guys seem attracted to you.\"<br>\r\n\"I can live with that.\" Penny says.<br>\r\n\"No, really, I think you should just stick to being a cross dresser.  You'll find a wife that loves and understands you, plus you'll have all of the fun that girls have, with none of the baggage.\"<br>\r\n\"It's not the same.  You don't know how lucky you are.\" says Penny.<br>\r\n\"If given the option, I'd rather be a father.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Wow, girl talk is hard, and awkward, especially, when no real girls are involved.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think for a second, you're guessing that Penny (if that is her real name) wouldn't mind being in the predicament that you're in, but at the same time, didn't either Brian or Alice mention something about transfer of masculine and feminine energy.

The male me, I mean!\" you say.<br>\r\n\"Of course you are.\" says Alice, leaning against you, \"and what a man you are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean by that?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"I mean you're my man.\" says Alice, as she holds up her hand, showing a wedding ring.  You look at your left hand, and see a similar ring.<br>\r\n\"Wait? What?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice looks sad that you're not happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is that damn curse!\" you tell her.<br>\r\n\"Honey, that was two years ago.  And don't call it a curse, that's such a negative connotation, call it a spell.\"<br>\r\n\"I have to go for a walk you say.\"<br>\r\n\"I'll come with you.\" says Alice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk, you find that you have a cellphone in your pocket.  You look at the menu, and find out that Brian's name is still on this thing.<br>\r\nYou call him up as you're walking.<br>\r\n\"Brian, this is Alex.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"That time of the month again?\" he asks.<br>\r\n\"What?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"You look your memory once every month, and call me with the same damn questions.\" he responds.<br>\r\n\"Really?!\" you say, half terrified, and half excited.<br>\r\n\"Yes, you're married to Alice, yes, it's part of the curse, the more time goes by, the more docile she becomes.  It's all part of the curse.  It was supposed to make her find a good husband, and that series of events lead her to ending up with you.\"<br>\r\n\"So how did the curse effect me?\" you ask.<br>\r\nAlice has put her arm around your free one, and looks at you lovingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, as far as I can tell, the blackouts are a glitch, whoever created this curse had no idea that it could ever turn in on itself.\"<br>\r\n\"So, it's just the blackouts?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"No, it's more than that.  Most the time when I see you, you don't act like yourself.  It's only around this time of the month when you seem to act like the person you were when we first met.\" Brian tells you.<br>\r\n\"So...\"<br>\r\n\"So, I've been researching any and all possible explanations in my spare time. To help you out\" he tells you.<br>\r\n\"But...you're going to say but, since there is always a but.\"<br>\r\n\"But...you seem happy most days.  Most people who don't know how you met think you're the perfect couple.\" says Brian.<br>\r\n\"You're freaking me out.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"Oh, Amy says hi!\" says Brian.<br>\r\n\"Hi!\" says Amy over the phone.<br>\r\n\"Anyways, I've got to go.  There is only so many times I can tell you the same thing before I got crazy.\" says Brian as he disconnects the call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brian is so sweet.\" says Alice, as she pulls herself closer to you.<br>\r\n\"He is.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"It's getting cold.  I'm going to head back.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"That's a great idea. I know just how to warm you up.\" says Alice, and she puts her hand in your back pocket, and rubs herself up against you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe'll, it's far from perfect, in fact, you later found out that Emily had dumped you for Tom shortly after that night at the dance.  But you took comfort in knowing that this would only last until Brian found a cure, or you blacked out again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlus you at least got to wear the pants in the relationship.</span></div></div>",

And at least you have the excuse that you're not in your proper body.  Looking nervous, like he's going to accidentally offend someone, the guy keeps a good meter away from you at all times.<br>\r\nYou really don't mind dancing with this loser, there is no way he's going to try and make a move on you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the song continues, you accidentally bump each-others behinds.  \"Sorry.\" he says in a pathetic tone.  The guy is obviously not comfortable with his sexuality. Which some girls might find cute in early high school, but this is university.  The song ends, and he walks back over to the corner.  You decide to walk back with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want to give me another dance?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"It's okay.\" says the guy looking at his feet.<br>\r\n\"Want to talk for a bit?\" you  ask.<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" he says in a sad voice.<br>\r\n\"You don't look like you do this much.\" you say<br>\r\n\"I don't.\" says the guy.<br>\r\n\"But you're here.

One of the guys in the group beckons the person you're talking with to join them.  The guy gives a hand signal, saying he's not interested.<br>\r\n\"Do you want to impress them?\" you say.<br>\r\n\"What?\" he asks.<br>\r\n\"Do you want to impress your friends?\" you repeat.<br>\r\n\"How?\" says the guy.<br>\r\n\"Dance with me, and throw me around.\"<br>\r\n\"I have no practice.\" he responds, twiddling his thumbs.<br>\r\n\"Well, that makes two of us.\" you say, pulling him into the crowd again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother fast song starts.<br>\r\n\"Put your hand on my waste.\" you tell the guy.<br>\r\n\"What?!\" The guy asks.<br>\r\n\"Just press against it, I'll do all the work.\" you tell him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a short time, you start swaying your hips back and forth.  You then raise your arms over your head as you swing your hair.  You have no idea if this is sexy, but if a girl ever did this you you, you'd notice.<br>\r\n\"Now move your hands up the side.: you tell him.<br>\r\nMeekly, the guy does as ordered.<br>\r\n\"Too, high.\" you tell him as he nears your ribcage. \"Go lower.\" you tell him as you sway a lot more.<br>\r\nAs you heat the song about to reach it's end. You look him in there eyes, and say \"Now catch me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou purposely trip on your heels and fall, right into him.  Panicking, the guy reaches out to grab you.  As you lean back, you look up and make eye contact with him.  He unleashes a giant smile.<br>\r\n\"Ya!\" two of his friends say, and a few more of his buddies give him a small clap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Why did I just do that?</i>\" you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around to make sure you can't see Dale, you force the little awkward guy to have the next slow dance with you.<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" he says, blushing.<br>\r\n\"Hey, I just brought out what was in you. You just have to decide if you want to go with it, or go back to being a shrinking violet.\"<br>\r\n\"I...\" he says, but can't finish his sentence.<br>\r\nYou pull yourself closer the the guy, making sure your breasts push up against him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Why am I doing this?</i>\" you think.  Are you slowly losing control of yourself?<br>\r\n\"It's cool, you're young, and there is so much potential in you.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"Really?\" says the guy, more embarrassed than anything else.<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" you whisper in his ear in the most sexual tone that you could.  You mind seems split into two parts, one is terrified, and the other is struggling not to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe current song is wrapping up, there are only a few chords left.  You can feel the guy relax his grip on you.<br>\r\n\"One more thing.\" you whisper to the guy.<br>\r\n\"What?\" he asks in earnest.<br>\r\n\"This.\" you say, as you land a gentle kiss on his lips.<br>\r\nA moment, later, your mouths pull apart, and the song ends.<br>\r\nYou take a step back.<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" asks the guy.<br>\r\n\"Just the beginning.\" you answer as you drift off into the crowd.</span></div></div>",

Thinking faster makes you slow down, but not thinking about things makes you speed up.  You can also drift left or right if you feel like it, but still you continue walking through the campus.  It's strange, most the girls aren't looking at you, as you walk by.  Maybe it's early, maybe they can't tell you apart from a real girl.  One or two guys look at you as you pass by them, but even they don't look at you like they did in the pass few days.  (But that's a good thing, right?)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, it hits you were to are headed, this is the way to Brian's place.  Why is your body walking here?  Entering his building, you walk up the stairs until you get to his room.  You knock three times and he answers.  \"Alex! he says in surprise.  \"I barely recognized you.\" he seems tired.<br>\r\n\"What am I doing here?\" you say in a dazed voice.<br>\r\n\"I was going to ask you the same thing.\" he says.<br>\r\nYou try to enter his apartment, you find that you're physically make yourself enter it.<br>\r\n\"Come in.\" says Brian, seeing your struggle to enter his domain.<br>\r\n\"<i>Thanks.</i>\" you try to say, but all you do is smile as you walk in.  \"<i>That's weird.</i>\" you think.<br>\r\nYou both stare at each other, not knowing what to say.<br>\r\n\"Want some coffee?\" Brian finally says.<br>\r\n\"Okay!\" you say as he goes to get you a cup.  You can't help but smile for some reason.<br>\r\n\"Here.\" says Brian, giving you a mug of the black liquid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWOW! That caffeine has a stronger kick than you're used to.  Maybe your new body is reacting to it differently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, why are you here?\" asks Brian.<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\"<br>\r\n\"You honestly just walked here?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes!\"<br>\r\n\"Give me a second.\" Brian says as he goes to his desk, and brings back a book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlipping through the book, he stops on a strange page. \"So, you walked here completely on instinct?\" he says.<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n\"And are, you, um...completely female?\" he asks.<br>\r\nYou look down at yourself, embarrassed. You grab the end of your hair, and stroke it a bit.  \"Physically.\" you manage to say.<br>\r\n\"Interesting.\" says Brian as he flips the page. \"Take a look at me, and tell me honestly, what is the first word you think of when you think of me?\" asks Brian.<br>\r\n\"<i>Food, resource, information, friend, helpful, nerd.</i>\" you think.  \"Man.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"Interesting, for the first word that you use to describe me involves my sex.\" says Brian.<br>\r\n\"No, it's gender issues...on my mind...makes sense.\" you spurt out, you're not thinking straight, Brian saying the word 'sex' threw you.<br>\r\n\"Well, judging by you're responses, I'd say you're condition seems to have similar traits to that of lycanthropy of legend, except instead of gaining the physical and mental metamorphoses into a noble hunter, you're changes seem to be limited to that of the opposite sex.\" says Brian, doing his best to sound smart.  (And it's kind of working.)<br>\r\n\"Did you just call me a werewolf?\" you say in a voice that comes out dizzier than you mean it to.<br>\r\n\"No, more like a were-woman. Which if you know your Celtic wording, comes across as both humorous and accurate.\" Brian says with a chuckle.<br>\r\nYou look at him, wondering what's so funny.<br>\r\n\"The word 'were' means man in Celtic dialect.\" he says.<br>\r\n\"That's not that funny.\" you say  with a confused look on your face.  (Are you playing dumb?)<br>\r\n\"Sorry, back to business. Your changes, are gradual, while traditionally, were-wolfs are almost instantaneous, plus werewolves don't spend their entire  time stuck in the same form, which you seem to be doing.\"<br>\r\n\"Great.\" you say with a sarcastic sigh.<br>\r\n\"One thing you should be grateful for is that you seem to be mostly in control of your actions.  Traditionally, werewolves are driven almost completely by instinct and are less in control of themselves than natural wolves.\"<br>\r\n\"So, you're saying, I'm going to attack those around me?\"<br>\r\n\"No. If you strip a wolf to his most basic instincts, than multiple them, you're left with a creature that's main drive is to hunt.  If you strip a woman's instincts down to her most primal nature, what are you left with?\" Brian asks.<br>\r\n\"I don't know!\" you say.<br>\r\n\"Yes you do.  What's the driving force of all humanity?\" he asks you.<br>\r\n\"To survive?\" you answer.<br>\r\n\"But eternal life is impossible.  The best you can do is pass on your genetic code. The main instincts of any human is to find a worthy mate and breed.\" he says.<br>\r\n\"But...I...Um...\" you say, unable to think of a response.<br>\r\n\"Not what you wanted to hear?\" asks Brian with a bit of smugness about him.<br>\r\n\"I don't even know anymore.\" you say with a depressing breath.<br>\r\n\"Relax, it's probably not that bad, like I said, there seem to be differences between your condition and werewolf-isms.\" says Brian.<br>\r\n\"Aren't werewolves contagious?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"Yes.  In the movies, but even there, the rules of infection spread.  Is it their blood, saliva, mystical bite or a simple scratch that duplicates there curse?  It changes from version to version.  So don't scratch, bite, kiss, or fuck anyone, and you'll do fine.\"<br>\r\n\"Don't what?!\" you ask, insulted that Brian would even think of you doing something like that.<br>\r\n\"Relax. I'm joking...Partially. You did after all, contract your current condition from someone who was in a similar state, right?\"<br>\r\n\"ALAN!\" You say.<br>\r\n\"Alan?\" asks Brian.<br>\r\n\"The guy who did this to me.  Well, he was a she back then, and named Alice.  He was a dude again when I saw him yesterday.\" you tell Brian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next ten minutes of the conversation involve you explaining to Brian almost everything that Alan told you.<br>\r\n\"Interesting.\" says Brian.<br>\r\n\"Isn't it?\" you say.<br>\r\n\"Listen, I might be able to work something out from what you told me, but I have to work fast.  Come back here in four hours, you might not have to play Alan's game at the dance tonight.\"<br>\r\n\"Really?!\" you say, in a voice that produces so much excitement that is almost swoons.<br>\r\n\"Give me four hours.\" says Brian.<br>\r\n\"Four hours?\"<br>\r\n\"Four hours!\"<br>\r\n\"I'll be back in four.\" you say with a sexy little smile on your lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian seems to notice this as you walk towards the door.<br>\r\n\"Alex, one more thing!\" yells Brian before you leave.<br>\r\n\"What?\" you say turning around.<br>\r\n\"Remember what I told you not to do!\"</span></div></div>",

Something is boiling in a pot on the oven, and you quickly grab a wooden spoon to help stir the pot.  After turning down the boiling water a bit, you go to wash some dishes in the sink.  Thanks to a conveniently placed mirror over it, you look at your reflection and realize that still look female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>The dishes need to be done.</i>\" you say in a tone of defeat.  Your hair is a mess, and the heat in the room, just makes the long strands of your hair keep falling in front of your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it hits you, you have no idea who you are cooking for. You're standing barefoot in the kitchen, it's a feminists worst nightmare.<br>\r\nAs the heat increases, you decide to leave the room, but find that some invisible barrier is holding you there.  Not wanting to play this game, you turn off the fire, and sit down in a chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after that, the stove starts itself up again, and you get a feeling of uselessness inside of you.  You can only sit for so long, before your instincts drive you to stand up and start stirring whatever is in the pot.  As you're doing this, the emptiness inside of you slowly goes away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey, I'm home!\" says tall man with fiery red hair.<br>\r\nHAHAHAHA! invisible voices seem to be laughing with him<br>\r\n'Um...\" you say, looking at him in silence.

It's what you're acting like being female is all about.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!\" you say, insulted.<br>\r\n\"You don't need to walk like that. If you don't want to.\"<br>\r\nIn less than a second, you feel several inches taller.  You look down to see that you're still in an apron, but are now sporting matching high-heels.<br>\r\n\"I don't want to be like this.\" you say to the man.<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry honey.\" says the man, and in a blink of his eyes, your shoes disappear, and you fall on your ass.  You try and get up but can't.<br>\r\n\"Now you're beautiful.\" says the man as he pulls you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down and see that your apron is gone.  You are completely naked.  But there is another change, a bigger one.  Your stomach is sticking out, you're six months pregnant!  You feel something kick inside of you.  Both horrified, and excited, you grab your belly, and almost smile.

The shower is running, and judging by the haze in the air, it has probably been running for two hours.  You roll out of bed, and try and walk, but stumble to the floor.  Something seems very wrong with you.  As you crawl your way into the bathroom, you mouth opens, gasping for air.  In the bathroom, you manage to pull yourself up on the counter and look into the mirror.  Your face looks unrecognizable.  Your lips are gasping for something.  Your eyes look sultry.  It reminds you of a face you once saw in a porn video on the web.  You know that the face belongs to you, but you try hard to distance yourself from it.  It is the face of a woman who wants sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the shower, you can make out a silhouette of a man rubbing himself with soap.<br>\r\n(Tom?)<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" you say.<br>\r\nThere is no response.<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" you cry.<br>\r\nThe man still keeps washing himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TOM? TOM?! Is that you?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot being able to take in the air anymore, you  crawl your way over to the shower cover and open it.<br>\r\n\"YOU!\" you gasp as you fall backwards.<br>\r\n\"What the hell?\" the voice says as it's owner looks at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's you!  It's you as a male, cleaning yourself!  Or at least he was.  He looks at you and shuts off the shower.<br>\r\nYou are eyeing him over, but he doesn't recognize you.  He doesn't recognize you at all.<br>\r\n\"What are you doing here?\" he yells in a hostile manner.<br>\r\n\"You...You...Ignored me.  You abandoned me!  You abandoned me to die, thinking I couldn't fend for myself!\" you yell.<br>\r\nYou can't even control the yelling, it's that stupid female id saying this.<br>\r\n\"I don't know who you are!\" says your male self.<br>\r\n\"That's the problem!\" you gasp.<br>\r\n\"Leave or I'm calling the police!\"<br>\r\n\"Call them.  You're the intruder here.\" you yell, as energy you use up most of the energy you had woken up with.<br>\r\n\"What do you want?\" asks your old self confused.<br>\r\nYou examine your old body, your old from head to tow.  You want you're old body back.  But you can't find the energy to say it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lift your arm and point towards your male self.  Unfortunately, you only have the strength to lift it to point towards your old waist.  You try and lift your arm higher, trying to point at the face or the heart, but it shakes a bit and false to the floor.  (Great, your male half things you were just pointing to his junk, and you still have that expression you saw yourself with in the mirror.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry.\" says male you.  \"I need to keep myself for Emily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe haze quickly gets thicker, and you pass out.  You're pretty sure the last thing you see is your old body coming towards you.  But was it trying to help you, or something else?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up on your bed again.  You're still dressed as you were when you laid down to close your eyes.  You had a stupid double dream...double nightmare.  You look at the time and realize that your late for your meeting with Brian.  Wow that was a long nap.</span></div></div>",

I came over to make sure nothing was wrong.\"<br>\r\nYou look at Brian, surprised that he walked across campus for you.

But you think of the warning the red-haired guy gave about Brian, what was Brian's angle in this whole thing?

I've been sleeping more lately.\" your mouth says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down at the rose you're still holding, and that's when it hits you, you haven't really been in control of yourself since you woke up.<br>\r\nEvery movement, every word, it was all done by something, or one, that didn't have your best business in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian quickly looks through his books.  \"Here it is. The rose of Avongard.\"<br>\r\n\"The rose of what?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"It's a rose that is supposed to transfer human energy to another person.\"<br>\r\n\"Wait what?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"The Duchess of Avongard, way back in the 13th century lived to be 80, and never looked like she passed the age of twenty-five.  Some thought she was a creature similar to a vampire. But shortly after her death, a local folktale sprung up.  Basically what it said was that she would hire young women to come into her palace once ever five years, then switch her age and looks with them.  She did spent most her time in a rose garden, and then one night she would grab the rose and do something with it to transfer her older energy for a younger one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did they stop her?\" you ask.  (Although you're not sure if you want to ask that, or if someone else wanted you too.)<br>\r\n\"An old witch caught on, and one day cast an enchantment on herself to look like a teenage girl.  When it came time for a switch, the witches energy went into the Duchess, and she aged, becoming hideous.  Despite living in a bit house, no one lived with her, besides the girls she used.  The Duchess ended up a beggar on the street, what the witch died of natural causes a year later.  Although she might have been poisoned.\"<br>\r\n\"So you're saying that...\"<br>\r\n\"This rose is what caused that kiss to effect you.,,Somehow that girl got you to accept her ethereal energy, while she got yours.\"<br>\r\n\"So if I kissed you here, with this rose in my hand...\"<br>\r\n\"In theory, we'd spiritual auras, and I'd slowly transform like you have.  But I might be way off on this, and I'm not looking to kiss you.  Sorry.\" he says.<br>\r\n\"Understandable.\"<br>\r\n\"It's why it took me so long to figure out what's happening, we're not dealing with one curse, but two!\" says Brian, looking excited.<br>\r\n\"So?\" you say after a moment of silence.  (Dammit, you are playing dumb for Brian.)<br>\r\n\"So, it means that we can do more than just cure you we could take your curse away all together.\"<br>\r\n\"Really?\" you say in a sweet, yet surprised voice.  Your excitement quickly dies down though, as you notice that you've been playing with your hair, while watching Brian read the book.<br>\r\n\"Well, it's all hypothetical, but I think I can pull this off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut will he?</span></div></div>",

You think of all the good times you've had with Emily, and when you reopen your eyes, you see your masculine self looking into the mirror.  \"I did it!\" you say in your old voice.  \"That's great.\" says Brian washing his hands as he exits the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both look at the female version of you sitting down in the chair.  \"She didn't try to escape?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"You never commanded her too.\" says Brian.  \"I think when you switched bodies, you got the power over her that she once had over you.\"<br>\r\n\"She doesn't look happy though. I at least looked happy what all that stuff was done to me.\"<br>\r\n\"You can command her to be happy.\" says Brian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at Brian and smile.  \"Hey Brian.  I never thanked you for everything you did for me.\" you say.  Brian lets a tiny smile come across his face, he knows where this is going too.<br>\r\n\"Wench!\" you tell your former body.  \"Brian is now your new master, so do whatever he tells you, and act like you enjoy it.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" says your feminine body sheepishly.<br>\r\nYou turn to Brian.  \"Now Brian that WAS me, so don't...you know...\"<br>\r\n\"Got it.\" says Brian.  \"No worries, there might still be some transitional energies from the rose left, I'm not going to touch her for at least a week.  I'm just going to ask A LOT of questions. Think of how much we can learn from her.\"<br>\r\n\"Cool.\" you say as you disappear in the shadows.</span></div></div>",

I need to get something to wear, I need to fix my hair, buy some make-up, get the right shoes.\"  Her anger quickly changes to panic.<br>\r\n\"Emily, you look fine.\" you say. \"You don't need to do all that stuff. It's a dance, not the prom.\"<br>\r\n\"Wow, you know nothing about being a girl.\" Amy irrupts.  \"Come on, I'll help you get dolled up.\" she says to Emily as she pushes her into the bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing your new powers, several hours pass in less than a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy comes out and introduces your dance partner for tonight.  She looks gorgeous, and she looks that way for you.  (And for herself.)<br>\r\nYou can't help but smile as you both get in a cab and head towards the dance at the university's double gym.  Emily is impressed that you paid for a cab, but from now on, you feel that money won't be an issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stroll into the gym and you own the place, everyone looks at you and Emily.  You're not sure if it's because you made them do that, or if Emily just looks that good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter having a pleasant slow dance, you stroll over to a familiar looking face in the corner.<br>\r\n\"What's up?\" you say to Dale.<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" asks Dale.  (That's right, he doesn't recognize you now.)<br>\r\n\"You look like you got stood up.\" you tell him.<br>\r\n\"Look, I don't want to talk about it.\" he says.<br>\r\n\"That's fine.  Just know this.  If she stood you up, it was because she was a bitch, and you can do better than her anyways.\"<br>\r\nDale doesn't say anything, but the look in his eyes asks if you mean it.<br>\r\n\"You'll find someone by tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter having another dance with Emily, you noticed that more guys are starting to hit on her than usual.  \"<i>Odd</i>.\" you think, as an infinite amount of possibilities of how to stop this situation appear in your mind.  But before you can decide on one, you see Alan standing in the corner by himself looking for someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looking for me?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"Who...oh!\" says Alan.<br>\r\n\"You know, it turns out that I didn't need your help. I'm cured!\" you say.<br>\r\n\"But how?!\" asks Alan.<br>\r\n\"Transfer it to someone else?  Naw, I'm better than you.\" you say smugly.<br>\r\n\"But I tried to help you through it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe can see in your eye that something is going to happen.<br>\r\n\"You wanted me to be here, thinking that I'd have to abuse my sexuality in order to get tickets.\" <br>\r\n\"Look, I had to make sure you were prepared.\"<br>\r\n\"That's a lie, you wanted to see me suffer.\"<br>\r\n\"No...I...You see...\" Alan stutters.<br>\r\n\"It's okay.\" you say suddenly changing the tone of your voice. \"If I never met you, I don't think I'd be where I am tonight. Improving my relationship with my girlfriend in ways I couldn't imagine.\"<br>\r\n\"Really?\" he says with some justified suspicion.<br>\r\n\"Sure, I'm just here to say thanks.\" you say reaching out shake his hand.<br>\r\n\"No hard feelings?\" he asks as his hand meets yours.<br>\r\n\"No.\" you say as you clothes your eyes thinking about your second last transformation.  You feel Alan's hand shift as his who body goes through a metamorphosis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open them to see Alice looking back at you, seeming mildly surprised.  Actually, she looks like a mix between Alice and that porn body you saw in the mirror.  Her lips are a full dark crimson and slightly parted.  The eyes are partly closed with a light blue shade on top, and her hair has been curled.  Alan's suit has been replaced with a dark blue sparkling dress, which is pushing up her double C sized breasts.  A slit up the dresses side shows that she's not only shaved her legs, but not wearing any underwear.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do to me?\" she asks in a sultry tone and she looks in surprise at how red her nails are.  <br>\r\n\"I made you how you thought I'd end up.\" you say with a devious smile.<br>\r\n\"But...\" she protests.<br>\r\n\"Relax, I left you with your male brain, and you don't have to worry about any dark suitor coming after you, I've dealt with that.\" you say.  \"See, I'm leaving you in a much better position than you'd ever leave me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice just looks at you.  You can tell she's surprised or angry, but her can only make an expression that is begging for sex.<br>\r\n\"I know it's not how you expected tonight to go.  But I left you with some improvements.\" you say, slightly slapping her ass.<br>\r\n\"Ooh.\" she lets out in a sound of pleasure.<br>\r\n\"I designed your new body to only feel comfortable if you're making physical contact with a man.\" you said.<br>\r\n\"And you want to leave me like this?\" asks Alice in a voice so full of lust that it's kind of creepy.<br>\r\n\"Just spend the dance with that man, and I'll change you back...If you want me to.\" you say as you point towards Dale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice's lip begins to quiver as she looks at Dale, you can't tell if she's trying to cry, or if her body is getting excited.  \"Excuse me.\" she says as she walks in his direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting back to Emily, do another slow dance, as you notice more and more people are gazing at her ass, even as they're dancing with their other girlfriends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>That's it.</i>\" you think, \"<i>Some of these guys are going to wake up in the morning a few inches and a Y-Chromosome short.</i>\"<br>\r\nYou stop your train of thought for a minute.  This isn't like you.  This is something a trickster would do.  Maybe you exchanged more than just bodies at Brian's place.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh well, beggars can't be choosers, your new life is going to be fun.</span></div></div>",

Her body is too short for the clothes she is wearing, and they look baggy and stupid on her.<br>\r\n\"Destroy the rose!\" yells Brian, and you grab it, rushing off towards the stove.  You quickly light it, and throw the rose into an empty sink as you watch it burn.  As the rose shrivels and blackens, you turn on the water and stop the fire.  The second you do this, you can feel half the mystical energy in the room leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do?\" yells the woman, still unable to leave the circle.<br>\r\n\"You did it!\" says Brian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down at yourself, and realize that you have indeed got your male body back.<br>\r\n\"What did you do?\" asks the woman as she starts to cry.<br>\r\n\"What did you do?\" you ask Brian.<br>\r\n\"Simple, I took a chance that the rose was the same as the legend, and I was correct.  It took all of the alien energies in you and pushed them to the surface.  It's what you acted so strange a moment ago.  The energy needed somewhere to go, and when you kissed the guy...well girl now I guess...it transferred that energy into him.\"<br>\r\n\"So he changed instead of me?\"<br>\r\n\"Without the energy, your body couldn't maintain it's transformed state.\"<br>\r\n\"So that's why I am a man again.\"<br>\r\n\"Yes!\"<br>\r\n\"So what happens to the crying red-head?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"Good question.  The rose is destroyed, once the energy evaporates, I don't think she'll be able to change.\"<br>\r\n\"So we should keep her here overnight? Isn't that illegal.\"<br>\r\n\"Hey, she's free to go whenever she wants.  Assuming she can leave this circle.\"<br>\r\n\"Please, don't leave me like this!\" cries the red-head.<br>\r\n\"You did this to yourself!\" you say.<br>\r\n\"Yes sir.\" the girl says meekly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian stops as he notices this.<br>\r\n\"Hey, Alex, I think she's already being mentally affected by the change.\"<br>\r\nYou stop and look at her.<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with being trapped like this?\" you ask her.<br>\r\n\"Nothing, I just don't want be here alone.\" she says blushing.<br>\r\n\"So if I say...\" says Brian<br>\r\n\"I want you to say.\" she says looking at you and biting her lip.  Her legs are clenched together as looks at you.<br>\r\n\"Is she getting turned on?\" Brian ask.<br>\r\n\"I'm not telling!\" you say.  (It's none of his business!)<br>\r\n\"It seems that the spell that was supposed to make you attracted to her reversed as well.\" says Brian.<br>\r\nYou stay quiet, as you look into the girls loving eyes.  When was the last time Emily looked at you like that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, lets go, looking at this is pathetic.\" says Brian, breaking your trance as you both leave his apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHREE DAYS LATER<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour life has gotten back to normal, more or less.  You're relationship with Emily is improving, and Tom is hanging around you again.  Everything is going fine until one day, you decide to introduce everyone else to Brian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you, Tom, Amy and Emily go wait at the meeting place, Brian shows up, with the red-haired girl.  On seeing you, she lets out a delighted squeal and runs giving you a hug.  You try and nudge her to hint that she should let you go, but she doesn't.<br>\r\n\"She calls herself Ginger now.\" says Brian, almost laughing.<br>\r\nYou look at Emily, who seems a bit upset that Ginger is clinging to you.<br>\r\n\"So how do you know Ginger?\" she asks.<br>\r\nThe red-headed girl starts rubbing her cheek against yours.<br>\r\n\"I can explain!\" you promise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Tom and Brian look at you, certain that you're not going to tell Emily the events that have happened over the last week.<br>\r\nEmily looks into your eyes.  She seems to realize that you aren't cheating on her, but is still jealous of the affection this other girl is giving you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you can't.\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I can't.\" you admit.</span></div></div>",

Eventually massaging his lips enough until they give in and open.  You immediately feel his pants push out against your torso, but as quickly as it starts it disappears.  You and Alex seem to switch heights, you're growing, while he is shrinking, becoming more slender.  Your hair starts to shed, and is immediately replaced by shorter hair.  Brian's grows.  Soon, you notice that your chest is flat and that it is Brian's that is pushing against you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreaking the kiss, you fall back on the floor.  And quickly look over yourself, you seem to be completely male again, and cured of the curse.  \"Brian!\" you say to the female pinned against the wall.<br>\r\n\"Wow!\" says Brian, looking refreshed.  He then suddenly snaps to his senses.  \"Wait, what happened?\" he says.<br>\r\n\"Now that is more like it!\" says the red hair stranger.  \"This is someone I can break.\"<br>\r\n\"No, wait!\" Brian pleads.<br>\r\n\"You shouldn't have messed with the gods.\" says the dark suitor.<br>\r\n\"Alex, help!\" says Brian as the suitor pulls Brian into the circle with his powers.<br>\r\nYou try to stand up, but can't move, the guy's powers are still holding you down.<br>\r\n\"Brian!\" you yell, but it seems in vain.<br>\r\n\"Brittney!\" says the dark man to the girl that is now crying in his arms. \"I can't wait to make a woman out of you!\"<br>\r\nUsing his otherworldly powers, the man simultaneously pulls down all the curtains while turning on the lights.<br>\r\nWhen your eyes adjust, you notice that both the man and Brian (or is it Brittney now?) are gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot sure what to do, you look around the room, still readjusting you your movements, getting used to being male again.  Looking through the papers on Brian's desk, you look at one which says: <i>Step 1) Release Alex from curse  Step 2) Challange Okil in his own domain Step 3) Use rose to transfer power.  Step 4) Wish me luck!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at the floor to see that the rose has disappeared along with Brian and the dark suitor.

But unfortunately, your body refuses to listen to you, as finding a match in Brian's kitchen, you light the plant on fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrowing the rose into the sink so that the fire won't spread, your body turns to look at Brian's body on the floor.  \"DRAG HIM TO HIS BED!\" demands the voice.<br>\r\nYour body seems incredibly strong for a woman's as you drag the man to his unmade bed, and toss him on top of the covers.<br>\r\n\"<i>Is he alive?</i>\" you think.<br>\r\n\"HE WILL SURVIVE, IT IS IN MY INTEREST THAT HE DOES.\"<br>\r\nSuddenly, your body stays frozen and still.<br>\r\n\"<i>What do I do now?</i>\" you think, feeling a bit more mental control come over you.<br>\r\n\"REPLENISH YOURSELF.\" says the voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, you fall to the floor.

Whatever happened to you completely took all your energy away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stumble to the kitchen and open the fridge, there is an energy drink, that you quickly gulp down.  It does nothing.

So silence seems the best choice.<br>\r\nThe male version of yourself would have at least tried to think up a joke to lighten the mood, but in your new form, you're not into comedy as much. (Although you'll never admit that to anyone.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There!\" says Brian, pointing at one of his papers.<br>\r\n\"What is it?\"<br>\r\n\"I think I know what's going on.\"<br>\r\n\"Really?

You just want sex with someone.\" Brian says.<br>\r\n\"You're disgusting.  This is getting uncomfortable, and I'm going to leave.\"<br>\r\n\"But is that you talking?\" asks Brian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou close your eyes and think about it.  But slowly an image appears in your head, and you see that you are in the bathroom you were in the dream, the woman who looked like a sex crazed version of you is laying down in the haze, and you're leaning over her.  Looking down at your own naked body, you realize that you're inhabiting your male self in your thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when it hits you, you've been in complete control since you've had that dream.  You see the female moaning (in a sound somewhere between pain and pleasure) on the floor, and suddenly, you snap out of the image and open your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am in complete control!\" you say defiantly to Brian.<br>\r\n\"That's great! Now get off me.\" Brian tells you as you see that he's pinned to the floor...by your hands!<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry.\" you say, as you both get back up.  \"What happened?\"<br>\r\n\"You went silent, told me to 'come here' and threw me to the floor and you rubbed yourself against me.\"<br>\r\n\"I did?\" you say in a voice that sounds frightened and innocent.<br>\r\n\"What was going through your head?\" asks Brian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a pause.  You figure its about time you tell Brian what happened, but you can't.  That's when it hits you, your free choice was an illusion from the second you woke up today!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter?\" asks Brian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour head spins and you think, you find yourself back in your dream, as you look up and see your naked male body looking at you from the floor.  You don't want it to touch you, but it starts leaning over.  (Is it trying to help?)  \"Go away!\" you try and warn it.  But all that comes out is a semi-sexual moan.  \"<i>I can't be this dumb.</i>\" you think, but the truth is, you were too chivalrous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou male self leans over to touch you, to make sure you were okay, but the second that his hand touches you, he lets out a scream, as he becomes some hideous human/liquid hybrid and starts to be absorbed into you.  A second later, the haze clears up and you feel energized.  You look into the mirror to see that you're now naked. (Something that you inherited from your male self.)  Looking into the mirror, you find that you look great and aren't ashamed of your body.  That's when you realize that even in your head, this creature, your female id, has taken control.  You are now little more than a passenger of your own thoughts.</span></div></div>",

After about 15 seconds of kissing, you pull your head back, and notice that some drool is hanging from your lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get up, and see that Brian's mouth has altered into a smile as the last of life leaves his body.

You chew on the meal for 6 minutes, despite the fact that you'd usually eat a salad that size in under two minutes.  Maybe the fact that it was five dollars makes you try and savor the bites.  (Stupid campus pricing.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you eat, you just sit at your empty table and watch the others.  You don't know why buy your eyes keep drifting towards the female faces.  You're mind is taking notes about how good their smoky eyes look, how their eyeliner contrasts with their lip gloss.  You're starting to piece together how they're dressing and doing up their hair.  It's all done to help promote their sexuality, their differences from men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of them seem to be having a good time, the girls are talking to each other, but many of them look tired.  You note that the less makeup a girl is wearing, the more tired she looks.  You catch your reflection in a nearby slate of glass.  You look pretty tired too.  And your stupid hair is all over the place.  It looks like you've just rolled out of bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a girl sits across from you.  You shoot her a glare.<br>\r\n\"Can I sit here?\" she asks.<br>\r\n\"Free country.\" you shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Samantha.\" she says as she opens some containers of food in front of her.<br>\r\n\"I'm Alex.\" you say.  You don't want to talk to this girl, something seems off about her.  But you also don't feel like moving anymore than you have to at the moment.<br>\r\n\"I haven't seen you on campus before.\" says Sam.<br>\r\n\"It's a big campus.\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're hoping that Samantha takes a hint with your short responses.  Your hope is futile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I was taking classes all over the place, it takes me fifty minutes to walk from one class to another.  Sometimes by the time I get to the class, it's already ended.\" she says.<br>\r\nFor the next five minutes, Samantha talks almost no stop.  You try and keep your sanity by focusing on other people.  Eventually, you go back to paying attention to her once you notice yourself staring at some guys crotch. (Did you just lick your lips?)<br>\r\n\"...So what do you think?\" asks Samantha.<br>\r\n\"Um, I think, you're right?\" you say, guessing that that was the appropriate response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha's eyes start to quiver a bit, she seemed desperate for an answer.  Her lips start shaking too, as starts to whimper.</span></div></div>",

You feel some hesitation opening up the door, this seems to be just another milestone in losing your manhood.  It opens with a creek. And you're introduced to a room with three sinks, five stalls and a giant mirror that stretched from one end of the wall to the other.  They even have a condom machine...no, wait...that's a tampon dispenser. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look back and see that Samantha seems just as hesitant to enter as you do.  (Maybe she's just embarrassed.) The door closes, and some woman who was putting on lipstick, quickly finishes up and walks out of the area.  Apparently there are some unspoken rules that are taking place here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab some paper towels and pass them to Samantha.  \"Blow your nose on these,\" you say.<br>\r\nSamantha blows her nose, and starts to wipe away her running mascara.  She's doing a lousy job at it.<br>\r\n\"Can you help me?

Her cleavage is pretty exposed, especially for this time of year.  You kind of feel guilty for noticing, but you can't help but smile.  You're proud of yourself for noticing those.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're starting to piece this situation together.<br>\r\n\"Sam, is there something you want to tell me?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"You wouldn't understand.\" she says as you look at her.<br>\r\n\"I think I would.\" you tell her.<br>\r\n\"No, you wouldn't.\" she responds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you decide to come right out and say it.<br>\r\n\"You're really a man.

I wasn't gay, but I sucked with girls.  I didn't know my own strength and kept destroying things.  I was over six feet tall, and people just didn't trust me.  I could smell there intimidation awhile away.  One night at a bar, I met this girl.  She thought like me.  She knew exactly what was going on in my head, and we started hanging out together.  She seemed strange though, because no matter how much she flirted with me, she would never do anything more than touch.  One day, I felt like she was the one.  I told her and she freaked out.  She said she couldn't and was going to leave me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha hangs her head down, tears seem to form at the bottom of her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I begged her to stay, but she said only if we could still be friends.  I told her I didn't want her as a friend.\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha looks back at you and forces a smile.  \"This sounds so weird when I say it out loud, in this voice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continues: \"I told her I wanted to be part of her.  To be with her and have a life together.  I had known her for less than a week.  But it felt so right.  She told me that she had a disease.  That was it, a disease that crippled her and made her weaker, more unstable.  That she'd be harder to live with as she got older.  I told her again that I didn't care.  In the heat of the moment we made love.  She seemed so unsure at first, it was so cute.  But as we went on, she didn't want to stop.  She refused to, and, well, things got kinkier from there.  Naked and exhausted, we both fell asleep.  I woke up to find her dead the next morning.  Witnesses said she jumped in front of a bus.  The next night, I woke up like this.  And had been trying to adapt ever since.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe starts crying again, and you pass her some Kleenex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long ago did this happen?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"About a month.\"<br>\r\n\"And you instantly changed? Like, you were like this for both night and day?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes...why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot thinking that staying silent was an option. (You're obviously not in your right mind today.) You tell her your story up to this moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what the sad part is?\" she says. \"I think I secretly wanted this.  Mom always treated my sisters better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find yourself just staring at her.  Sam is better looking than you, but that's not saying much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would you want this? My life was fine until this happened. Now I'm all mixed up.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"I needed a change. I was unhappy. Like, really unhappy.  This is nothing short of a miracle.  Of course, it's nothing like I thought it'd be either.  I was never brought up being taught the little things most girls are.\" Sam answers.</span></div></div>",

Brian than goes to his books.<br>\r\n\"I found this out last night.\" he says as he begins to sum up what's on paper. \"There is this demon called Clafathios.  He was an old god, like pre-history.  They only found his name about three years ago etched in stone on an old sacrificial temple.  Anyways, he was the dominant patriarchal god of this civilization. The problem was that none of the other goddesses wanted to have his children, because he was so repulsive and sexist.  But being male, he did want to get laid, so he went after Earth women.  The other goddesses didn't want him to do this.  So they joined forces and put a spell of protection on the woman.  This pissed off Clafathios, so he started to go after the men and bring them back with him.  Of course, wanting straight sex, he changed the men into his ideal version of women, then got them to have his kids.\"<br>\r\n\"Ew.\" you say in disgust.<br>\r\n\"Wait, so you think that we might be his brides?\" ask Sam.<br>\r\n\"It's just another old legend I came across.  It would explain your lack of transformation, compared to Alex here.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm still technically male.\" you tell Sam.<br>\r\n\"Wait, what do you mean ideal woman?\" you ask Brian.<br>\r\n\"It doesn't specify.  I'm assuming passive, submissive, curvy, dumb.  Stuff like that, since he was a the main patriarch of this lost religion, and, the writings say he had sexist traits.\"<br>\r\n\"So do you think that we could be dealing with two different gods who turn guys into...us?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"Well, the idea of having no recorded metamorphoses in history and then you two suddenly changing does seem coincidental.  I mean very coincidental...It's possible we're not dealing with a myth at all here, but a new virus.  Alex, when it was just you, I thought it might be a glitch in nature, but with Sam here.  It could be that bigger things are going on.  You both might want to see a doctor, like immediately.\"<br>\r\n\"Wouldn't they lock us away and probe all our holes?\" asks Sam.<br>\r\n\"Or say we're insane?\" you add.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Those are risks.  But two of you like this in the same place, it just seems like you should take precautions.\" says Brian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Sam walk out of his apartment.<br>\r\n\"Sorry I wasn't more help.\" says Brian as he shuts the door.\"<br>\r\n\"Your friend Brian is cute.\" says Samantha.in a girly voice.<br>\r\n\"I haven't noticed.\" you respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreat, now you know your situation is no longer unique.  You play your options in your head.  You can either go to see a doctor about this, or you can sit on it for a while and study Samantha yourself.

It's got a tropical climate, a beach side home, and you can spend your days on the beach in the sun.\"<br>\r\n\"Does it have internet?\" you ask.<br>\r\nThe doctor turns around and whispers to people behind the mirrors.  \"Yes.\" he says.<br>\r\n\"And you'll just leave me on this island for the rest of my days?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"You wouldn't be alone.

In case you're island has any unexpected visitors.\"<br>\r\n\"I don't like him!\" you immediately say.<br>\r\n\"Your body betrays you.\" says Pennington.<br>\r\nYou look down to see that your nipples have perked, and your groin has become a bit wet from Dave's touch.  (Right, you're naked.  Kind of easy to forget that after two days of being bare.)<br>\r\n\"Can't I just stay here?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"No.  We need to decontaminate this room, then use it for other subjects.

This is stupid, do you want to watch something else?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"Your hair's longer!\" Sam says in surprise.<br>\r\nYou quickly feel your hair, and notice that the sun has gone down completely.  The transformation was so subtle this time that you didn't even notice it.  Physically, you're fully female now.<br>\r\n\"Oh, that happens.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"It looks good. Can I do something with it?\" she asks as she takes a brush out of her purse.<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" you say, still a bit moody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next fifteen minutes are humiliating, at least they would be if you were male.  Samantha talks about many of the experiences she's had since she changed, and the knots in your hair get straightened out.  You hate to admit it, but having her babble on about useless subjects while brushing your hair is relaxing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you watch a chick flick, and you actually swoon.  You didn't even know you could swoon.  Thankfully, Samantha doesn't notice.  After the film is done, Samantha offers to paint your nails.

The whole campus just woke up.  Not a single dick to be seen.\" Jeff says, wetting her lips after saying Dick.  You don't even think she notices she did that.  \"It looks like you adapted fast.\" she says, looking at all the make up on you.<br>\r\n\"Oh, right.  I forgot I was wearing any...I mean I didn't put it on...someone else put it on me...when I was asleep.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"Look, I don't care.

The nail polish doesn't seem to be coming off as easily.<br>\r\nBefore you can try scraping it off, the door knocks again.<br>\r\nAs you open it, you get a first to the gut and fall down on the floor as an athletic looking girl jumps on you.<br>\r\n\"I know this is your fault somehow.\" she yells, pinning you down.  \"Fix it!  Fix it!\"<br>\r\n\"Tom?\" you ask.<br>\r\nTom raises her fist, like she's going to punch you in the face.  She then opens the fist and slaps you on the cheek.  Tom rolls on his back beside you and starts crying.<br>\r\n\"Are you alright?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"Why am I crying? I'm not even sad.  I'm angry.\" Tom blubbers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForgetting to get dressed, you leave Tom and run outside.  No one notices your lack of clothes.  You see woman arguing with each other.  One's crying.  But none of the woman here look familiar.  These were all men yesterday.  What happened to the real woman?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, you feel a draft, and look down.  Your boxers look flat.  You didn't change back since last night.  You're in the same position as all of these guys.  At least you had a week to brace for the change.  Two thoughts instantly cross your mind.  You need to check up on Emily and make sure she's alright.  Alan might also have a few answers to what if going on.  Maybe he could help out.</span></div></div>",

About five years after the even, a scientific breakthrough allowed for women to have babies without the help of men, thanks to some genetic manipulation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother problem that almost no one saw coming were synchronized periods, since most the men changed around the same time and the curse started their cycle almost a month since their initial transformation.  Most the population of Earth now felt bloated and bitchy on those days.  Those days became unofficial holidays, as many knew better than to wander outside or demand heavy labor tasks then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeavy labor and construction is something that also took a short term halt, as the people in the field needed a year to get back into shape and return to their duties.  Advances in computer technology also slowed down, but no one is one hundred percent sure why.  The stuff being released has a lot less glitches though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the second month of the event, only two known adult males were left on Earth,  a dark stranger that treated people like garbage, but many woman went on pilgrimages to see him anyways. And Alan, who was a hit with the ladies.  A year later, a crew of astronauts returned and became one of the most popular people on the planet.  One of them even managed to father a son, who will be brought up and conditioned to be a breeder.  There have also been explorations into jungles, to look for isolated tribes that were not effected by the initial change.  No word on success from that front.  Some suspect a government cover up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was even a myth that intercourse with Alan had changed some back into men.  Those men were little more than mules though.  Alan himself disappeared after the third month, when he took a liking to some girl called Samantha.  You thought you saw a girl who reminded you of Alice on the news at some point after that, but you could never be sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for you, you and Emily broke up, and she has started to take a liking to Amy.  They're planning their wedding next spring.  Tom still refuses to talk to you, and Brian lost her interest in mythology, since he no longer wanted to relate to anyone in them.  You keep your mouth shut about your experience leading up to the worldwide epidemic, since you don't want to be the focus of anyone's anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a year, you notice that your life isn't so bad when it's passes as normal.

Your hair is short again, the long strands of it are all over the floor.  You look down at your pants and see that your erection is pushing up against Sam's leather skirt.<br>\r\n\"Sorry.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"Don't be.\" Sam says enthusiastically.<br>\r\nYou push yourself up and look into the mirror.

Her blouse begins to split a bit, but her hair doesn't change.<br>\r\nSam sits back up, with a very deep voice and says \"wow.\"<br>\r\nStanding up, Sam easily looks over six feet tall, and can barely move in her skirt, which has a very noticeable penis bulge poking out of the front of it.

I'll get it tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou never do get Tom to believe you about what happened that night, but you don't care.  He's a good enough friend not to tell Emily, and you can pee standing up, so all in all.

Trying to use hand signals, you fail, as Sam can't understand what you're doing.  Eventually, you make it over to your bed and try and cry, but no tears come out.  You turn over trying to think of what happened.  You probably absorbed Sam's curse and it merged with your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try and look up, hoping that Sam will come over and comfort you.<br>\r\nHe doesn't, and soon, all you can think to comfort yourself is babies.

You went for a walk there once, she knows it, but no one goes there at this time of year.  You'll be safe until she shows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo hours pass, you dress warmly, and then you race off across campus, feeling your body change with every person you pass.  Thankfully, you're not by anyone long enough for the curse to take really transform you.  Eventually, you reach the forest, where you hide yourself just off of the path.  Sitting on a log and waiting for Emily to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you wait, you look up and see that it is a lot darker than you are used to it being at this time of year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilently, you wait until you see a figure coming around the corner.</span></div></div>",

This guy's powers clearly don't have the same affect on men as they do on women.<br>\r\n\"Rules, I cannot use her.  I can torture her, kill her, bring her back to life, but not use her.  I cannot make her an equal, I can not make her scream like you.\"<br>\r\n\"You're sick.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"Yes, the rules are sick.  I just follow them. To break them is to break all that is known. There are loopholes, though.\"<br>\r\n\"Loopholes?\"<br>\r\n\"You are too tired to fight, she is no use to me.  You are of some use.  Come with me and I will treat you well, and leave her to live her life.\"<br>\r\n\"Her life without me.\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, this is where fate splits you up.  Either she goes with me, or you do, neither will be with the other again.\"<br>\r\n\"And you'll kill her if I don't.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"Worse.\" he responds. \"I like this no better than you, but I am leaving this place with someone.</span></div></div>",

You see we've seen cases like yours for a while.  We've managed to isolate the chemicals, reverse them, cure them, and all we need to, in order to control this outbreak.\"<br>\r\n\"Then why tell me?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"Because you were the last piece.  Someone effected outside the program so that we could see if the cure works or not.\" he tells you.<br>\r\nYou're about to ask him why he's bothering to tell you, but your intuition tells you to stop.  Telling you all this is his way of telling you you're never going to leave here.  He's looking for a reaction.<br>\r\n\"Why weaponize it?\" you ask him.<br>\r\n\"Because it solves so many problems.  China was having 130 boys for every 100 girls they produced.  Whenever the male population outnumbers the female like that, war becomes inevitable.  We've just given millions of men potential wives.  We've just created a new market to flood products into.  And the best part, they've all transformed at once, you've just matching up up to 50 million biological cycles.  You have any idea how easy it will be to play the market like this?\" he says.<br>\r\n\"I can imagine.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"Oh, and what people will pay for the cure.  A pill a day keeps the estrogen down.\" he says.<br>\r\n\"And why stop at China? Why not the middle East or Russia?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"We'll literally make any population who opposes our country our bitches.\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a silence.  He's waiting for you to ask why he's telling you this.<br>\r\n\"Oh, one more thing.  Why am I naked?\" you ask him.<br>\r\n\"Because women are much easier to control that way.\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conversation is ended, and you're thrown back into your cell.</span></div></div>",

The elevator is only about 50 yards from your cell, you didn't see any keypads or retinal scanners or anything on it.  If you can make it to the elevator, in theory, you can take it right to the top of wherever you are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's getting out of the cell that will be the problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach up to a loosened air-vent, its much too small for a person to get through, but it's where you hide the scalpel you took.  It's extremely sharp, but you try and tangle it up in your long hair.  It's impossible to hide completely, the silver shine is seen reflecting off any lights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fight the urge to cry.  You just want out of here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard walks past your cell, and you look down at yourself, he will probably think a woman as skinny as you will not be any problem, catching him off guard is your greatest chance.

Even after all this time as a woman, it disgusts you to play this objectifying role.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou need to get close enough to kiss him.  That should get him distracted enough for you to subdue him, grab the key and go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gets closer and you realize the size different between you and him is much larger than you though.  You're barely over five feet tall, and he is over 6 and a half feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we start with the kissing?\" you ask, acting meek.<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" Justin says.<br>\r\nYou stand on the edge of your bed and lean over to kiss him.<br>\r\n\"He's probably infected.\" your mind thinks as the lips touch.  You almost feel bad for him, this scalpel attack will mess him up.  You then feel a premature squirt on your torso and you stop feeling sorry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing the loose vent, you pull it and use all your strength to putt it off the wall and hit Justin's head with it.  Before he can react, you do it again.  Grabbing the cell key from his belt, you hit him one more time and sprint for the elevator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart is racing as you press the top button of the elevator and the doors of it close.  You feel it start to rise as your stomach fills with butterflies.  You could actually pull this off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the elevator stops and the doors open, you're at Jones Smith's office as he's about to enter the elevator.  He looks shocked to see you there standing naked.  You realize in your current state, he could easily overpower you.  Before he gets a chance to think, you jump on him and kiss him,  You can't explain it, but kissing others seem to give you energy.  When you jump back, you find that you have the scalpel in your hand and the director has a stab would in his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both look at the bloody instrument shocked, as Jones falls backwards out of surprise.  The elevator doors clothes again and it starts to rise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou figure you have less than a minute before he gets up and raises the alarm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door finally opens and you find yourself in a lobby.  Through a window, sunrise hits your face, and your eyes close in pain.  This is the first time in probably am month you've seen sunlight.  Looking at the ground you sprint.  Looking up for only seconds at a time to make sure you don't run into a wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then hear the alarms go off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Freeze.\" you hear a voice say.<br>\r\nYou keep running, keeping your head down.<br>\r\nYou hear a shot wiz past your head.<br>\r\n\"I said freeze!\" the same voice behind you yells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you open the front door, you feel a sharp pain in your chest, followed by a moment of warmth, and eventually coolness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes open one more time as the door to the outside slowly hits your face.<br>\r\nYou must have been shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can think another thought, your brain shuts down and you never think again.</span></div></div>",

This remark catches her and you off guard.  She probably thinks you're joking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily walks out of the bathroom, there is a clear stink coming from it, thankfully, Amy's nail polish has a stronger sent.<br>\r\n\"Alex!\" she says surprised.<br>\r\nYou're surprised at how she looks.  She's wearing no make up, her hair isn't properly done, and she's wearing sweatpants that hide her nice figure.<br>\r\n\"Emily.\" you force yourself to say.<br>\r\n\"I wasn't expecting you.\" she says, embarrassed.<br>\r\n\"I see that...but that's alright.  You look great.\" you manage to say.<br>\r\n\"Um...what are you doing here?\" she asks.<br>\r\n\"I thought that we could have an early dinner.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"But it's like 3pm.\" Amy says.<br>\r\n\"Well, it gets dark early this time of year.  I was thinking he'd go to a nice restaurant, order, and be done before six.\" you say.  You're improvising, but it sounds as if you've really thought this out.<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess.  I just need to get ready.\" Emily says.  You can tell by her expression that she doesn't really want to go, but she can tell this means something to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next forty minutes involve you making small talk with Amy as Emily gets ready.  Finally Emily comes out of her bathroom, dressed to kill.  She's wearing sleeveless dress and has her hair and make up all done.  That's the Emily you think of when you close your eyes at night.  You find it kind of strange though, she's defiantly attractive, but you're not as attracted to her.  In fact, you're both envious and jealous of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's going on with you?</span></div></div>",

You get out of the cab, and open the door for Emily, holding her hand as you help her out.  You pay the driver, and look at your credit card, part of your mind thinks that you're going to regret paying for tonight, but its a shrinking part.

Emily blushes more.<br>\r\n\"I wanted to make up for not seeing you last time.  I felt sick, and it wasn't fair to you.\" you tell her.<br>\r\n\"You were sick, you didn't have to do all of this.\" Emily says.<br>\r\n\"Ya, but I wanted to.  I wanted to remind myself how it feels, I wanted to remind you how this feels.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"Mission accomplished.\" says Emily.  She's lifted her foot out of her dress show, and is rubbing the side of your leg with it, under the table.<br>\r\nNow you're the one blushing, you're a bit embarrassed.  The thought of a girl touching you in a sexually suggestive manner seems a bit off for some reason.  You try and move your leg to respond back, but your heart isn't in it, and Emily seems to notice, she stops, and tones down her actions a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next moments are pretty awkward, as you two are silent.<br>\r\n\"Is everything okay?\" Emily asks.<br>\r\n\"Ya, I think so. Why does something seem off?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"Well, kind of.\" says Emily.<br>\r\nYou stay silent, not risk saying anything.<br>\r\n\"Well tonight, there's something different about you.\"<br>\r\n\"Different about me how?\"<br>\r\n\"It's...it's not important.\"<br>\r\n\"No, it's okay, if it's bugging you I want to know.\"<br>\r\n\"Your mannerisms...how do I say this...they're a bit...effeminate.\"<br>\r\n\"Is that all?\" you say, drinking some of your complimentary water.<br>\r\n\"You don't seemed shocked.\" Emily mentions.<br>\r\n\"I'm insulted, obviously. My sexuality is...\" you stop, you can feel a cramp in your thigh.<br>\r\n\"It's...\"<br>\r\nBut before the conversation can go on, the food arrives at the table.<br>\r\nEmily eats all of her food, but once she's done, you look down and over half the food on your plate in untouched.  You didn't even order that much either.<br>\r\n\"Okay, now I know there is something wrong.\" says Emily.<br>\r\n\"There's nothing wrong.\" you promise.

You try and wrap a towel around it but the stupid thing keeps falling off.  You lift up your arm pit and find the smell is more poignant than usual. (Did your sense of smell increase?)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time you leave the bathroom, you realize that you were in there five times longer than you were when you were a man.  \"Being a woman sucks\" you think as you go through the shopping bags that Emily brought over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take out some of the clothes and start trying them out in the mirror until you a combination that matches.  You don't know why this matters to you, but for some reason it does.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after about forty-something minutes of getting ready, you prepare to leave the room and head towards the library where you hope that the girl that kissed you will be there again.</span></div></div>",

You clench your teeth as your face alters itself in subtle ways.

He positions himself behind you and thrusts his arms into your ribcage.  Just as your ass and breasts start to inflate.<br>\r\nConfused, but focusing on trying to save your life, you feel the waiters genitalia start to erect as he keeps trying to squeeze the the air out of you.  At this point, all eyes in the restaurant are on you and you let out a giant wheeze.<br>\r\nShocked that no food came out, the waiter just looks at you in puzzlement.<br>\r\n\"I must have swallowed whatever was in there.\" you say, in a surprisingly feminine voice.<br>\r\n\"Sorry mam.

You pants are now too lose for you, but thankfully, you wore a belt and have managed to secure them from falling down.  You notice more of a sway in your hips when you walk.  It feels weird, and even though you're not wearing heels, you're seem to be barely touching the ground.

You're not thinking about little thinks, like how curtains help the look of a room, or how to make yourself look more desirable, or watching what you eat.  You're mind is flashing to sports that you like, and not focusing on the players bodies, but the plays themselves.  You're thinking of how to get Emily back.

There is no telling what sort of trouble that you have found yourself getting into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get back to your place, and Tom has thankfully not returned for the night.  You're not sure how you'd explain your presence to him.  Then it hits you, a simple not on the door will solve your problems.  You write a letter and stick it in an envelope for Tom.  The letters says:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTOM!<br>\r\nA GIRL IS STAYING HERE FOR A FEW NIGHTS.<br>\r\nSHE IS A FRIEND!

You place your hands between your legs to make sure you aren't sore there, and are happy to see that you're perfectly healthy in that area. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get up, and walk to the bathroom to wipe some drool off the side of your face.  You look closly in the mirror to ensure that there are not bags under your eyes.  Thankfully, there is no need to buy cream for that yet.  Although you wouldn't mind getting some products that make your skin softer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stop yourself halfway through that thought.  What the hell is up with you?  You're not going to buy products that make you more feminine while you're a male, are you?  It's bad enough that you're female after nightfall, you don't have to act or dress more feminine during the day.  Fine, you've decided that you're fine the way you are.  Except you need to have a shower and comb your hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter doing that, you go and get something to eat.  Half a bowl of cereal should last you until lunch.  You don't want to get too many extra calories into you and ruin your figure.  (Dammit, stop that!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom is still sleeping, and probably hung over.  He's a good friend, but he's hit a bit of a dry spell while dealing with women lately, can you really trust him alone with you at night?  Your mind starts to think of all the potential scenarios that would end with intercourse.  You make a mental note to sell some of them to porn studios.  No reason you can't profit from this experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing that you need to do is go and see that girl in the library.  Then you can talk to Emily, and sort things out with her.  Right after you go to class.  You be having an identity crisis of titanic proportions, but that's no excuse to let your grades slip.  But library first.  Even if the girl doesn't show, you can study for a while.</span></div></div>",

It helps ease your pain.<br>\r\n\"You know you'll have to work those calories off, right?\" Amy says.<br>\r\n\"Shh, not now.\" Emily whispers to her.  You just give them both your death stare, and continue to eat.<br>\r\n\"So what are we going to do now?\" you ask her.<br>\r\n\"I don't know, I was thinking after you finish this ice cream, you head back to your place. And get back to your life in the morning.\"<br>\r\n\"Please no.\" you say.  \"Tom is hard enough to live with when I'm a guy.  It's only a matter of time before he starts hitting on me like this.\"<br>\r\n\"Tom does know you're a guy half the time, right?\" asks Amy.<br>\r\n\"I...I haven't told him.\" you admit.<br>\r\n\"This is just too weird.\" Emily says to herself again.  \"This doesn't happen outside of pornos and bad erotic fiction.  I mean guys just don't morph into women at night!\" she says, getting louder.<br>\r\n\"Well, that's how this curse goes.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"It's not a curse.\" snarks Amy.<br>\r\n\"Are you telling me that if you could avoid monthly periods, or have a kid without getting pregnant, your life wouldn't be easier?\"<br>\r\nAmy stays silent.<br>\r\n\"So you're cursed.\" says Emily.  \"Welcome to womanhood.  Until the sun rises and you don't have to worry about those things.\"<br>\r\nShe's starting to sound hysterical.<br>\r\n\"I was going to ask to crash on the bed here tonight. But I'll just risk walking back to my place and fighting off the advances of my drunk roommate.\" you say.  You kind of feel bad, Tom has made no move towards you, but you don't want to leave Emily right now, she's one of your strongest links to your life before this whole mess began.  The longer you stay, the greater the chance she'll change her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, stay on the couch tonight.\" says Emily.<br>\r\n\"I can paint you nails if you want.\" Amy adds.<br>\r\n\"It's fine.\" you tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, you are allowed to fall asleep on the couch, but you don't feel very tired.  Your body is restless, like it wants to see the world, and explore.  You pull the blanket on the couch tightly around you, and sit up, once you hear a few creeks.  You see Amy walking towards you with her make-up bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" you ask unimpressed.<br>\r\n\"I just wanted to see what you'd look like as a full woman.\" says Amy.<br>\r\n\"Like this.\" you say, pointing to your breasts and face.<br>\r\n\"You look like a man in a woman's body...No offense...Everything about you seems reserved, and sad.\" she says.<br>\r\n\"I'm reserved and sad because I look so different.  Trying to make me look more different is just going to make me feel worse.\" you explain to her.<br>\r\n\"I thought that when I was a little girl.  But the things in this bag, they made me look better, and feel better.  I just thought...\"<br>\r\n\"You know when I wake up in the morning, I'll be male again, right?\" you ask her.<br>\r\nAmy bites her lip, embarrassed.  \"I didn't know.\" she says.<br>\r\n\"It's fine, this situation is just unnatural, I don't know how I would of reacted in this sort of situation.\"<br>\r\n\"Like if I turned into a man?\" Amy says.<br>\r\n\"Ya, and it turned out that no one taught you how to use or take care of your body.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"Do you still think like a man?\" Amy asks.<br>\r\n\"Ironically, I mainly think like one at night.  During the last few days, I've been noticing curtains, and outfit designs.\"<br>\r\n\"Strange.\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" you tell Amy.<br>\r\n\"Why?\" she asks.<br>\r\n\"How letting me talk to you.\"<br>\r\n\"It's called female-bonding.\" Amy says. \"It'll be better if you let me do your hair and make-up.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm not ready for that yet.\" you tell her.<br>\r\n\"One day.\" she says.<br>\r\n\"Maybe when I want to kill myself.\" you retort.<br>\r\nYou both let out a tiny snort of laughter.<br>\r\n\"Shhhh. Not too loud, you'll wake Emily.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"So I'll let you get back to sleep them.\" Amy says.<br>\r\n\"Here,  Give me this.\" you say taking the make-up bag.<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" she asks.<br>\r\nYou lift up the couch.  No easy feat, considering the lack of muscles in your arm.  Then you throw the small bag under it and jump back on the couch.<br>\r\n\"What was that for?\" Amy asks.<br>\r\n\"To make sure you didn't put that stuff on me when I slept.\" you say.<br>\r\nAmy smiles, it was exactly what she was planning to do.<br>\r\n\"Good night.\" you say to Amy.<br>\r\n\"Good night.\" she replies, as she heads back into her room.</span></div></div>",

As you look down, you see Amy held between your arms as you leg has wrapped around the outside of her thigh.<br>\r\nWell, it's better to wake up as a man next to a woman you don't like, than it is to wake up as a woman next to a man that you don't like.  Plus you both have your clothes on.  Well, you have Amy's clothes on, but Emily was the one that put them on you.  They feel tight now.  To the point where you can barely move in them.  Not that you could move at all with Amy snuggling against you.  She's not awake yet.  She must have come to the couch when you were asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you got over me fast.\" Emily says as she walks by you and Amy.<br>\r\n\"She was feeling vulnerable and alone.\" says Amy.<br>\r\n\"Oh, female hormones are such a bitch. He'll get used to them.\" Emily says as she walks out the door.<br>\r\nAmy turns around and sees your masculine face again. \"Oh wow.\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreakfast is small but enjoyable.  The transformations are causing you to burn more than you take in.  You're actually losing weight.  Of course, you need to eat more energy to keep going.  You look down at yourself realizing that you now how to be aware of the two different figures you have.<br>\r\n\"This breakfast is lovely.\" you tell Amy, careful not to chew with your mouth full.<br>\r\n\"Thanks, but it's just cereal and some left overs.\"<br>\r\n\"Ya, but it's just what I need to watch my figure.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"I guess.\" says Amy.<br>\r\n\"You've got a pretty nice figure yourself.  I'm jealous.\" you tell her.<br>\r\n\"You're just saying that.\" she says embarrassed.<br>\r\n\"No really, I can totally see why Emily is jealous of you.\"<br>\r\n\"I...this is part of the curse isn't it?\" she asks.<br>\r\n\"Oh, the curse!  What time is it?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"Almost noon.\" Amy answers.<br>\r\n\"Oh, wow, I got to go.\" you tell Amy as you run out the door.<br>\r\nYou've changed back into the clothes you came over with.  They don't look as nice on you as Amy's clothes did, but they at least fit, and you can run pretty fast with them if you need to.  And you're running towards your daily meeting with that girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go down to the bottom floor at the library and look at the table the girl sits at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see a crumpled up paper next to some books on it.  You un-crumple the paper and begin to read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDEAR VICTIM,<br>\r\nI AM SORRY.  I HAD TO LEAVE. IDENTITY FOUND HERE.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI AM SORRY.  IT WILL GET WORSE FOR YOU.<br>\r\nI AM SORRY.  I HAVE NOT CHANGED BACK IN OVER A MONTH NOW.<br>\r\nI AM SORRY.  HOPEFULLY YOU ARE STRONGER.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMY NAME IS ALAN.  PEOPLE CALLED ME ALICE.  I HOPE THEY REMEMBER BE AS ALAN.  ITS WHO I WAS BORN AS AND WHO I WISH TO DIE AS.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI AM SORRY.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-ALAN<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is more on the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUNDERNEATH THE TABLE, STUCK TO SOME GUM IS THE KEY TO MY APARTMENT IT'S PAID UP FOR THE NEXT TWO MONTHS.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing that is the address.  Kind of risky for him to leave it here.  But the books did make it look like someone was just disappearing for a minute and would return.  You look at the books.  ORLANDO by Virginia Wolfe. THE MYTH OF HERMAPHRODITUS by Ovid. TEIRESIAS by an unknown author.  There are several other books there, but all of them are on the same subject, about a guy becoming female because of magic.<br>\r\nYou stick your hand under the desk, and feel a big wad of gum.  Inside of it is a house key.</span></div></div>",

In it is a delightful color-coordinated apartment, with frilly curtains and a clean carpet.  Oh wow, there are frilly pillows everywhere.  (Is this a peek of what your future will look like?)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExploring a bit, you found out that his whole closet is full of clothes he never wore.  Dresses, shoes, blouses, skirts, and more shoes.  And they're a mess.  Why anyone needs thirty pairs of shoes, you'll never know.  He must have been buying a pair a day.  You venture into his bathroom, to find the toilet seat down with a cozy on it.  There are at least two vanity mirrors, and feminine hygiene products on the counter.  Getting the eerie feeling like you're in some sort of cursed tomb, you turn the lights off and leave the room, without touching anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the bedroom, you see pictures all over the wall.  They're pictures that Alan took of himself.  Some are of him naked, some are of him dressed up.  Some are of his face in a variety of facial expressions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk over to his desk to see to your horror, a scrap book.  You wearily open it up and look at the what's in it.  There are more pictures of him.  Newspaper clippings of cross dressers and other perverse things.  Some of the pictures have notes beside them.  One says 'My first date.' and you squirm.  The idea of Alan dating anyone creeps you out.  Underneath it, three underlined words say 'My ONLY date.  It is followed by a picture of Alan/Alice, looking sad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to look at anymore of Alan's scrap-booking, for the moment, you keep looking through his desk.  You find some ripped out pages from other books.  Almost none of them have any notes.  Although you find a highlighted passage on one of the pages.  It says:  <b>When dealing with contagious monsters as werewolves or vampires, whose bite may cause the curse to spread to the victim, it is possible to undo the curse in the victim, by killing the monster that infected them in some ritual manner.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt hit's you, this must have been what Alan was trying to do for you.  Unable to cure himself, he's hoping that his death will cure you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the page is not highlighted.  But interested in a possible cure, you continue to read more.  There's really nothing to note until you flip over the page and find a tiny sentence in the back.  It says: In some legends involving werewolves and vampires, the only way to revert the curse is for the most recent victim of the creature to be the one to kill it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it hits you, that part is not highlighted, Alan probably never read it.  (Oh shit.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to panic and see if there is any videos or notes left by Alan to see if he'd leave any clues to how he'll kill himself.</span></div></div>",

You see Alan's body taken from the river as a news reporter talks about the mysterious girl who jumped off a bridge and drowned herself in the river.  A video from a phone shows the girl jumping off.  <br>\r\n\"Police are still looking for the young woman's body.  But in their search for the remains, came across a naked young man's body.

You need someone to bitch at.\"<br>\r\n(You hate her, she's right.)<br>\r\n\"I'll be your Sherpa. We'll get you through this.\" she says hugging you.<br>\r\nThe hug is not at all sexual, but human contact is making you feel better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll stay here for tonight.\" Amy says.<br>\r\nYou feel too weakened by the televisions revelation to argue with her.</span></div></div>",

Maybe it just happened a bit earlier for you.  You walk towards the closet and slip something on.  It's only after you go to the mirror that you realized you just slipped on a one piece dress.

Why not?  I'll even do your nails.\" she says, her back still turned to you as she goes to get some boxes.

You never changed shape again after Alan died.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing female wasn't that bad.  Amy was right.  It just felt unnatural, until a few month later when it didn't.  Your mind always reverted to it's male side once night fell, but you accepted that you couldn't change your situation, and just watched sports events and action movies during that time.  You knowledge of these subjects made quite a few guys try and hook up with you.

You've found out the guy's name is Todd.  He's a bit of a dork, and knows binary.  He seems somewhat out of shape though, you could probably take him in a fight. Wearing his thick framed glasses, Todd at least has the good sense to offer you his coat as you walk through the cold night.  Todd might not have a lot going for him, but at least he knows how to treat a woman.  It's just to bad he seems to be focusing this effort on you.  Maybe you can try and set him up with someone.  (Wait, why are you thinking this?)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after what seems to be a pleasant stroll you find yourself in front of your residence.<br>\r\n\"Is this your place?\" Todd asks playfully.<br>\r\n\"Ya, thanks.\" you tell him.<br>\r\n\"No problem.\" he says as you open up the door.<br>\r\nYou both stand on different sides of the threshold, neither one seeming to break eye contact.  Why isn't this guy leaving?<br>\r\n\"Um...\" he says.<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" you say. (Why do you sound needy?)<br>\r\n\"I'd like my coat back.\" he says.<br>\r\nFor a second you consider telling him that he can take it with him in the morning.  You have no clue why you'd think this, maybe it's so out of character that the thought just jumped in your head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh an embarrassing girlish laugh as you hand over the coat.<br>\r\n\"Say something!\" you think.<br>\r\n\"It was nice meeting you.\" Todd says.<br>\r\n\"Same.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"So, if you see me around sometime, don't be afraid to come over and say hi.\" he says as he holds your hand.<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" you say.  You don't know why, but that physical contact has started your heart racing.<br>\r\n\"I'll do the same.\" he says as he walks off into the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door shuts and you walk up to your room.  (Why do you feel like skipping? Stop it!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open the door, forgetting that you're female.  It just hits you how embarrassing it'd be for you to walk in on Tom when you're like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoy your date?\" asks a voice over at Tom's computer.<br>\r\n\"Wait, what?\" you ask as you flip on the light-switch.<br>\r\nThe lights merely flicker and it hits you that the person at the computer isn't Tom.</span></div></div>",

I was the guy who fell asleep on the couch.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"Impossible.  It was just me and my fraternity brother's last night.  And some bitches we picked up from the campus bar.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm pretty sure I was there with you guys.\" you reply.<br>\r\n\"You ain't listening to me.  You weren't.  We got film, we got pics, everyone in this house is going to star in my blog this afternoon.  I just looked through the pics.  You ain't in them.\" he sneers.  \"Now get outta here.\"<br>\r\nYou see that that he is about to shut the door, so you shout, \"If I wasn't there last night, how do I know that your couch is green?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy looks at you with a suspicious face.  He then shuts the door and leaves you alone on the porch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is nothing left to do now, but go back to campus.  This whole thing was a waste of time.</span></div></div>",

After studying some more so that you can write your paper, you decide that going on the internet and randomly browsing websites would be more productive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyping Omega-Yang-Fraternity, you come across the blog that the guy you met was talking about.  The pictures from last night are posted, and you slowly take your time scrolling through them.  There are lots of pictures of hot girls doing inappropriate things.  Some are flashing their breasts, some are dropping their pants, some are doing oral.  (Hey, there's a video of the oral sex.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter looking for an hour, finally catch something of interest, that mysterious girl that kissed you the other night is one of the ones with her top off.  You then come across another picture of a girl who is naked, wearing only the lipstick that you woke up to find yourself marked with.  You must have made out with her last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe doesn't look anything like a wholesome girl.  You can tell by her face that this bitch is trouble.  (Hopefully you wore a condom.)  There is a picture of her making out with five different guys (while naked,)  and your relieved when none of the pictures have her making out with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you looking at?\" Tom asks as he comes up behind you.<br>\r\n\"Nothing.\" you say as you try and close the website.<br>\r\nYou're not fast enough, Tom sees what's going on.<br>\r\n\"Alex, if you wanted porn, I have collection in my closet.\" says Tom.<br>\r\n\"No, it's a site that Amy found last night, she said one of her friend's were at this party.\" you lie.<br>\r\n\"I thought you were with Emily last night.\"<br>\r\n\"I was...they're always together.\" you explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Wow, you're getting good at lying.

The girl that's with us keeps giving them ice cold stares.  Keeping them away from out table, like she's got her claim on us.  Anyways, she can't keep all of us to herself, so Terry and Kyle go dancing with those other women.  I swear, not two minutes later, I see them fondling the girls breasts in the corner.\"<br>\r\n\"Wow, no wonder you didn't check up on me.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm not even done the story.

I get here, make sure you're not in the room, then jump on the bed.  She looks at me like she wants to blow me.  But first she offers to make a drink.  I'm convinced she slipped something in that drink.  I was out like a light.\"<br>\r\n\"Damn, did she take your wallet?\" you ask.<br>\r\nTom checks his pants pocket.  \"Still here.\" he says.<br>\r\n\"Did she rape you?\"<br>\r\nTom pulls the front of his pants forwards and looks down into them.  \"Doesn't smell funky.\" he smiles.<br>\r\nYou think the conversation is over, but Tom looks up at you.  \"I've got to get together with the boys tonight to exchange war stories.\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at the time, You still got a good three hours before class.</span></div></div>",

You eat some food, study the reading material, then participate in the next class.  Once it gets dark out, you figure you'll just close your eyes for a bit before going back to study.

Meanwhile, as she's doing this, her legs start to rub against mine under the table.\"<br>\r\n\"Tom, I don't really want to...\"<br>\r\n\"Let me finished.  The one beside me starts rubbing her breasts against my shoulder, and before I know it, her hand is on my crotch, she's massaging it through my pants.  Next thing I know, the girls look at each other, look at me and say 'threesome!' then giggle.  I know I dream about this, but it smelled wrong. I need an exit, and manage to break towards the door.  I look outside, and I swear that there's a group of like ten sluts in the area.  I know I'm not going to make it back to this place tonight, so I hide in the mens' room.\"<br>\r\n\"That's terrifying.\" you say sarcastically, expecting this story to be made up. \"Let me guess, you came to your senses, banged every one of them, and showed them their place.\"<br>\r\n\"Dude, it's not funny.  I stayed in the mens' room for two hours.  At one point, the two girls looked in and asked if I was there.  They felt the breeze of an open window and assumed I escaped.\"<br>\r\n\"You really expect me to believe that...\"<br>\r\n\"One of the girls called the other Teri.  How creepy is that?\" he says.<br>\r\n\"It's not an uncommon girls name.\"<br>\r\n\"Hey man, you got kissed by that strange girl, like three nights ago, did your life get any better since?\"<br>\r\n\"No, but I don't think that a single kiss is the sole cause of all my recent troubles.\"<br>\r\n\"I used to have dreams of these types of things.  I felt like last night, I was in a nightmare.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you're overreacting.\"<br>\r\n\"Does this mean I turned gay?\" Tom asks you in a terrified manner.<br>\r\n\"Tom, I don't think people just turn gay.  I think you're born that way.\"<br>\r\n\"So I'm not going to find you attractive?\" Tom asks, showing signs of relief.<br>\r\n(What was Tom's upbringing like?

You touch it and find that you're wearing a bright red wig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice that you're wearing nylons and once again are unconstrained by any pair of underwear. <br>\r\nAs you raise your head further off the pillow, you notice that you're in a nice king sized bed in a crappy downtown apartment.<br>\r\nThat's not all.  Looking into a wardrobe mirror at the end of the bed, you see that you're face has been made up.  You're wearing hot pink lipstick, dark blue eyeshadow, and there is a powder around your face to make your skin look brighter than it really is.<br>\r\nAs your eye's shift down on the reflection, you see that you're wearing three inched leather high-heeled boots that come up to your knees.<br>\r\nYou're about to get up, when you hear a giant snore coming from the foot of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou want to get out, but you're not sure if you'd ever live it down if you went outside like this.  Then you're eye spots an open drawn with what seems to be your old clothes slightly sticking out of it.  You want to reach them, but that means you'd risk waking the man.  You're not sure how he'd feel about seeing a strange cross dresser going through his clothes in the morning.  You crawl to the end of the bed and see a giant muscular thirty year old sleeping on the floor.  He kind of looks Greek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you risk going for the clothes?  Or just cut your losses and go.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You're in a strange place in a strange getup, with a strange man sleeping near you.  All common sense just says you should leave while you still have a chance to.  If he dressed you up like this in your sleep, he's probably some sort of ultra-perv, or he's a serial killer or something.  Thankful that you didn't end up in handcuffs, you decide to sneak out before this guy wakes up and complicates things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst thing you need to do is take these boots off so that you can sneak out of the apartment without waking him.  A second later, you're horrified when the zipper refuses to move.  You're trapped in these things.  (How did you even get them on?)  Being extra cautious, you slowly put your heels to the floor and try to stand up.  You lean all over the place, before balancing well enough to stand up.  With a noticeable wobble, you start taking miniature steps towards the door.  You raise your arms out to the sides to try and balance yourself, leaning against the wall first chance you get.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach step sounds extremely loud to you, but the sleeping guy on the floor doesn't seem to notice.  You escape the bedroom, to find yourself in the living room, with a little purse on the table.  Seeing some imprints of coins along the side of it are all the temptation that you need to take it with you.  Throwing it over your shoulder, you head towards the main door.  On the rack beside the main entrance is a worn out leather jacket.  You take it in hopes of hiding your embarrassing upper-wear.  You your surprise, there is a large pair of sunglasses in the front pocket.  You quickly throw them over your face.  People may know you're a man by your legs, but at least now they can't get a good look at your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeeping the wig to disguise your identity, you make your way out the door and slowly walk down a flight of stairs to reach street level.<br>\r\nCatching a bus, you pay the fare with the change in the purse, and sit at the back trying not to draw anymore attention to yourself than necessary.  It's not too successful, as a young kid beside his mother keeps pointing at you and saying \"Mommy, what's wrong with her?\"  You respond with a forced smile as the mother gives the kid a lecture of why it's not polite to point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a transfer, you end up close enough to the campus that you can make it to your residence without causing too much attention to yourself, as long as you sneak through the back door.  Walking on campus, you see a few familiar faces, but they don't seem to recognize you.  Some asshole gives a wolf whistle at you, and you just flip him off.  Deciding to remain silent.  You make it into the building and through some miracle, get to your floor without anyone seeing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the door, (your key was in the purse for some reason,) you take off the jacket and glasses and decide to wash your face.  Refusing to wonder why your face looks that way, you wash all the make up off.  You manage to get the tube top off with ease, the skirt and boots seem to take a lot more work.   Trying to make your skin more slippery by using a wet bar of soap, you finally manage to get naked, and take a long hot shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the water hits your face, you think about how you can no longer afford to ignore these back outs.  You start to piece together how they all come to you after nightfall, and they all seem to end by morning.  You're clearly mobile during them, but it seems that you have little to no control of your actions during that period.  They also started the night after that strange girl kissed you.  This was connected with her.  You also wake up lying down.  So it seems that your body has to pass out after you black out before you regain consciousness again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter your shower, you get dressed, hide all the clothing you woke up with under your bed, and look at the internet to see if there are any similar medical conditions like the one you are suffering.  It turns out there are, but a lot of them involve head trauma or drugs.  Although some people are known to have such dramatic experiences that they completely block them out.  But almost none of them have them on a nightly basis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go to class, but all your notes suck, you're clearing having a bad week.  When you come back, you check out the Omega-Yang-Fraternity's nightly blog and see that it hasn't been updated since you last checked it.  (That's weird you think.)</span></div></div>",

If you can find that strange girl that kissed you, you might be able to get some answers.  Tom could also shed some light about what happened when you blacked out.  Finding them would probably give you the best chance to piece this together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething is up at the Omega-Yang-Fraternity as well.  It wasn't coincidence that you woke up there and then they stopped posting on their blogs. (Well, that might have been a coincidence.)  It's clear the campus clinic has no clue what's going on.  Maybe you could clear this stuff up and make things good with Emily again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter thinking about it, the only thing that's sure to be there is the Fraternity.  You decide to walk down and see if they can shed some light on the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knock on the door and the door to see a different person there.  It's a small black guy with glasses, who looks a bit on the nerd side.<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" he says.<br>\r\n\"Hi, I was at the party here last weekend.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh ya, I remember you.\" he lies.<br>\r\n\"Ya, I'm a follower of your blog, did it get shut down?  Did another girl try and sue you?\"<br>\r\n\"No, we just haven't had any night parties here worth posting.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, one more thing, are you guys experiencing black outs?\"<br>\r\n\"Like...?\"<br>\r\n\"Like you've just missed eight hours of your life.\"<br>\r\nThe little black guy looks around to see if anyone else is around.  \"Come on in.\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy tells you his name is Steve and offers to make some tea.  You both sit down on the puke green couch, as he pulls up the coffee table.<br>\r\n\"Ya, the blackouts started Monday night.  At first, I thought it was just me.\"<br>\r\n\"But after the second night, you noticed...\"<br>\r\n\"...That everyone was waking up in weird places. Ya.\"<br>\r\n\"So what did you do?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, first two nights, we figured someone drugged our drinks. Last night, thought it might be something more.\"<br>\r\n\"Any plans for how to deal with this?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm videotaping some of the guys when they fall asleep.  Seeing if anything worth noting happens.\"<br>\r\n\"Good call.\"<br>\r\n\"Ya, we want to get this thing fixed fast.  We're keeping it close to the chest now.  People from around campus say that their are these slutty girls coming out at night, looking for guys like us.\"<br>\r\n\"...And you want them to party with you.\"<br>\r\n\"That's the plan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then proceed to tell him about your black outs, but leave out details on where you woke up.<br>\r\nSteven than looks at you, \"It's strange, I don't remember you being her on the weekend.\"<br>\r\n\"Maybe you blacked it out.\" you say jokingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, the tea is ready.\" Steven says as he rushes in to get some.<br>\r\n\"It's okay, I really should be going.\" you tell him.<br>\r\n\"I insist.\" says Steven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, Steven was informative, but the last time you saw that strange girl that kissed you was around noon at the library.  Maybe she's there again.  Leaving now might be your best chance to see her, if she's even there again.  On the other hand, it might not be wise to upset Steven, he could be a connection here that you could use.  The guy who answered the door last time was no help.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When you regain your senses you find your nearly naked, wearing only a pair of your briefs, as your sitting on some guys lap.  You look down and are shocked at your appearance.  It being nearly naked wasn't enough, you're now sporting a perky set of breasts and some tight curves.  The front of your briefs looks incredibly flat as well.  The same thing can not be said about the front of the man's pants that you are sitting on, as his member is fully at attention.  To your disgust, you look down and see that your hands were about to unzip his fly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man notices that you've stopped grooving on his lap and are paused just before you're about to pull down his pants.  \"You okay?\" he asks.<br>\r\nYou just sit there stunned, with you mouth wide open.  \"Did you just get a stroke?\" he jokes.<br>\r\n\"I...um...\" you pause for a second, your voice has a much higher octave than you're used to.  \"...I need to use the bathroom.\" you finish.<br>\r\n\"Babe, I don't care if I get a bit wet.\" says the man, as he puts his arms around you and squeezes you closer to his erect member.<br>\r\n\"I gotta take a shit.\" you say frantically.  Not being a perverse German, the man lets go and lets you exit the room to find a toilet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't a complete lie, you really did have to use the toilet.  At least you think you do.  You take small steps well squeezing your newly rounded ass.  You can't help but think the man behind you is getting off on the image.  Two doors down the hall, you find a toilet, its seat covered in dry piss.  Feeling the urge to clean it, you resist and just throw toilet paper over the thing, creating an artificial cover for the seat.  (At least he left it down.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit down and fart.  It's not your usual fart, it's a dainty sounding fart.  A quick spray of piss comes out right after.  You look around, and notice that this place is at least nicer than the last one you woke up in.  The bathroom is bright, there is a rose in a glass half full of water, and even some scented candles by the sink.  This place defiantly feels like it has a woman's sensibility about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down at yourself on the toilet, you now have child bearing hips. and a nice set of firm little boobs.  You gaze down to see that your manhood is gone, and replaced with a tiny slit, possessing vaginal lips.  Out of sheer curiosity you touch it and a quiver shoots through your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand up from the toilet, pull your briefs back over your smooth legs and look in the mirror.  Your boobs are swaying a bit. (You need to find those things some support!)  Another thing you find disturbing is that you are wearing make up.  You see the darkened eyelashes, covered in mascara, outlined by a dark eyeliner.  It defiantly makes your eyes look bigger and rounder than they are.  Your eyebrows look plucked too, and more arched than they used to be.  You're also wearing a light toned pink lipstick, that's meant to compliment your skin color. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf that wasn't disturbing enough, you see that your hair is now longer, you have bangs falling around the ears.  And you're wearing earrings.  Blue buttoned earrings.  You want to blame Steve for dressing you up this way, but you remember the way you woke up the other night, and think that there's something more going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice a make up bag on the counter, and look in it to see a familiar set of keys, as well your old ID and some money.  You were in this bathroom before.  Taking one last look at yourself in the mirror, you notice your reflection looks more sinister than you want it to.  But when you try and smile, it bangs on the glass, breaking it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink your eyes in shock, and the mirror and your reflection return to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open the door, and return to the room, starting to pick up your lose clothes on the floor.  (Well, you assume they're yours, but they don't look like anything you'd wear.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What took you?\" asks the guy.<br>\r\n\"I'm not feeling well.\" you tell him.<br>\r\n\"I've got some medicine.\" he says.<br>\r\n\"Trust me, I'm not up for anything tonight.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"But you were practically begging to pleasure me earlier tonight.\"<br>\r\n\"Well that was earlier, before this hit.\" you say in a pissed off voice. \"<i>Before I came to my senses.</i>\" you think.<br>\r\nThe man nods and starts to help you collect your clothes.<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" you say as he passes the last of your clothes to you. You then instinctively kiss him on the forehead.  \"<i>Why did I do that?</i>\" you think, puzzled, and afraid of how impulsive you're behaving.<br>\r\nYou then begin to dress in front of the guy.  Why not? He's seen you nearly naked.  He even helps you hook your bra on after it's clear you're having trouble doing it yourself.<br>\r\nThe guy then offers to drive you back.  \"An ass like yours is too cute to be walking alone at night.\" is his reasoning.  Not wanting to get raped, you agree and he drops you off at the university.<br>\r\n\"You're a student?\" he says.<br>\r\n\"Ya.\" you say almost insulted.<br>\r\n\"But you told me you're 24.\" he says.<br>\r\n\"Can't I be both?\" you shrug innocently.<br>\r\n\"I guess.  So I let you off here?\" he says stopping fifty yards from your building.<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" you say, and he leans in, his lips puckered for a kiss.<br>\r\n\"Not tonight.\" you say.  \"I don't want to give you whatever I have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get out of the car and walk up to the building.  You wave at the car as you open the door and it drives away.  But before you can close the thing, that mysterious girl that kissed you runs up waving and shouting \"Alex. Alex.\"</span></div></div>",

I didn't know the first thing about taking care of my body. I even tried dating, but I never got a second date with anyone.  The year, I blacked out and woke up in positions you wouldn't believe.\"<br>\r\n\"I might believe them.\" you say, thinking of your own experience.<br>\r\n\"Oh, tip if you want a safe sex life, dildos are worth every penny.\" she says, before getting back to her story. \"Anyways, one night, a guy got really drunk and started hitting on me.  I figured what-the-hell and kissed him.  He gave me his number, next date we had, he started changing in his car, while driving.  Nearly avoiding a crash, I discovered that this girl was horny and looking to me for advice.  Next thing you knew it was a girls night out.  He woke up next to me that morning, back to normal, but wondered why he had a manicure.  Didn't remember a thing since the transformation.  I told him we just had the greatest sex of our lives, and the next night, the same changes happened again.  Except this time at the bar, he went home with another guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice pauses.<br>\r\n\"What happened to them?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"Don't know.  Anyways, I found out that if I swap fluids with anyone, if it's blood, saliva, cum, whatever, they become...like me...you.\"<br>\r\n\"So why do this? Why isn't this a national phenomenon of STD?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"Because I'm careful.\"<br>\r\n\"Like you were careful with me?\"<br>\r\n\"I had alcohol. Tip don't drink alcohol, even the slightest drop affects your judgement severely.  Then you're open to suggestion or driven by impulse.<br>\r\n\"Is that why you ordered me this beer?\" you ask, putting down the bottle.<br>\r\n\"Ya.\" Alice admits.<br>\r\n\"Why do this to others?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"The guys that changed, the Omega-Ying-Yang whatever, they deserved it, sexist pigs almost raped me one night.  That guy tonight, didn't know what he had, hit on me right in front of his wife.\"<br>\r\n\"Wait, you're pimping me out for vengeance?\" you ask.<br>\r\nAlice gives a wicked smile and drinks whatever is in her glass.<br>\r\n\"You SUCK!\" you say, feeling a bit woozy as you point your finger at her.  The beer is kicking in.<br>\r\n\"Why my roommates friends, or that Greek guy downtown?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"I had nothing to do with those.\" she says. \"Who you screw on your own time is your business.\"<br>\r\nYour mind is getting cloudy, you can feel it, you're losing control.  Your vision starts to blur, your eyes look at your cleavage, your shoes, the exposed skin of your legs.  (You're pretty hot when you're drunk! And that guy behind you thinks so too.)<br>\r\n\"Mam, can I walk you home?\" he asks in a gentlemanly manner.<br>\r\n\"You can walk me anywhere.\" you say, as you get up off the stool and trip against him.  (Stupid alcohol.) <br>\r\nYou look back at the stool where Alice was sitting, it's empty.  <br>\r\nThis must have been the guy she wanted you to see tonight.  Damn it, you played right into her hands!  Not that you care right now.  Your brain is working at a reptilian level, the big strong man is taking you home.</span></div></div>",

It's hot under the blanket, you're both stripped down to your undergarments.<br>\r\n\"<i>How stupid is the guy going to feel when he wakes up and finds out we're both dudes?</i>\" you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurns out he's not going to feel as stupid as you are in a second. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you feel the guy's morning rise against you, you realize that your soldier is no longer standing at attention, concerned, you slide your hand down there to realize that even though it's morning, you are still female.  You take a peak under the covers and lift your undies to see that the lips between your legs are swollen.  Now that yo think about it, that area does hurt.  Trying to move your stomach muscles, you feel something dry and stick on them.  \"<i>Please don't let that be what I think it is.</i>\" you think.  You roll a bit and look at the floor beside your bed, where three used condoms are sitting on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try and pull yourself out from under the guys arm, but all it does is does is wake him.<br>\r\n\"Morning.\" he says with loving eyes.<br>\r\n\"Hi.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"Last night was amazing.\" he says.  You blush, horrified.<br>\r\n\"I'm going to freshen up.\" you say, as you take his arm from around you.<br>\r\nHe sits up as you stand.<br>\r\n\"Why don't you make us some breakfast.\" he says playfully as he slaps your ass.<br>\r\n\"Hey.\" you say as the slap causes you to jump a bit in surprise.  You have a hard time walking.  Your calves keep quivering like they're going to give out.  The guy looks at you struggling.  \"Don't mind those, they're just aftershocks.\" the he says.  (How come you never gave Emily aftershocks?)<br>\r\nYou look at your face in the mirror.  You now possess what some women call raccoon eyes.  The make up has run down beneath them.  Your lipstick also looks a bit smudged.  You sit on the toilet, wanting to cry, but unable to will yourself to do so.  Too many thoughts are flowing through your head.  Did you want to do this? How much of it was the curse, and how much of this sexual odyssey was caused by a chance to unleash your sexual repression?  Are you straight? What would even be considered straight now?  Your nipples tighten up just thinking of guys, but your mind seems a bit repulsed by that fact.  Are you cursing them the same way Alice did you?  How much responsibility do you have to this guy?  Should you even tell him what's going to happen, or would he just think you're crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe you should tell him over breakfast. Wait, what are you thinking?  He took you when you were drunk.  Was he drunk too?  The condoms would suggest otherwise.  Maybe this fucker is getting exactly what's coming to him.  You should kick him out into the hall like he is, nearly naked.</span></div></div>",

But how do you tell a man that he's going to lose his Y-chromosome?  Are you going to be cruel about it?  Or try and break it to him sweetly.  You keep asking yourself why you even want to tell him what will happen, but decide that no matter what sort of dick he is, he deserves to know the life changing experience that he's about to undergo.  The kind of warning that Alice tried to give to you, after she forced it on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...\" you say, to the guy as he puts his pants back on.<br>\r\n\"Name is Greg.\" he says, almost like he can read your mind.<br>\r\n\"Listen, Greg.

You should have chosen your words better.  This guy could beat you into a pulp, walk away, and no one else would ever know.<br>\r\n\"PLEASE! LISTEN!\" you yell, raising you hands to brace yourself in case he attacks.<br>\r\n\"Bitch, this had better be good.\" he says, gritting his teeth.<br>\r\n\"STD was the wrong word, it's not a disease, it's a condition. But it's only passed down through sexual acts.\"<br>\r\n\"Condition.\" Greg repeats, quietly and intensely.<br>\r\n\"Kind of like a curse, it raises your charisma, your sex-appeal, your life expectancy, and some would argue, your IQ, but it also raises your voice.\"<br>\r\n\"My voice?\" Greg repeats.<br>\r\n\"You're going to turn into a girl.\" you say.<br>\r\nGreg's reaction goes from intense fear and anger to a forced smile.<br>\r\n\"You had me going there.\" he says.<br>\r\n\"I know what you're thinking, but it's not a joke.\" you tell him.<br>\r\n\"Oh, wow, bitch, you are crazy.\" he says with a laugh. \"Who put you up to this? One of my weird friends? It was Johnathan wasn't it?\"<br>\r\n\"Johnathan? No!...Listen, you need to know...\"<br>\r\nBefore you can finish, he's out the door.</span></div></div>",

Maybe the fact that you haven't changed back is having a psychological impact on you.  Right now, you don't care, you never wanted to wake up like this!  It's time to make sure this guy gets what's coming to him, and you don't want him to see it coming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think how the best way to get him out of here is.  What do girls do in these situations?  Ah, hissy-fits.  That should do the trick.<br>\r\nYou look in the mirror again and remove your lipstick, the smudges on it just look weird.  You're keeping the swollen looking raccoon eye though.  They make you look creepy and unstable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>The trick is to be unpredictable and unreasonable.</i>\" you keep telling yourself.  You take a deep breath and slam open the bathroom door.<br>\r\n\"Get out!\" you shout.<br>\r\n\"Wait, what?\" asks the guy.<br>\r\n\"Out now you sick fuck.\" you shout.<br>\r\n\"I'm confused.\" the guy says.<br>\r\n\"I never wanted to wake up with you.\" you tell him.<br>\r\n\"Did you want me to sneak out in the middle of the night?\"<br>\r\n\"I never wanted to sleep with you!\"<br>\r\n\"You seemed satisfied a minute ago.\" he says in earnest and confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrap, he hasn't left yet.

The sad truth is that you could use a good hug right now, but not from this guy.  You push him away, still looking mad.  \"Just take your clothes and go.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy picks up his clothes and walks out of your live forever.   You really didn't want to think about this morning again.<br>\r\nNow you need to get dressed.  You look on the floor and see that all types of girly, revealing clothes are now laying around your apartment.  You've figured out why that is at least.  Alice must have been getting these for you as she pimped you out in your blackouts.  You put on a sports bra and a blouse, and wear some ladies pants.  (You are defiantly not ready to try on a skirt.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou need to get some more answers from Alice.  So you make yourself some breakfast and clean up your face a bit.  You put your long hair into a ponytail. You look presentable.

Some girls you pass give you the stink-eye.  You catch at least one guy gazing at your breasts.  You can only imagine how many are looking at your ass.  You're mind is still unsure if you like the attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your mind wanders, you walk straight into someone, and fall on your ass.  \"Ouch.\" you say, your breasts and ass are sore from the hit.  You look up to see a very well built hard...er...dark haired man looking down at you.<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry.\" he says in a deep and confident voice.  You're blushing.<br>\r\n\"Here, let me help you up.\" he offers as his hands reach down to grab yours.<br>\r\n\"This was totally my fault.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"Trust me, I should have been watching for you.\"<br>\r\n\"I...\"<br>\r\n\"Let's just say we're both at fault.\" he smiles. \"Are you sure you're okay?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm...fine.\" you say, dusting yourself off.<br>\r\n\"Look, I'm in a rush, but I want to make this up to you.\" he says as he pulls a business card out of his wallet, and writes a number on the back.  \"Call me by tomorrow and I'll set something up to make up for this to you.\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" you say, as you can't help but smile.  He walks off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh wow!  That was that?  You offered no resistance.  What is wrong with you?  It's the curse.  It has to be the damn curse!<br>\r\nFor some reason, you feel the need to constantly look at the card.  Someone who has a business card just asked you out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, someone takes the card out of your hand.  You look up and see Emily looking straight at you.  She's mad.  \"Another one?  You got another one?!\" she shouts.  \"How many relationships are you going to ruin, skank!\"<br>\r\n\"That just happened.  I swear.\" you say immediately without thinking.<br>\r\n\"And what about my boyfriend?  Did that just happen too?\"<br>\r\n\"I swear I never slept with your boyfriend.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"And I'm supposed to believe that? I saw those pictures on the web!  You did it like with half a fraternity!\"<br>\r\n\"I promise, you'll never find me and your boyfriend in the same room at the same time.\"<br>\r\n\"What, I'm supposed to take you at your word?\" says Emily, clearly hurt as the thought that you'd want to spend more time with this girl you've become, than her.<br>\r\n\"He loves you.\" you blurt out.  \"Alex loves you.\"<br>\r\n\"How do you know?\" she asks sceptically.<br>\r\n\"I just do.  Please believe me, he never wants to see these again.\" you continue, fondling your breasts. \"He never wanted to see me, and never will.\"<br>\r\n\"I don't believe you.\" she says.<br>\r\n\"Ask him next time you meet him.\" you say as you go into the library, leaving her outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel bad, you love Emily, but when you just saw her now, nothing about her seemed attractive to you.  Although she is willing to fight for you.  That's something you'd be grateful for if it wasn't you she wanted to fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you go to see if you can find Alice in the basement, like you did earlier this week.</span></div></div>",

You calming walk up to her table and sit across from her.<br>\r\n\"Wow, you're still female?\" she asks.<br>\r\n\"Is that different?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"Usually, it takes just over a week for someone...like us, to stay as a female during the day.\"<br>\r\n\"I want some real answers.\" You tell her.<br>\r\n\"And I wanted to give them to you days ago.\" she says.<br>\r\n\"Why didn't you just tell me last night instead of pimping me out?\" you say angerly.<br>\r\n\"I did that? Crap.\" she says.<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n\"You know when you have black outs and wake up in strange places?\"<br>\r\n\"We talked about this last night.\"<br>\r\n\"That happened to me last night.  At night, I'm mentally a completely different person. Sometimes I remember what I do, sometimes I don't.  I usually have little to no control over my actions after dark.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt sounds a bit far fetched, but you're inclined to believe her, her legs are spread apart under the table, and she's not playing any games.  She sounds kind of like a dude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're contagious, aren't we?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"Most of the time.\" Alice admits. \"When you're PMSing, or pregnant, you won't be able to affect anyone.\"<br>\r\n\"Pregnant?!\"<br>\r\n\"Ya, you can get pregnant.  A friend of mine had it happen.  He...well, she, got knocked up, and didn't change back until she stopped nursing.<br>\r\n\"Wait, how quickly do ovaries form after the change?\"<br>\r\n\"Immediately.\"<br>\r\n\"Is this why I haven't changed?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"Not necessarily, there's plenty of reasons why you might not be able to change back.  Sometimes you mentally stop yourself, turns out it can work both ways too.  Sometimes your body is in danger, and it refuses to turn back.  Sometimes, your body registers that you're enjoy the form and it won't put unnecessary strain for your transformation. Of course, sometimes you just don't change back because the curse won't let you.\"<br>\r\n\"I see.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"Do you find yourself thinking about fashion, clashing clothes, curtains, stuff like that, even when you're a guy?\"<br>\r\n\"Sometimes.\" you admit.<br>\r\n\"It's because your brain is rewiring itself.  Your body also produces more estrogen, even when you're male. Do you find yourself being more passive than usual?\"<br>\r\nYou don't respond.<br>\r\n\"Thought so.\" Alice says.<br>\r\n\"Is there a cure?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"I'll tell you if I find one.\"<br>\r\n\"Seriously?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"It's going to be bras over bros.  Most the stuff I own now is feminine.  If you don't buy what you need, you'll find you'll just black out and not be pleased with what you wake up with.\"<br>\r\n\"So your mind is mostly male now, right?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"Ya.\" says Alice, letting out a small fart.<br>\r\n\"Then why are you wearing make up?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"Think of it like a sacrifice. If you do small things like this, when you black out, your id, or alter ego, or whatever she is, won't act as drastically to prove that she's female.\" Alice says.<br>\r\n\"So by acting girly now...\"<br>\r\n\"You won't wake up naked in a strangers bed.\" Alice says.<br>\r\n\"I wish you told me that a few days ago.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"If you weren't being such a bitch, I might have.\" responds Alice.<br>\r\n\"So when can I expect to change back?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"Assuming you're not pregnant, about two days.  Then who knows?  I've stayed like this for the past two months. Like it or not, your old life is over, unless everyone around believes in magic.\"<br>\r\n\"So what can I do?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"Well, death is always an option, some people become shut ins.  Some people tell their loved ones, and they accept them as this.  Some guys even manage to stay with their girls.  We're not contagious to those already female.  Lesbian relationships can happen.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm pretty sure my girlfriend is not a lesbian.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"Could always buy a strap on.\" she tells you.<br>\r\n\"And if I can't?\"<br>\r\n\"Then you'd better accept that fact that you like being with men.\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think about what you should do, and what lose ends you might want to wrap up before leaving, or if you should fight for Emily.  After all, she fought for you.  But before you can decide, your eyesight fades and you black out.</span></div></div>",

(You always suspected that women pooped.)<br>\r\n\"Okay...\" you say, as you can't get over how familiar she looks.<br>\r\n\"My name is Teri.\" she says<br>\r\n\"I totally knew that.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"Say 'hi' to Tom for me.\"<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" you say, and you get your usual shirt on, and pull of the baggy pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk out of the bathroom, to see that even more woman are now there.<br>\r\n\"I'm so proud of you Alex.\" Alice says as she gives you a hug.<br>\r\n\"Why?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"Because I had no clue how I would affect others, but increasing our numbers, making sure that we won't be alone, but you, your attitude and dedication, and let's face it, you libido, all showed me that it wasn't just this curse.\" she says.<br>\r\n\"Curse?\" you say.<br>\r\n\"You're right, it's not a curse, it's a tool, a tool of understanding, of evolution, and equalization.\"<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" you say.<br>\r\n\"Can you believe that over half of the ladies in this room were converted by you?\" she says.<br>\r\n\"<i>Wait, what?!</i>\" you think.  \"No I can't.\" you manage to say politely.<br>\r\n\"I hate you for that.\" says Beth as she gives you the middle figure.<br>\r\n\"Your just jealous your not top-slut.\" Teri says from the toilet.<br>\r\n\"Alex, you need to get back to your place.  There is maybe 2 hours before the sun comes out.  You really don't want Alexander to get even more suspicious about what's going on.\" she says.<br>\r\n\"I'm pretty sure that if he had half a brain, he'd figure out what's going on.\" you say, ironically. (Wait, is that ironic?)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leave, and as you do, a few girls hug you and thank you for being their inspiration, most wave as you exit into the hall, but Beth just gives the middle finger as she burps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make it to your apartment, and fall onto your bed, unable to sleep, thinking of the information you've obtained.  You seem to be a hit with everyone, next to Alice, you're probably top bitch of the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the sun comes through the window and hits you, you feel your body grow as your shoulder's spread, your hips shrink, and your breasts deflate as your lungs grown.  Your hair sheds until most of it falls to the floor and disintegrates in the light.  You feel your womb and uterus start to disappear as your testes and dick reemerge, with a sensual squeeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck?!\" you manage to say to yourself in your deep male voice as your thoughts start to become more your own.</span></div></div>",

Once you finish, you're about to lay down in bed again when Tom opens the door drunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sees you.<br>\r\n\"Buddy, you're up man.\" he slurs.<br>\r\n\"Yup, guess I am.\" you say. <br>\r\n\"You want to talk?\" he says.<br>\r\n\"Sure, why not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom gets another beer out of the fridge. and pours you both a glass.<br>\r\n\"Did you talk to Emily?\" he asks.<br>\r\n\"Ya, we're going out again the day after tomorrow, er...today, you know what I mean.\"<br>\r\n\"Totally.\"<br>\r\n\"How was the bar?\"<br>\r\n\"It was a club, it was awesome, I made out with like three chicks.\"<br>\r\n\"Cool.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"I totally made that part up, it was slow, some skanky looking girls tried to hit on us.  We said no, it was balls.\"<br>\r\n\"And now yours are blue.\" you said.<br>\r\n\"What? no!\" says Tom, too drunk to get the joke.<br>\r\n\"Want to go to bed now?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"No, I want to watch a movie. Tom says.<br>\r\n\"Whatever.\" you say, as you try and sleep.<br>\r\nIt's some Asian movie, a lot of yelling in it.  Tom actually falls asleep with the volume on.  You're not as lucky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery time you close your eyes, you find yourself imagining some feminine setting with you blending right in.  The night is comprised of six or seven twenty minute dreams, with you waking up before they become sexual.<br>\r\n\"<i>What's happening to me?</i>\" you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou eventually manage to fall asleep, but your alarm goes off thirty minutes later.</span></div></div>",

It's not like you'd be the first person inside the building who was caught asleep on the indoor bench.  In fact, seeing people sleep there is a daily thing.  Figuring that you'll just close your eyes for a minute, you lay down and hope that no one will steal your books while your out.</span></div></div>",

One night, I took the wrong woman home, she was all over me at the bar, but once she found out I'd passed it, she was talking some gibberish about getting her identity back.  Told her I'd help her, gave her a quick fuck, and then kicked her out the next morning.  I saw her corpse on the evening news.  Unidentified woman dead.  Later found out it was suicide.  I never said a word.  Didn't want it coming back to me. Next night I found out that whenever it got dark, my sausage became a pair of eggs.'<br>\r\n'Why?

The door locks itself as a bar is slid over across it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at your rescuer as the wolves bang against the door.  The person comes into the light and smiles.  It's Alice.<br>\r\n\"What are you doing here?\" she asks.<br>\r\n\"I..I came to see you.\" you spit out.<br>\r\n\"Oh, I see, you came to see me. Dressed like that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down and suddenly remember that you're completely indecent. (Funny how running for your life makes you forget things like that.)  Your hands try and cover your exposed bits, but they're still shaking from the adrenaline.<br>\r\n\"Don't bother.\" says Alice, throwing you an extra skirt that was in her chest. \"Not like I can rape you, and lets face it, you don't have anything I haven't seen before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice sits down and lets you put on a blouse that she also had in the chest.  She looks calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolves crash against the door again.<br>\r\n\"Why did you sick those on me?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"I have nothing to do with the wolves.\"<br>\r\n\"But...what is this place?\" you inquire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice pauses for a second, thinking if she should reveal the answer.<br>\r\n\"This place, is our dream.  A nightmare, a playground of sadistic acts.\" she says. \"But it's our dream.\"<br>\r\n\"Our dream.  So we're telepathically linked?\"<br>\r\n\"You, me, and that.\" Alice says pointing to the door as a wolf bangs into it once more.<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, he can't get in.  As far as I can tell, this is a safe zone.\"<br>\r\n\"A safe zone?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"In every one of these scenarios, there is a place where that thing can't get us.  I don't know why, maybe it has to follow some ancient rules, maybe it doesn't choose these settings.<br>\r\n\"So, we're safe here.\"<br>\r\n\"Now we just wait to wake up.\" Alice says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come out, come out baby girls.\" growls the wolf through the a tiny crack in the boarded up window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is he?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"He's our owner.\"<br>\r\n\"Our what?!\"<br>\r\n\"Technically, under some ancient law, he owns us.  The curse, that turns you into...well...her...that's a sign of his mark.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm marked?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"Yes, and it gets worse too.  Soon he'll be able to follow you outside of your sleep.<br>\r\n\"Why?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"Maybe it's his nature, maybe its how he procreates, I don't know, but the last thing you want to do is let him catch you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear the wolves snapping at something.<br>\r\n\"Please, help me. Please.\" screams a girl in the distance.<br>\r\nYou hear a growling and a final wail as you sense the girl is no more.<br>\r\n\"Was she...?\"<br>\r\n\"Yup. She was another one like us...I meet them, occasionally, in these scenarios. There are only two who have lasted longer than me.<br>\r\n\"Why did you bring me into this?\" you ask Alice.  You feel like crying.<br>\r\n\"Honestly, I was trying to escape.  Pass on the curse and save myself.\"<br>\r\n\"Didn't work, did it?\"<br>\r\n\"Nope.\"<br>\r\n\"But...\"<br>\r\n\"What's done is done.\"<br>\r\n\"How did you change when you're awake?  I've only been like this, while sleeping.\"<br>\r\n\"You occasionally wake up like this.  Lasts for about twenty-four hours, then you remain yourself for the next three days.\"<br>\r\n\"Even in your dreams?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"Nope.\" says Alice with a look of defeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try and look through a hole in the window boards to see if the wolves are out there.  You just see a new face morph in the tree nearest to you.  It must have been the unlucky girl that just died.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Run.\" the wind seems to whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look back over at Alice.<br>\r\n\"What happens in the demon dies in these dreams?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"Maybe he'll come back, maybe he'll die. Maybe it'll break the curse.\"<br>\r\n\"Do you want to try and take him out?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"Wouldn't you rather be safe?\" she replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Run.\" an unseen voice whispers again.</span></div></div>",

The origin from this comes from a webcomic I wrote (no, I'm not telling which one,) where the only female character in it was going to turn into a man during the full moon.  Unfortunately, the webcomic died before I finished the first arc, (but I wish the artist the best of luck,) so the idea never happened there.  Plus I always wanted to make a choose your own adventure book, since I read them a lot as a kid and teen, and wanted to see if I could pull it off.  The format on this site was the closest I'll probably ever get to making one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Q: What genre does this come under?</b><br>\r\n<b>A:</b> At first, it was supposed to be a comedy, where I'd play up the threat just like a werewolf movie.  But in traditional werewolf stories, the monsters lose almost all control of their impulses when transformed.  That wouldn't work as well for an interactive adventure.  So I tried to keep the comedy but getting the main character (Alex) to go through increasingly uncomfortable tasks.  As the chapters grew, I needed to find a way for him to either get cured or be stuck in his condition.  It was more fun to keep him trapped and miserable, so it became a horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Q: How much of this story did you plot out?</b><br>\r\n<b>A:</b> I originally tried to plot out about 200 choices going over 3 main story lines, but it felt to stringent and limiting, so after writing 2/3rds of the first major story arc, I improvised the rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Q: Who is your favorite character?</b><br>\r\n<b>A:</b> My favorite character was the one that I never intended to write, the Dark Stranger (a.k.a. the dark man,)  I was bored writing similar paths with minor changes, and I originally wanted Alex's curse to be the only supernatural thing about the fictional universe that he was in.  One day I got bored and wrote about a strange figure that attacks Alex out of nowhere.  It was the most interesting the story had been since I started it, so I made sure he kept popping up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Q: Are the characters based off of anyone?</b><br>\r\n<b>A:</b> Nope, I tried hard to do as little description as possible to the characters and locations in this story.  You fill their descriptions in on your own.  It's more fun to imagine people who you know (and probably hate) filling all of the roles.  Although I did meet a women named Alex who dresses and acts a lot like a man after I started writing this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Q: I see a lot of reoccurring characters and they act slightly different in every path.  What is canon?</b><br>\r\n<b>A:</b> Nothing about the curse is canon, it changes to keep the story interesting for the reader (and the writer,) as for characters and their relationships, if it's mentioned in two separate story threads and not contradicted, it's canon.  My original goal was to write a bunch of incomplete stories where you'd have to read each choice in order to get the whole story.  I kind of kept that, but the changing nature of the curse made it hard to keep with that original goal.  Still, you can get a sense of the larger tapestry in Alex's universe by picking the different choices and seeing what is revealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Q: I'm unhappy about where you left a storyline hanging, I want to read more of that story.</b><br>\r\n<b>A:</b> I did leave some story lines prematurely, because I wanted to do a similar story on another path/thread.  If enough people want a story to be continued, and I still have a few ideas on how to make Alex miserable, I'll continue it for you.  Otherwise, feel free to continue where the story left off by starting your own sequel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Q:</b> <b>There is a noticeable lack of sex/intercourse, dressing up, and the main character enjoying the situation, why didn't you make Alex have more fun with it?</b><br>\r\n<b>A:</b> Because personally, I find transformation stories terrifying.  The body shifting itself to an alien form, the new expectations placed on the character, the mystery (and usually magical) nature of the transformation is something more suitable to horror than fetish material.  The other reason is that every time to have a tg/tf story, those aspects get focused on WAY too often.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Q: If Alex and Tom are so short on money, how come they have a dorm room with a personal bathroom in it?</b><br>\r\n<b>A:</b> It's true that personal bathrooms are rare for dorm rooms and the ones that have them are usually much too expensive for people who have Tom and Alex habits to afford.  But for the stories sake, the situation posed more opportunities with the character to get out of strange situations if they had access to their own bathroom.  I'll just note too that for a lot of this story to work, Tom and Alex's dorm room would need to be three times wider in length than the average one you find on campuses in North America.  This relies on the suspension of disbelief, but if you can suspend it for the curse and it's effects, hopefully, you'll suspend your disbelief for Tom and Alex's living style too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Q: Why don't you let other people write in these stories?</b><br>\r\n<b>A:</b> Because I know how it's going to go down, there will be two or three writers with similar tastes writing the story, but then they'll leave most their plots unfinished.  Then there will be a lot of other writers who won't have the patience for description, or will just focus on the character doing crude acts for the sake of it.  Again, I apologize to a few of you I know wanted to do this, but there are LOTS of other stories on this site with the same theme you can participate in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Q: This is a cool story and I want to add to it or adapt it, what can I do?</b><br>\r\n<b>A:</b> I'm always looking to show off new artists, if you have original illustrations that fit something that's going on in the story, just email me and I'll be more than happy to link to your webpage/deviant art account.  If you want to continue the story of the characters, go for it!  If you're writing a similar story and want to use a situation or transformation described, that's cool too.  Just don't outright copy and paste it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Q: The rating on this story is wierd, most of it's non-offensive.</b><br>\r\n<b>A:</b> That's not a question, but yes.  I wrote it to be a light PG story with sudden chapters that earned an R rating.  This kept a sense of dread over how far the story would go, and the reader is always waiting for the dagger to drop.</span></div></div>",
