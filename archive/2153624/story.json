Why was that? she tried to remember...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shh, did she just move?\" \"I-I think she's coming around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were voices, what were they saying? Milas head swam as she tried to focus past the pain. What had she done that made her hurt so bad? She could recall being in port... it had been an average day, she'd offloaded her cargo of spice from her small ship and then bummed around town for some shopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe coin necklace. Somehow that stuck out in her memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd seen it in a local shop, somehow the golden circle just called out to her and she couldn't resist buying it. her arm moved slowly, each inch aching as she moved it up to feel for the new weight around her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is waking up.\" \"W-What do we do?\" \"Calm down and go get the captain. He'll want to talk to her right away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMila struggled to recall, there'd been something going on, some fuss in town, and she'd decided to set sail early. Then... the storm. That's right, there was a nasty squall that blew up out of nowhere. Waves flooded the ship, the sails tore and snapped. A beam came crashing down on her head...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMila struggled to open her eyes, the merest glimmer of light made her headache worse, but she tried. Slowly a dingy cabin came into view, rope and supplies were piled in a corner with folded sails. She was laying on a few more folded to make a temporary bed. Mila struggled to sit up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when she found a knife to her throat. \"I wouldn't try anything missy. Not unless you want to try breathing through your neck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMila looked up. The figure that stood over her was feminine with long dark hair, a hog-nosed bat if she had to guess the species given her sharp teeth and flared tip of her snout. Mila's tail twitched anxiously, fearful of what might happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morgana!\" Boomed a commanding voice, \"What in heaven's name are you doing to our guest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just showing her where she stands on the food chain sir,\" the bat replied with a cocky smirk before stowing the knife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround her side came a tall imposing figure. Canine, again if Mila's addled brain had to guess. Dark brown with a tan muzzle and red hair pulled back into a knot. He was dressed a bit more finely than the bat with a proper red coat with gold trim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll have to forgive my first mate,\" the canine growled as if he expected no such thing, \"She's... 'overzealous' with her work. My name is Darius, leader of The Dread Pirates.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pirates?\" Mila croaked before she could help herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not what you think,\" Darius replied with a surprisingly embarrassed look on his face, \"We're more like treasure hunters. But you beat some other treasure-seeking group to the gold and suddenly everyone's naming you pirates.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What do you want from me?\" Mila stammered nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That gold coin around your neck dear,\" Morgana grinned toothily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stow it,\" Darius chided her, \"But she is right... That coin is one of several we're seeking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This?\" Mila asked touching the broad disk, \"But why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It has an inscription on it, right?\" Darius asked with a gentile smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Mila answered hesitantly, \"It says 'Become What You Seek'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thought so,\" Darius nodded sagely, \"That coin is one of several my crew is seeking. They're very special, and you should know there are far more dangerous types than us after them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right,\" the bat female added, \"So just hand it over and we can be done with this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now hold on Morgana,\" Darius mused, \"Her boat sank in that storm. And...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sank!?\" Mia gaped. That boat was her whole livelihood. Granted she'd never made much money, but without it she was out of a job, out of money, and out on her rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid so,\" Darius sighed, \"We were following you, I admit, after we found out you'd bought the coin. But your ship sank before we could reach you. Luckily we found you floating on a bit of scrap wood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMila felt shock and empty, what was she to do now? Darious could see the concern in her eyes and gave her a gentile smile, \"Which is why I wanted to ask if you'd consider joining us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Mila asked and Morgana looked just as shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her?\" the bat pointed at Mila, \"Get real captain. She's weak. Just another mouth to feed and back to guard. We don't need her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's her choice,\" Darius replied, \"If she doesn't want to she can give us the coin and we'll drop her off at the next port. No harm done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMila looked between them. On the one hand joining up with pirates felt wrong but on the other she had nothing left... She couldn't explain it, but something urged her on. \"I'll do it. I'll stay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful,\" Darius smiled, \"You just rest for now though. You had it rough. Come up top when you're feeling better and we'll discuss our next destination.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Darius left he turned and shot Morgana a look. \"Be nice.\" he warned her, to which the bat just snorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen his tail had disappeared around the door-frame Morgana glared at the feline, \"Let's get one thing straight. I'm the first mate on this ship. That means unless Darius says otherwise what I say goes. You got that? I won't have some sniveling little coward getting in my way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Morgana left Mila groaned and leaned back trying to think of what to do. What made her accept such a offer? Her hand drifted to the coin and felt the smooth surface. It was strangely warm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMila was a member of pirates now. Or treasure hunters. Whatever. But she could tell this wasn't some walk in the park. Whatever was going to happen was something she would have to live with. Could she handle the changes ahead in her life?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: Mila holds firm to her innocence. No matter what comes she wants to believe in the good in everyone. Do the right thing, protect the lives of those who matter. Find a peaceful solution whenever possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: Mila seeks the middle ground. She believes compromise can win the day. bargain, work together, show mutual respect and understanding and together everybody prospers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3: Mila decides she wants to get tough. Morgana might be nasty but she's a survivor. Getting stronger, not showing weakness, pursuing her goals with unflinching passion. She should show the world she can truely rise from nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 4: (Special 1) Mila seeks her own ends. These coins must have some special purpose. Otherwise why would pirates be seeking them? Maybe she should learn all she can, use them however possible, and work from the inside to better position herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 5: (Special 2) The Coins aren't the only thing the Pirates are seeking. See next chapter for details.</span></div></div>",

While it is impossible (At the moment) to remove all the evil emotions in the world, or be able to do something without consequences, she won\u2019t give up on being a kind and helpful woman just because of a dire situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wants to help bring out the best in others, even if it is a long and difficult path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs long as she and those she considers friends and family can get a happy ending, she\u2019ll be alright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Dread Pirates say they want to do good in the world, and whose to stop her from helping them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe captain seemed afable. And while Morgana seemed rough, she figures she has her reasons. Besides, they saved her life, without even knowing she had a coin, so they can\u2019t be too terrible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it\u2019s time for her to start the adventure of a lifetime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Mila is musing over this, a short corgi enters wearing red merchant clothes and rose tinted glasses, he gasps, \u201cOh, hi there. I\u2019m Leeko, the ship\u2019s cartographer. Did the captain mention me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMila smiles, \u201cNo, they didn\u2019t. But then again this could be a big crew.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeeko sweates, \u201cNope. Just the three of us. No pressure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMila shrugs, \u201cWell, it\u2019s four now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeeko admits, \u201cWell, to be honest, they call me the cartographer, but I\u2019m really just a merchant like you. Read a few maps, and you\u2019re called a cartographer. Like it\u2019s a fancy title among us pirates.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMila cocks an eyebrow, \u201cBut the captain says we\u2019re treasure hunters.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeeko points out, \u201cWe\u2019re all hunting treasure. What\u2019s the difference between us and regular pirates?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMila admits, \u201cThey saved me from drowning, and I don\u2019t know many pirates that would do that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeeko warns, \u201cEveryone has secrets, agendas, and everything in between. I learned a long time ago not to trust anyone. So don\u2019t trust me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMila blurts out, \u201cYou seem awfully cheery for talking like a cynic.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeeko admits, \u201cEveryone\u2019s gotta cope somehow with finding treasure empowered by mumbo-jumbo. Although, it\u2019s gotta be valuable if it\u2019s at the cursed coast.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe raises his hand like a teacher, \u201cNow for the moment, we don\u2019t know where exactly the treasure is, so we\u2019re doing\u2026\u2019recon\u2019 at the local taverns to dig up dirt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere are the choices:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: Inside the first Tavern, where nothing too important happens (POSSIBLE OC)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: Inside the next Tavern (Follow the main story SORTA)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3: Somewhere in between (Right before the main tavern story begins)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 4: Somewhere in between the in between (AGAIN POSSIBLE OC)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 5: Not long after...Another Pirate Crew!?</span></div></div>",

A magical set of eight rune stones created by a sorceress attempting to channel the darkest natures of the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeven of the stones are rooted in the Seven Deadly Sins: Greed, Lust, Sloth, Wrath, Pride, Envy, and Gluttony.

Slowly she stood and made for the stairs to the deck, pausing only briefly to check herself in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was the same tan furred, brown haired feline she'd always been. Her blue cloth cap pulled snug down between her ears and her simple cloth outfit were both still damp from the sea water, but they were beginning to dry and become stiff. Her first instinct was to just change clothes, but then a wave of depression hit Mina as she remember her ship had sunk. All she had in the world were the clothes on her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeaving a sigh she stepped out onto deck... and immediately bumped into someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof. Oh! Oh I'm sorry!\" she muttered looking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-It's fine really. Glad to see you're up. Looking down Mila was surprised to see a small corgi in a large red hat and coat clutching what looked to be several charts. \"My name's Leeko it's nice to meet you, Miss...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mila,\" the feline replied with a soft smile, \"And it's nice to meet you too. Though you don't seem like the pirate type.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just because I'm not tall or strong or brave...\" the canine sighed and Mila immediately regretted her words. Clearly this was a sore subject, \"It's fine. I'm not really. Truth be told I was a spice merchant too. But I wasn't very good at it. Darius picked me up after one rather disastrous run and took me on. Since I couldn't rig sails or do any heavy lifting, he decided I should be Cartographer. I mean I admit I'm good at reading maps, but... that's about all I'm good at.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't sell yourself... erm, short,\" Mila blushed, \"I'm sure there's lots you can do, Leeko.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, I don't worry about it really,\" the corgi shrugged, \"It's not the best life, but I'm being helpful, so hat's something at least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMila wanted to reassure him that he could do more but a polite cough interjected as Darius stepped down from the Poop Deck. \"Mila, could I see you in my cabin please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeeko just smiled and waved her off as he disappeared below decks. \"O-Of course sir,\" the feline replied following him inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe captains cabin was quite the treasure-trove of items. Charts hun on the wall, there was a wardrobe filled with clothes, a table was laden with a number of strange objects, some with gems encrusted into their sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impressive isn't it?\" Darius chuckled seeing Milas shocked expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose I shouldn't be surprised,\" Mila muttered, \"I mean, you are pirates after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarius sighed as if he was tired of explaining himself, which he was, \"We're not Pirates Mila. As I said, we don't just take what we want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you saying you bought all this?\" Mila asked skeptically folding her arms and raising an eyebrow as Darius shifted a little uncomfortably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's... no, not really. but we didn't just shoot at ships, plunder their goods, raid homes and kill anyone that got in our way. We're treasure hunters and all of this was 'acquired' without harming anyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, fine,\" Mila backed off, clearly it was a little bit of a touchy subject, \"They are lovely though. You could live well off the money from a lot of these trinkets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps,\" Darious gave a more gentile smile, \"But i wouldn't want to part with them. Each item here has a story behind it. An adventure we've been through.\" He picked up a rather plane looking gold hoop earring, \"This one is from when we brought Morgana on board.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How she ended up with is is... difficult to explain. Suffice it to say we rescued her much the same as we rescued you. We had some strong differences of opinion when she started. She was ready to take off first chance she got. But she claimed she wouldn't leave without her most important possession. You've noticed she wears the other earring all the time right? This is the other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But couldn't she just come in here and steal it back?\" Mila asked confused, to which Darius just smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mila, she <i>gave</i> it to me. She wanted an excuse to stay on, so I let her have one. I think she feels she owes me for saving her life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why not give it back to her?\" Mila asked, confused, \"She seems like she's on your side now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, but don't you see? The earring is a symbol. She gave a piece of herself to me. If I gave it back it would be saying we didn't need her anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMila bit her lip. She sort of understood what Darius meant, but it still didn't add up. It felt like there was more to it than what Darius said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway,\" the canine sighed, \"I called you in here because we're going to put in to port in a few hours. I want you to come with us when we go into town. There's a local tavern that might have clues about where we could find one or more of the coins. We need everyone we can asking about them. Maybe someone will talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure if I'll find anything,\" Mila noted, \"But I'll do my best.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n==========<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMila's 'best' was admirable, but as it turned out most of the patrons of the tavern came in two flavors: Surly and drunk or depressed and drunk. And getting info out of either was like dentistry. Either Mila was pulling teeth trying to get them to talk or afraid of losing her teeth when they got mad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing she looked around at the group. Mila was engaged in a card game with a portly red dragon. Leeko seemed to be torn on whether to buy a fifth beer for the skink lizard he'd been trying to get info from, and Darius was nowhere to be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMila sat in the corner of the bar, taking a break from trying to get information and kicked her heals lightly against the cobblestone floor. A wave of exhaustion washed over her as she looked around. Maybe the whole venture was pointless? After all they'd found her one coin, but what was the chance of them finding another so soon after? The idea that the quest could take months or even years settled into her mind like a heavy weight and, despite almost never doing such things, Mila ordered a large beer from the barkeep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lost your way sweetheart?\" the bartender, a somewhat hefty red fox with a short white beard on his jawline asked, \"I've seen plenty of them. All sitting right where you are now. had to drag most out to the street when they couldn't pay their tab and didn't want to leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I won't be here long,\" Mila sighed, \"I just feel like this has all been a waste of time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looking for treasure huh?\" the fox smiled as she tried to gauge him, \"Relax, I get them all the time. Mercenaries adventurers, bounty hunters, pirates even. Always looking for some treasure. I don't mind, keeps me and my daughter in business.\" he nodded to the tan furred canine waiting tables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Adopted before you ask,\" the bartender replied as he set down Mila's beer, \"But I love her just the same. So, maybe I can help you out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No offence sir, but i doubt it,\" Mila sighed fingering her necklace, \"We're looking for coins like this one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coins with an inscription on them?\" Mila's ears perked up as she looked at the bartender, \"Relax. I'm not interested, but I did hear something about a coin like that. There's a dangerous coastline not far from here. The rocks are treacherous. Sail in at high tide and your ship will be torn to pieces. At low tide the rocks become a slippery maze of sinkholes and jagged edges. There's supposed to be one spot where you can get in, but only my daughter knows where it is. And good-luck getting her to talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcited Mila ran back to the group, Darious had reconvened everyone at a table near the back wall. \"I've got a lead!\" she beamed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our luck grows,\" Darius smiled, Leeko and Morgana found ones too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Mila blinked, \"All three of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's as I said,\" Darius nodded sagely, \"The coins are drawing us together. What's your lead Mila?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe explained about the rocky coastline, to which Morgana just snorted, \"Sounds crazy to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what's yourse?\" Mila asked, genuinely curious. Morgana just blushed a little in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rumor is there's bakery in the next town over. Their products have been suspiciously good for the last few years. Oddly enough, they were on the verge of going out of business when the food just suddenly improved. Locals even claim it's 'perfect' somehow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds magical to me,\" Darius nodded and turned to the remaining crew-member, \"Leeko?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, well the guy I talked to said there was a temple some ways south where they worship beauty as the ultimate goal. The guy said he saw something that looked like the coin on a statue in their temple.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three promising leads. So which one should we take?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMila realized with some shock everyone was looking at her. \"What, me? Why do i need to pick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want me to spell it out?\" Morgana huffed, \"If Darius picks we fall in behind him so his vote doesn't count, and between the rest of us voting for our own leads it's a three way tie. And Darius already gavce me an ultimatum about bulling Leeko. So it's your call to break the deadlock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMila bit her lip uncertainly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice one: Mila says they should follow her idea. The coast may be tricky but if they can get the info they can land safely. (coin of unknown effects)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice two: Follow Morganas plan. a Bakery sounds much easier to get the coin from. And maybe they can get some good food too. (Coin of Weight Gain/Fattening)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice three: Follow Leeko's lead. A temple is an odd place, but it would certainly be adventurous to explore. (Coin of Beaufy/Gender change)</span></div></div>",

I think Morgana's bakery lead sounds best,\" Mila admitted after a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn straight it's the best choice,\" the bat sneered, \"Glad to see you know good news when you hear it.\" However, despite the sneer, there was something that flashed across her features Mila couldn't quite pick out. Surprise? Thanks? It was hard to be sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, the bakery it is,\" Darius nodded, \"I'll pay our tab and we can get out of here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they were leaving the tavern though Morgana noticed a particular ship out in the harbor and her features turned furious, \"Darius. It's Rourkie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who?\" Mila asked looking at the hardening expressions of the crew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rourkie,\" Darius huffed, \"He's a pirate. Like a real 'kill everyone, back-stab anyone, take all the treasure for himself' sort of pirate. We've been rivals on more than a few occasions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now's our chance Darius,\" Morgana growled, \"Let's ambush him, sink his ship, just do something before he gets away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Morgana,\" the captain sighed, \"Believe me, i hate his guts as much as you do, but I won't sink to his level.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He deserves no mercy Darius,\" the bat replied with a growl. He's scum beyond scum. I should know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMila blinked at that but Darius simply out his foot down, \"Enough Morgana. I agree he deserves it, but if we kill him in cold blood how can we ever clame to be better than him?\" Darius turned and walked back down towards the harbor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how many more will suffer at his hands while you do nothing?\" Morgana replied as the rest of the crew followed, \"You can't ever expect him to fight fair. He'll pull every dirty trick he has to in order to win. If we kill him it's not murder, it's justice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what happens when that so-called justice system comes after us?\" Darius replied as he continued to walk, \"Would we become the next Rourkie to be hunted down and destroyed by someone else? We have to hold to our morals or w're no better than him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgana clearly disagreed, but they were nearing the harbor and rather than continue to fight she kept her eyes out, not wanting to be ambushed by Rourkie's group. As soon as they were back on the ship Morgana swept it top to bottom. While there had been a number of boats in the harbor there was a chance Rourkie had identified 'The Pirates Fate' and she was determined to prevent an ambush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately no such thing occurred and they soon set sail, Morgana watching all the while to make sure Rourkie's ship didn't follow them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she had seemed to calm down a bit Mila approached her cautiously, \"How do you know Rourkie?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you interested in writing my life story or something?\" Morgana growled but sighed, \"I... I used to run with his gang. It wasn't by choice. I was sold to him as a child and spent most of my so called 'innocent years' under that pig of a bunny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" Mila muttered sympathetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm the one who's sorry,\" Morgana replied, \"Sorry I never cut off his junk and fed it to him. Even if it would have gotten me killed I'd have preferred it to working as his slave. I... I did things I'm not proud of. And the sickest thing, was some part of me enjoyed that. If the world was going to make me miserable I figured I should spread it around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's awful,\" Mila muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's over now,\" Morgana sighed, \"Rourkie abandoned me in a botched raid some years back. Darius found me and took me in. The big softy. Guess he just knew he needed me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Or you needed him</i>, Mila thought, remember the conversation with Darius and the gold hoop earring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n==========<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day they put into the new town. Ironically it seemed to be named Strudel. As the crew docked the bot Mila was already noticing something odd about the townsfolk. Not the merchants unloading their wares at the docks, but the actual citizens of the town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost were overweight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot all perhaps, but for every one almost normal sized being Mila saw two more who ranged from faintly chubby to outright fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The currency must really flow through this place,\" Morgana quipped, \"How else would everyone have so much money to spend to look like this all the time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe the food's just that good?\" Leeko replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah right,\" Morgana huffed, \"No food in the world could be good enough to make me lose my figure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took all of stopping one portly alligator on the street to ask where the bakery was to find it. \"Best goods I ever had,\" the scaly figure replied, \"Seriously, I order from them all the time...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it shows,\" Morgana muttered under her breath to Mila.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say you folks in town for the big event?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What big event?\" Darius replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You haven't heard? It's all revolving around the bakery you're looking for. 'Perfect Pies'? There's...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: \"... A big contest happening today. The winner get's a thousand gold coins and free baked goods for life.\" (The crew decides to sign up one of their members for the contest.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: \"...A big party for the new bakery expansion. They're hiring on staff to work there too. Lots of folks want to work for such a great place.\" (Get one of the crew hired to look for the coin.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3: \"...The queen is coming for a royal celebration and Perfect Pies is catering for her.\" (If the food could be tampered with the queen might arrest the baker and shut down the shop, giving them a chance to steal the coin.)</span></div></div>",

Better hurry if you want to sign up. Nearly half the town wants that prize.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Morgana shrugged, \"For a thousand gold coins people will do just about anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's certainly part of it,\" the alligator muttered with a slightly embarrassed look on his face, \"Most folks just want free food for life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course they do,\" Morgana deadpanned as the alligator turned and walked away, \"Because who in this town would ever want to be fit and limber and... and able to see their own toes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy Morgana,\" Darius muttered hand to his chin as they walked, \"This could be a big break.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm ready to break something alright,\" the bat huffed then cooled and added, \"How?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The competition. One of us enters, we win the coins legitimately. These magic coins are drawing us together. Even if most of the prize money is just normal cash, there might be a few magic ones mixed in.Plus free food means we'll have ample time to meet with the baker and figure out where their coin is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's nuts,\" Morgana replied trying to keep her voice down as they passed several more large beings, \"We don't know any of us could win in a town full of these pigs. They probably eat seven pies a day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or more...,\" Leeko added as he stared at a large skunk female who had a whole pie in one hand and bag filled with boxes more as she passed them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? Even Leeko agrees with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, hey, I never said that,\" the corgi muttered looking nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarius sighed and tried to speak patiently, \"Morgana the contest is today. You want to rob a bakery in broad daylight that's probably packed with customers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're probably closed,\" Morgana replied though now she sounded less certain as she kicked a pebble down the road, \"So many butterballs showing up, they'll be baking overtime. And not just for the competitors. All the spectators are going to want a snack too. With all the business this'll get they're sure to be shut up cooking away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All the more reason not to break in,\" Darius responded, \"We break in and assuming we can even subdue everyone before a cook sounds the alarm, we'll have to high tail it out of here straight away. As I'm sure the locals would be quite enraged over us committing such a crime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate to say it but Darius has a point,\" Mila offered, \"Winning legitimately might be the only way. besides, just because everyone is of... larger persuasion doesn't mean they're all skilled at such competitions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course that statement came into question as they neared the pie shop. Though the line wasn't <i>quite</i> out the door it was close enough they couldn't take two steps inside before nearly bumping into the back of a large rhino who seemed nearly as wide as he was tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe line moved slowly but still decently and within ten minutes they were all inside the shop. Mila sniffed the air, her mouth water in spite of herself. The smells of fresh baked bread and pastries along with sweet chocolate and jelly fillings saturated the air like a warm haze and she found her stomach growl faintly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScooting the side Mila could just make out the shelves loaded with fresh baked goods and sweet delicious treats covering every inch of counter space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" Darius muttered, \"We need to decide who's doing this. Who signs up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't look at me, I'm not putting my waist on the line for this mission,\" Morgana replied, though she was sniffing the air as much as the rest of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't we all enter?\" Mila suggested, \"Then one of us stands a better chance at winning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One problem with that,\" Leeko pointed to the counter. Mila had missed it staring at the fod but there was a simple flip counter with a sign over it that said 'Remaining Competition Openings.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt stood at 12.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were fifteen people ahead of them in line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not good,\" Mila muttered and as she watched the next customer left and the sign was turned over to show 11 openings remaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe line moved. 10... 9... 8...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should we do something?\" Mila whispered.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, we don't want to draw attention to ourselves,\" Darius replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7... 6... 5...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could start a fight,\" Morgana suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you wouldn't get in for sure,\" Leeko pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere went the chance of all of them getting in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmazingly the rhino was the last one ahead of them. Not everyone had been so eager to sign up. But as he left the counter flipped again. Just one spot remaining. Who gets it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: Morgana. Despite her blustering she is starving and it would keep her out of trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: Mila. She supported Morganas lead it's only fare she takes the risk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3: Darius. He's the leader, it's only right he assumes responsibility for the crew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 4: Leeko!? Against all odds the small Corgi feels he can win. Although Morgana is less confident and decides to do something about it.</span></div></div>",

I'm the one who brought us here. I'll see it through.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she stepped up to the counter, they were greeted by a rather large female bicolor or 'tuxedo' feline wearing a wide blue apron. She brushed her brown hair aside and Mila could read the name Tammy embroidered on her apron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there,\" she beamed in a sweet voice that matched her pastries, \"You're super lucky. My last customers for the day. Gotta get ready for the big competition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually our friend her e wants to sign up for it,\" Darius replied nodding to Morgana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" the feline replied, \"She does?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got bread-sticks in your ears?\" Morgana growled, \"Yeah I do. What of it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear me, nothing it's just... well i never expected someone from out of town would want to enter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see how it works,\" Morgana sneered, \"Hoping some local would win and pour all their winnings back into the bakery, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... Nothing like that,\" The feline looked flustered though whether that had been intentional or not the realization of that possibility and it being lost did seem to make her concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm signing up anyway,\" Morgana replied stepping up and filling out the card. As she dropped it in the box she smiled, \"Those gold coins... They wouldn't happen to be 'special' in any way would they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Special?\" the tuxedo cat replied, \"What do you mean?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know. Unique. Not like the others.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I don't think so,\" Tammy replied, though Mila noticed she tugged at her apron slightly as she said it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgana just huffed, \"Fine, guess we'll be on our way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait,\" Tammy muttered and then hesitated, \"Um. don't you want anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotta save my appetite for the competition,\" Morgana smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I have a couple brownies here. they're my last ones. They got a little burnt so nobody really wanted them, but you could have them for free if you like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgana considered this then shrugged, \"Free is always good. Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTammy looked uncertain as she scooped up the brownies but she managed a smile as she handed them over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way,\" Darius interjected as Morgana took the treats, \"Which way to the competition at the community center? We're new in town...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it's just out the door to your left, down the road two blocks and then a right turn. It's the large building on the side of the central square.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarius thanked her and the group left. Tammy seeing them to the door and flipping the sign to 'Closed' as they did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did any of that seem a little odd to you?\" Mila asked the crew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe,\" Morgana replied as she bit into a brownie, \"But she sells herself short. These are amazing! I don't know what she was talking about them being burnt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it would be hard to tell for anyone just looking at them right?\" Leeko asked, \"I mean, given the color and all...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe, but Mila still felt uncertain as she walked behind Morgana... Had her pants always looked so snug?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n==========<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the community center the group signed in and then had to go their separate ways for a time. Morgana was taken to the room with all the contestants and Mila, Darius, and Leeko made their way to join the audience. who sat in tiered seats along one wall of a large room. the far wall had a stage where several long tables were pushed together and chairs were arranged on the far side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few words from the mayor, a somewhat hefty looking beaver in a top hat, the contestants filed in. All total there were about three dozen, Morgana ended up in the last seat almost directly across from Mila, Leeko and Darius. Mila blinked as she looked but tried not to stare. She was sure Morgana's top had not been that tight over her chest earlier... right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to shrug it off as the contest was about to begin.

I urge you all to keep an open mind and and give it a try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the carts were rolled out with the teat everyone stared at the strange food item. A flat disk of bread covered with what looked to be sauce, melted cheese and toppings of various kinds. Whispers started immediately about the odd food item but nobody could deny the smell was intriguing for the most part if not outright delicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever not everyone was captivated. Though the majority of the contestants just looked confused, plenty were still hungry enough to try. Only a few backed out immediately (though to be fare they were at the table served pizzas with sardines as toppings). A few others looked uncertain, Morgana included.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer table which seated two others beside her (a portly chestnut stallion and a hefty white furred rabbit), had been served about a dozen pizzas with strange red flat discs on them. Pepperoni she guessed from the smell.

If you can't eat you're disqualified. If you can't hold the food down, you're disqualified. And the contest will continue as long as there's still two competitors. When the second to last falls, the last must take one more bite at least and they win. Now, get ready...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgana again looked at the stack of this strange new food, concerned but also determined. This was just another challenge and she would not falter. She was actually so focused she almost missed the mayors signal to start. Last to the draw perhaps, Morgana picked up a slice of pizza and bit into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeven. Pure delicious heven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe may not have seen any religious figures but the taste on her tongue was too delicious not to be divine. Almost before she had comprehension she'd devoured the sliced and moved on to another. And a third.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe race had begun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompetitors cheered and encouraged their favorites to win. A few individuals were even taking bets on the outcome. Leeko did his best to encourage Morgana but was likely drowned out by everyone else. Darisu said nothing but from his smile it was clear he was urging their comrade on in his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly Mila watched with quiet disbelief as Morgana amazingly finished her first pizza and dug into another, a little slower but with no less determination. Every bite Mila felt her own jaw ache faintly in sympathy. Every swallow her eys followed the bulge down Morgana's throat. And every moment her heart seemed to thunder in her chest. For she was seeing what her comrades had failed to notice just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgana was getting bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't obvious. If Mila hadn't been looking for it she might not have seen it, but she was sure. Every slice consumed, every pie swallowed, Morgana's features looked a tiny bit softer, her to looked a little tighter. And while Mila couldn't see behind the cloth covered table she was sure the bats one toned and flat stomach had begun to round out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough it was no surprise nearly every competitor that remained had consumed the pizzas with no problem (one wolf had to be rushed out due to an allergic reaction to the peppers on his pizza), it was a shock to all her friends that Morgana was till in the race.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you know she could eat so much?\" Leeko asked Darius who just shook his head, his soft smile having turned to thoughtful concern. Morgana herself looked shocked. Of the twelve pizzas at her table she'd consumed four with no problem. granted she wasn't starving anymore but she had the feeling she could keep going if she wanted. And she certainly did want to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one could ever say Morgana quit something she committed to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, as the next course was brought out, large hoagie style sandwiches loaded with meat, cheese, and sauces, she was concerned. She'd never had an apatite like this before. Still as soon as the first sandwich touched her tongue she ate like a female possessed. Each bite she neither felt her stomach fill nor her hunger diminish. It wasn't all-consuming, but it was enough that she didn't have to force herself to continue. She only paused one after the third sandwich to undo her belt. Her hands brushed something soft but though this caused a flicker of uncertainty in her mind, she didn't dare fall behind the other competitors and resumed eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of the sandwiches Leeko and Darius had seen what Mila noticed first. Morgana was definitely expanding. her once slim jawline was wider and her neck sunk a bit into a developing second chin. Her breasts strained at her top now, cleavage bunching up and pressing tight against the fabric. Her arms had thickened, straining the sleeves of her top, and while no one heard it, Mila was sure she saw Morgana's belly wobble as the strings that held together her corset began to break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Morgana had noticed she might have been horrified, but already the next round had started. Pastries, doughnuts, cupcakes, tarts, danishes, and more were all carted into the hall. A handful more competitors dropped out, and before the end of the round still more had to be carted off. Less than a dozen now remained and Morgana grinned down the line of tables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer own table had been decimated. The rabbit had given up the previous round and now the stallion was throwing in the towel. She had the table to herself so she scooted over and grabbed the rabbit's chair to tuck under her own rear end along with her own. The one she'd been using just felt too small somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat should have rung alarm bells in her head and might have as she leaned forward to grab an eclair from the pile only to hear a faint 'riiiip' from behind her. However the moment the pastry touched her lips she was back in the zone. No one was going to beat her in this competition. She could win anything and she'd prove it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What are we going to do?\" Leeko muttered, \"Look at her, Darius. This... this isn't natural.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" the canine mused, \"It must be the work of the coins, but how I wonder? None of the other contestants are swelling up...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe...\" Mila croaked, surprised to find her throat dry, \"Maybe it was the brownies?\" Though her voice was so low as she said it and the crowds cheers so loud she wasn't sure Leeko and Darius heard her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith only half a dozen contestants left everyone was on the edge of their seat for what happened next. They were just bringing out the next course, a series of truly decedent looking cakes, cheesecakes, and torts, when something happened...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice One: Mila notices vendors moving through the crowd, selling wares. Her own stomach grumbles and despite every warning sign she buys a few pastries for a snack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice Two: Morgana is growing faster. In fact if Mila looks close enough she can see the bat not only swelling wider, but getting a little taller too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice three: The doors are suddenly slammed open. it's Rourkie and his pirates! They've come for the coin and the prize money and they won't take no for an answer!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice four: Something completely unexpected?</span></div></div>",

She flagged down a vendor and bought a few donuts to snack on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs she ate, she marveled at how good they were, wondering idly how the people in this town weren\u2019t even bigger, if all the food was this good. However, between snarfing down her own goodies, and watching Morgana slowly expand on stage, she didn\u2019t notice her own waist started to widen. Slowly, her stomach began to push against the cloth wrapped around her stomach and hips, causing it to unravel slowly and fall to the ground. The rest of her not to be outdone, her hips began to widen, and her butt slowly began to push out. She reached back to adjust her pants, idly wondering if they had gotten twisted, before resuming her snacking. By now, she was nearly out of food, so she flagged down another vendor, her arm jiggling much more than it had previously. Her breasts had also expanded, lifting her shirt up and revealing her rounding paunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMeanwhile, as the competition raged on, Morgana was looking massive. She looked to be on her third cake, and was hardly slowing down. Her corset was in tatters on the ground, her belly, swollen with food and fat, had caused it to rip clean off. Her pants were hardly in better condition, though the crowd couldn\u2019t see it under the table cloth. Tears were appearing and stretching as her thighs widened, looking to be as big around as a small tree trunk, and the rip in the seat of her pants was slowly growing as her butt pushed further out behind her. Her breasts, while not quite as grand as the rest of her, had still grown quite large, barely kept decent by her stretched top. As they began to move to the next course, only 1 other contestant remained, a large wolf girl. Their next course was pies, and as it was placed in front of her Morgana surprised herself by letting out a large belch, idly rubbing her stomach. She was so focused on the pie in front of her, however, that she didn't notice how much her hand sunk into her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith only her and the girl remaining, and Mila expanding slowly in the crowd, the next thing to happen is\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice one: Mogana wins when the wolf girl drops out<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice two: The wolf girl wins when Morgana drops out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice three: The competition rages on<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice four: Something else happens<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Unable to stomach any more, she falls onto her back, groaning and rubbing her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blergh...\" Says the wolf girl, unable to say anything else. Morgana gives a smirk before proudly finishing off her own pie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like we have our winner here, everyone!\" the mayor announces. \"Congratulations to you, miss Morgana! Here is your prize money.\" He hands Morgana the bag full of coins. \"Oh, and not to be rude,\" he whispers to her, \"but you might want to spend some of that money on getting some new clothing. Our tailors have lately gotten really good at making clothing that fits our... bigger residents.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait... what?\" And with that, the food-induced trance was broken. Morgana got a good look at herself: most of her clothing had several tears in them, her corset was beyond ruined, and her undergarments were straining against her new bulk. \"WHAT. THE. HELL!?\" Morgana yells, standing in surprise. <b>RIIIIIIP!</b> Her pants gained several large tears as her belly, breasts and butt jiggled from the sudden motion. The red on Morgana's face was easy to spot, though whether it was from embarrassment or rage was hard to tell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgana's outburst startled Mila, and the tearing sounds were accompanied by some from Mila's own pants. Mila looked down at herself, realizing just how much she was affected by how little she ate! \"Oh no...\" Mila murmured, feeling her own stomach, surprised by how easily her hand sunk in. She ran over to Darious and Leeko, making sure to readjust her clothing again. \"Darious! Leeko!\" she yelled over to the duo, catching their attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Mila- GOOD HEAVENS! You too!?\" Leeko responded, surprised by just how much Mila had grown in such a small amount of time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The food here is more than just delicious, it's very addictive and fattening. I'm more than certain that the brownies she ate earlier might be why Morgana has been affected this much,\" Mila explains, catching her breath and trying to pull her shirt down over her paunch, to no avail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It may be a very good idea to leave as soon as we get the coin from the bakery,\" Darious states, giving a worried look to Mila and giving a very worried glance at Morgana. \"Who knows how much bigger any of us will get if we stay for too long...\" He gets up, preparing to walk to the stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgana looks like she's ready to break something, most likely the mayor. Noticing the murderous glare directed at him, said beaver nervously tips his hat and runs off as best as he can. Morgana grabs one of the tablecloths (thankfully empty of any dishes, as they had been removed after their contents were eaten), and wraps it around her waist, grumbling all the while. Picking up the coin bag, she walks over to where Darious and the crew are standing. \"Let's get that coin and get out of here...\" <b>RIP!</b> The sound of her pants giving up the ghost are heard, and she blushes a deep crimson. \"...After I get some new clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It might be a good idea to talk to the owner of the bakery as soon as possible, and see if she can answer our questions about the coins.\" Darious points out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darious, on any other day I would agree with you,\" Morgana starts, \"however, seeing as I'm now using a TABLECLOTH as a skirt, I really want to wear something that's not going to fall off at any moment.\" She finishes, tugging said table cloth upwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarious looks at Mila and Leeko. \"What do you two think we should do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMila and Leeko look at each other, and Mila speaks up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice One: Go to the bakery first. The sooner those coins are collected, the less to worry about. Hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice Two: Go to the Tailor to get new clothing for both Mila and Morgana. Their old clothing just doesn't fit as well as it used to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice Three: Split up, Morgana and one other person will go to get new clothing, and the other two will ask about the coin. The only question is: who will go where?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice Four: Tammy from the Bakery suddenly comes rushing up with some important news.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Impossible as it seemed the competition continued. Neither Morgana nor the wolf girl seemed ready to give up as the pies disappeared down their throats with a strange nearly identical rhythm. Though the wolf girl was not immune to the effects hers were certainly the lesser changes of the pair. her bloat stomach, left free from her exposed shirt and loose pants rolled down between her legs, stretching a little more to accommodate the food she was eating. But it was just a food filled sack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgana meanwhile was becoming a mound of fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was as if all she ate simply digested instantly into more soft pounds to roll onto her frame. Her shirt was stretched to the limit over a pair of watermelon sized breasts and had begun to tear. Though a few males watched eagerly a collective soft groan of disappointment went up as a stage hand walked up behind Morgana and draped a large sheet over her shoulders to cover them. She spared him only a questioning glance then resumed stuffing her face as her now foot thick double chin began to roll down into her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomewhere under the table, buried under six inch love-handles and a belly large enough to hold all of Darius inside the remains of Morgana's belt broke, soon followed by the upper portion of her pants. The tears spread in fits and spurts down her legs, seams splitting and gaps widening until the remaining cloth was all but tatters on the three chairs that now supported her wide rear end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMila watched it all with such fascination she barely registered flagging down three more vendors for food, the consumption of which was doing a number on her own wardrobe. Her pants strained and again dipped as she struggled to pull up the waistband over a rear end three sizes too large for them. The sash over her breasts creaked with every movement as her once tiny perky breasts had swelled to full melons and rested on a belly as large as a large pumpkin. The only reason Leeko and Darius had failed to notice her change from their seats behind her was their own fixed attention on Morgana's impressive size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the one thing that could pull Mila away from the competition hit her: Her mouth ached with thirst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing no drink vendors, she slowly slid off the bench and stood. Though she felt strangely off-balance she attributed it to sitting too long for the moment. Carefully she slid past the other observers as she gave the seat of her pants another tug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately there were vendors right outside the room selling their wares and despite a small line it at least curved past the doors so Mila could still crane her neck to watch as Morgana finished off the last pie and the next course began. It looked to be huge serving bowls of pudding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could be sure though Mila had her attention pulled back to the vendor, a somewhat portly Bluejay. \"What's your pleasure, miss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...\" Mila though as she looked at the sign, \"Give me a fruit punch. In your largest sized cup.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One bucket o' punch coming up,\" the crow smiled and indeed what he hauled out looked like a bucket. As Mila bent to get it though a loud tear sounded behind her and her face went pale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crow however just gave a good natured chuckle, \"Don't worry Miss, we've all been there. I can recommend a good tailor if you like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd like that the spell was broken. Kinda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMila looked down at herself for the first time and gasped at the changes she'd gone through. True Morgana was much bigger but the changes to her form were no less noticeable. She payed the jay and took her drink back to the doors, but hesitates as she stood next to the stands gulping from it. What would Darius and Leeko say? Morgana was already a huge butterball (something about that thrilled Mila to no end), but having two fat masses on the ship? Surely something drastic would have to be done about it, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMila stood there for some time trying to decide what to do. Eventually...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice One: She returned to her seat... only to discover to her surprise Darius and Leeko have been snacking too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice Two: She waits out the competition where she is, Morgana looks to be on the verge of victory anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice Three: Mila stays where she is, biting her lip as Morgana seems like she's about to drop out of the competition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice Four: Mila sucks it up and puts on a brave face. So what if she was fat? Morgana looked sexy, she could look sexy too. She wouldn't let anyone tell her she couldn't be whatever size she wanted.</span></div></div>",

Already massive, she was completely naked except for the sheet draped around her breasts, her butt leviathan in size, pushing her up so high in her seats she was nearly as tall sitting down as she was standing, and her stomach pushing far past her knees, squishing into the table, almost pushing it further away. She was so focused she didn\u2019t notice the creaking of her chairs beneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMeanwhile, the wolfess was struggling. She barely finished the last round, her gargantuan belly shoved hard into the table. She attempted to massage it, but as soon as she touched the taut ted skin pain flared across it. As they hauled out the next course out, cookies the size of dinner plates, she felt like she\u2019d hurl. She tried to take a bite, but her will gave out and she pushed herself away from the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs she did so, everyone looked to Morgana to see if she could take that last bite, to discover she hadn\u2019t even noticed. She was still going, her face buried in her food. As the cheering erupted around her she looked up bewildered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhen she realized she had won, she attempted to stand, only to find that she couldn\u2019t. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGod, why do I feel so heavy,\u201d she asked herself, looking down. As soon as she saw why, she froze, barely comprehending what she was seeing. Looking down all she could see was her belly. Her clothes had all burst off, and stomach was sticking out so far she couldn\u2019t see her knees. Turning side to side she saw her massive hips and ass, so wide she would likely demolish doorways trying to walk through them, her butt sticking at least 2 feet straight out behind her. She could feel the three chairs she sat on beneath her, all creaking and groaning under the great weight they held. Her breasts, easily the size of pumpkins, were beginning to peak out from beneath the sheet, and she instinctively tried to wrap her arms around them to hide them, only to push them up into her face, nearly suffocating herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOver the minute or so Morgana took to peruse her fattened body, the mayor had come out and to congratulate her, and was luckily intercepted by Darius before he could get too close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019ll accept this in her stead, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d Darius said, taking the sack of coins and approaching Morgana, Leeko close behind, Mila approaching slowly from the crowd, which was dispersing now that the competition was over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs they Approached Morgana they noticed that she was\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice One: Enraged at her sudden weight gain <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice Two: Intrigued by her sudden weight gain (possibly a personality shift or some such)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice Three: Aroused.

The owner of the renowned pastry shop was a rat named Abby, who's height could even best that of Darius'. She was corpulent, sporting ample breasts and thick hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was wore a flowing light blue dress, which Mila could easily determine must have cost a fortune, for it was decorated with jewels and the fabric was exquisite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround her thick neck was a pearl necklace and on the bridge of her noise was a pair of glasses. She seemed motherly, but Mila could sense that behind the facade was a very mean person. This was the reason why she was intimidating by her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can I do for you, dear,\" she said in a squeaky voice, smiling warmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMila cleared her throat and said nervously, \"I-I like to have a job here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they heard that the shop was hiring, Darius saw this as the perfect opportunity to steal the coin. Wanting to prove that she was useful, Mila had agreed to do the inside job. Though, she was starting to regret her choice now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, splendid!\" said the rat, clasping her hands together, \"What can you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMila bit her lower lip, for she had feared that question. \"Well, to be honest,\" said she, rubbing her neck, \"I don't know much about baking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, but you don't need to bake, dear,\" said Abby, \"We have much and more shipping coming in because of our expansion, and we need a lot of packers to carry and sort out the stock for us. Plus, with the new restaurant we opened you can work as a waiter too. I'm pretty sure anyone with half a brain is competent enough to do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be very nice, thank you,\" said Mila, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no, dear, thank you for volunteering!\" said Abby, \"We need all the help we can get! Now, let's get you suited up for your first day at work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a large, meaty hand she held Mila's wrist gently but firmly, guiding her into the back of the store. She felt nervous, but she knew she couldn't chicken out now. The crew was counting on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

It had been a long, stressful day and she was exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho knew being a waiter could be so difficult? Or it was at least difficult at this establishment. Mila's suspicion about Abby proved to be correct; she was a truly a horrid person, hiding her true nature behind a facade of kindness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shouted a lot and reduced some staff to tears with her scolding. Mila was lucky enough to escape her employer's wrath, but, like the rest, she was still overworked. Worst of all, she still didn't figure out where the coin was hidden and the day was almost over, the sun setting over the ocean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo that she had much time to search, though. A working employee is a good employee, that's how Abby's motto ran, and she made sure everyone followed it to the letter ''T\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby was always on the move, surprisingly graceful and quick ten spite her size. She was always on the lookout for idle workers, despising them and taking great delight shouting at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo where was safe, it was said, for she knew every hiding spot in the shop where a lazy worker could hide. It was rumored that she had a crystal ball helping her keep track of everyone, watching you like some sort of all-seeing eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it was at this moment that fate decided to be cruel to Mila. Abby had spotted her and stomped towards the poor feline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what are you doing daydreaming here?\" she asked sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMila gave a jolt in surprise. \"O, h-hey, there, Abby,\" she said nervously, smiling sheepishly, \"I-I was just taking a quick break.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A break?\" cried Abby in anger, \"You have plenty of breaks! Stop being lazy and get out there and serve those customers! They paid good money, dammit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMila wanted to scream at her that she didn't get breaks and that she was a bitch, but she instead bit her tongue and said, \"Yes, ma'am. I'm sorry,\" and departed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O, you better be sorry,\" she heard Abby say after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't wait to quite this job,\" Mila thought sourly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe restaurant was full that afternoon. It was a was a journey to move between tables, for the girth of the morbidly obese town folk made it extremely crowded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she maneuvered her way past the maze of fat people, delivering her order of three jumbo sized blueberry pies to a wolf, who's clothes were ready to burst off of his near-immobile frame, she heard the name of someone and it made her blood run cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Rourki, care to tell us why we're here in the land of the fat and home of the immobile?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMila gulped. Rourki? Wasn't that the guy that was Darius' rival and who abused Morgana in her earlier life? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll tell you, but first...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMila felt someone tug roughly on her clothes and she gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does it take to get some grub around here, hey, lady?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMila turned around and stared into a pair of cruel and vain eyes of a sinister-looking bunny. He was small, but Mila could sense that he was very dangerous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the table he sat were two other beings that she guessed were his cronies. On was a well-built parrot and the other a black and white sheep. Mila was afraid and stood there speechless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, are you deaf?\" Rourki said impatiently, \"I said get us something to eat, now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartled, Mila said quickly, \"W-what do you want me to get you, sir?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything,\" said the bunny, waving a dismissive hand, turning back to his companions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMila hurried away, sweating. She thanked her lucky stars that she had only joined the Dread Pirates a few days ago, that no one knew that she was a member of them, not even Rourki and his gang or she would have been in grave danger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hurried to the kitchen and, because it was a random order, Mila grabbed the usual: an apple pie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she arrived at the table and served Rourki and his crew, who barely sparred her a glance, she wanted to dash from the room, but then she heard something that made her stop and decide to eavesdrop on their conversation, hiding around the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now can you tell us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a coin here,\" said Rourki, \"And so are the Dread Pirates, and they're no doubt after the treasure as well. We need to get ahead of them and I have the perfect plan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMila couldn't listen to what it was, for she heard heavy foot falls, the first sign that Abby was in the area, and she quickly retreated back to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the fact that Rourki and his gang was here had shaken Mila. Even worse, they knew her crew was here, plotting something against them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to stop them. What did Mila do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: Mila, after work, returned back to the ship to warn Darius and the rest of the crew about Rourki. Together they figure out what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoice 2: Mila gets an idea that would strike two birds down with one stone. She plans to fatten up Rourki and his cronies! If they're rendered immobile, they can't chase after them for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also plans to use this as a distraction so that she can snoop around for the coin.</span></div></div>",

It was raining for Pete's sake! Another storm had moved in last night, but thanks to Darius' quick thinking they were able to make it to shore and dock at the nearest settlement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he did this, he and Morgana went into town for some vague reason, leaving Mila behind to tend to the ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMila was drenched to the bone in the downpour, shivering. She cursed Morgana, who had ordered her to do this, no doubt her first act to make her life on board the ship as unpleasant as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMila wished she knew what that bat's problem was. Why was she so mean to her? Was she angry that she couldn't get her way and throw Mila off board? Was she trying to toughen her up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would never know what went on in that homicidal bat's mind, nor would she complain about her harsh treatment, for she had vowed to herself that she would see it through with this crew no matter what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer plan was to obey everyone's wishes, avoid getting on anyone's bad side, especially Morgana's, and, as soon as they found the treasure, take her share, rebuild her life and become a wealthy spice merchant, owner of not one but an entire fleet of ships, living the good life like she always dreamed of doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mila scrubbed the deck, fantasizing about what it would be like to be rich, she was unaware that a short corgi emerged from the hatch way, carrying several scrolls under his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did not see Mila, for he pulled the brim of his hat over his face in an attempt to protect him from the pouring rain, and it was because of this that he ran and tripped over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both fell on the wet deck, scrolls scattering everywhere, but they recovered at the same time, and when they saw each other they were equally surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMila's first thought was, \"Must be another member. I thought this crew was a little short on hands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe corgi asked, \"W-who are you? What are you doing on the ship?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O, sorry, my name is Mila,\" she quickly introduced herself, \"Darius let me join the crew.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O, you must be the new recruit!\" said the corgi, standing up and began to gather his scrolls, \"I heard about you. Sorry I couldn't introduce myself earlier. My name is Leeko. I've been very busy lately working on the maps.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maps?\" asked Mila.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm the ship's cartographer,\" said Leeko, helping Mila up, \"but what are we doing standing here in the rain? Let's go inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wish I could,\" said Mila, \"but I got orders. Morgana said she wants to see this deck spotless when she gets back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which would be in a couple of hours,\" said Leeko, \"Trust me, when they go on a pub crawl...I mean, \"reconnaissance mission\", they usually take hours. You have plenty of time to scrub it before they get back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, in that case,\" said Mila, smiling, dropping her rag to the deck, \"I think I'll join you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMila sat inside Leeko's cabin, a blanket covering her. It was warm and cozy inside, for a small wood burning stove heated the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darius told you what we're all about, right?\" said Leeko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was taking down several thick books, and Mila stared at him curiously, wondering what he was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" said Mila, showing Leeko her coin, \"We're after these things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that all?\" Leeko asked, raising an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMila frowned. \"Yeah,\" she said, \"That's about it. Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeeko smirked. \"I see Darius only told you the half of it, didn't he?\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Mila asked, puzzled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's true that we're hunting those coins,\" Leeko answered, \"but that's just a small prize compared to what we're actually after.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened a a very thick book, which, Mila was able to quickly enough, had the title that read, \"Myths and Legends of the Caribbean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see,\" Leeko continued, beckoning Mila come closer and showing her what he found in the book, \"hundreds of years ago a there was a great wizard that tried to rid the world of all its woes. Basically, he was trying to put every bad thing back into Pandora's box. He did this by trapping it into coins, like that one you have right now. He was planning to destroy them, but, unfortunately, he was killed and the coins were scattered across the world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's tragic,\" said Mila.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeeko nodded. \"Indeed,\" he said, \"but there came another sorceress named Scarlet, who tried the same stunt as the wizard, this time with the Seven Deadly Sins. She trapped them in eight clay tablets-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, wait, eight?\" Mila said, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, eight,\" said Leeko, \"Apparently there is an eighth sin no one knows about. Anyway, she, like the wizard, was killed by someone called the Good Knight, though, I highly doubt he was good if it murdered someone trying to rid the world of evil. Like the coins, the tablets were scattered, but this time across the Caribbean instead of the world.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!\" Mila said, \"but what does Darius want with the runes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He wants to destroy them, of course,\" said Leeko, \"A noble thing to do, I admit, though, in my opinion, I believe these tablets are very dangerous, for the Seven Deadly Sins that are trapped inside could have strange effects on whoever possesses them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeeko closed the book shut and put it back on the shelf. \"Though, there's at least one positive thing about it,\" he said, \"there's no rivals that we know of that's after them, for what bloodthirsty pirate would be interested in a couple of dusty clay tablets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMila smiled and nodded. \"Seeing that you're the cartographer,\" she said, \"where are we going to find the first one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" said Leeko, \"there is several places I picked, actually, and it's good to have second opinion. I was thinking that we should first go to..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere did Leeko pick to go? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: The Isle of Pleasure is a series of islands that are renowned by pirates and infamous to the rest of Caribbean for the bizarre cult that inhabits them. All the priests of this strange religion are females, who are highly skilled in the ways of sex and have disproportionately large assets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeeko believes that the tablet of Lust must be hidden somewhere there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: The House of the Lazy Duke is an old, abandoned castle located quite somewhere near a the large town of Westerfront, built on a cliff overlooking the ocean, which many regard as being a splendid view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's because of this that many a wealthy person had tried to buy and renovate the castle, but after purchasing it and living in it for a while, the owners suddenly grew very lazy and squandered their wealth away on endless feasts, growing very fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeeko believes the tablet of Sloth and/or Gluttony can be found there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3: It is said that the cave near a small fishing village is cursed. If you wonder in there you might be eaten by strange beasts that emerge out of it every decade, which would later be killed by the villagers as it begins to wonder around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeeko believes the tablets of Wrath and/or Rage can be found there.</span></div></div>",

Rising and falling over the choppy waves, the ship sailed towards the Isle of Pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding on the prow of the ship, Leeko was looking through a scope across the ocean, and Mila walked up to him and asked, \"See anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeeko shook his head. \"Nothing yet,\" he said before looking through the the scope again, \"No, wait! I actually do see something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough the scope the corgi could make out the hazy shape of land.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll be there soon,\" he said, smiling, putting the scope into his belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's about time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Leeko and Mila jumped in surprise when Morgana suddenly spoke behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought we'd never get there,\" she said, hands on her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O, come on, Morgana,\" said Leeko, \"It's only been a week. It's to be expected, considering the fact that the Isle of Pleasure is halfway across the Caribbean. Besides, we'd traveled greater distances and waited even longer, so I don't know why you're complaining.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgana huffed. \"If it was up to me I would have gone to the House of the Fat Guy or whatever,\" she said, \"We would have gotten there in half the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come now, Morgana, you're still not sour that Darius chose our heading?\" said Leeko, \"You know he likes it when we vote on it, and he wanted to go to the isles as well. We were the majority on this one and overruled you. You can't argue with that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgana huffed again and walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXxxX<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarius grunted as he rowed the skiff to shore. Sitting opposite of him was Morgana and Mila. Leeko had volunteered to stay behind to look after the ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMila studied her surrounding. The Isle of Pleasure were several small islands that surrounded a huge one. The landscape of the large island was mountainous, covered in a thick jungle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's beautiful here,\" said Mila, gazing at the crystal clear waters and golden yellow beaches as the entered a lagoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get too comfortable,\" said Morgana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's right,\" said Darius, \"Looks can be deceiving. We don't know what awaits for us here on this island. We best keep our guard up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd they were indeed armed. Darius brought his favorite saber along and Morgana was armed with her typical knife and another one that was long enough to be considered as a short sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Mila, even though Morgana protested that she wasn't experienced enough to carry a weapon, was armed with a cocked pistol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey ran aground and Darius was the first to jump out, tying the boat to a nearby tree. Mila and Morgana followed him as he he walked into the jungle, hacking away plants with his sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're are we going exactly?\" Mila asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're following the river,\" said Darius, for they were indeed following the river that ran into the lagoon, \"Where there is water there is life. Even the most primitive of societies build their settlements near a source of fresh water.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey continued to follow the river over the uneven terrain until they came across a cave where it ran out of. It was pitch black inside, so they lit a lantern they brought with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey moved slowly through the darkness, the only sound being their boots striking the ground, and Mila began to feel uneasy and cluster phobic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it felt for Mila that they were traveling in the darkness forever, a light appeared at the end of the tunnel. It grew bigger and bigger as they approached it, the hole reaching the size of a house, and when they stepped through it, their eyes adjusting to light, they were met by a spectacular sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuilt in the shape of a horse shoe, the building was beautiful, from its gorgeous architecture to its lush, well-maintained gardens. It was built against the side of a mountain, where the water originated from, which a small but sophisticated dam was built around to contain it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This place is a paradise,\" said Mila in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again, remember, looks can be deceiving,\" said Darius, though he was impressed as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how the hell are we going to get up there?\" said Morgana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps we can use that,\" said Mila, pointing to a flight of stairs that led up to the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey climbed the stairs and, to their surprise, found someone waiting for them at the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings, travelers!\" said a beautiful white dragoness with flowing green hair, \"Have you came here to seek enlightenment?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo describe her as thick would be a major understatement. Mila determined that she was twice as wide as she was, her breasts bigger than her head. She was so tall that she even towered over Darius.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut her size wasn't what caught the trio's attention. The fact that she was only wearing a loincloth, and only a loincloth, was. Her breasts was bare for the world to see, each dotted with coin-sized pink nipples, which was standing erect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Morgana and Mila raised there eyebrows in shock while Darius only blushed, cleared his throat, which felt strangely dry, and said, \"We're...explorers. We came here to study your faith and culture and also receive some of this...enlightenment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragoness gave a squeal of delight, clapping her hands to. \"O, this is simply divine!\" she said, \"Come this way, explorers, let my show you around. By the way, my name is Edna, the high priestess of this temple.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked, Morgana said in a hushed voice to Darius, \"Explorers? What the hell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm bullshitting my way in, okay,\" said Darius in a hushed voice as well, \"If we want to get the tablet than I advise you stick to the plan and follow the charade.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It passed too quick to say what it had been so she didn't dwell on it, but it had felt odd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust ahead Edna lead the way, the dragoness large booty and tail swaying back and forth almost hypnotically. It was so eye catching the group almost didn't notice when they stepped back outside again. or at least it seemed that way at first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPast the short entrance hall the temple opened up again to a large inner courtyard/garden. All around columns and supports were decorated with tall golden statues of alternating male and female figures in various poses, each standing two stories tall. The second level around the courtyard appeared to have personal housing for everyone as many smaller doors lead off from it. The space ahead was huge, enough that roughly six of their ships could have fit inside the space with room to spare. No less than four small pools and one large fountain could be seen with flowerbeds and meticulously tended grass spread all about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever that wasn't what everyone saw. Not at first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat everyone's eyes fell on was dozens of beings all in the throws of 'romantic intercourse'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Morgana was rendered speechless as close by no less than four pairs (and at least two threesomes) participated in some form of sexual stimulation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" Edna muttered, \"I know it can be a bit much for outsiders to take, but it's all perfectly natural i assure you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMila felt like her whole face was about to burst into flames from her blushing and yet she couldn't tear her eyes away. Darius too struggled to find any spot elsewhere to look, but everywhere someone was moaning, licking, thrusting, kissing, fondling, groping or so many other things there didn't seem to be a 'safe spot' to stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is... Is all this normal around here?\" Morgana asked, her own throat feeling a bit dry as she stared at a stallion giving a alligator girl a good hard seeing to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's not every day,\" Edna explained as she lead the way around the courtyard, \"Only every other day. There are chores to do after all. And not everyone enjoys being so public. Many of our clan prefer to enjoy themselves in private.\" As they passed along the open corridor around the courtyard Mila could hear shouts from a room above. Shouts of pleasure...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were almost a quarter of the way around the courtyard when Mila's eye caught sight of something. She'd been trying not to stare at the orgy going on, but now that her mind had adapted she was noticing something odd. Some beings participating looked... odd. One wolfess she saw was sporting four breasts in two pairs. The stallion she'd seen earlier pulled out to reveal two almost two foot long members still throbbing with need. And towards the back of the orgy was a female rhino. At least she seemed female until Mila saw she was the one thrusting into a female skunk underneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy that point Darius and Morgana had noticed and also stopped in their tracks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna had kept walking at first but seeing they'd been stunned again she turned back with a smile. \"The gift of our goddess,\" she explained, \"Those who worship, are dutiful and desire to bask in her light can be granted a gift to make their bodies into their ideal form. Many females who are here now were once males, and some males were females. Some were't sure what they desired and became all the more mixed when blessed, but all have found peace and pleasure here as a result.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she moved on Morgana let her get a couple steps ahead and then muttered under her breath, \"It's a temple of freaks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMila was tempted to silently agree. And yet somehow she didn't find it as disturbing as she thought she would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n==========<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna showed them all around. From the communal dining hall to the vegetable gardens and even their elaborate irrigation system. The water from the dam ran down into a large pool where several more of the tribe were having their 'fun'. and from there on down to water the garden. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first Mila was a little grossed out as she thought the pool had become so full of 'secretions' it had turned opaque, but then Darius pointed out another small channel barely more than two feet wide that lead off in another direction through the trees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat water was nearly completely white.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where does that stream come from?\" he asked, indicating the white colored water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid that's something of a secret,\" Edna muttered embarrassed, \"There's a sacred place it flows from behind the central temple. I could show you but you would have to undergo the initiation process to become part of the tribe. We can't allow outsiders to know all our secrets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you do let them leave don't you?\" Mila asked with some worry they might have to escape this weird cult somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh of course,\" Edna smiled, \"No one is making you stay here. Though I don't see why you'd want to leave. We have all one could want to enjoy here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what does the ritual to join entail?\" Darius asked, getting shocked looks from Morgana and Mila, \"It's not some blood binding ritual or something, is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hardly,\" Edna smiled warmly, \"There's a party, lots of food is shared, some words are said and then the new arrivals must consummate before the alter of the goddess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\" Morgana shrieked, \"We'd have to... to have sex in front of everyone!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not,\" Edna replied, \"The ritual is very special, only those joining the tribe may be inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm may we talk about this?\" Darius asked and Edna nodded as Darius pulled them away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't seriously be thinking about going through with this?\" Morgana replied, though there was something odd in her voice too that Mila picked up on. Was she actually curious to do it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What other choice do we have?\" Darius replied, \"The alter seems like the best place for the coin to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A coin?\" Mila asked, \"I thought we were looking for a rune?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at how these people have changed,\" Darius pointed out, \"Obviously there's a coin here too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even if we get it though we don't know where the rune is,\" Morgana pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The coins will let us reshape the world,\" Darius pointed out, \"Maybe we can banish the runes when we do. If not we could always come back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would be better to get both at once,\" Mila suggested, \"Then we wouldn't have to come back if we made the tribe angry. And I get the feeling leaving suddenly after they let us in would be very upsetting for them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Either way we need more time to find the Rune,\" Darius mused, \"We could either stall for time and stay, hoping to see more, but who knows how long that will last. Or we can take the initiation which will give us plenty of time to find it.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Westerfront was quite the large town as it turned out, with many streets branching out from a large curving bay. At the northern-most tip on a high cliff sat the castle. Really it was more of a large mansion, but it's three pointed roof topped towers gave the distinct impression of a castle. The whole thing looked faintly decrepit. Not 'falling apart' certainly, but a few missing roof tiles, vines growing on stone walls and at least one window was visibly broken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't be serious,\" Morgana was stating as they walked off the ship, \"Searching the place is one thing, but buying it? It probably costs more than everything we own and then some.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually the news I've heard is th place is being sold for a fraction of what it's worth,\" Darius replied, \"A mere one thousand gold coins.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgana was shocked enough to stop in her tracks, but she shook her head and caught up a moment later, \"Even so that's more money than we have on hand, And why do you want this place anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morgana, we can't just keep all our stuff on The Pirate's fat,\" Darius explained, \"If the ship sinks we've lost everything. We need a more stable base of operations. Something we can fortify or just hide our gear if need be. A haunted house seems like a good place because it's already got a local stigma attached to keep people away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unless it really is haunted,\" Leeko muttered with some small fear. To which Morgana just scoffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah right. Don't tell me you believe in the tooth fairy and Santa Claus too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeeko didn't reply but Mila stepped up to make her voice heard as they walked, \"I think it's a great idea. A base of operations could be very useful, especially if these coins are as powerful as Darius says. Best not to just leave them lying somewhere obvious where they could be stolen or lost if the ship was sunk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgana just huffed as they walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a little searching, but Darius finally located the offices of Burgess and Books, the agency that handled all land purchases in or around the town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter waking a somewhat grizzled old bager from a nap, Darius explained their intentions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? You really want to buy that place?\" the old badger, Mr.Books muttered as he adjusted his thin spectacles, \"Crazy the lot of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nobody calls me crazy,\" Morgana muttered, \"And I'll gut anyone who says otherwise.\" Darius shushed her with a wave of his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just why is it crazy to want this place sir?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because this place eats it's owners,\" the badger responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eats them!?\" Leeko shivered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe not physically, but who knows?\" the badger shrugged, \"Years ago, back when i was knee-high to my father, it was owned by a wealthy merchant who spent a lifetime sailing the globe collecting rare, wondrous, and often times magical items. Then about forty years back, he set sail and vanished over the seas for ten straight years. No one knew where he was or what he was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then one night his ship pulled into the harbor under heavy cover of fog. No one saw him get off the boat, but there were lights on in the castle all night.. Old friends and neighbors knocked on the door but there was no answer. Days passed, weeks, months. No one saw or heard anything. Only rumors abound of the owner hold up in there doing who-knows what.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then one day the door was just found wide open. The lights were off and there was no sign of anyone home. The place lay like that for weeks. When it was determined that the owner was possibly no longer living, a team of investigators were sent to look into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They vanished too. Never came out of the house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you serious?\" Morgana looked skeptical but also a little spooked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dead serious,\" Mr.Books thumped the desk, \"After that no one went in alone. And always tried to be careful and watch their backs. That place... I only went inside once and I never strayed out of sight of the front door. The whole time I felt as if I was watched, followed, examined...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you're just trying to freak us out,\" Morgana sighed, but from the look on Leeko's face it was working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't always take someone,\" the badger continued as if he hadn't heard her, \"Sometimes they find their way back out, claiming to have been lost in a maze of corridors and rooms for hours. Other times someone steps into the shadows and is just gone instantly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since we can't examine the house to determine what in it can be sold, it's been for sale as is ever since. So far it's 'eaten' the appraisers, five owners, and a dozen explorers who've tried to map it in various ways. If you want it I won't stop you, but I'd sooner cut my wrists than go near that place again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a long moment of silence before Morgana looked at Darious. \"You're still thinking about buying that place aren't you?\" she muttered in a deadpan tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n==========<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I cannot believe you just bought this place!\" Leeko whimpered as the group trudged their way up the long winding path to the huge building, \"Didn't you hear him? We're all going to vanish forever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leeko stop panicking,\" Mila muttered, although she too was feeling nervous as they approached the large structure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom below the building had looked impressive. Up close it loomed over them like some moss and fern covered giant. The blank and bare windows staring down at them like judgmental eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mila's Right Leeko,\" Darius sighed, \"We should be cautious but we can't let fear rule us. We should face this problem head on. If it is indeed haunted we'll deal with that, but did any of you catch what else Mr.Books said?\" He turned to them expectantly and when no one answer he continued, \"He said the owner was a collector of rare and magical artifacts. Hopefully that means some of the magic coins are here too. Possibly one or more of the Rune stones as well. If facing a few ghosts gets us a base and that much closer to our goals then we <i>need</i> to face it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the same everyone looked at the looming structure of the mansion with mixed feelings. Darious barely flinched as he walked up to the front door and gave the knob a twist. The rattle of metal followed by the creek of hinges was decidedly eerie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut so far nothing dangerous had happened, so there was hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the group poured in through the front door the Pirates found themselves in a very large foyer. Old tattered paintings hung on the walls, plants long dead sat as delicate piles of twigs in dusty pots. Overhead a large wraught iron chandelier rattled in the breeze from the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhead the mansion opened in all directions. There were doors to the left and right into additional rooms, two sweeping staircases that curved around a hallway that lead deeper into the mansion. And just visible the second floor balcony seemed to be at a T-junction leading left, right, and forwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarius had just made to close the front door when abruptly it banged open. Standing in the doorway was a green lizard female dressed in cloth wrappings and looking a bit frazzled and out of breath, but otherwise fairly lovely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait,\u201d she panted, \u201cWait... for me...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd just who the hell are you?\u201d Morgana growled fingering her knife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lizardess took a moment to compose herself, \u201cForgive me. My name is Tam-Tam. And when I saw you coming up to this mansion I realized to much be explorers. I wished to join you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTechnically we're the new owners of this place,\u201d Morgana replied, \u201cSo you can get the hell out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh even better,\u201d Tam-Tam replied seemingly not hearing the 'get out' part, \u201cPlease, allow me to accompany you. I'm sure I can be of some assistance. This place is quite large after all. You'll need help exploring all of it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarius rubbed his chin in consideration as Morgana slapped her forehead, \u201cDarius you can't be serious It's one impulsive decision to buy this place. It's something else entirely to let a stranger in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh really?\u201d Tam-Tam chided, \u201cWell maybe I won't share my secret for navigating this place. I head one of the few guys who got out alive explaining how they did it. But if that's no good for you...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice One: Darius agrees to let her join. Tam-Tam explains that the survivors tied a rope to the door handle so they could find their way back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice two: Darius refuses and Tam-Tam 'leaves' but sneaks back in after them a few minutes later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice three: A loud noise down the hall distracts everyone.</span></div></div>",

But I understand that you don't won't me here. I'll leave. It's your house, after all. But know that you just lost a very valuable helper that can help you navigate through these shifting hallways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs quickly as she appeared, Tam Tam left, strutting through the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan huffed and sad, \"Can you believe her? Telling us that we've lost something valuable. The nerve! I outta gut her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to Darius and grinned. \"Nice going captain,\" she complemented, happy that Darius followed her suggestion \"You sure chased that crook away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure if that was such a good idea,\" Leeko said, \"They told us that this place is cursed, and we just chased away someone could have helped us combat it. I think we did something very stupid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgana rolled her eyes. \"O, stop being such a scardy cat, Leeko,\" said she before looking at Mila and adding, \"No offense, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None taking,\" said Mila.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's not just stand around here idle,\" said Darius, \"Let's explore our new home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But where should we go first?\" asked Mila, looking down the many pathways that branched throughout the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarius put his hand to his chin as he decided. \"Hmm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: Darius decides to head upstairs, where they will continue down the middle hallway. This will lead them to a set of furnished rooms, which seemed surprisingly tidy than the rest of the building, a lounging area with shelves stacked with books, and a indoor swimming pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Various forms of expansion and transformation can happen here.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: Darius decides to go off to his right, for he smelled the sweet scent of food.

Unfortunately, there was only two rooms, despite the house's size. The one on the right led to the master's bedroom while the other led to a guest room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guest room was sparsely furnished, with only two single beds and a desk for writing, but the master bedroom had a large double bed, a wardrobe, beautiful oil painting on the walls, a small bookcase, a door leading to a balcony, and a shaggy carpet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what both rooms had in common was that they were all dusty, the furniture covered in white linen to protect them from filth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful!\" said Morgana sarcastically, pulling off a large piece of linen from the wardrobe, \"There's too few rooms for us and too few beds. I guess one of us are going to have sleep on the floor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glanced at Mila, already deciding who it was going to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need for that,\" said Darius, \"Leeko and I will take the guest room while you two girls take the master bedroom and share the double bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Morgana exclaimed, \"You want me to share a bed with...her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe very idea of sharing a room with Mila, let alone having her sleep alongside her, was embarrassing to the bat, and she couldn't help but blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarius nodded. \"You two need your own privacy, and it's also a perfect way to bond with each other,\" he said, \"So far what I've seen, your attitude towards Mila hasn't been the warmest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgana gave a sheepish grin when the captain pointed this detail out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides,\" he continued, \"two guys sharing a bed can be...awkward, but two women sharing one is more acceptable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, \"Morgana said, \"Alright, but we better do some renovations very soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In time, Morgana, in time,\" said Darius, \"but for now, let's explore further, shall we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurther down the hallway they found a library, which, like the other rooms, were dusty and the furniture covered in white linen, and Leeko was overjoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They got books on everything here,\" he said happily, pulling volume after volume down and checking their titles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can read book later, Leeko,\" said Morgana impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave him be,\" said Darius, \"He's like a kid in a candy store. Don't ruin his fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey decided to leave the happy corgi there to indulge on what the the large room and to offer and continued onwards, arriving at the last door at the end of the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a double door, to be more precise, and Darius pushed them simultaneous open. On the other side was a crystal clear indoor swimming pool with various flora planted around it for decoration and a sun roof allowing light to shine down upon the waters and reflect on the walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice,\" said Morgana, \"Wouldn't mind doing some swimming in these waters anytime soon. Though, I wonder why it's so clean. The rest of the rooms look like they need a shine, but this one here is spotless.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that is strange,\" said Darius, suspicious, rubbing his chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think it could the result of the people trapped in here?\" Mila asked, feeling a bit uneasy, like she was being watched, \"Or possibly something else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarius shrugged. \"Could be,\" he said, \"but it's best that we don't crack our heads open about something like that.

There were also some of the crew's personal belongings that had to be moved, and Mila found a few...interesting articles when she was helping out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile moving some of Morgana's property, the feline stumbled on a book that was titled, \"High Fashion: the complete guide to upper-class lifestyle and fashion.\" This was a strange find for Mila, because she heard from Leeko that Morgana could scarcely read or write.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe book had a lot of well-drawn pictures in it, though, displaying people in fancy clothes and doing various activities only the rich can afford, and Mila guessed that Morgana probably liked looking at the drawings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, it was a strange thing for Morgana, the rough and tough first mate, fearless and bloodthirsty, to have. One could argue that the bat didn't really look at it, that it was just something she happened to have, but that didn't explain why there were several arrows drawn towards certain dresses and childish drawings added along with certain activities that looked a lot like Morgana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Mila never asked the first mate about this, for she was certain that if this secret leaked, Morgana would see this as mutiny and gut her for sure. Instead, she remained silent and moved it along with the rest. Still, it changed how Mila saw Morgana. Was she the type of person that tried to cope with her horrible childhood by envying the rich?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the crew moved their supplies, they left it in the foyer until tomorrow, for they were all tired and Darius insisted that they get a good night's rest. But before they could turn in for they night, the old sheets on the beds had to be replaced and the heavy mattresses flipped over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwards, they bid each other a goodnight, but Mila couldn't climb into bed without a warning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay on your side,\" said Morgana, \"It's already uncomfortable enough to share a bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMila did as the first mate commanded, laying a fair distance away from her. Luckily the bed was huge, so they had plenty of room to spare between each other. But as everyone was drifting off into the land of dreams, snuggled up in the cozy blankets, Mila lay in bed awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't know why, but she still felt the feeling that she was being watched. The feline swore she heard footsteps down the hallway and voices whispering, and try as she might, she couldn't hear what they were saying, nor find out if the footsteps were just her imagination. Perhaps it would help if Morgana would stop snoring for a change...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few hours of fruitless listening, Mila drifted off into an uneasy sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: The noises during the night doesn't go away, but it continues, growing louder until even the other members of the crew could hear it. Unable to sleep, Darius and the rest decide to investigate. Could it possibly be someone who is trapped in the house?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: There was a loud crash during the night, which woke up the entire crew, and when they went to investigate, they found Tam Tam downstairs. Could she be responsible for all the noises during the night?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3: A strange but delicious smell tempts one or more crew members out of bed in the night and down to the kitchen. Somehow a delicious banquet of food has materialized out of nowhere, but many of the dishes seem strange, exotic and yet smell extremely tempting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 4: Something very weird and possibly paranormal happens in the night. Examples: The room fills with water only to be bone dry the next moment. Or the furniture hovers off the ground briefly. Or the room appears to flip upside down.</span></div></div>",

There belongings were scattered all over the floor, one of the towering stack of crates knocked over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping over the contents of the crates gingerly, the crew of the Pirate's Fate kept their eyes peeled for intruders,and sure enough, Morgana spotted one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There!\" she cried, pointing, \"They're hiding behind that large crate!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarious stepped bravely forward, pointing his pistol to where Morgana pointed, and said, \"Whoever you are, get out from behind there, but do it slowly, with your hands raised.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stranger did as he commanded, and when a green figure emerged, Darious lowered his pistol slightly in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tam Tam?\" he said, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlicking her hair back and grinning, as if she was oblivious to her predicament, or simply not caring, she said, \"Good job! You guys caught me red handed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGriting her teeth in annoyance, Morgana stepped forward, saying, \"You! You were the one making all that noise, weren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stepped closer, brandishing her wicked knife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You probably stole some of our stuff too, hey?\" she continued, her blood beginning to boil in anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTam Tam looked at the fuming bat calmly and said, \"I'll admit that I broke into your home and accidentally knocked over your belongings, but I have haven't stolen anything...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lair!\" Morgana shouted, \"You figured that you couldn't join our crew, so you decided to rob us instead. I'll show you..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before she could lunge herself at Tam Tam, Darious quickly placed a firm hand on her shoulder, holding Morgana back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, Tam Tam,\" Darious began, speaking softly and with concern, \"if you're not stealing anything, then why are you here? Do you really want to join our crew so badly? Don't you have other work or a place to stay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTam Tam looked sad and began to rub her arm. \"To tell you the truth, no I do not,\" she said, \"No one in the whole area wants my services. I even tried to do some honest work, but not even that is available. I have no money, no place to stay. You have money and a place to stay, albeit a little neglected, but it has a roof over your head. Joining you is my only hope.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarious was taken aback. \"Oh,\" he said in sympathy, \"Well...in that case, I guess you can join us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgana whirled around. \"Darious, you aren't serious,\" she said, shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\" the captain said, shrugging his shoulder, \"She's homeless and desperate. We can't leave her out in the cold. Besides, we always need more hands, especially if we want to renovate this place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgana opened her mouth to argue further, but thought better. Darious had made up his mind, and he wasn't going to go back on his word. He had such a soft heart...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApproaching the beaming Tam Tam, he shook her hand and said, \"Welcome aboard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: A few days go by, and the crew of the Pirate's Fate settles down into their new home. But Tam Tam suddenly begins behaving strangely, wandering around the house late in the night, and Morgana suspects that perhaps her reason for joining the crew wasn't so innocent afterall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: After settling down, the curse that rested on the house truly begins to take effect. Strangely enough, it mostly focused mainly on Morgana and Tam Tam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3: That night something weird happens as all the pirates arrive at a dinner feast and yet no one seems to know who cooked it. The food just seemed to appear when no one was looking. And though concern worthy none of them can resist the delicious smells coming off a table loaded with good food.</span></div></div>",

The wind began to pick up as lightning flashed over the ocean, followed by the loud bang of thunder, and fat drops of rain began to fall from the sky. Except for the storm raging outside, all was eerily quiet in the mansion. Down in the foyer where the crew's belongings were assembled, Darius' small grandfather clock struck midnight and chimed eerily throughout the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it finished striking its bell three times, an almost transparent white smoke began to drift out of the cracks of the door that led to the kitchen. It seemed to have a mind of its own, drifting up the stairs, and it snaked its way to the room where Morgana and Mila were sleeping peacefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt stopped when it reached the slumbering bat, floating above her. The smoke began to take shape, forming into a hand, and it drifted closer to Morgana's pointy snout. Her house began to twitch and she, still asleep, her eyes closed, began to rise, attracted by the heavenly smell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrowing the covers away, revealing that she was dressed in nothing more than a tunic and underwear, she rose from her bed and followed the smoke, which was silently beckoning her to follow with its index finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly made her way down the stairs and to the kitchen, where a large table was set withe cakes, pies and pastries, and it was from here that the strange white smoke originated from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill fast asleep, the bat dug in, gorging on the feast that layed out before her. As she ate, her body began to expand as she gained weight, her ones toned belly advancing forward, lifting up her tunic, which was being smeared with food stains that dripped from her maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hips and rear began to grow wider and thicker, stretching her underwear until it form tears in the fabric, which only exposed her swelling white globes even more. Her sharp and intimidating facial features was being coated in a thick layer of fat, a second chin forming under the first, and her skinny arms swelled thicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast but not least, Morgana's breasts expanded from an average C-cup to a massive DD-cup, her ample bussoms stretching the v-shaped neckline of her tunic, exposing her cleavage so much that little was left for the imagination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was finished, the obese bat left the kitchen, waddoing back upstairs and climbing back into bed, which creaked under her new weight. She slept further, unaware of what she will find tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: Morgana wakes up the next morning and she screams at what happened to her obese body, which is to be expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: Same as one, however none of the other crew seems to think her new size is weird and think she's always been so heavy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3: Morgana wakes up the next morning and is...oddly okay with her new size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 4: Morgana wakes up and thinks everything is normal, even though the crew can see the new added pounds to her frame.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After the late night storm, the following morning brought a day as clear and bright as anyone would hope. The sun stretched its bright yellow rays through the window and over the two slumbering forms of Morgana and Mila. The bat was the first to wake up, groaning and rolling onto her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes fluttered open and she stared at the canopy above her. She yawned loudly, exposing her sharp, vicious teeth for a brief moment. Despite sleeping on a bed fit for the wealthy, Morgana didn't feel so well rested. She guessed nothing beated a hammock hanging between two pillars under the deck of a ship. It looked like her secret fantasy of sleeping in bed fit for a queen was a little anticlimactic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe threw her covers away, but when Morgana sat up she quickly noticed something: she felt heavier. Looking down at her body, she stared directly at her round, bulging belly and much larger breasts, her tunic covered in food stains and barely able to cover her large size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgana rushed to the full-length mirror, and what she saw made her scream so loudly that it woke everyone up in the mansion. Mila shot awake, throwing away her cover and jumping out of bed, alarmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morgana, what's the matter?\" she asked, \"What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened!?\" The very word both angered and frustrated the bat. \"Look at me!\" She grabbed a handful of her belly and shook it, gritting her teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMila studied Morgana's body. Nope, there was nothing different about her. She was still as big, sturdy and intimidating as always despite her soft features. Though the food-stained tunic was new, but Morgana probably snuck off late last night to grab a bite to eat, a bad habit of hers. But that didn't explain why her clothes was in such a torn, shabby condition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing how sensitive Morgana is about her figure, Mila said, trying to put her words gently, \"You look okay. I see nothing wrong. Though, your clothes are a little bit busted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgana only stared at Mila with a confused and shocked expression. Was she blind? couldn't she see what happned to her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does this look \"okay\" to you!\" the bat cried, gesturing to her fat body, \"I'm fat ass. Can't you see that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMila had no idea why Morgana was acting like this. The bat never had a problem with her weight before. Why now? And why did she act like she plump up to this size overnight?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you've always been this big, if you ask me?\" said Mila, testing her luck with her blunt words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas that an insult? Morgana felt her blood begin to boil in anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll show you what's big,\" she said through clenched teeth, stomping towards her, and Mila took a step back in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that the door of their room opened and Leeko and Darius stepped into the chamber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What on earth is going on here?\" said Darius when he saw the angered Morgana and Mila cowering in a corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bat turned to her captain and said, \"Look at me Darius. Does this look normal to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarius didn't want to look, for she was barely clothed, but he said, \"I see nothing wrong. Now tell me, why did you scream like that? You gave us a big scare.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I saw myself like...this,\" she said, placing her hands on her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarius frowned in confusion. \"But...you've always been like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDumbfounded, Morgana's maw fell open. What was going on with everyone? Did they honestly think that she had always been like this? This had to be somekind of joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" thought Morgana when she realized what was going on, \"It must be this mansion that's doing this. It must have somehow made me fat and altered everyone's memory so that they think I've always been a lardball. I knew this place is cursed like the people in the village said.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now she had to do some damage control after her outburst that confused everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComposing herself, she said, \"Sorry,I guess I must have overreacted when Mila called me fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't call you fat,\" the feline said, quickly jumping to her defence, \"I just said you were big, that's all. There's no use denying that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarius shook his head. \"Listen, Morgana, I know you're sensitive about your weight,\" he began, \"but becoming so easily angered when someone just gives you a hard truth doesn't help. You'll just have to accept that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, captain,\" said Morgana, \"and I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then,\" said Darius, \"let's put this matter behind us and get dressed. We got a lot to do today. We need to unpack those crates and make ourselves at home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye Aye, captain,\" they all said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgana feared that all her clothes would be too small for her size, but to her surprise she found that they were all magically enlarged to fit her size. Still, she needed some help tying a few laces at areas she could not reach, like her back for example.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMila was reluctant, though, after Morgana's outburst, but after asking her nicely she did as she asked. As she was tying her laces, the bat felt somewhat guilty lashing out at the feline like that. Mila wasn't a bad person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was just someone who found herself struck by a bad event that ruined her livelihood and was forced to take the first opportunity that came flying by, like joining a crew of supposit pirates, and Morgana admitted that she had been giving Mila a hard time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps they could improve their relationship some way. Yet again, Morgana was concerned about this mansion, especially after what it did to her. Perhaps she and Mila could go exploring it some time and find The Rune of Gluttony by themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: After a bit of unpacking Morgana and Mila go off in search of the rune stone that might be hidden somewhere in the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: Around Lunchtime delicious smells lure all the crew to the dining room for a feast none of them can remember making but all find irresistible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3: Tam-Tam returns, determined to assist the team in one form or another... And remarkable she remembers Morgana's real size, making the large bat curious about what the lizard female might know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 4: Something else</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The fog that lay across the bay was so thick that you could scarcely see ten meters in front of you. There was not a breath of air, the waters so calm that it looked like glass. It was eerie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough the fog the Pirate's Fate sailed. Standing on the prow of the ship, Mila rubbed her arms, her breath steaming in the cool air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty creepy out here, hey?\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me about it,\" said Leeko, rubbing his hand together, \"It's cold too. Should have brought a scarf.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough the fog lights began to appear, and Mila pointed and said, \"There's the fishing village.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup,\" said Leeko, \"that's the town of Glum. We'll be there soon. I hope the place is a bit more cheery than this gloomy weather.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's hope,\" said Mila.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXxxX <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately Leeko was wrong and the town was just as bad, if not worse, than the weather. Glum consisted out of twenty residences, a small fish market, a pub and a small shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the building were constructed out of wood, which were blackened by age and scarred by the storm that raged over the bay every ones and a while.Through the greasy windows the yellow light of a burning candle shone through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Dread Pirates made their way into town, Mila felt uneasy. It was like something malevolent was hidden in the dark corners of this town, watching her specifically. She stayed as close to her crew as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, what a dump,\" said Morgana, \"I'm surprised this place hasn't been abandoned decades ago. I wonder why people even bother to stay here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lack of money and sentiment values, maybe,\" said Darius, \"People live out their entire life here. It's the only thing they know. But we're not here to criticize people's living standards. We're here to gather information. The pub over there seems like a good place to start.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXxxX <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeeko eyed the large mug full of black liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is this?\" he asked, genuinely curious, \"Is it beer or sewage water?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably the latter,\" said Morgana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pub was a place that was warmer and a little more cheery than outside, most likely due to the large wood burning stove in the corner and a few colorful decorations, but the ventilation was poor and smoke, which drifted from the kitchen, lay thick against the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere wasn't much variety when it came to food and drinks, the only thing they had on the menu being fish and beer. The fish was okay, Mila guessed, although it tasted a little funny, but the beer was a different story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could tell it tasted horrible, but they ordered it anyway to avoid looking suspicious when they were asking questions about the tablet, although it was unnecessary, considering the fact that the pub was empty save for a old raccoon that was passed out on his chair in the corner, mug still in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, tell me,\" said Darius to a ragged-looking vixen, who was a waitress, \"is there any caves around here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you ask?\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you see, I'm a cartographer, and this here is my insistent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe placed his hand on Leeko's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And these two are some hired help,\" Darius continued, \"We came here to map this coast and it's important that we know if there's any caves here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no caves here,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will this perhaps loosen you tongue?\" Darius said, offering her a gold coin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took the coin and bit it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she saw that it was indeed real and not imitation, she said, \"To the West you'll find it, though it quite tricky to get to the cave. It's located on the face of a cliff, where large waves pound against it. The only way to reach the cave is by being lowered down by a rope.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" said Darius, \"Is there anything we should know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vixen shook her head. \"Nope, nothing,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Darius sensed she was holding back something and gave her another coin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took it and said, \"The cave is cursed, okay! And you guys are stupid if you want to go exploring the dam place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who so?\" asked Darius.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Monsters, that's why,\" the vixen said, \"They emerge out of the cave every now and then. Don't know how they get up the cliff but they do. I've never seen one, of course, because it's been a long while since any of those beasts popped up, but my mamma remembers the last time one was seen and always told me the story.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really,\" said Darius, \"Do you care to tell us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vixen looked uncertain. \"Not sure if I should,\" she said, \"It's a long and dark story.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're interested in listening to it,\" said Darius, giving her a third coin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took it and began her story:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was a long time ago, about 15 years, to be precise. Fisherman John was a hardworking wolf, taking care of his wife and kin like a good husband should, catching fish from dawn till dusk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, unfortunately, there was a nasty storm that came in one day and damaged all the ships in the harbor, and poor John's vessel received the worst of it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell, it sank! You could only see the point of the mast sticking out of the water. They managed to fish out the fishing boat, but it needed some expensive repairs, and John didn't have the coin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's was no lumber around here either, so he had to work odd jobs to receive some payment, which he used to order supplies from the nearest city.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that wasn't enough. Without a boat he couldn't catch fish and put food on the table. His family was starving and he was growing desperate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He decided to enter the cave. Now, there's a legend that floats around that the monsters of the cave is protecting some big treasure. A lot of dumb people went to search for it and never came back. Probably got eaten by the beasts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But John was desperate enough to go look for it himself. Ten spite his wife's pleading, he went and, as expected, didn't come back that evening nor the day after that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her worst fears was confirmed: John was dead. But then, one night later, something happened, something this town won't soon forget.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John's wife's was awoken that night by loud hammering on the door. When she went downstairs to see who it was, the door gave in, and standing on the other side was the beast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was tall, close to eight feet high, with bulging muscles and a lot of hair. The beast had two tusks portraying from its mouth, one pointing upwards and the other downwards, and glowing yellow eyes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It didn't growl nor attack. It had, John's wife would later admit, when the terror had worn off, a sheepish grin on its face, as if it didn't mean to break down the door and that it was an accident.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But at the time John's wife was terrified. When it approached her, stretching out its huge hands, she screamed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luckily, the neighborhood was woken up by the ruckus and several men jumped to arms, their guns and pitchforks at the ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It grew enraged when the villagers attacked it. It killed one and severely injured others before fleeing the village. From then on it was never seen again, though rumored circulated that farmers had spotted a strange creature stalking the fields at night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that's all I know and nothing more,\" the vixen said, finally concluding her story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Dread Pirates sat there in silence, transfixed by her silence. Even Morgana couldn't find anything sarcastic to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe silence was broken Darius cleared his throat and spoke, \"Now, that's quite a tale. I think it's time that we go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Darius payed for the food and drink, the Dread Pirates stepped outside the pub and Morgana said, \"Still want to find this rune?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We came all this way to find the tablet and I'm not going to be scarred away by some ghost story\" said Darius, \"Ready the lanterns and some rope. We're going in.\"</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Before anything else, be aware this Interactive is based on the visual novel 'The Pirates Fate' available on Steam. So if this at all piques your interest...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><b>GO BUY IT!</b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeriously, it's only $20 and it's worth it if you're into this sort of thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/app/553480/The_Pirates_Fate/\" target=\"_blank\">http://store.steampowered.com/app/553480/The_Pirates_Fate/</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYe be warned, there be (slight) spoilers ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere's the plot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a world of wooden ships, pirates, enchanted lands, and magic we follow the character Mila. A young feline spice merchant who had the happenstance to buy a necklace with a gold coin in it before setting sail. As the story opens Mila's ship has been sunk in a storm and she awakens, rescued by a group calling themselves The Dread Pirates. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey are led by captain Darious. A tall, strong, brown furred canine with a short mat of redish-pink hair pulled back into a short tuft. Darious goal is a noble one. Despite the name of the crew, he repeatedly states it's just a name, and they're more akin to treasure hunters. In fact they are on what other might perceive as a 'noble quest' were their situation different. (See below)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis first mate is Morgana, a tan hog-nosed bat with long, curly black hair. She's dangerous and vicious, but that's something of a facade. She was born in jail (a subject she's very touchy about), ran with a group of pirates that were extremely nasty and did things she regretted, and then when Darious found her abandoned by the pirate he called his rival, he took her in and showed her kindness. She's still very rough, but that shell has begun to crack given the right encouragement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last member of the pirates at start is Leeko. A short corgi who, like Mila, also used to be a merchant. However he admits he wasn't very good at it and somehow wound up with Darius and his crew. Just because he's very good with maps they made him a cartographer. He's timid and shy, but open and honest and really speaks as the rational counterpoint to Morgana's brash blustering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs stated, Darius claims their goal is a noble one. Long ago a powerful wizard sought to rid the wold of the ills and troubles that filled it. He summoned all his magic and channeled it into golden coins intending to use them to reshape the world. However he died before the final step in the process and the coins were lost, scared across the many lands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMila has found one of them. The inscription reads 'Become what you seek'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the coins have powers to reshape the ones who touch them. But for good or ill remains to be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk, now on to the part I'm sure you'll all like to hear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">Da Rules</font></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLets' start with the broad strokes ground rules. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.) All chapters must be of decent length. No 'OMG they become a goat' or something stupid. Make an effort, write a couple paragraphs, and make something substantial. It's not hard. The only (and I mean <b>THE ONLY</b>) exception is <i>adding more choices to an event</i>. And even then you should fill out one of those chapter choices. So if someone writes a chapter and leaves a choice that's open and you post a chapter that's just more choices, pick one of those choices and <i>write a chapter about it</i>. Don't just expect others to do the work for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2.) The deaths of characters can happen (it's a cruel world after all) but find a middle ground between 'they died off-screen' and 'their guts and organs are blown everywhere'. Keep deaths tasteful, minimal, and most of all, <i><b>meaningful</b></i>. Don't just kill someone because you don't like them. If their death will not affect anyone then there was no point to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3.) Keep self-inserts to a minimum. If you want to have your OC be a character the crew talks to for information, that's fine. I wouldn't object even to characters having a 'one night stand' or something. But bear in mind that any character added is fair game for other writers to use in the story how they see fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4.) Watch the characters closely and keep them in character. Don't just suddenly have a brave character turn cowardly without reason and don't start an impromptu love interest where there was no buildup before. If you've been reading from the start you'll know the changes they've gone through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5.) Romantic pairings exist, and I will not hinder any option to 'hook up' with whatever pairing you like, but don't just write that two characters 'banged together' and leave it at that (see rule one). Give it some spirit, some romance, some fun. And remember there may be consequences with other characters for doing so. Trust me, the more effort put into it the more people will appreciate your writing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk, now that's the general rules out of the way, on to the Gameplay rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm not exactly sure how many gold coins there are, but I know it's a lot. I'll start with the 'known' abilities of the coins' and then move into the ones specific for this Interactive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Known.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.) The coins change someone based on either inner desires or external forces. Such as ones life being threatened. They can't be 'willed' to change someone. It has to be life or death, or a fundamental mental shift of ones mind that that is reflected in their body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2.) Once someone changes they <i>cannot</i> be changed back. Not without rewriting history (and yes there is a coin for that but it's highly unpredictable). Whatever their change it is fundamental to their being. Even if they can't accept it right away, in the long run it may bring them greater happiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3.) Although in the game one of the crew is only effected just once by a coin found, presumably they can be used multiple times. Mila's coin activates at least twice in the game or more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4.) Coins can be used to 'enchant' other objects with their power, thus extending their effects. Such as a coin for weight gain used to make a series of pies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Interactive Specific.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.) Coins can be used at most three times on each character directly and infinitely on enchanting objects. However the object must be in some way related to the coins power for it to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2.) There are a lot of coins in the game, though only a dozen or so seem to have impactful story moments. A chest is seen in one plot-line containing nearly all the coins collected and at a guess it's a few hundred to a couple thousand. However since that would be too many to have an adventure for EVERY coin, use your best judgement when enough are found and they go to the final challenge. Just don't have them go in a story-line where they found two or three, wait until they have at least a dozen or so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3.) While the coins can BE any effect, each time a coin is found the chapter title must include 'Coin Found' and the chapter ends with a list of coins found. Example:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoins Found<br>\r\n==========<br>\r\n-Coin of Weight Gain<br>\r\n-Coin of Macro growth<br>\r\n-Coin of Transformation<br>\r\n-Coin of Beauty<br>\r\netc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce all the coins are found the final trial begins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's everything I can think of for now. Again, I recommend buying the game first, show some love to the creators who made this world. For now though, enjoy.</td>",
