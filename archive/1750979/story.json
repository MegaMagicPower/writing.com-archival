She heard giggling nearby and looked up to see her friend, Bethany Matthews. Bethany smiled when she saw Sarrena and hurried over with Sarrena's other friend, Calissa Worthing, in tow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Sarrena!\" Bethany exclaimed brightly. \"Me and Calissa were just looking at Scott Jacobs from the year above us. You know, the fit one on the football team,\" she babbled on.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'd say he's great in bed, not that you'd know Sarrena,\" Calissa giggled, exchanging a knowing look with Bethany.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarrena glanced from Bethany to Calissa then back again. \"Am I missing something here?\" she asked, softly, still looking from one friend to the other. Bethany rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, Sarrena. Obviously, you're missing something. You're missing out on sex with all the fit guys in our year and the year above. When are you going to lose your virginity? I mean it's embarrassing, Sarrena. Guys keep asking us if you're up for it and you keep stopping us from saying yes. Maybe you can lose it soon, alright? Anyway we've got to go, byeee!\" Bethany said in a rush before sauntering off, dragging Calissa behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarrena stared after her friends, her mouth wide open. <i>What am I going to do?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sarrena closed her book and shoved it into her bag. Without really thinking, she got up and followed her friends out of the library. Part of her wanted to catch up to them and ask for their help. She was tired of feeling like a freak while everyone around her knew all about sex and talked about it like it was nothing. She didn't like being clueless, not \"getting\" the jokes and innuendos. Part of her wanted to be able to size up her male classmates like pieces of meat the way her friends did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped and watched Bethany and Calissa's backs recede down the hall. An even bigger part of her wanted to scream at them that her virginity or lack of it was none of their freaking business. People had a right to keep some things private. Girls could be sexually hyper, straight, lesbian, bi and it was all cool with everybody. But it was like some kind of crime to be a virgin. It looked like everybody else in the world had some say over when, where and how she should lose it. Every one but Sarrena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd who were all these guys asking about her? She wondered as she made her way to her locker.  Yeah, sure it was flattering that they were interested. But it sounded like they were only interested in sex. She supposed that at least that meant they thought she was hot. Was that all she was to these guys? Geez, thanks to Bethany, Sarrena would be suspicious that any guy that looked at her was just waiting for her to be \"up for it.\"  Great. Just one more reason to feel self-conscious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened her locker and took out textbook for biology class, and slammed the door shut. It seemed like the sound reverberated down the hall. Several of the students close by looked at her, and she wanted to sink into the floor. She felt distinctly nauseous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When she got there her teacher, Ms. Matthews, had decided to try out a new seating plan. She found herself sitting at the back of the class with Ross Nugent. According to Bethany, he was cute and a bit of a bad boy. She didn't see him as particularly interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe spent the class trying to flirt with her and she found herself beginning to feel sick again. He was only interested in getting her into bed after all so how was she supposed to feel? Grateful? Relieved? She couldn't help wondering if Ross was one of the boys that Bethany had been talking about. She really hoped he wasn't because she had no idea how long she was going to have to sit beside him for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Relieved when the bell finally went, Sarrena gathered up her books and was out of the classroom not long after Ross.He was whispering to one of his friends in front of her and she overheard her name. She froze and tried to listen into their conversation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't matter how hot Sarrena is, no way is she gonna put out, Ross,\" his friend was saying. She felt rage and hurt well up inside her and she wanted to lash out at him for speaking about her like that. Hell he didn't even know her! But all the feelings that were threatening to spill over were extinguishd as she listened to Ross. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't talk about her like that just because she's smart enough not to let everybody and anybody have a piece of her. She isn't like Bethany, thank God, so don't be such a prick, Elliot. There's more to life than sex, not that you'd know or anything,\" he hissed at his friend before storming off to his class at the next turn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarrena paused in the corridor wondering if she should go after Ross and make some excuse to her History teacher or whether she should just go to class. She made up her mind and headed off in her chosen direction.</span></div></div>",

She was face to face with Scott Jacobs, the school football captain, from the year above them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine. You looked like you were distracted,\" he smiled before walking around her. She bit her lip as she watched him go. She had to admit that he was very attractive.

Her lips parted slightly, and without missing a beat, Scott penetrated her mouth with his tongue; his hands clawed at her hair, tangling it madly. Serrena leaned in, struggling to catch her breath, yet she didn't care. Her hands began to wander, exploring every part of him, eventually finding the hem of his leather jacket. It slid from his shoulders easily, and the moment the garment hit the grass, he advanced, his kiss becoming hard and passionate. A gasp escaped Serrena's mouth as he slid his hands up her jumper; his touch was cold from the breeze, and she wasn't used to a pair of hands fiddling with her bra.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The cold hands were uncomfortable, then he suddenly removed them, clutching her plain white bra in his palm. Then he was down on his knees, forcing the hem of her jumper up, her breasts spilling out into the open air. His tongue found the soft nipples before the air even reached her flesh - the tip of his wet tongue circled her breasts, leaving a thin trail of saliva. Ripples of pleasure spread across Serrena's body, and she shivered.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Then it all turned scary.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Scott grabbed Serrana's shoulders, the flesh turning scarlett, and forced her down on the hard earth.

Stop!\" she protested, and attempted to slap his fingers away, yet he brought his palm down on her face. The ripples of pleasure converted to pain; Serrena was helpless against the monster's firm grip. The brass buttons of her jeans popped open and he tore at them, forcing them off. \"No, stop it!\" Another slap to the face silenced her. Her jeans flew over Scott's shoulder, strewn across the yard. The only barrier between him and her were the light pink panties that adorned her waist. \"No, no, please don't!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The panties ripped with extreme ease. Her eyes filled with worry, she immediately clamped her eyes shut, prepared for the pain. She heard several things, including the unmistakeable sound of a zipper.</span></div></div>",

Tears welled up in her closed eyes as she tugged at the lush grass, praying that this was all just a nightmare, that she'd awaken any minute now in her warm, plump bed, next to a light and  her computer and the thankfulness that she had refused the invitation to the party. But no - there she was, lying on a freshly-mown lawn in broad daylight, being assaulted by the guy she'd once wished to lose her virginity to. Well, she was going to lose it to him, but not in the way she'd fantasized about.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Scott, for God's sake, please stop!\" she whispered between choked sobs, yet her pleads fell upon deaf ears. His fingers ran all over her nude body, roughly caressing her breasts, dragging his blunt nail down her chalky figure and leaving horrifying scratches and even drawing blood in few places. \"Scott, please... listen to me... just stop!\" <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You'll just grass me up,\" he growled under his breath as he tore chunks of flesh from her left breast, blood spurting from the gash mutilating her underboob and staining the jade grass a startling shade of crimson. Then his dry lips dragged up her rear, and he bit into the flesh, making Serrena gritting her pearly teeth as she attempted to keep back a cry of pain.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No, I won't, I promise!\" she cried, still refusing to open her eyes. \"We'll just forget about this, and... and leave everything here. I promise.\" At that moment she felt Scott hesitate, his wandering hands suddenly halting on their journey to discover her slender figure, and Serrena crossed her gaunt fingers that he'd rise and leave her to dress herself and escape back home.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But he didn't.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Suddenly, Serrena felt four chunky fingers submerge themselves deep inside her vagina and thrash about madly, deforming the walls of her pussy. Serrena let out a cry of intense pain as he shoved his hand deeper, pumping it down and up, lubricated by her own fluids; as tears streamed down her face, Serrena lay on the grass, finally admitting defeat, pain vigorously attacking her motionless body with no indication of retreating. This wasn't how she pictured it.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She imagined what would have happened if she hadn't fallen for Scott, and she'd waited for the right time to lose it, and the right person to lose it to. She imagined herself as an adult living in a huge apartment, accompanied by a dream job and a dream husband. She pictured herself lying nude beneath his buff figure, moaning quietly as his lips and tongue scoured her body, pleasure rippling through her...as he gently caressed her round breasts, she'd carefully give him a handjob, then raise the tip of his erection to her mouth and perform a powerful blowjob as he breathed heavily...he'd then come in her mouth, and the salty taste would coat the roof of her jaw...then she lie on her stomach, legs spread out, and he'd hold her by the waist whilst admitting all the things he'd wanted to do to her ever since he met her...then he'd insert himself into her, and everything would be happy and pleasuring.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But she hadn't waited. She'd fallen for the most popular guy in high school, and she'd accepted the invitation to go to a party, and now he was raping her on the front lawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, he removed his now-blood-caked hand from her leaking arsehole and flipped her onto her front, his eyes hungrily swallowing every part of her. She daren't open her eyes, terrified of the image she'd be greeted to if she did. She felt Scott slip his hands between her thighs and spread them, against Serrena's weak attempt to stop him. Then he roughly yanked down his trousers and produced his stiff erection from his boxers. A shiver of terror ran through the girl as she felt his large cock brush against her bleeding vagina, then suddenly it was inside her, all the way inside her, harshly pumping it. The pain returned harder, and a wail escaped Serrena's throat, yet he brought his hand down on her face, immediately silencing her.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ow! Ow! Stop! Please, stop! Stop, Scott, stop!\" she begged as he placed his burly arm across her throat, pinning her down with ease, whilst still violently moving inside her. \"Please! I'm sorry....I'm sorry...I'm sorry! Stop! Oh!\" she felt his dick go all the way inside her, and he removed it, caked in thick blood.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Her eyes stayed shut. Scott enclapsed his fingers around her shoulders and shook her, obviously thinking she'd passed out from the pain. It was when she twitched that he realized there was still life in her. </span></div></div>",

She did, and almost hurled at the sight of her rapist's cold, hungry eyes glowing in the breeze. He roughly wiped his blood-caked hands across the grass then grabbed his silk boxers which lay strewn across the lawn and hurriedly put them on, followed by his smart trousers. He rose, not looking at all dissimilar than he had before the incident, and glared at his victim with black eyes.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You tell anyone, and I'll do it again,\" he threatened, and the corners of his mouth slightly twisted up as he caught Serrena's eyes widening in a mixture of fear and pain. Then he bent down and picked up Serrena's jeans and her bra, and tossed them to her. \"Dress yourself and get the fuck out of my sight. I don't want to see you again.\" He approached her, and bent down, crawling on top of her once again. She shivered in the cold, her head facing the side, as his finger traced the outline of her left nipple. \"I swear, if you tell anyone about today, I will catch you and I will do this again, and then I will kill you.\" Then, with those words, he disappeared around the corner of the house.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Serrena lay on the cold grass, struggling to process all the information that she had just been fed. She struggled to get the story straight, even though she knew exactly what had happened: she'd finally had sex with the boy she'd always fancied. She preferred that version of the story. <i>I've just slept with the boy of my dreams, and it gave me so much pleasure, it hurt,</i> she told herself over and over, so many times, until she almost believed it herself. <i>My screaming and squirming and crying was me orgasming madly... he didn't rape me. It was just sex. He didn't rape me... he didn't rape me... he did not rape me...</i> Then, in a mixture of pain and self-hate, she burst out crying.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When her legs had recovered from all the pain, and when she had dismissed the word 'rape' from her mind, she finally pushed herself on to her feet and swiftly dressed herself, concentrating on anything but the pain that stabbed her thighs. The breeze slapped her face harder than Scott had, and dragged itself through her entangled hair, and stung her wet eyes. She had to get away from the grass. The blood was the only reminder left, apart from the nausea stirring in her stomach. Her eyes scanned the surrounding areas on where she could go.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She could either take a gamble and go back into the house, or she could run into the woods which encompassed the house, and find help.</span></div></div>",

The heavy techno beat seemed to shake the earth, which only strengthened the pain which soared through her skinny legs.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The party was a blur of multi-coloured fairy lights and drunken laughter and couples shagging in the corner, accompanied by the pounding tunes which screamed from the stereos. Games of Beer Pong and Spin the Bottle occurred in random parts of the house, and the occasional limp, passed-out body lay strewn across the carpet. Rushing past all the commotion, Serrena darted between the intoxicated crowds until she found the narrow, litter-blanketed staircase; stumbling over her own feet, she ascended the steps, hand clamped over her mouth. People thought it was because she was about to vomit, and let her through. But it was really to hide her sobs of agony.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The upstairs corridors seemed long and winding as she searched for somewhere to hide, to lock herself away from the world and cry. Each room was occupied by either a couple fucking or a ring of rebels snorting something white. Eventually, Sarrena found a door which wasn't locked or blocked.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When she opened the door to the bathroom, she didn't expect what she was about to see. Bethany sat on the glimmering white sink, her curvaceous breasts free from her dress, toned legs spread out wide. In front of her, his tongue drawing intricate shapes on her naked clit, was Scott. The monster who'd just called the woman he was fucking, a slut only five minutes ago. The monster who'd just raped her. Bethany's face was contorted in a look of sheer pleasure, one hand gripping the side of the sink, the other hand on the back of Scott's head, shoving his head deeper into her wet pussy. His tongue flicked her clitoris, not battering it but definitely tossing it around. Loud, long moans slithered from Beth's open mouth as her grip tightened every time Scott hit  a sweet spot.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Serrena immediately closed the door, but not all the way; she could see them, but they couldn't see her. She couldn't believe it. This man, who'd just beaten her, raped her, and ruined her life, was treating another girl the way a man should. And that girl was her best friend.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The pitch of the moans began to rise in pitch and intensity and Scott began noisily sucking her vagina, getting into every nook and cranny. Bethany's beautiful body slumped down the sink, and both of her hands shoved Scott's face deeper into her. Her eyebrows knitted together and her mouth in the shape of an O, a scream erupted from her lungs as Scott attacked her clit.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh my god, fuck me!\" she pleaded, yelping as he tugged her pussy skin. \"Keep doing th... oh god yes... r... right there... oh <i>fuck</i>!\" The orgasm must have been amazing, because Bethany completely gave in, her body limp as wave after wave of indescribable pleasure rippled through her. \"Oh... oh... fuck.\" </span></div></div>",

She had reached the thin, bony trees in just a few seconds, yet they did naught to hide her, so she breathed deeply and headed into the thick, dense heart of the woods.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Her frantic footsteps were muffled by the pine-blanketed floor, and the bushy leaves of the gnarled trees prevented any sunlight from illuminating the area. Strange noises emerged from nowhere, causing Serrena's heart to skip a beat every time she jumped, and the arms of the contorted trees reached out for her, aching to touch and caress her like he had, wanting to embed them in their grip. <i>I have to go on, I need to get help!</i> she thought determinedly as she raced past the body of a fox cub, it's insides on display for all the see, obviously the remains of a hunt. The nausea automatically returned, yet she fought it down.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It was getting darker and darker by the minute, and soon all she could see was the buckled outlines of the trees that seemed only centimeters away from her. The strangled cry of crows echoed through the woodland, and now it was pitch black. She was lost, alone, and a rape victim.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Struggling to catch her breath, she fell at the foot of a tree, and its arms wrapped around her protectively. She breathed heavily, her thighs caked in blood, her clothes torn to shreds almost. Finally, she was ready to give up. She was just going to sit here and die peacefully - either from starvation or blood loss. Either way was painless.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Suddenly, the quaint sound of footsteps alerted her.</span></div></div>",

She sat at her black laptop and started typing up her story that was due in for a report. It had to be an erotica story, which annoyed her even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe racked her brain for describing words about love and sex. <br>\r\n\"Erm ... love, fun ... I don't know!\" She shrieked, and slammed down her laptop. Shoving it to one side, she heard giggles coming from upstairs in the spare room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe held her breath as she crept up the creaky stairs. The door was locked, and the gap at the bottom of the door had been blocked with a towel. She sighed in disappointment. Then she had an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went up the second flight of stairs. Result! There was a gap in the floorboards, so she could see to the bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down, and saw Bethany with Scott, kissing and touching. Beth's bra slid off as they slid under the duvet. Sarrena winced as she saw a pair of lacy knickers slide out from the duvet. Then, she heard moans of pleasure. <i>Ew!</i> She gasped, so grossed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as the saucy details came in, Sarrena jumped as the bell rung close to her ear for the next class.<br>\r\n\"Mmmm ... come on, get your clothes on!\" Bethany said as she slid her pants back on. Beth was so fit, so slim. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott was in his jeans before Beth had slid her top back on.

She glanced repeatedly to Bethany, pondering how she might react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarrena waited until school was over. Beth would stay and spend her time before the cheerleading squad would start practise.

The 16 year old girl nodded shyly. \"You mean a silent threesome?\" Bethany thought that her friend was teasing her. And she was right.

I'm looking for Scott Jacobs. I want to get a good look at him, you understand right? I might see if I can tempt him into coming with me to the back of the gym later, if you catch my drift,\" Bethany smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBethany had a very high opinion of herself. She had shoulder length white blonde hair and bright blue eyes and she knew how to wrap a boy around her little finger. Admittedly, her 44DD breasts did help with that. She was notorious for being a slut, who'd bend over anything if she was asked and commonly gave blow jobs in the boys' bathroom. Her reputation didn't bother her in the slightest, in fact she was rather proud of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sauntered between the aisles of books, well aware of the eyes following her.

The two girls erupted in a fit of giggles, both now trying to avoid looking at Scott. While this was happening, Bethany spotted Sarrena and waved before dragging Calissa over with her. She explained the Scott Jacobs situation to Sarrena and insisted that the girl lost her virginity soon. The two girls then returned to their previous position at the end of a line of shelves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll see you later, Calissa, alright?\" she said pointedly.
