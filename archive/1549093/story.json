So trainers and pokemon will understand each other. All humans are normal sized, while the pokemon can be either normal, giant, or tiny depending on where the story goes. Also, this world is all vore, so some pokemon will eat another pokemon or do something else to its victim depending on where the story goes. Okay, I guess that's it for now. So what are you?</span></div></div>",

The Arcanine panted lightly before swallowing again, bringing your head and shoulders into its mouth, its big tongue slathering you with drool as it tasted you, it let out a hum of satisfaction at your somewhat salty taste. The large dog lifted you up into a standing position as it gulped, pressing your face to the entrance of its throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIts large tongue wrapped around your waist as your midsection was pulled into its warm maw, the dog swallowed again, its throat rippling around head. A loud moan tore from your throat as its pesky tongue found its way around your erection and gave a slight tug. You squirmed in its jaws as it continued to torture you into euphoria, another sudden swallow left you practically screaming as shoulders joined your head in its throat and the warmth of the tongue uncurled itself and left you yearning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Arcanine tilted its head back and swallowed again, the pulsing throat responding by pulling you deeper inside. Your arms slid into a more open space, the stomach.</span></div></div>",

A low, satisfied, almost purr-like growl came from the Arcanine as it swallowed once more, landing your arousal inside its pulsing throat and allowing the dog to shut its jaws gently around your squirming legs. Gravity took over the work as the warm, rippling throat slowly worked you deeper and deeper inside; a loud shuddering moan wracked your body as you finally gained release, your hips pressing against the walls that surrounded you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, the visible bulge you made seemed to slide painfully slow down the Arcanine's neck as its stomach slowly expanded, its midsection becoming taunt as you slid inside. The Arcanine licked its lips as your legs finally joined the rest of you in its throat. It took only a few more minutes for you to slide into waiting belly, you were forced into curled up position as the stomach closed in around you in a tight hug. Letting out a satisfied burp, the Arcanine flopped onto its back, its hind legs spread as its belly rest over its lower half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pressed and pushed against the walls as they squeezed you again with a loud groan. </span></div></div>",

It.... doesn't?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your eyes and look down. The acid is around your feet, and has dissolved your shoes but it hasn't affected you. It feels just like warm water. Are you immune or something? You relax a bit, now knowing that you aren't going to get hurt. Sitting down in the pool of acid, you lean against the pink muscle, and listen to everything around you.

You decide to give Lugia a belly rub of your own. And Lugia likes it a lot. Just then a couple of berries arrive at the stomach some were swallow whole while others were chewed. You figured the chewed up ones were for lugia and the ones swallowed whole are yours. You were starving so you dig into the berries. Several minutes later, you find yourself tired. You then hear Lugia yawning as well, and it was loud due to you inside his belly. You figured why not stay in Lugia's tummy for the night. And that's exactly what you plan to do. Lugia later looked into your backpack to find one pokeball. He opened it to reveal a yellow Pikachu. You then hear Lugia speaking to Pikachu in the pokemon language. He must be explaining to Pikachu about where I am. Just then a loud gulping sound occured. You looked up the esophagus at the top of the stomach, to discovered that your Pikachu is there. As Pikachu landed, he happily rushed to you and gave you a big hug. You then yawned telling you you're tired. Pikachu yawned as well, and began to snuggle up to you. You smiled, and began to cuddle up and began to sleep inside Lugia's tummy. You think to yourself, I do not want to leave this place, ever. The night was calm and soothing.

Then, with a single gulp, Lugia swallows you whole, and sends your form sliding down its throat into its stomach. You land in the stomach with a soft plop.

Lugia quickly becomes agitated from the kicking and times your next kick so that your other foot lands inside its mouth.

You're quick, but the Lugia is quicker; it appears infront of you in a flash, knocking you down with its stomach. On your back, you look up at the Lugia who is now staring down at you, its form blocking out the bright sun. It lowers its head down towards you and begins sniffing you, trying to determine something. Then it brings its head only inches from your face, and licks your face. The Lugia appears to like your taste... It licks your stomach, and then your legs. It really likes your taste... The Lugia brings its head back up, licking its chops as it looks at you in hunger. You quickly get up and try to run away from it, but Lugia is too fast for you. Suddenly everything goes dark, the Lugia has engulfed the upper portion of your body inside its mouth. Lugia's tongue is pressing against your back and is savoring your flavor as it tilts its head upwards, causing you to slide back into its throat. Your legs pass into the Lugia's mouth, and then finally your feet. The Lugia gulps and sends your slender form down its narrow neck. Lugia yawns and decides to rest in the shade to digest you.</span></div></div>",

An Ultra Ball to be specific. It won't catch the creature, but it will buy time. You remember what you mentor said, something about eggs. You actually don't know what your mentor said. You were too concentrating on complaining about how he said there was only one-hundred-and-fifty of these things. Spent all his life studying Pok\u00e9mon only to be wrong about most everything he learnt. He even gave you an empty Pok\u00e9dex, thanks!<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As your thoughts wonder, a Wild Arbok appeared and used tackle. It was super effective at knocking you down. You got to your feet and three the ball at it. It bounced off it's head and plopped on the ground. That wasn't an Ultra Ball, it was a Net Ball! Why did you even have that in there?<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Arbok wasn't happy about it either. And on closer inspection, it was the biggest Arbok you've ever seen. It wasn't giant, but it was big enough to swallow... You... Whole...<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You start running as fast as you could. The Arbok didn't waste time. It slithered in front of you, then behind you. Soon you tripped over the purple snake and landed hard on the ground. The Arbok wrapped it's body around you quickly. You felt the coils squeeze your body, \"Wait! Wait! I know you can understand me. Wait!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Arbok stopped tightening it's hold on you, \"What do you want, prey?\" It hissed.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Your chest was in pain, blood rushed to your brain and your heart was beating in your chest, working over time to push blood through the tight veins and arteries of your body, \"I-I...\" You began, not knowing what you're about to say and in a panic, \"I won't struggle if you don't strangle me!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The snake titled it's head in curiousity.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>It's working!</i> You think to yourself. \"Just loosen up and I'll even remove my gear. I taste better without it, I promise.\" You felt the Arbok release it's grasps on you slightly. You weren't planning on letting this beast eat you, this is just some tomfoolery. You take off your backpack slowly, \"It'd be faster if you let go.\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He let you go entirely now, waiting for you to remove your belt, shoes and anything else that doesn't digest well. Now is your chance!</span></div></div>",

If you can jump off the nearby small cliff behind you, then you might have a chance. Below the cliff was some water that looked deep enough to jump in feet first without too many consequences. You just need to buy time enough to get the snake away from it so you can have a direct line to run.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You remove your cap from your head, the Arbok is directly in front of you now! Before you could turn away and run, something happened. The Arbok opened it's mouth and dived at you. You were caught unaware, it seems the snake either forgot about the shoes or merely didn't care.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Your head was smothered against its squishy mouth. The Arbok wrapped around you again, but didn't squeeze the life out of you. Instead it held you still as it began to slurp and pull you into its body. Your screams and calls for help were muffled behind a wall of flesh. Every moment your body inch in deeper and deeper into your predator. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Your head was no longer in the mouth, instead it's deep in the throat. The tiny teeth made to hold prey were poking into your back and stomach. Any attempt at struggling caused the Pok\u00e9mon to bite into your back until you stopped. You were shoved and squeezed through the warm, gooey tube of a creature. Its body crushed you gently. Your clothes became sticky due to the salivation of the mouth and the wet throat. The deeper you were pulled in, the less it became warm and instead became hot.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0By the time your rump was inside the predator, the heat became almost unbearable. You wondered what a sight you'd make; just a pair of legs sticking and kicking in the air from the mouth of a snake swallowing and engulfing them down quickly. Soon, even they were gone, leaving you to slither faster down the gullet until you reached a point where it was less constrictive. Its stomach.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It was still tight, but you were able to squirm about if you tried heard enough. It felt like someone zipped you up in a small sleepy bag, except this one is all wet and trying to digest you. The stomach was sticky and reeked of old meat. You tried pressing against the walls, for all your troubles worth it only contracted and nearly squeezed the air out of you. The Arbok slithered away content with its meal, and you were able to feel the large rocks and twists and turns it made.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It was like this for some time; minutes maybe even an hour. Any pleas you made were ignored. You were hoping maybe you'd lose consciousness soon. Then at one moment, when you pushed hard against the end of the stomach to help you sit up, a hole opened and your hand went through. \"No! Please let me out!\"<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Still nothing. This is it. Your vision all but left you as you traveled deeper in the creature, well as your consciousness, and in just a few hours, your body will also be gone.</span></div></div>",

You were a macro Espeon-- meaning you had a very rare condition that made you five times your normal size. You stood at over 15 feet, towering over humans and many other Pok\u00e9mon. Despite your huge stature and relentless carnivorous appetite, you were very friendly and gentle with humans. Admittedly, you have accidentally stepped on or sat on them a few times, but never doing any serious damage. In fact, you have never eaten a single human in your life, preferring to devour other Pok\u00e9mon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour belly grumbles. It has been hours since you\u2019d last eaten. Your stomach is huge, and digests your prey quickly, so your appetite is relentless. You stop in your tracks, giving your trainer a distressed look. You don\u2019t have the vocal chords to talk to him, but you do have the power to communicate telepathically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I\u2019m starving. Can we stop for a moment so I can hunt?\"</i> you ask telepathically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cSeriously? You just had lunch a few hours ago! Can\u2019t you wait?\u201d</b> he replied, exasperated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Well, I guess it can wait\u2026 but I am getting really really hungry, and you\u2019re starting to look pretty tasty right about now...\"</i> you smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cAlright, alright! If you\u2019re going to play dirty like that, I guess we can stop for a bite to eat,\u201d</b> he relents, throwing up his hands. You giggle, padding gingerly into the bushes. Kyle pretends to be intimidated, but he knows you would never eat him. You were just messing with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk deeper into the forest, before finding a small clearing. You lay for a moment down so that Kyle could jump off your back. While your trainer sat on a tree stump to have his dinner, you run off into the woods, searching for a delicious little snack to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow are you going to fill your empty stomach?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You trod towards one of the hiking trails through the forest, licking your lips at the thought of a meal. Hunting down and swallowing wild Pok\u00e9mon was fun, but it could get a little dull eating the same kinds of Pok\u00e9mon everyday. Thus, you preferred battling trainers and devouring their Pok\u00e9mon, because you could never be sure what you were going to get! You hoped they had something tasty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach one of the trails, and immediately see a scrawny-looking trainer walking the dirt road. He looks quite timid, and was apparently foolish enough to travel alone. Perfect!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou emerge from the forest onto the path in front of the trainer, flashing him the most menacing look you can muster. He immediately panicked, as you expected he would. He\u2019d probably never seen a macro Pok\u00e9mon before. He immediately grabs a Pokeball from his bag, and tosses it onto the ground in front of him, revealing in a flash of light\u2026 a Lucario! You almost jumped with glee. Lucarios are a delicacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cG-go! Lucario!\u201d</b> the trainer shouted. The Lucario was stunned for a moment, before hesitantly assuming a battle stance. You smirked, deciding you were going to let the poor thing get at least one punch in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cLucario! U-use Aura Sphere!\u201d</b> the trainer commanded, and the Lucario immediately rolled up a ball of energy, before sending it flying through the air, shattering into your side. You flinched a little bit, but ultimately its attack did almost no damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore it had a chance to react, you immediately countered with Quick Attack. Due to your size, this single attack sent the much smaller Lucario flying into a nearby tree. The Lucario collapsed onto the ground, immediately defeated. The trainer looked terrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cPlease don\u2019t eat me!\u201d</b> The human screamed, before running desperately away back down the trail. You giggle, watching him leave. You then trod over to the Lucario, still lying near the tree, the breath knocked out of him. You look playfully down at him, and he looks defiantly up at you. He was completely at your mercy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lean down and started licking his chest and face, savoring his flavor. He tries to push your face away, but he doesn\u2019t have the strength. Eventually, you move your barrage of licks down to his paws. With each lick, you slowly nudge his legs further and further into your maw. He looks down, and you make sure to taunt him with a good view of your gaping maw and your dark, tight throat. He panics a bit, trying to get away, but you\u2019re much too strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe\u2019s quickly in your mouth up to his waist, his paws almost touching the back of your mouth. You raise him up in the air by his legs, before tipping your head back, letting gravity assist your soft swallowing. His paws slowly slide down into your throat as his belly enters your mouth. You hardly have to do anything at this point-- you just had to sit back and enjoy your delicious little treat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more full minutes of this, he was laying on his back on your tongue, up to his waist in your throat. You give him a few moments to take one last look at the outside world before closing your mouth around him, sealing him in darkness. You sit there savouring his flavor for another solid minute before leaning your head back and swallowing relentlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis entire body enters your throat, leaving a massive bulge. His arms are pinned to his sides as he slides slowly but surely down your tight throat. The bulge eventually disappears into your chest, and you purr a bit as you feel his body being deposited into your waiting stomach. Your stomach walls squeezed tightly against him as your belly kicked into action. He couldn\u2019t move a muscle-- all he could do was sit inside of you and wait for your stomach to turn him into but more fat on your belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laid down on your back, rubbing your gurgling belly as it gets to work on digesting its new occupant. <i>\u2019He was even more delicious than I imagined!\u2019</i> you thought to yourself. After a few minutes, the struggles slow to a stop, as the Lucario in your belly passes out out due to the lack of oxygen. You stand up, letting out a cute little burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2019Well, that was filling,\u2019</i> you thought, as you walked back into forest.</span></div></div>",

Still a bit confused, you finally look up, noticing that the ground seems to stretch on forever, like an endless road of pink. But as your eyes follow the road even farther, you see that the road is actually pinched off by a mouth; a mouth belonging to the chubby, pink face of a lickitung.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich means that you were saved by its abnormally long tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink and yellow pokemon blinks down at you with its beady, black eyes. At first, you're unsure of what it's thinking, but when you look around, you see that you're surrounded by cheri berries--and judging from the drool dribbling out of the corners of its mouth, to the hungry giant, you looked like nothing more than an extra furry fruit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the greedy gleam in its eye, your next move was obvious: you had to get off! But just as you're about to make a mad scramble for the edge, the ground unexpectedly surges beneath you as the massive pokemon lifts its tongue upwards, tilting it sharply. Despite this, you still try to jump off, except that the lickitung decides to curl its tongue inwards like a bowl, forcing the berries (and you) to line up in a straight, single-file line. And as you begin to slip downwards, you realize exactly what the lickitung's doing: its creating a slide so that it can gulp down the berries one-by-one--and sure enough, you look down just in time to see the pokemon's mouth open wide, the black throat flexing open just as the first berry tumbles out of sight. The giant didn't even swallow. It just allowed the treats to fall straight down into its stomach, one after another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn spite of all your efforts to escape, you soon realize that you're helpless to flee. The throat seems to rush closer--and that's when you see it! The uvula! Just dangling there high above the death pit that was the giant's esophogus. If you could just grab hold of it and hang on, maybe you could completely avoid your dark fate inside the pokemon's massive belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were only a handful of cheris in front of you now, so you'd have to time it just right. You're inside the luckitung's beak now, and you countdown as you witness the last of the berries disappear over the edge of the tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was now or never!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spring off of spongy surface, the glistening uvula in your sights.

After what feels like an eternity of terrified falling, you feel yourself enter a cavernous space and you land heavily on the mound of berries. Quickly scrambling to your feet, you try your best to hide as more of the treat drop down to join you. Once the last berry is deposited, the stomach entrance flexes shut, sealing you to your fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe muscled walls of the stomach immediately get to work, writhing and contracting as they begin grinding the berries against each other. And as if things couldn't get any worse, the same walls begin to exude a pungent liquid, thick strings of it dribbling from the ceiling onto the churning pile of food. One especially thick, green glob lands on the berry right next to you, and you witness in horror as the fruit melts right before your eyes, instantly reduced to a pulpy mush--similar to what you'll look like soon if you never get out of this death pit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fleshy sac you're trapped in continues to churn its contents. The air is thick with the smell of fruits and gastric juices as the acids continue to rise to overtake the mound. Despite your best efforts to stay far away from the digestive juices, you feel the ground beneath gradually become soft and squishy as the food you're standing on begins to settle. Soon, however, there's nothing left you can do, and your small body joins the digestive soup, the last thing you remember hearing being the intense gurgling of the intestines just beyond the stomach walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lickitung leans back against the cheri tree, rubbing its full, round tummy in an effort to sooth its stomach as it broke down its lunch. Because lickitung lacked teeth for chewing, they made up for it with their extremely potent stomach acids. Thinking of the cheri berries, it began drooling again. That batch of berries had been especially filling--and its belly seemed happy too, finally shrinking down as the solid fruits were liquefied. Quite content, the pokemon shuts its eyes, listening to the quiet gurgles coming from its tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt also thought it may have heard a tiny squeak, but by that time, the massive pokemon was already asleep.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You family was known to breed the largest Eevees in the forest and ruled this forest. Much to disappointment of your mother \u2013a Vaporeon- and your father \u2013a Leafeon-, when the litter was born, you were the smallest, beyond even the runt of the litter. Your mother and father were surprised you even survived the journey out of your mother\u2019s womb without being squashed during her pregnancy by one of your brothers or sisters. Despite their disappointment in your size and your inability to speak or even communicate with you, being barely an inch at birth, both of your parents did their best to provide you special care. You mother allowed you have your own private feeding times, to avoid the hassle of fighting with your larger siblings over a teat to suck. Your father spent much time with you when he wasn\u2019t hunting, even more so then your more independent siblings. The day finally came when your brothers and sisters were old enough to live on their own and leave the family cave, while you on the other hand had to stay with your mother and father, seemingly not ever having the advantages that ran in your family in the category of size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany months later, considering it would be good for you to see some of the outside world, your mother and father decided it would be best for you to spend some quality time with one of your siblings and would set off in the afternoon to find a brother or sister that would be obliged to taking you in for a time. While you wait for the sun to rise to its highest point, you think about your brothers and sisters, as well as your mother and father in a perspective as your three inch form lays upon your mother\u2019s smooth and slick back as she floats in the pond near your home cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou mother is six feet in length from nose to tail, twice as tall as the average height of a Vaporeon. She is loving and caring like any mother would be, even towards something she originally thought as a disappointment when you were first conceived. She has grown attached to you, in the way the yearning to look after one\u2019s child besets a mother whose other children have left the home. For this reason, your mother is ever protective of you and was almost against letting you go to live with one of your possibly mean brothers or sisters, but your father insisted. You spend half of the nights sleeping in the embrace of your mothers paws, while the other half is cuddling with your father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou father is six foot three in length from nose to tail, slightly more than twice as tall as the average Leafeon. Though not as willing to admit it, your father is just as loving and caring as your mother, but tends to keep more of a distance from you I fear of hurting your accidentally. Though in a way, your father slightly despises you for your size, he loves you for the way you keep a constant bond between him and your mother. If it wasn\u2019t for having to look after you, when your siblings left, they probably would have gone their separate ways. Occasionally, your father takes you on food gatherings with him, since he believes one day you will be able to fend for yourself, though this is but a dream of your fathers. Despite not being able to understand him or any other of your own kind, you have a feeling your father loves you very much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour first brother is an Eevee, who never came in contact with any stones in this unknown region. He is two foot two, above twice the size of a regular Eevee. Due to your brother being the second smallest in the litter when you\u2019re other siblings evolved, you two were very close. Honestly, he liked being close to you because then he didn\u2019t feel as small compared to the others. Often you would spend time crawling around on his belly when you two were alone and at one time you even helped him clean up his mouth, though this almost resulted in you becoming his next meal, but he was able to regurgitate you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour first sister is a Flareon that in five foot from nose to tail. Like your Eevee brother, she too cared for you deeply, but in a more sensual way. Often she\u2019d try to take you someplace within her mouth and tried to swallow you whole. You weren\u2019t able to talk to her because of your birth defect, unable to understand she just wanted you closer to her, to protect you. Since you didn\u2019t understand too well why she did this, you were on a constant balance between loving her and fearing her, unable to choose between the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour next brother is a Jolteon who is four foot six from nose to tail. By far the most rough out of your siblings, he was often the one playing fetch with you, literally; he tossed you up in the air and tried to grab you with his maw. This made some pretty close calls, but he was always smart enough to know the right position while catching you to not hurt you. Your brother was always energetic and excited towards you, something that scared you until you got use to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour next sister, Espeon being four foot eleven from nose to tail, was the sister who cared very little for you. Often when tasked with looking after you during family outings, she would simply sit on you to make sure you didn\u2019t go anywhere while she groomed herself. Despite your sister\u2019s failings during most of the time in her presence, she would often use her psychic abilities to entertain you when she felt like it and when you were in danger; she would even shield you from being squashed or hurt. If you had to guess, she was just rough in a different sense from your Jolteon brother and that the way she treated you was just a way she showed affection. Perhaps with all the others coddling you, she decided to give you a break by treating you differently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour brother, Umbreon was five foot from nose to tail and often took you along on his night time excursions. You would often spend hours a night staring at the stars with him, nestled comfortably on his belly, listening to the noises it made and the heart beat not far above. One time or another, you imagined what it would be like to hear it on the inside, not knowing this was the same feeling your sister, Flareon wanted for you, but instead you felt for your brother Umbreon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour last sister and sibling, a Glaceon was four foot five from nose to tail and was very cold towards you. She would often attempt to bat you away if you got in her path and even stepped on you a few times, though never put on her full weight. A few times when you were eating your food, she would come and take it from you, even when you were still on top of it. This led to many encounters with her teeth and even a journey to her belly, only to be regurgitated as she left you lying in her vomit with disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe afternoon finally arrived and you stood up on your mother\u2019s back, she too getting the signal that you were ready to go, even though you two couldn\u2019t communicate. Dreary eyed from relaxing so long, your mother carefully made her way out of the pond, making sure not to move too suddenly or you\u2019d fall off. The sun reflecting off of your mother\u2019s skin caused you to recoil and close your eyes from the intensive glare, your mother noticing this and quickly going into the shade. You father soon arrived with a Magikarp for tonight\u2019s feast dangling from his mouth, held by its tail. Your father would often feed your mother before himself, so the Magikarp was for her. Dropping the fish Pok\u00e9mon to aimlessly flop on the ground, your father prepared for your mother\u2019s decision; who was going to take you to one of your siblings?</span></div></div>",
