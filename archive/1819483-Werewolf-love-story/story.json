Behind her the form of a furry beast followed her, its yellow eyes glowing in the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough it could easily close the distance between the women and it, the beast, for some reason, kept its distance, like it was merely following her out of curiosity rather than malice. Pamela broke through the woods, and, with a great amount of courage, stole a glance behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beast was gone. She breathed heavily, her chest heaving. Pamela was standing at the riverside, the lights of Stockhill, the town that she lived in, visible in the distance to the south. With her wits returning after the shock, the black-haired teen collapsed to the rocky shore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't believe it. Her love of her life, Arthur, was dead. Or that was at least what she thought happened. When Pamela followed him into the woods this night, she lost track of him. Soon she heard yelps of pain, followed by the howl of a wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing Pamela knew was that she was being chased by an unknown giant animal. She suspected it killed him, and that she, with her presence, provoked it to do so. Pamela felt sick with guilt, but she had to know why her boyfriend disappeared into the woods at night when the moon was full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPamela begged for many months to tell her why, but Arthur would only laugh nervously, giving her vague answers or would try to change the subject. But, as she sat there in shelf-pity, an idea struck her. What if the wolf was Arthur?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't ponder the idea for long, because Pamela felt like something was watching her. Looking up, she saw the beast from earlier on a large boulder. It watched her with its those yellow eyes of it, sitting on its haunches, not moving a single muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow properly in the moonlight, Pamela could see its brown fur, its bulging muscles, and its large wolf-like head. The way its anatomy was designed, the beast looked like it could switch from being bipedal to quadruped, and quadruped to bipedal, at will. Standing, it would most likely stand seven feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPamela screamed, jumping to her feet, and running down the rocky riverside towards Stockhill. The wolf-like creature watched her leave, making no move to intercept her. The beast sat there, studying her, cocking its head left and right, trying to figure out who it was. The two-legged creature's identity was somewhere hidden in the back of its mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt sniffed the air, using the two-legged's scent help the beast. \"Prey?\" it thought, offering a solution to itself. The beast took another sniff of the air, thus time something familiar coming to it. \"No,\" it corrected itself, its glowing eyes growing wide, \"Mate!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beast's tail began to wag. Quickly it decided what it should do.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was late, and the police station was mostly empty, but Officer Dale Brown was sitting in his office and studying evidence under the light of a lamp. He sighed, leaning back in his chair, rubbing his sore eyes and knuckled his mustache before he leaned in again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a policeman the only crimes that Brown had to deal with were petty offenses; stolen bicycles, shoplifters, and sometimes burglaries. But now he had this, a Missing Person case. Brown could still remember vividly the young women that arrived at the station a few nights ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was sobbing, obviously traumatized, rambling about a monster, her boyfriend, and a murder. Officer Francine Strydom, Brown's partner, calmed the girl down and took her in for questioning. From there they got a better story, and the women told them a bizarre story about her boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApproaching the end of every month, Arthur Tepper would show signs of aggression and would become extremely protective of her, right before disappearing into the woods, when the moon was full, for two days. He would then return, looking tired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe women asked him multiple times why, but he would shift the subject every time. So far the story seemed rational, but then the women told them that she followed him into the woods and was attacked by a monster. She was there at the station to report a murder, believing that it killed her boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOfficer Brown and Francine were obviously skeptical about her story, but the girl was very serious, begging for their help. They sent her home and took up the case. Officers of the station, helped by a few members of the community, no doubt swept up by the worried women, went out to search for him. They couldn't find anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately they couldn't rule it as a murder, for they didn't have sufficient evidence, but they could rule it as a Missing Person case. While the search was on for Arthur Tepper, Officer Brown and Francine went out to gather some information about the young man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir search led them to a old women named Tamara Anderson, who was Arthur's aunt and guardian. It was from there that they found out that the boy was home schooled by her, and that he was tragically left orphaned after his mother died and his father was no where to be found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat made Officer Brown suspicious of the old women was that she didn't seem surprised, or concerned, when they told her that Arthur was missing. He had a hunch that she knew something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe search continued, and they found out that he also worked at a local grocery store. According to the shop owner, he was a hard working, and loyal, employee. Though, he was rather reclusive and had few friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passed, and the two day time period that he was gone, according the young women, ran out. There was still no news of him, even though they set up a reward for anyone who saw or found him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the search teams had some luck at least; they found in the woods, in a small clearing, scraps of torn clothing they identified as Arthur's. Brown was fearing that this was a wild animal attack, for it happened at least ones a decade to hikers in this part of the state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut if it was then they would have found the mangled body a long time ago, or at least bones. They did found, however, tracks of a very large wolf in the mud. Brown didn't want to admit it but he was beginning to believe the young women's story of a monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this very moment he was studying the evidence they so far found, linking it up with another witness. Mr. Joe McClaren was a Irish immigrant that was a farmer, living a few miles out of town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't the first time the man called the police station to report that his livestock had been attacked by some monster. Officer Francine, who was always dispatch to him, took up Joe's stories with a pinch of salt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAccording to the residence of Stockhill, the Irishman drank quite a lot. Of course Joe had evidence of an attack - a ripped up carcass of a cow or sheep - but Officer Francine always concluded that it was a bear attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Joe insisted that it was some sort of beast, Officer Francine would simply ask: \"How much have you been drinking last night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the question Joe would grow very thoughtful. \"Well,\" he would say slowly, his hand touching his wrinkled face covered in stubble, \"Not much, really. Just a mug or so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOfficer Francine would leave it there, telling him to lock his animals up better in the night, which he often forgot to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Brown was studying the evidence, his cell phone rang. Without looking at it, he picked it up and answered it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello,\" he said, \"This is Dale Brown. Who is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there, Dale,\" came Francine's familiar voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrown's head perked up. \"Francine,\" he said, a hopeful smile appearing on his face, \"Is there any news?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" said Francine, \"The dogs from the city has arrived.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStockhill was a small town, and its police station didn't have the necessary equipment to battle large crimes. For this case they had to request help from a police station from the nearest city. They had sent them a dog squad, and with the bloodhounds it would be easier to track the missing man down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And have they found anything yet?\" Brown asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Francine confirmed, \"They got a scent. They're also asking you to come down here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be there in a few minutes,\" said Brown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter ending the call, Brown jumped to his feet. He grabbed his flashlight, his hat, and jacket, then headed out the door.</span></div></div>",

As soon as it touched the waters of the Sul river, the eagle immediately pulled up, carrying away its prize, a squirming, wet fish. Standing on the riverbank, dressed in rags, a bucket in his right hand, Arthur Tepper watched this scene with awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took a gulp of the fresh and cool morning air, watching the first rays of the sun reach over the mountain range.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYup, there was nothing more beautiful than Mother Nature. Crouching, the young man dipped his bucket into the slow-moving water. He carried the full bucket up the hill, walking on a path that led towards a small log cabin, which had smoke pouring from its chimney.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he approached Arthur could hear loud thumbing noises. Herman Tepper, Arthur's uncle, a man with a unkempt brown beard and hair, dressed in animal skins he tailored himself, was busy splitting wood. He looked up when he heard his nephew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got the water you wanted,\" said Arthur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHerman nodded, saying: \"Good. Throw it in the pot on the stove.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiving here deep in the woods, miles away from civilization, in a cabin nestled between tall pine trees where there was no running water or electricity, life was different. Many might call it rough and barbaric, but Arthur felt right at home here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was also the only place he could come after his transformation into a wolf, to a family member which not only welcomed him but also inherited the same curse of turning into a beast when the moon was full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe always did this, staying there for a few days, helping his uncle with his day-to-day life, chairing vegetables and fruits from his garden, canning meat, fetching him water from the river and chopping wood for a fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter two days he would make his way back to Stockhill where he lived with his aunt, who knew what he was but, fortunately, didn't suffer the curse. But, as Arthur was throwing the water in the pot, the young man with his brown and curly hair highly doubt he would be returning home soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though he lost some of his memory after his transformation, Arthur could still remember vividly what happen almost a week ago. He must have scared the living daylight out of his girlfriend. For many months he wished he could tell her what he was, but Arthur feared how Pamela would react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course his uncle wasn't too happy when he told him what happened that night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're stupid, boy!\" he scolded that night after Arthur arrived at his doorstep, naked, which wasn't a odd thing for a person that was a werewolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our kind and normal people don't mix,\" he continued, \"You should have left that town as soon as you finished your schooling, not go off forming a relationship with a human. Remember the rules, Arthur.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yes, werewolves did have rules, and the main one was never to be discovered. Arthur respected this one. He didn't want to know what would happen if the government found out about them. No, it was best that they remained as nothing but myth and legend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHerman's way of keeping to rule involved living in complete isolation. He could do this with ease, for he was a lone wolf, but Arthur couldn't. The young man found that he craved human contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven now, as he was standing in the doorway of the cabin, looking to the south the way he came, he felt a ache in his heart being so far away from Pamela. He really wished she could be his mate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arthur!\" Herman called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur went around the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHerman gave his nephew the axe, saying: \"Chop the rest of the wood for me. I'm going up the hill to check if anyone's coming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since Arthur arrived here, Herman went up the hill a few miles away with a pair of binoculars, one of the few modern equipment he had. From there you could see quite a distance, the perfect spot for scouting. His uncle was most likely afraid that the local authorities would arrive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur was afraid, too. He had been gone for quite some time, and he was sure that even his aunt would be worried about him. He hoped that they would never find him. Arthur was thinking of going back, after the heat died down, finding Pamela and confession what he. He hoped that she would except him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking up the axe, he began to split the wood.</span></div></div>",
