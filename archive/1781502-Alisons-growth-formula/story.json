            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nothing was supposed to change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's what they told her.  Three months ago when Alison first heard that Sementex, the small biotech company she worked for was being bought out by the massive multinational company FMG pharmaceuticals.  Research programs that were approved were to continue, FMG was buying them out for their products and intellectual property after all, why would they cancel things?  Or so the story went.  Alison almost believed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now, sitting in her new boss's waiting room, waiting to be summoned on the carpet, all sorts of dire predictions were running through her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dr. Sullivan will see you now, Dr. Galloway,\" said the receptionist, Sandra Adams.  She was the type of woman who normally make Alison uncomfortable with herself, tall, blonde, and stunning, with a brilliant smile and a full, bombshell figure.  'They're probably fake' Alison thought to herself cattily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison, in contrast to Sandra, was a mousy female academic. She was very tall, nearly 6 feet, but you'd never know it, as she hunched over a lot to conceal her height.  Her body was almost unnaturally thin - she weighed only 112 pounds, with a boyish, bony figure, and no breasts to speak of.  Her face was striking with sharp, high cheekbones and enormous green eyes, and she could have been beautiful, a tall, willowy model type, if she had worked at it, but Alison Galloway worked at the opposite.  Always afraid to show her femininity in the overwhelmingly male dominated world of scientific research, like many female scientists, Alison wore sloppy clothes and never any jewelry or makeup.  She wore large ugly glasses many years out of fashion, and had a bad habit of biting her nails until they hurt.  Her hair was thick and blonde, long, but uncared for and pulled back into a ponytail of frizz and split ends pretty much all the time.  When it wasn't, her hair looked like she cut it herself, with a uniform length everywhere, except at the bangs which were cut short to keep out of her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe often thought about that - the way she dressed and presented herself.  Dr. Alison Galloway was a incredibly intelligent woman, she knew she could be beautiful if she tried.  But somehow the security of being the plain, mousy woman held her tight.  She told herself that her colleagues would only take her seriously if she was as far from a sex object as possible.  She told herself that she refused to pander to societal ideals of how a woman should look.  She told herself that it was just too much trouble, and too shallow to spend time working at being beautiful.  But for all her confidence in herself professionally and scientifically, the sight of a magnificent stunner like Miss Adams provoked feelings of inadequacy, self consciousness and jealous anger in Alison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut not today.  Today Alison hardly noticed her.  Today, her thoughts were buried in her work.  Alison had spent the last 6 years of her life, since graduate school, working on a compound to promote protein synthesis, and it was finally close to becoming a reality.  I would be a godsend to millions of people with muscular atrophying diseases and chronic wasting, helping their body synthesize more protein to the muscular structure.  She was hoping to apply for FDA approval for initial clinical trials on human subjects to determine toxicity, but the ABG buyout had put that project on hold.  Clinical trials were very expensive.  Alison wasn't going to stand for that.  She hunched into Michael Sullivan's office ready to fight for her life's work.  <br>\r\nAlison had never been a fighter, she had always ran from any confrontation, but today, over this, she was ready to fight hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Mike Sullivan was in the business of science.  He wasn't an old man, only 38, but it had been years since he'd been in a lab as anything other than a tourist.  Even back when he was an active researcher he spent far more of his time on connections and networking than solvents and assays.  His students used to joke that when Mike showed up at the lab they had to assign him an escort to make sure he didn't touch anything and mess it up.  It wasn't much of an exaggeration.  Nevertheless, he was a very smart man, and ambitious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, at 38 Mike had his sights on VP research for FMG pharmaceuticals, a job that would make him rich beyond belief.  But to get to that lofty position, he needed to make the Sementex acquisition work.  Sementex had a lot of promising projects, but a lot of them were risky with a slim chance of paying off, and even if they did, a very long time horizon to profitability.  It was Mike's plan to pick the ones that could show a profit quickly and throw his support and resources behind them, and abandon the rest of the dogs to wither without any funding.  That way his baby Sementex would show up as a hugely lucrative acquisition in the short term and, with luck (and Mike's voice in their ears at every opportunity) his superiors would notice and promote him quickly before the pipeline dried up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of dogs, Dr. Galloway was here.  God, what a mess she was, especially standing next to the exquisite Sandy Adams.  She should really at least get her hair done.  What is it about some women in science that they just didn't try?  Mike watched Sandra's fantastic breasts bounce slightly as she walked in.  He thought he was being discrete, but both women knew exactly what he was looking at.  Sandy gave him a short, dazzling smile, and Alison fumed inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dr. Galloway, take a seat please.  I've been looking over the specifics of your proposal to take your project to clinical testing, and I wanted to ask  you a few questions before I make my decision,\" Mike opened, never hinting that his mind was already made up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're working on a project to promote protein synthesis in muscle tissue in humans.  This has the potential to be a blockbuster, the sports supplement possibilities are staggering...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm more concerned with the potential impact as a treatment against muscle wasting diseases, Dr. Sullivan,\" Alison interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, of course.  As I was saying I'm concerned about some of the particulars of the project.  Early animal testing seems to suggest that the product can only work on females, is that correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Dr. Sullivan.  Many pathways are involved in muscle hypertrophy in mammals.  The primary one is based on the male hormone testosterone, but for a number of reasons, that has proved difficult to manipulate.  We've had tremendous success, however, in manipulating another, secondary muscle growth pathway, based on female hormones, primarily estrogen but these pathways are essentially inactive in males.  The treatment works on stimulating the body's own muscle growth machinery, essentially tricking it into thinking you've just had a hard workout.  It's much more effective than working out though.  The problem with weight training to promote muscular hypertrophy is that you have to take 2 steps back to take 3 forward.  The training breaks down muscle fibers which the body then regrows bigger and stronger.  My treatment skips the first part, but mimics the chemical signals that cause the body to grow muscle.  In addition, the synthetic signals are many times stronger than those that come as a response to resistance training, and the results in animal studies are truly incredible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.  You've had some problems with fatalities in the rats, haven't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but we understand why that is now.  Simply put, the body can only handle so much mass, whether it's muscle or fat or whatever.  The rats that died were advanced subjects, their muscle mass had been increased to the point where they weighed many times what is normal, and their organs simply couldn't handle the increased mass.  However, when we set an end point earlier in the mass development we have no problems with fatalities, and in fact the rats emerge from the experiments in fantastic health by all traditional measures.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>And you've made no real progress in stimulating the male pathways, correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, we haven't.  After our breakthrough with females last year we've focused on that.  It is disappointing that this treatment will only be available to women, but it's still a significant step forward, I believe, in the management of muscle wasting diseases.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm sure,\"  He paused and looked over his file.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dr. Galloway, allow me to be frank.  You'd like to be entering early human trials with this female muscle stimulant.  This is an extremely expensive undertaking, as you well know and will require a significant portion of Sementex's resources.  With that in mind, I'm afraid the numbers simply don't add up.  Even if everything works out perfectly, and you'll agree with me that never happens at this stage of a drug's development, after years and literally millions of dollars, FMG will be left with a product that has a limited market at best addressing only a small segment of muscle wasting diseases, and only in women.  Now if the product worked on both genders we'd be looking at significant revenues from the sports supplementation side but honestly, no one cares about women's sports and performance.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But there are other potential uses as well, Dr. Sullivan,\" Alison interjected with a note of panic in her voice.  \"As a treatment for anorexia, or to stave off sarcopenia to add years of productive life to millions of elderly women.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike closed the file folder on his desk.  \"I'm afraid it's not enough to make it a good bet for us.  We're going to have to cancel your project.  You'll be reassigned to work in Dr. Peterson's lab.  He's working on a treatment for female sexual dysfunction, your experience in the female hormone pathways will prove invaluable there.  We want you to take the next few weeks to wrap up your work and clean out the lab, then you'll be assigned to Dr. Peterson permanently.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison was stunned.  Her mouth moved, but no words would come.  She knew she was going to have to fight to get a proper financing to move ahead with her work, but ... shutting her down??  She'd never anticipated that.  This was her life's work!  How could they?  She wouldn't allow it!  Mousy Alison, for perhaps the first time in her life was shaking with rage.  And assigning her to work under Peterson?  Peterson was a moron and a pig, he was the joke of Sementex, and he was going to be her boss??</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"You can't shut this project down, I won't allow it.  This is unacceptable!\"  Alison ran out of the office holding back tears, striding past Sandra the receptionist and into the elevator.  She was frantic, hysterical, but she was also resolute.  They weren't going to shut her down!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe practically ran through her lab, tears streaming down her face.  Julie and Craig, her lab tech and postdoctoral assistant were working in the corner.  They were starting to synthesize treatment and placebo doses in anticipation of the clinical trials, and the sight of them working sent Alison off in a new bout of sobs.  She pushed past them into her private office and slammed the door shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside Alison took a moment and calmed down a bit.  Panic and hysteria were replaced by resolve.  It wasn't going to end like this.  She grabbed a legal box from under the desk and began to pack up everything she could related to her work, pads, notebooks, stacks of papers, CDs everything she could find.  She went to the computer and copied all the research information on her hard drive onto her memory stick and tossed that in the box too.  Then she noticed the vials on her desk.  Craig must have been working hard, bless him.  On her desk were 12 vials, 6 doses of the treatment prepared for the never to happen clinical trials and 6 doses of the inhibitor.  Alison's treatment was self-sustaining.  Once taken the body would continue to synthesize protein into muscle at a hugely accelerated rate.  Since that process would eventually kill the patient, literally smothering them in their own tissue, an inhibitor was required to stop the action of the initial treatment.  She didn't think Craig would have been able to get 6 doses of each compound ready so quickly, but Craig often surprised her.  Evidently he left the vials on her desk to show her just how efficient he was.  Alison snatched the 12 vials up and tossed them on top of the box.  She then sat down at her computer and composed a brief email resigning from FMG, sent it off to Mike Sullivan and left her office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA legal sized box full of paper is a heavy thing, and Alison wasn't very strong, but she managed to heft the box onto her hip and sort of throw/waddle it out the door of her office.  Once out in the lab she dropped it on the floor and called her staff over.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't know how to say this, so I'll just come out and say it.  Bad news from Sullivan.  We're being shut down.\"  Alison put up her hand to stifle the inevitable questions from Craig and Julie.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's over.  I've resigned effective immediately, you two are going to be reassigned to Dr. Peterson, I imagine.  Sullivan is going to send people down to clean out the lab soon, I'm sure.  Look, I'd like to answer your questions, but I .. I just can't right now\"  Tears were welling up in Alison's eyes again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can reach me at my gmail account, I'll be in touch in a couple of days to try to explain everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Alison waddled out of the lab, swinging the heavy box down the corridor.  She was crying again, tears streaming down her face, and the box was just too heavy, she needed to rest, but she really didn't want any more people than necessary to see her lugging the box out.  The ladies' room was just around the corner, fortunately, and Alison swung the box through the door, praying that the bathroom would be empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was.  Alison dropped the box on the ground, panting and looked at herself in the mirror.  She wiped the tears from her eyes - fortunately she wasn't wearing any mascara to run and splashed water on her face.  It wasn't far to the parking lot, just a short break here and she could lug the heavy box to her car.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As she bent down to pick up the box again she noticed that the lid had been knocked off when she dropped it onto the bathroom floor, and she spotted the vials on top of the papers.  It was such a waste, such a shame.  Ten years of work had gone into those things, and now they'd never get tested.  She might as well pour the contents down the drain now.  Suddenly a thought jumped into Alison's mind.  They didn't have to go to waste...   It's a commandment of research that one should never test on themselves, but .. what other option was there?  The vials beckoned Alison.  What if they were toxic?  So what?  Life wasn't worth living without her life's work.  Quickly, before she had a chance to talk herself out of it, Alison grabbed one of the vials, filled the attached syringe and shot herself straight into the vein with her treatment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waited a few minutes.  Her arm burned at the site of the injection, but otherwise it was fine.  No immediate allergic reaction, no swelling or sign of initial toxicity.  Now she would just have to wait and see.  She tossed the used syringe back into the box, put the lid on and grunted as she again swung the heavy load down the corridor.  She had to stop 3 more times to rest before she got to her little Corolla station wagon in the parking lot, but she hefted the box into the back and drove off, hoping to never see Sementex again.  As she pulled out of the parking lot, Alison realized that she was absolutely starving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe drove out of the parking lot, onto the feeder road and in 5 minutes was merging onto route 1.  The hunger pains were getting stronger now, she was hungrier than she'd ever been in her life, craving meat. Alison suspected that  this was the compound working.  The rats in the tests had displayed hugely increased appetites.  It was promoting protein synthesis, and calling on her nutritional system to provide it.  And she knew exactly where she wanted to eat.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ray's Hidden Ranch was just half a mile from the Sementex labs on route 1, she used to take her lab staff out there once or twice a year to reward them with a night out and a big feed.  It was a western style barbecue, steaks as big as your head, beans by the bucketful and vegetarians beware!  Her staff loved it, and even though it was a lot of meat for Alison to consume, she didn't mind taking them there, and enduring the jokes about eating her leftovers all week long.  But today, with her compound working on her, Ray's Hidden Ranch was the perfect place for Alison to enjoy an early meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Afternoon ma'am\", the waitress drawled in a patently fake Texas accent, after Alison had been seated.  Her name tag identified her as Holly.  She'd been working at Ray's for over a year since she graduated high school.  Holly was a short, pretty girl, with dark red hair and fierce green eyes.  She carried about 20 extra pounds, but most of it was in the right place, at least for those who liked their women a little thicker, a little rounder.  Ray was one of those men, and Holly had been his mistress since the week after she started.  She outlined the specials in a bored voice - 16 oz. sirloin, a chicken breast for those who are less hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about that?\", interrupted Alison, pointing to the poster on the wall.  Holly followed Alison's finger, chuckling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's our big eater special ma'am, you probably don't want that.  It's a 100 ounce steak, 2 baked potatoes, salad, shrimp cocktail, big bowl of beans and some other trimmings for $100, but if you can finish it all it's free.  And you get your name and picture on that wall over there.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like one of those\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ma'am that's a lot of food, are you sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm very hungry\", responded Alison with a twinkle in her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright\", responded Holly, with a look of amusement.  \"There are some rules to the contest.  You must sit at the designated table in our dining room. You may not leave the table for any reason once the contest starts. No one may assist you in any way (such as cutting up your meal). You must complete the dinner in 1 hour.  If you can't do the meal in an hour, you ain't going get it done in 2 hours, believe me!  You may not share your meal even if you don't complete the dinner, like take it back to your table to be shared by any folks you may have invited to cheer you on.  But I guess you're alone today, right?  Oh, and if you get sick, the contest is over, period.  Follow me ma'am.  Oh, how would you like that done?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rare, very rare.  I'm very hungry, if you could bring that out as soon as possible, at least the salad and beans, that would be fantastic.  Oh and could you bring me a big pitcher of water?  I'm parched.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly, shaking her head slightly, walked off to the kitchen.  She was back with a big bowl of beans and Alison's salad in a couple of minutes.  The steak took 10 more.  And half an hour after ordering the belt buster special, Alison was mopping the last of the juice up with a piece of bread.  The 100 oz steak was over 6 pounds of meat.  Add in the beans, potatoes, etc. and Alison figured she'd probably consumed at least 10 pounds of food in less than half an hour.  Strangely her stomach didn't feel full, nor did it bulge with all that newly consumed food.  In fact, Alison didn't feel any different at all, she was still hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly came out of the back to check on Alison and swore to herself when she noticed that the thin woman had actually finished her steak in less than half an hour.  Ray didn't like people eating for free, and he especially didn't like being scammed.  No way could that skinny chick have finished all that, she was playing games.  She hadn't left the table, but Holly was willing to bet she had gotten rid of the steak somehow.  She should have watched her closer.  Or maybe she was some sort of freak of nature, like the 120 pound Japanese guy that eats 50 hot dogs.  But nothing she could do about it now.  It was time to congratulate the winner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!  That didn't take you long!  The owner, Ray, likes to take the pictures of people who finish the belt buster, because it doesn't happen very often!  Ray isn't here now though, he usually gets in around 1 in the afternoon, and so I'll just take your name and get it put on that plaque over there, the wall of fame!  Will that be all Ma'am?  Or do you have room for desert?\u201d Holly inquired mischievously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To tell you the truth\", Alison replied, \"I'm still a bit hungry.  Are there any rules about me ordering another belt buster?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, now this chick was pushing her luck.  \"Excuse me?\" Holly stammered out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously\", Alison replied.  \"I'm still hungry.  I have a very fast metabolism, my mother always used to say I have a hollow leg.  I'd like another steak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, no one ever has ever ordered 2 of those, but I can't see any reason why we can't serve you another one.  Let me ask in the back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly was back a few minutes later, after calling Ray at home.  He was on his way in, and gave his waitress instructions.  No one was scamming Ray Holmgren out of 2 free meals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss?  I talked to the owner and he says we'd be happy to serve you another belt buster, on the condition that if you can't finish the second, you'll have to pay for both.  If you finish the second too, well then both are free of course, and you'll be enshrined forever - we'll put your picture on the wall with big lights around it for beating the belt buster twice!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I don't need that\", Alison responded, \"Just something to eat.  Please make it rare again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time Holly watched her like a hawk as Alison devoured the meat.  She noticed that Alison wasn't as skinny as she first thought she had been.  She was wearing loose fitting clothes that hid her well, but they didn't billow around her as much as Holly first thought.  Girl actually looked like she had some chunk to her.  Well she'd have to, Holly thought to herself, to eat that much!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took her longer to finish this time, almost using up a whole half hour, but Alison finished every bite as Holly watched in amazement.  No hiding food, no tricks, Holly was watching, this woman actually ate 2 100 ounce steaks in just over an hour!  As Alison was finishing the last of her steak, Ray walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay Holmgren was a big man, six foot three, and about three hundred pounds.  He used to be a linebacker at Texas A and M back in the day.  He was now in his 40s and had lost his shape and developed a beer gut, but his arms and shoulders still carried the muscle of a division 1 college football player.  He knew it too.  Ray was extremely proud of his imposing physical stature, and would flare his lats out as he walked, pulling his arms away from his body to puff his muscles up as he walked into his Ranch House, his castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd owned his steak house for years now and only 8 people had EVER finished his belt buster special.  And they were all 300 pound men.  So what was this about a skinny little girl eating it twice?  What kind of shenanigans were going on?  Ray was going to get to the bottom of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, is this the little lady who's eating me out of house and home?\u201d Ray inquired, walking up to Alison's table just as she had finished her meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison looked up into Ray's face.  The second steak had filled her up, and she really had to go to the bathroom, but Holly had insisted that Alison could not leave the table until it was gone.  Although she still didn't feel bloated or full, her bra straps and underwear were cutting into her skin painfully, cutting off circulation.  She needed to get to the bathroom to try to fix it, but it looked like Ray wanted to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Ray, the proprietor, and I have no idea where you put all that meat, darlin'.  You hiding some in that purse there?\u201d Ray quipped, only half joking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleased to meet you Ray, but I really need to excuse myself.\"  Alison said, moving to get up.  Her body felt strange as she stood, like her limbs belonged to someone else.  She almost sat back down to steady herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProbably going to go throw up, thought Ray, but said nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison lurched awkwardly down the hall to the bathroom, like someone who'd drank, rather than ate, too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds after Ray saw Alison disappear through the door to the ladies room he motioned to Holly.  \"Go see what she's doing in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want me to spy on the lady in the bathroom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I (ah) want to know if she's puking in there, yeah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly Holly got up and trudged to the ladies room herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay's Ranch house wasn't exactly the kind of place that went to great effort to appoint itself with luxury bathrooms, but the privacy was exactly what Alison needed.  She slipped into a stall, closed the door behind her, and peed more than she'd ever peed in her life.  When she was done, she unbuttoned her blouse, which wasn't nearly as loose fitting as she remembered, and reached her arms behind her back to undo the catch on her bra, which was practically strangling her at this point.  She took off the blouse, pulled the bra off and then noticed the changes in herself.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The transformation was astonishing.  Skinny Alison was gone, replaced by a muscular beauty.  She wasn't bulky, but lithe and athletic, looking like she just stepped off the field at the Olympics.  She was sporting a substantial amount of muscle, not a bodybuilder by any means, but enough that her tone and definition were obvious.  It wasn't surprising; after all if the protein synthesis was working she had probably added 15 pounds of muscle to her frame in the last hour.  She ran her hands over her now six-pack abs amazed by their shape and hardness.  She couldn't resist flexing her biceps, and was surprised by the bulge that popped out in her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer self-examination was interrupted by the sound of Holly coming into the ladies' room.  Alison quickly slipped her blouse back on.  There was no way the bra was going to fit, but Alison hardly needed it, though her breasts did seem a bit fuller.  Perhaps a side-effect of the female hormonal pathways she used for the protein synthesis?  If so, it would be a welcome side effect.  Her blouse was still quite loose, but the polyester blend was heavy enough to keep her from getting arrested without a bra, but light enough that her small breasts poked sexily against it.  The blouse was starting to get tight across her back and shoulders, but was still pretty loose fitting overall.  Alison opened the stall door and exited, her skirt still distressingly tight across her formerly flat bottom, but there was nothing that could be done about that right now.  She was going to have to go shopping in the near future though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, miss.  He sent me in to watch you.  He thinks you're puking your dinner up right now.  No one your size has ever finished the gut buster, never mind twice!  I wouldn't ever have believed it.  You weren't... were you?  Barfing, I mean.\"  Alison stammered, speaking too quickly.  She was suddenly strangely intimidated by the tall woman in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, hardly .. Holly\", replied Alison, reading the name off of Holly's tag.  She thought to herself for a second.  She knew she should just get out of there, jump in her car and drive off, avoid any kind of confrontation.  That was always her first instinct.  But Alison was feeling a surge of confidence and even pride for the first time in a long time.  She was enjoying the attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just that I'm in training, pretty seriously too.  And I have to eat a tremendous amount of food to keep up with it.  Like thousands of calories a day,\u201d The lie was smoothly and confidently delivered, and Alison couldn't help smirking as she said it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly nervously pulled a stick of lipstick from her purse and looked into the mirror as she applied it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That makes sense, I guess\", she said, in between rolling her lips together.  It didn't really, but she had heard that athletes did eat a lot of food to keep their strength up.  \"What are you in training for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bodybuilding.\"  The word popped out of Alison's mouth without missing a beat.  She chuckled inside.  Alison Galloway pretending to be a bodybuilder.  That was a stretch!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!\"  Holly turned to Alison, done with her lipstick.  \"Lady you're too skinny!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm just starting out, to be honest.\"  It was honest too, damn it!  She certainly hadn't been anything like a bodybuilder yesterday!  \"But I'm making great progress so far.  Here, let me show you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly's heart sped up just a bit with excitement.  Alison rolled her sleeve up on her left arm and flexed for Holly.  Her bicep popped up again, and Holly's jaw dropped as she stared transfixed.  She slowly reached out her arm to touch Alison's pausing only to mutter, \"May I?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead\", replied Alison in a deep, confident voice.  She was enjoying this moment more than she would have ever guessed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly's arm cupped Alison's bicep gently.  It was warm, and the skin was soft, but underneath it was like marble, hard and solid.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn!  I never would have guessed you were built like that!  Girl, I'd KILL for an arm like that!\"  Holly wasn't exaggerating much.  She'd always been fascinated with the look of muscular women, and wished she could look like them.  But she never had the willpower to work at it.  She'd joined a few gyms, but never lasted more than a month, mostly because she was confused by the exercise selection, and more than a little intimidated by all the fit, muscular people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's easier than you think Holly\", Alison replied.  If only you knew how easy it was!  She didn't know where the next thing she spoke came from, but she heard herself offering, \"If you'd like, maybe we can meet someday and I'll show you a few things in the gym.\"  Now where did that come from?  What the hell did Alison know about a gym?  Hopefully the 'someday' would save her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's my card.  Give me a call sometime\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Alison.\u201d Holly stammered still preoccupied from touching Alison's arm.  \"I might do that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison angled past the still distracted Holly and out of the ladies room.  Holly followed her our a few seconds later.  Alison needed to get her coat and get out of Ray's, hopefully before Ray noticed and made trouble for her.  But no such luck, Ray was still sitting at the table where she had left her coat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Little lady, I don't know how, but I'm being scammed.  Nobody your side eats 2 belt busters, no way.  Now I don't know if you just puked your guts out, or got rid of the food some other way, but no way you finished the contest fair and square.  Ah'm gonna have to ask you to pay for your food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison was about to object when Holly jumped in.  \"She's legit Ray.  She's a bodybuilder, and needs to eat a lot to grow her muscles.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A bodybuilder??  A lady bodybuilder?  This skinny thing?\"  Ray laughed his booming laugh \"Haw Haw!!  Building up big strong muscles, are you darlin'?  Lemme see your big muscles!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison was becoming angry now.  Yesterday this kind of confrontation would have probably sent her into a seizure, or at least left her crying.  But today it was just making her mad.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, Ray, I followed the rules of the contest, and I'm going to be on my way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, soon as you pay up,\u201d Ray was still chuckling to himself.  \"Lady bodybuilders, what's this world coming to.  Hell, bodybuilding in general is pretty dumb.  I remember back when Ah was playing football, those bodybuilder guys in the gym.  The looked like Hercules, but they was all show and no go, weaklings each and every one of em.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Care to see who's the weakling here, tough guy?\"  Again the words slipped out of Alison's mouth before she even realized it.  It was like someone else was talking.  But they were out there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haw! Haw! Haw! little lady, what you have in mind?  You wanna arm rassle or something?  Haw! Haw!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it'll get me out of here, sure.  But I only will wrestle you on one condition.  If I win I walk out without having to pay.  And believe me I'm NEVER coming back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if Ah win?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, then I guess I have to pay my bill.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal!  Follow me out back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What the hell?\u2019 thought Alison to herself.  She had nothing to lose, Ray wasn't going to let her out without paying anyways.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue to its macho image, Ray's Ranch house did have a competition arm wrestling table in the back.  Sometimes some of the customers wanted to test their strength against each other, or against the owner.  Ray almost never lost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison and Ray went to the back room and sat on opposite sides of the table, putting their elbows in the padded circles and grabbed the posts with their left hands.  Holly was playing referee, and held their hands together in the top position.  Secretly she was pulling for Alison, but she knew the girl had no chance.  Ray outweighed her by more than 100 pounds, and he was the arm wrestling king around the restaurant.  Alison had some nice muscle in her arm, for a girl, but she wasn't close to Ray.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Alison had never arm wrestled in her life, but then how hard could it be?  Push with all your might, pin Ray's arm.  Despite her obvious disadvantage compared to Ray, Alison's newfound confidence was telling her she could DO this!  She almost believed it.  Still she knew she was the serious underdog here.  Her only hope was a bit of deception.  Ray was clearly the show off type, and although the restaurant was empty at 3:30 in the afternoon, a few cooks and cleaners had gathered to watch the match.  She knew that Ray would be cocky, and wouldn't be able to help but show off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Holly pulled her hands away to signal the start of the match, Alison lurched her arm with sudden force, hoping to take Ray off guard.  She didn't use all her strength, only about half, but she was quicker than Ray, who was caught a bit off guard, and moved his arm about halfway down before he caught her.  With a grin on his face Ray pulled their arms back to the starting point, while Alison put up only a fraction of her strength into resisting.  Ray smiled and started joking with the staff as he pushed Alison's arm halfway down and then let up.  He was going to toy with her now, just as she thought he would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter, little lady?  Too hard on you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay let off the pressure and let Alison pull her arm back up.  He was clearly not exerting himself, talking and joking with the audience.  Alison, while also not expending her full strength, was pretending she was pushing for all she was worth.  Slowly Ray's arm went down as he teased her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, you're making me work for this, darlin'.  Ah cain't stop you! Ah!  Mah arm!\"  Ray joked as he let Alison push his arm most of the way down to the table.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRay's arm was getting close to the bottom.  Alison knew he'd pour on his strength any minute now and slam her down to her defeat.  But Ray didn't know how much Alison was holding back.  Suddenly she flexed her muscles tight and threw her weight into her arm, jerking Rays arm suddenly down to the table!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it wasn't enough.  Ray caught on, and put his whole strength into it, stopping Alison as his arm was hovering about half an inch above the table.  After that it was inevitable.  Ray was simply stronger.  Ray grit his teeth, his face went red and he poured all his strength into his arm and he slowly.. ever so slowly pushed Alison's arm back.  Back up to the top and over and down, pinning her arm a few minutes later.  When it was over both competitors arms felt like fire, but Ray was the winner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly was amazed at how good a fight Alison had put up.  Ray won, Ray always won, but she hadn't seen him pushed like that since the Rutgers football team was down a few months back.  That girl was STRONG!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Alison swore loudly to herself as she veered through traffic.  Rush hour was just starting on Route 1 and things were starting to slow down.  Alison was in a blind rage, angrier than she ever remembered being.  Not only had Ray beaten her, and left her $200 poorer on the day she lost her job, but he was a gigantic prick about it, strutting around the bar and teasing her.  She slinked out, fuming and nearly tore Holly's head off when the waitress followed her out to apologize.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He can be such an asshole sometimes, I'm sorry Alison.  I hope I can still call you about working out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, whatever.\"  Alison growled, but couldn't help but smile a touch at Holly's supplication.  But her anger soon returned, and thoughts of revenge against Ray were at the forefront.  She caught herself mid-growl.  \"I'm not mad at you Holly, I'm just frustrated at myself and angry at Ray.  I'd love to take that bully down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's not that bad, when you get to know him!\"  Holly called out after Alison's rapidly retreating car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison's hunger had returned with a vengeance and she stopped off at the drive through on the way home to order 3 double whopper value meals.  They barely sated her.  If this drug ever makes it into production, make sure to buy stock in Burger King, she thought to herself.  Like it was going to ever see production now.   Thoughts of how her research had been shut down just made her even angrier, so she put them out of her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison stopped at the supermarket on the way home and stocked up on $400 worth of food, enough to feed a family of 4 for a couple of weeks.  She figured it would last her a day or two.  It was surprisingly easy lifting the heavy bags of meat and groceries into the trunk of her car.  Her strength gains were incredible.  She held a gallon jug of milk out at arms length in front of her effortlessly.  She could have held it there all day.  Yesterday she would barely have been able to lift it.  Still, not enough to beat Ray, she fumed to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got home and unloaded her groceries and the box of stuff she'd stolen from the lab.  She chuckled as she easily held the filing box in one arm as she carried a dozen plastic grocery bags in the other.  When she left the lab she'd barely been able to pick up the box filled with papers and her collected research.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison took out her laptop and booted it up.  She checked her email at work.  Sure enough there was a message from Mike Sullivan accepting her resignation and reminding her about her non-disclosure and non-compete contracts with Sementex and how they applied to FMG as well.  She wouldn't be able to legally take her research that she'd performed at Sementex anywhere else.  Oh well.  Mike also demanded that Alison return the FMG property that she had taken earlier that day, or they'd begin legal proceedings.  Alison lazily flexed her bicep.  Maybe she was considered FMG property now!  In her gmail account was a message from her postdoc Craig.  The guy was really a sweetheart, he was concerned for Alison's welfare, didn't say a thing in the email about his own career going down with hers.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat done, the scientist in Alison took over.  She began a new document to chart her progress as a guinea pig.  She stripped down to her panties and got out her digital camera to take pictures, cursing herself for not taking any \"before\" shots.  She'd have to dig up some pictures from her hard drive, hopefully she'd find something appropriate to compare with.  Alison's muscles didn't' seem to have grown much from the 3 double whopper meals, but her breasts were definitely larger and fuller.  She wasn't sure why that was, but she had a theory.  The protein synthesis machinery in her cells needed protein to work, and the meal at Ray's, although filled with it's share of fat and carbs, was primarily protein.  The fast food meals, on the other hand, were loaded with fat.  Her muscles couldn't make much use of that, so her body stored it away.  In her breasts, apparently.  The targeted fat storage was probably due to the female hormone pathways she'd used in the protein synthesis.  If only Dr. Sullivan had known Alison had a breast growth pill earlier than morning!  They'd never halt THAT project!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison cupped her new breasts and felt them.  They were firm and supple, and she had to reluctantly admit, after a lifetime of telling herself that breasts just got in the way, they looked fantastic on her.  They were nothing extreme, barely a B cup at best, but they were so much more than she had this morning!  It made her feel all tingly.  She tore herself away from the mirror, put on a bathrobe and grabbed  one of the boxes of protein bars she'd just picked up at the supermarket along with a gallon jug of milk, and started chewing on a bar.  The she sat at her computer and began to type.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Subject 001 female 6'0\" tall, weight approx. 112 pounds, body fat 18% (according to her body fat scale.  Those things were notoriously inaccurate, but it was all she had).  Baseline strength measurements (Alison dug out her workout journal):<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeg press, 45 degree angle: 12 repetitions at 110 pounds<br>\r\nBench press: 2 x 20 pounds dumbbells, 11 repetitions<br>\r\nshoulder press, seated: 10 repetitions with 2x10 pound dumbbells<br>\r\ncable row: 13 repetitions at 30 pounds<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSubject took compound coded 0098845 at approximately 1300, Thursday, May 17, 2007.  Subject exhibited  vastly stimulated appetite soon thereafter and consumed\", Alison guessed, \"approximately 40000 kcals of nutrition, which consisted of about 2000 grams of protein\".  Enough to feed the old Alison for about 3 weeks, she chuckled to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Subsequent to this feeding subject exhibited vast muscular hypertrophy as well as vastly increased strength, levels to be documented later.  At approximately 1700, 02/15 subject weighs\" ... Alison pulled out her scale and stepped on.  \"133 pounds with 16% body fat\".  She'd gained 21 pounds AND she lost some fat.  Wow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Subject reports heightened levels of confidence and some euphoria.  Subject also reports increased aggression, with some episodes of rage\", it was important to be honest with yourself, \"as well as a heightened state of sexual arousal.\"  She hadn't been able to put her finger on that right away, but there was no denying it.  Her new body was turning Alison on more than she had been since high school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison was munching away on the protein bars as she finished typing, and was surprised to see she'd not just finished a bar, but rather the whole box of 24!  It only contained empty wrappers now.  The milk was gone too!  The bars and the milk were very high in protein and Alison could feel a pleasant warmth all through her muscles as her body absorbed the nutrition.  She checked the nutritional label on the bars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Addendum, 1900 hours:  Subject has consumer a further 6000 calories and 800 g protein.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Alison lived in an apartment complex that catered to young single professionals, and as such it came with a membership at a local \"fitness center\".  She managed to squeeze herself into her sports bra, threw on a pair of shorts and a t-shirt that used to be too big on her and walked the half a mile to the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore her experimentation on herself Alison had been going to the gym semi-regularly to keep in shape, and she knew the place would be crowded tonight, so she hoped no one recognized her.  She didn't think there was much chance of that, though.  Alison had never captured a lot of attention at the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe warmed up by running on the treadmill for about 20 minutes.  Alison had always enjoyed running, she had even gotten seriously into it in college, but hadn't kept it up.  But she was very pleased to see that her extra 20 pounds hadn't slowed her down any.  If anything she was less winded after her run than she would have been.  She moved to the mats to do some yoga and stretching and was again pleased to notice that her flexibility hadn't decreased at all with her new body.  What Alison didn't notice, probably because she wasn't used to it, was the stares she was getting from the other patrons.  She was becoming noticeably muscular and was obviously very fit and people were watching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison moved over to the smaller free weight area where she used to do her resistance training.  She started with cable rows and set the weight at 50 pounds, almost double what she was using before her treatment.  She sat herself back in the seat and pulled on the handle and the weight rose almost by itself, it was so easy!  She put the weight back down and set it for 80 pounds, then 110 then finally at 140, more than half of the 200 pound stack, she found the resistance challenging.  The 12th repetition was very hard and Alison grit her teeth against the pain, but she kept perfect form as the weight went up.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom 30 to 140 pounds!  That was incredible, Alison was exhilarated by her new abilities.  Her back was burning but it felt so good, almost euphoric.  The warmth she had felt earlier after her meal was back, concentrated in her back and biceps.  OK, seated shoulder press.  The biggest weights they had in the small weight room were 40 pound dumbbells, and Alison quickly learned that they wouldn't be enough to test her strength.  With a mixture of dread and excitement she knew she had to move to the big guy's side of the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWomen went to the big guy's side of the gym, of course, but mostly it was to talk to the guys.  This was the side of the serious weightlifter or bodybuilder.  It was sweaty, and noisy and the dumbbells went up to 150 pounds.  Alison looked at those massive hunks of iron, and thought to herself, 'as if'.  A lot of heads turned though, as she grabbed a pair of 65 pound dumbbells and sat on a bench to press them overhead.  She was a little too ambitious this time, she only managed to get out 8 good reps before her shoulders gave out, but still, 2 x 65 was 130 pounds, that's what Alison weighed yesterday!  Two 80 pound dumbbells proved to be just about perfect for her chest press, and she just made the 12th rep.  As she walked them back to the rack to put them away Alison thought about how the weights felt in her hand.  She could tell they were heavy, she KNEW they were heavy, but somehow she could move them.  It was incredible, it brought a little tear to her eye to see how well her experiment was going.  Her chest was pumped and flushed with blood and  she could feel it pressing against her too tight sports bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, leg press.  She walked over to the two leg press machines.  One was being used by a guy, and the other.  Goddamn it.  Some jerk had left his weights on it.  It wasn't a ton, 4 45 pound plates on each side, but the old Alison would have had to wait for the other machine.  She simply couldn't lift the 45 pound plates to take them off of the machine.  She remembered a few  years back when she used to workout with Jamie, one of her lab assistants at the time.  Jamie was an athletic girl, who played basketball and rowed when she was in college, and she was much stronger than Alison.  She still remembered her and Jamie laughing hysterically as Alison tried and failed to pick up a 45 pound plate to add to Jamie's leg press.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, this wasn't the old Alison anymore.  She could DO this. She walked up the leg press machine, gripped the plate firmly and pulled it off and ... it came off.  OK the plate was still pretty heavy in her hands, but she was carrying it without dropping it or falling over.  She transferred the plate to one hand (one hand!) and pulled a plate off of the other side and walked them both over to their racks.  Then with 3 plates on each side (270 pounds) Alison decided to see if she could handle the leg press.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe should have left the plates on!  It was easy, at 10 reps she knew she'd have to add that fourth plate back on.  She walked over and replaced the 2 plates back on the machine and banged out another easy 10 reps.  Since it was so easy to do the lifting, Alison's focus drifted a bit and she noticed the guy next to her was also adding a fourth plate to his machine, and had started lifting.  He seemed to be having a harder time than she was though.  She quickly dropped her eyes and turned her gaze away in shyness as he looked over to see her watching him.  She could feel her cheeks blush, but she couldn't help but grin as she jumped up to add a fifth plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man saw her add the fifth plate and looked dejected as he finished his set and got up to add more weight on his machine.  Alison went for a drink of water and when she came back he was just starting his set.  By the eighth rep he was straining, and he just managed to rack it after the ninth with a grunt of exertion escaping his lips.  Alison, in contrast, finished her 12 fairly easily and got up to get more weight.  When she came back to add the sixth plate he was still leaning on his machine panting.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it, you win\", he gasped still trying to catch his breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You win.  No way can I do 6 plates.  Damn you're strong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, thanks\", Alison blushed and looked away again.  She didn't know how to react, but she couldn't keep the smile off of her face.  It didn't hurt that the guy was kind of cute.  He was really tall, about 4 or 5 inches taller than her 6 feet, with kind of a boyish smile.  Despite his height he was kind of stocky, with broad shoulders.  He carried a fair bit of excess fat, but he carried it well.  She wanted to say something back to this man, but Alison's flirting ability was practically nonexistent.  Was he hitting on her?  Her?  Nah, couldn't be, he was just making small talk.  Alison went back to work and stalled out at 9 reps with 6 plates.  That's 540 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy was still standing there when she finished, she hadn't noticed him when she was concentrating on her lifting.  He seemed a bit uncomfortable, like he wanted to say something, but didn't know how.  It kind of made Alison uncomfortable too, as she unloaded her leg press machine.  She could understand now why the strong guys never liked to unload the machines - it was a lot of work!  But she remembered what it was like being the weak girl and made sure to take the weights off.  Her neighbor, perhaps guilted into it or perhaps looking for an excuse to hang out pulled his off as well.  He then mumbled something and walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis kind of ticked her off.  What the hell was this guys' problem?  He had moved off to the bench press and was setting the bar with a plate on each side - 135 pounds.  Alison followed him with a boldness that she'd never have been capable of before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you mind if I work in with you here?\" she asked coldly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S sure\" he stammered.  \"I only have 2 sets though\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison stood at the head of the bench in a spotter position as the man put out 10 reps relatively easily.  She didn't stop to think that the bar weighed nearly as much as she did as she took her turn and lifted it off of the pins.  Again, it was surprisingly easy for her to complete 12 reps.  She noticed the man watching her as she lifted, and this time it was him that turned away when she met his gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You doing the same again, or more weight?\" she asked him when she was done.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M.. maybe another 25 on each side.  I'm feeling strong today!  Maybe I'm inspired.\"  He smiled and Alison couldn't help but smile back, her hostility melting away.  He wasn't being rude to her at all, he was shy!  She knew it from being on the other side, he was too shy to talk to her.  He was so nervous!  It was kind of sweet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn extra 25 on each side took it up to 185, and the man lay back on the bench to start lifting.  It was clear this was a lot harder for him, and he was straining by the 5th rep, and by the 7th he was stuck and Alison had to help him lift it.  Her biceps bulged out as she helped him lift the weight.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, two more, you can do this.  I won't let it drop on you\" she encouraged him, and he complied, finishing the last two reps with more than a little spotting help from her.  On the final rep she was basically lifting the bar on her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe racked the weight and got up slowly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew, thanks, guess I got a little ambitious there.\"  He paused for a while again, as Alison waited for him to say something.  Then he gave a half wave, dropped his eyes to the ground then turned and walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He looked relieved as he watched Alison take off the 25 pound half plate he'd added.  He walked to the spotting position but Alison stopped him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put on another plate on your side, would you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man was a little stunned, but he added another 45 pound weight to his side.  Alison did the same then lay herself on the bench underneath the bar that now weighed 225 pounds.  A hell of a lot more than she did.  The man had a look of disbelief on his face as she pulled the weight from the pins, but no one was more surprised than Alison herself when she lowered the weight, just briefly touched it to her chest and smoothly pressed it back up again.  She repeated the motion 9 more times, the 10th rep was slow and labored, but the man never needed to help her with it.  The excitement she showed as she so clearly demonstrated that she was the stronger was written all over her face, and her body tingled with excitement.  Her face flushed and her nipples pressed against the confinement of her too small sports bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood up and smiled at the man, \"thanks..\" she paused.  Surely he would volunteer a name.  Alison found herself drawn to the little game they were playing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greg.  Greg Madding.  I'm actually your neighbor from across the way at Castle White.  I never realized you were so strong!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe paused again.  She knew he wanted to ask her out, a little post workout coffee or something.  But he didn't seem to know what to say.  Inside she was screaming to him 'come on!  Ask me!' but Alison kept quiet as well.  A lifetime of being the shy one meant she didn't have the words any more than he did.  After a long awkward pause he finally spoke.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was good to see you, maybe I'll see you here again someday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was that, Greg was gone and Alison was alone and more than a little frustrated.  On the other hand, she never would have gotten even that far yesterday.  Besides, she was starving, time to go eat again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she got out of the gym it was almost 9 o'clock.  A little late to  be cooking.  In fact, getting enough food was getting to be a bit of a hassle for her.  Fortunately, there was a subway sandwich shop on the way.  She ordered a couple foot long sandwiches, double meat, told the girl behind the counter she was having a party and headed off home.  This growth experiment was getting expensive!  She got home and checked her voice mail.  Just one message.  From Holly, the waitress from this afternoon.  The girl's voice sounded strange, as if she was whispering into the phone, and sad, almost hysterical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Alison, it's Holly... the waitress from this afternoon, you remember?  Anyways, you remember you offered to workout with me and show me a few things?  I hope you meant it, because I'd really like to go workout with you.  Anyways call me at 443-8874, that's my cell maybe we can get together tomorrow?  I don't work tomorrow, I might be off for quite a while, so I can meet you any time.  I know you're probably busy, but I hope you can make some time for me.  I really need it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison couldn't help but be flattered.  She worried a bit about what Holly would think about her changes, and called Holly back.  She left a message on the waitresses voice mail setting up a workout at 6pm the next day.  The old Alison used to always try to avoid the gym at the peak after work hours, it was just too crowded, but the thought of working out in front of all those people, showing off her new body excited her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat taken care of, Alison started her dinner while she entered her gym feats into the computer.  She calculated that her overall strength was up just short of 500%, which was more than she would have expected, given her muscle gains up to now.  The new growth must be more efficient than the old, with better neurological connections, she conjectured while chewing a hunk of sandwich.  Twenty minutes later the sandwiches were all gone, and Alison was getting ready for bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't sleep well at all.  She tossed and turned over all night long and had bizarre dreams, mostly about eating.  Her alarm went off at 6:30 but she slept right through that, and when she finally awoke, she saw through groggy eyes that her bedside alarm clock said 9:28.  She rolled over to move an extra pillow off of her and swung her feet off the side of the bed only to step with a squish into a mostly empty gallon of melted ice cream.  Apparently her dreams weren't entirely fantasy last night, and thinking back she could vaguely remember, as if through a thick fog, getting up to eat that ice cream the night before.  It was then that she realized that the pillow she felt on her chest wasn't a pillow at all.  Alison had boobs!  Big and round and soft and beautiful.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison jumped up, wiped the ice cream off her foot with her sheet and ran to the bathroom mirror.  She watched her new additions jiggle and sway under her pajama top, big and ponderous, but still sitting high and perky on her chest.  They were HUGE!  Not cartoonish, not even quite in the porn star category, but still, so much more than she'd ever seen before.  In fact on Alison's newly expanded frame and with her height they looked perfect, like they belonged.  That's what a gallon of high fat ice cream will do to you, I guess, plus all the fat from the sandwiches.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison continued to admire their shape as she pulled off her pajamas and jumped into the shower.  Her physique had expanded overnight as well, and she doubted anyone would laugh when she suggested she was training for bodybuilding now.  Her biceps no longer required her to flex them to be obvious, and a prominent vein bulged from the front of her arms.  Her shoulders and back had widened considerably, with her traps growing up towards the back of her neck.  Her abs were a washboard of hard flesh, and her legs bulged with thick cords of muscle, with a prominent teardrop shape rising over her knee.  She wasn't contest ripped, but she wasn't far off it either, and veins and striations jumped out when she moved.  She gave a little awkward double bicep flex in the mirror (who knew there was technique involved in flexing your biceps and not looking goofy!) and lemon sized biceps leaped up from her arms.  She wasn't as big as a pro or even a national competitor, but she was pretty sure she if she dieted down a bit she'd be able to win just about any local level bodybuilding show she entered.  She wondered how strong she was now.  She jumped up on the scale and sat down to record her new progress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFriday, May 18, 2007, 10:00 - 6'0\" 183 pounds, 12% bf.  Subject continues to ingest massive quantities of food.  Estimated consumption since 1900 on May 17 is further 20000 kcals with 1000 g protein.  Subject has gained approximately 20 pounds since last report and has further decreased her overall body fat percentage.  This decrease is despite a startling increase in mammary tissue (measurements to follow).  Skeletal muscular hypertrophy continues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOK that done, time to get dressed.  One thing was obvious, she was going to need new clothes.  She giggled as she held up one of her old bras against her new chest.  Yeah, that wasn't going to work.  Even her stretchy sports bras weren't going to be up to that task.  Finding something to wear to go out and buy new clothes was going to be a bit of a challenge.  She couldn't really wear pajamas all day, could she?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Getting dressed was a bit of a comedy routine.  Her old panties had no hope of covering her greatly expanded hips and bottom, but a thong she'd bought to wear under a bridesmaid gown from her cousin's wedding a few years back did the job.  She hated wearing those things, but she had to admit it showed off her new backside in a spectacular fashion.  Any of her old bras were out of the question, but a formerly loose t-shirt tied off in the front like a halter top gave her some modesty, and even though it lacked any support, her new breasts were firm and perky enough that they didn't need much.  She threw her formerly baggy sweatshirt, which now looked like it belonged to her little sister, over top.  The sweatshirt tented out over her chest, and didn't come all the way down to her waist anymore, leaving a fair bit of her washboard stomach showing, but that was the style nowadays, wasn't it?  The lower half was easier.  None of her pants would go up over her expanded thighs, and wearing a skirt with a sweatshirt would just look too ridiculous for even a fashion victim like Alison, so she settled for a pair of stretchy cotton sweatpants.  They clung to her thighs and ass like cycling tights, but they'd do the job.  Socks and shoes and ... she looked ridiculous, but it would have to do.  Plus, with the thong, at least there were no panty lines visible through the tightly stretched pants.  She pulled her long hair back in a ponytail (and was amazed at the size of her biceps in the mirror as she did so), threw on a ball cap and a pair of sunglasses to give her some level of anonymity, and, after another huge breakfast, off she went to the mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison had always been blessed with a good memory for random useless facts.  Julie, Alison's former lab technician was very obese, but she also had huge breasts.  Julie, not being the shy type was always complaining over coffee about how expensive her bras were and how she could only shop at one store for them - Ruth's corsets, at Forest Park Mall, and that's where Alison headed first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuth Goldman was a short, plump, matronly jewish woman and thought of herself as the bra queen of central New Jersey.  She saw all kinds in her shop, from aspiring porn stars with enormous fake tits to the morbidly obese just looking for some support, but she'd never seen a stranger figure walk into her shop than the tall lady in the badly fitting sweat suit.  She was clearly seriously fit judging by the washboard belly she was so proudly displaying, and she had a good sized pair of girls.  Ruth's trained eye could tell the woman wasn't wearing much in the way of support, which was strange because breasts that size usually didn't support themselves too well.  That wasn't the only strange thing, though, the woman's body just looked ... wrong somehow.  The fashion train wreck she was wearing was probably to blame.  Regardless, this was a woman who needed professional help, and Ruth was ready to help her out.  Ugh, she was walking towards the generic rack.  Why did they always walk to the rack first?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning miss, may I help you?\" Ruth said with a strong Jersey accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm just looking, thank you.\"  Alison muttered a little overwhelmed.  Buying bras had always been easy, 36A, off the rack and done.  But now... she didn't even know what size she was.  And there were a bewildering array of choices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I may suggest, ma'am, we recommend that new customers get sized before buying from us.  We find that most women are wearing the wrong size bra.  It's complementary, and we'll keep your dimensions on file even if you don't buy anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHmm, that seemed like a good idea..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, that sounds very good, thank you.\"  responded Alison, clearly relieved to get some help here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, come with me to the fitting room, miss...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Galloway.  Alison Galloway.  Call me Alison.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Ruth, sweety, pleased to meet you.\"  Ruth shook her hand.  Alison's grip was like a rock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now sweety\", began Ruth once they'd entered the fitting room, \"we recommend that you take your top off for the fitting, it allows us to measure you better and get you a better fit.  But if you're uncomfortable, or don't want to take off your clothes we can still measure over top.  It just won't be as good a fit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't mind\", replied Alison, suddenly nervous.  Ruth's magnetism filled the room, but she made Alison comfortable, and reminded her of one of her aunts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuth let out a squeal as Alison pulled her sweatshirt and shirt over her head.  \"Oh.. my .. Gawd! Alison! You're spectacular sweetheart!  Look at you!\"  Alison blushed and lowered her eyes shyly.  \"That's incredible, you're body is absolutely gorgeous!  Look at you!  I would kill for your body!  That's fabulous!\"  She continued gushing.  \"OK before we start, give me a little flex, just show off a bit.  Oh come on Alison, you've worked so hard for that, show it off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuth noticed Alison's red face and caught herself.  \"Oh, I'm sorry honey, I didn't mean to embarrass you.  What a yutz I am, I get so carried away sometimes.  Lets get you measured.  You, my dear, are going to be a challenge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's ok Ruth, I'm just a little shy sometimes.  Here.\"  Alison flexed a bicep and Ruth reached out to touch it slowly, then recoiling her hand quickly as if she'd been shocked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweety, I've seen more topless women than a doctor, and you have the best body, and the best boobs I have ever seen.  That's a gift from God.  Don't you ever be shy about a gift like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison smiled as Ruth began her measurements.  She settled on 42DD, which wasn't an uncommon size at Ruth's.  Of course, most of the women buying 42DDs were fat, not built like Alison.  Alison was stunned at the effect a good bra had at lifting and supporting her new breasts.  She was even more surprised at what one cost!  A bra and a couple pairs of panties set her back over $300!  But looking at her shape in the mirror, even with the ridiculous sweatshirt on, it was worth it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Alison was paying and getting ready to leave Ruth pulled her aside and said, \"Alison, honey.  It's not my place, but you need to do something about the rest of you.  My daughter, Naomi works at a salon in the mall called Tortoise and Hair.  Go, tell her I sent you she'll fit you in, and give you a hair style that will do that amazing body justice.  You deserve this, go treat yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Tortoise and Hair was a high end mall salon filled with stainless steel, bright lights and perfectly groomed staff.  Alison looked down at her bizarre and shabby clothes and stopped.  She couldn't go in there, not looking like this.  She turned around and walked away, but stopped as she heard a voice from behind her call her name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alison?  Are you Alison Galloway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison turned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Naomi, my mother told me to look out for you.  You're in luck, my 11 o'clock appointment canceled. I'll get you started now and work through lunch, so we can get out fixed up.  Come on in, we'll get you started. Come on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaomi looked nothing like her mother, she was tall and fit although she'd clearly inherited her mother's large breasts.  She had piercing dark brown eyes and a thick mane of perfectly styled jet black hair cascading down her shoulders in an avalanche of inky color.  Her hips were hugged by a tight pair of low rise jeans, revealing a section of tanned, flat tummy underneath her tight, pink Dolce and Gabana t-shirt.  She was perfectly made up, manicured and smelled awesome.  Alison hated her, or rather, she was the kind of woman that Alison would have normally hated.  But right now Alison was too busy feeling self-conscious as she followed Naomi into the salon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are going to do so much to you, och, you won't recognize yourself when we're done.\"  Although she was gorgeous, Naomi's voice was pure Fran Drescher.  She guided Alison to the shampoo girl's chair.  Alison was growing annoyed at Naomi's tone.  She'd heard it before, it was the pitying, condescending tone of the pretty girl talking down to the plain girl.  She wanted to shrink down inside herself, but she remembered Ruth's advice to never be shy about her body.  Now was the time to take it.  She was Alison Galloway, PhD, member of the National Academy of Sciences and these ...shampoo girls weren't in her league!  It was time for Alison to out-attitude them.  Before sitting in the shampoo station she pulled her sweatshirt over her head and tossed it to the shampoo girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you take care of that for me please?\" she said with disdain, then sat in the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her sweatshirt off, Alison was only wearing a t-shirt, which was severely overstretched over her shoulders and chest.  Her new bra pushed her new breasts up and out, and the t-shirt barely covered them, and left Alison's whole midriff exposed.  She tensed her arms a little to make the muscles stand out, and watched the amazement in Naomi's face as she sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alison!  My mother said you were in shape, but look at those arms!  those abs!  I would kill for abs like that!  You must do a million crunches.  That's it, I have to go back to the gym!  What's your secret?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaomi gushed like her mother, and Alison found herself relaxing and warming up to her as the shampoo girl worked on her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you know, just .. work hard and eat right\".  Riiight.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oi, I wish I had your dedication.  I always have the muffin top pudge.\"  She pinched half an inch of fat around her midsection.  \"Thank you mom for this\".  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'The hot girl envious of my body... I could get used to this', thought Alison to herself.  She smiled to herself.  The shampooing was done, so she followed Naomi back to her chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girlfriend, your body is out of this world.  That's it, I have to go shopping with you!  But your hair.\"  Naomi pulled up a strand of Alison's hair and let it drop through her fingers with a distasteful look on her face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your hair is a mess.  Ick.  What do you shampoo with, battery acid?  We'll hook you up with some product when you go, don't cheap out on me, you have to use it.  You have to give nutrition to your hair, just like your body, ok?\"  Alison nervously watched as Naomi started cutting off the long hair she'd taken a lifetime to grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaomi sensed Alison's apprehension.  \"Relax, honey.  You have to trust me.  I'll give you great hair, but we're going to have to cut some of it off, to layer it to even it out and to get rid of the bad, ugh.. really bad split ends.  Just sit back and relax and trust Naomi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next couple of hours Alison got her hair cut, a manicure, makeup, the works.  To Alison's surprise she bonded with Naomi as she was working on her.  Despite being a plastic made-up beauty, the kind of woman Alison hated, you couldn't help but like Naomi.  And she had her own problems in life, a boyfriend who neglected her (but was a superb lover, as Alison learned in great detail), and deep uncertainty about how long she was going to be able to live the salon life.  As they talked Alison began to realize she was just as shallow, in her own way, as anyone else, judging Naomi by her clothes and hair before she got to know the real person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Naomi was done, Alison could barely believe her eyes, which now popped, green emeralds shining out of her face.  Her hair, despite Alison's certainty that Naomi was chopping it ALL off when she was in her chair, looked longer and fuller than before, and her new highlights shimmered in the salon's lights.  She was gorgeous.  She ran her hand with it's newly manicured nails through her mane, and marvelled at it's lustre, which was enough to distract her from the baseball sized bicep which popped on her arm.  Alison felt surprisingly emotional as she stared at her reflection.  She could have had this years ago.  What had she been thinking?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite a difference, isn't it?\", Naomi beamed, as she watched the tears well up in Alison's eyes.  She handed her a tissue.  \"This, this here is why I'm 28 and still working at this place.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison hopped up out of the chair and grabbed Naomi in a big hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy!  Oof, I think you broke my spine!\"  joked Naomi.  The girl did have a grip on her, but with muscles like that, it was no surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, Alison, you have the hair done, we should take the next step.\" said Naomi, looking over Alison's clothes with a frown.  \"I need to get some lunch, but after that I don't have another booking until 3pm, I'll take some time off and take you around.  You brought a credit card, right?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Since Naomi didn't want to lose any time from their shopping trip, lunch was the mall food court.  Naomi had a small salad.  Alison had a five course Chinese takeout meal, 4 slices of pizza and two high protein jamba juice smoothies.  Naomi watched her eat it all with a horrified look on her face, but managed to not comment on her friends appetite.  Not everyone was so polite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe food court was pretty crowded at lunch time, and Alison and Naomi got a lot of stares.  Naomi was used to it, but it was still a pretty new experience for Alison.  One couple at the next table in particular were pretty rude.  They were a thirtyish man and a woman out for lunch.  He was a slightly oafish guy in a Laker's jersey and a pair of loose fitting sport shorts, she was probably the pretty girl in high school, fifteen years and 50 pounds ago.  He couldn't stop looking over at Alison.  She couldn't stop commenting about her in a voice that was just a little bit too loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop looking at her, Carlos  ... How can she do that to herself, it's disgusting!  She looks like a man.  Look at her arms, they're bigger than yours.  Stop looking at her!  And look what she's eating!  Oh, I could never do that to myself...\" over and over.  Alison barely noticed, but Naomi was getting pissed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the two ladies got up from their meal and had cleared off their table, Naomi led Alison past the couple on their way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me,\" Alison's heart jumped as Naomi called over to the rude couple.  She pulled Alison along to their table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My friend and I need an opinion on something, I wonder if you two can help us out?\" she asked, and then continued, not waiting for a reply.  \"My friend has been working out a lot lately, and I think she looks spec-tac-u-lar, but she's worried it's too much.  You two are obviously a pair of fit and stylish people, what do you think?\"  Alison played along and hesitantly flexed a bicep.  Carlos' eyes went wide as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what do you think?\"  At this point the woman had shrunk down into her chair and was staring at the table.  Carlos managed to stammer out something that sounded like \"it's great.. looks great\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure, Carlos\", Naomi persisted.  \"Why don't you stand up and get a closer look?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that's ok, I can see fine from here, it looks great.\" Carlos said, obviously distressed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, come on, don't be shy Carlos\", Naomi grabbed his arm and began to pull him out of the food court seat.  Meanwhile his wife shot him a 'stand up and they'll go away' look.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, Carlos stood.  His loose fitting shorts did little to conceal his erection, showing just how much he approved of Alison's look.  Naomi smiled while smoke began to rise out of his wife's ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See honey, I told you you didn't need to worry.\"  Alison was starting to enjoy Naomi's revenge and get into the whole thing.  She reached over and embraced Carlos, effortlessly lifting him off the ground in a smothering bear hug, trying to ignore the object poking into her thigh.  Meanwhile his wife continued to look on furiously.  As they hugged Alison was a little ashamed to admit it, but it was really turning her on.    </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>By the time Alison got back to her apartment it was well after 3.  She felt the warm sun of this gorgeous May day on her face as she hefted all her parcels into her apartment.  She'd managed to keep Naomi fairly reigned in, after all, she was probably going to grow out of her new clothes in a short while, but still, with the spa and the clothes she was about a thousand dollars poorer than she had been this morning.  She had a lot of money saved away, and was expecting a generous severance package from Sementex, but still, without a job those savings weren't goign to last forever.  She had stopped off at an all you can eat buffet on the way home, since she felt like she had to control how much she ate at the food court with Naomi around, so she was still fairly full, and had a couple of hours to kill before she was supposed to meet Holly at the gym.  She didn't really know what to do with herself.  Alison had been an obsessive worker since her graduate student days, not having to go to work was hard to get used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike most scientists, Alison had a huge backlog of papers she'd been meaning to read someday, now seemed like a good time.   She thought about what Naomi said as she left her earlier that afternoon.  'Now you just need a tan.'  It was a beautiful day, and she did have this lovely bikini Naomi had made her buy, why not? She pulled off her clothes, rumaged through the shopping bags for her new bikini, pulled it on and walked to the bathroom to check herself in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn.  She had to admit, she was pretty incredible.  She was solidly in bodybuilder territory, but her new musculature fit her frame well.  She wondered how strong she was now, as she flexed a bicep and admired it's size and shape.  Ray might not be so cocky if she was arm wrestling him today!  Damn, Holly was going to be shocked to see how much bigger she'd gotted in just over a day.  She'd have to make up some excuse for the girl when they met to workout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison had never been one to spend much time in the sun before, so she was, to quote Naomi, \"fishbelly white\", so sunscreen was going to be a necessity.  As she rubbed the SPF 30 onto her skin she marveled at the feel of her new body.  The muscles were firm and toned, but they moved as she massaged them.  Unless she flexed.  Then they instantly transformed into warm marble.  It was amazing how hard they got.  She realized that she was enjoying this self-rubdown a lot more than she expected to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunscreen applied - except to her back.  That wasn't going to happen with the changes.  Alison used to be able to reach almost any spot on her back, with her long, thin arms, but with all the added musculature, this wasn't going to be the case anymore.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe there will be someone at the pool to help me out\", she cringed, picturing herself playing a part in such an old cliche.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo such luck when she got to the pool though.  She was the only one there.  Ah well, just have to lie on my back to read, not a problem.  She plopped down a stack of papers beside a lounge chair, thanked God that it wasn't a windy day and lost herself in her reading.  Alison was always a harsh critic of science, soon she was marveling at how many morons were able to get published in prestigious journals these days.  She was lost in her own thoughts and didn't notice Greg, the guy from the gym last night walk past the pool three times while he worked up the courage to talk to her, before he retreated in silent shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also couldn't have noticed the sound of a camera shutter coming from a van in a nearby parking lot as it took picture after picture of her.</span></div></div>",

Sandra was gyrating wildly on top of him, he was inside her, lost in the moment of anticipation.  Her blonde hair cascaded over her shoulders and contrasted with the black bra that clung to her perfect breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandra, on the other hand, heard it clearly.  It was time to end this little love session, there was work to do.  She reached down to support herself better on his thigh, and started rubbing her clit against his pelvic bone, and clamped down to increase the pressure on his member.  She bit her lip as a few well rehearsed gasps and moans escaped her lips.  In a matter of seconds Mike was over the edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rolled off of her boss, who soon got up and retreated to his private bathroom to clean himself off.  While he did, Sandra quickly jumped up, grabbed her memory stick and downloaded his email, and anything else he'd been doing off of her boss' computer.  It didn't take long, and she had the memory stick hidden away again before Mike was done and she was able to clean herself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was done and came out, Mike was at his computer, reading his email and chuckling to himself.  Although she had a copy of all of it on her memory stick, Sandra came up behind Mike, kissed his neck and looked over his shoulder at the pictures he was viewing.  A muscular blonde, who looked oddly familiar, sitting beside a pool.  She didn't have to ask him what they were about, Mike was never the quiet, secretive type.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe the idiot tested it on herself\", he mumbled, to no one in particular.  \"We are going to sue the pants off of her.  Look at her, she's turning into a freak!  God, but could you imagine if this stuff worked on men?  Talk about your blockbuster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Although...\" Mike paused, paying particular attention to a picture of Alison bending over to pick up one of her papers, her breasts dangling ponderously below her, barely concealed by her blue bathing suit.  \"Those aren't muscle...and she definitely didn't have them two days ago.  I wonder if this stuff might have some commercial viability after all?  Sandra, remind me to talk to Dr. Galloway's assistant, what's his name... on Monday about this.  If we can strip the muscle crap out of this drug, but keep the tit growth...\"  His voice trailed off, visions of dollar signs dancing through his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will, Dr. Sullivan\", Sandy replied professionally, as she buttoned her blouse and left her Mike's office.  Five minutes later she was sending all the new information she'd stolen off of her boss' computer, including Alison's pictures, to her real bosses.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Although Alison had bought a lot of clothes earlier that day, Naomi wasn't really interested in shopping for workout gear, so Alison wasn't much better prepared for her trip to the gym to meet Holly than she was to go out to the mall.  She had managed to pick up a few t-shirts, but they were strictly, going out t-shirts, as opposed to working out t-shirts.  She had managed to find a pair of spandex shorts that fit her, though, and those, along with her new sports bra, and the over-stretched sweatshirt to cover it all up made up her workout attire.  She had no idea how she was going to explain her recent growth to Holly.  Just rely on the facts, she thought.  She was clearly big and muscular, and if Holly didn't notice that yesterday, well she must not be very observant.  Riiight.  But what else could she do?  With some apprehension, she headed out to the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly was late, so Alison waited for her in the lobby, since she'd have to sign her in.  At the staff desk, an short, overly thin woman with enormous (fake) breasts was flirting with a customer.  To say the man was huge would be an understatement.  Marcus Englund was three time New Jersey State bodybuilding champion (heavyweight and overall), and he was a celebrity at the gym, and acted as if he owned the place.  He was the biggest and strongest guy at the gym, and he made sure everyone knew it.  He was tall, 6'2\", and in his offseason, like he was now, tipped the scales well north of 300 pounds, and enough testosterone (most of it synthetic) coursed through his veins to power an entire high school football team.  He was the alpha males alpha male, and this gym was his lair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the desk clerk went on with her story, Marcus' mind wandered.  She wanted to fuck him, he knew she wanted to fuck him, why did he have to listen to her crap?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Just wait here honey until my workout's done, then I'll take you back to my place, and rock your world.', he thought to himself.  'When we're done, if you're any good, maybe I'll drive you back to your car.  Blah, blah, blah... oh my God shut up!  I can't believe she's still going on about her stupid mother.  Maybe she won't get lucky tonight, after all.  She's not really my type anyways, too skinny.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus had always been partial to the thicker, curvier look, rather than the 'boys with breasts' look that some men liked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Nice tits though', he reconsidered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus wasn't the only one getting annoyed by the chatty receptionist (although he was the only one admiring her breasts).  Alison had stepped up to the counter, eager to get a headstart on the inevitable paperwork she'd have to do to get Holly signed in as a guest to the gym.  She was trying to get the receptionist's attention away from Marcus, but to no avail.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus, on the other hand, didn't take long to notice the new amazon at the counter.  She was dressed a bit oddly, but it was clear from the bulges in her sweater that the new girl had a hell of a body.  And her legs, damn!  Long and hard and covered with shapely muscle.  She must compete, he thought to himself, strange I don't know her.  Well, that's going to have to change, he thought to himself, the receptionist and her boring story long forgotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, Diane\", Marcus interrupted, hoping he remembered the receptionist's name correctly.  \"This lady here looks like she needs to speak with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe receptionist (who's name was Danielle) turned to Alison with a cold look, unhappy to be upstaged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\"  Her voice was less friendly than her stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A friend of mine will be meeting me here tonight to workout with me, but they're not a member.  What do I have to do to sign them in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanielle grabbed a form from under the counter, and slid it over to Alison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fill this out, and it'll be ten dollars.\"  They usually waived the fee, but she was in no mood.  She turned back to Marcus, but ended up staring straight at his massive shoulder.  He'd turned to speak with Alison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be new here ...\", he paused, waiting for the stranger to offer a name.  It took her a while to catch on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alison\", she added, eventually.  \"I'm not really new.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to meet you, Alison.\"  He held out a hand, she took it.  Nice firm grip, for a woman.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Marcus, I thought I knew all the serious lifters around here, but somehow I missed you.  Oh well, time to fix that.  We'll go get some coffee after we're done working out.\"  A statement, not a question.  Marcus never ASKED anyone out in his life.  Meanwhile, steam was rising from Danielle's ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison stopped writing for a second and looked up at Marcus.  She of course recognized him, everyone at the gym knew who Marcus was.  He'd clearly never given her a second look before tonight.  Part of her was offended by this, but the arousal she was getting from his confidence, not to mention his incredible body, completely overwhelmed that.  She felt herself smile, but she also felt her new self-confidence prod her.  She didn't know what the old Alison would say in a situation like this, since she'd never been in a situation like this before, but she was pretty sure it wasn't what came out of her mouth next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you really want to get to know me, why not dinner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Marcus' turn to smile.  This was going to be good.  Still, never let the woman have the last word, always escalate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll be a little late for that when I'm done working out, but tell you what.  I'll make you supper at my place tomorrow night, say 6 o'clock.\"  She'd never agree to it, dinner at a strange man's place before they'd even met.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds great\", Alison replied, without hesitation.  \"Make a lot of food, I'm a growing girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Alison was setting up her plans with Marcus, Holly finally arrived.  She hated being late, but she'd have been mortified if that Alison lady saw the state she was in before she applied her makeup.  'Come on Holly, hold it together' she thought to herself as she walked in the door.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked around the lobby quickly.  Crap.  Alison wasn't there, she probably got fed up and left already.  There were just the receptionist and two big bodybuilder types chatting at the desk.  The guy was enormous, like a mountain, and GORGEOUS.  The woman he was talking to was a lot smaller, but still, judging by her legs and butt, extremely muscular, and damn sexy.  'God, would my life be different if I had a body like hers', thought Holly to herself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman bodybuilder had her back turned towards Holly, but as the young waitress walked up to the counter she noticed that she looked oddly familiar.  As she got closer, wait... no way, it couldn't be.  But it was.  This was the girl from the restaurant yesterday.  Only she was about twice her size (and had a much better haircut) but it was definitely her.  What the hell was going on here?  Despite her shock, Holly kept her surprise hidden as she walked up and reintroduced herself to Alison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, and to Alison's relief, Holly didn't comment on Alison's incredible growth.  The paperwork completed, the two ladies entered the locker room.  Something struck Alison as strange about Holly's appearance, and her bearing.  She was definitely walking with a limp, though she was trying to mask it.  Plus she had clearly caked on a huge amount of makeup, not really what you'd expect of someone going for a workout.  'Probably hoping to pick up a guy at the gym', thought Alison to herself, aware of the irony given that she'd just done exactly that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next hour Alison took Holly through a basic workout.  She didn't do any lifting herself, concentrating on the younger girl, but she was clearly significantly stronger than she had been the day before.  The weights that she hadn't been able to lift two days ago, and that had felt heavy yesterday, now felt more like styrofoam.  Well, maybe not styrofoam, more like aluminum.  She watched Holly struggle, and eventually succeed in lifting a 45 pound plate onto the leg press machine, amazed in the fact that 48 hours ago she wouldn't even have been able to do that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her former frailty, Alison wasn't a stranger to the inside of a gym, and she was able to set Holly up with a solid, basic weight training routine that would certainly help the young girl tone up.  It hurt her a little when the young girl would repeatedly ask how long she'd have to workout before she could be like Alison (answer: never, not without some pharmaceutical help).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she'd taught Holly correct form on eight exercises, she sent her off to find a pair of treadmills for some cardio before they ended up her workout.  She'd join her in a few minutes, but being in the gym, Alison couldn't resist a chance to test her strength again.  Marcus had been deadlifting in the corner of the gym earlier, and she'd been watching him as Holly went through her paces.  She idly wondered if he grunted as loudly in bed as he did while he worked out.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, she'd watched him work his way up to a final set of 6 heavy deadlifts, before he wandered off to a different part of the gym.  Of course he left the heavily weighted barbell sitting on the ground, where some poor gym employee would have to unload it later.  She walked over to the barbell, thinking about how this was really stupid what she was going to try.  Attempting a deadlift that is too heavy is a good way to really hurt yourself.  But she couldn't resist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Five 45 pound plates on each side, another 35 pound plate on each side.. plus 45 pounds for the bar.. five hundred and sixty five pounds.  This was stupid.  But here goes... she took a deep breath, tightened her core and imagined pushing the world away with her legs, instead of lifting the bar, like the books taught.  Her whole body tensed, muscles bulged out everywhere, traps, thighs, back as she slowly increased the pressure on the bar.  And slowly the weight went up.  It felt strange, wobbly, until she realized that was because the weights were bouncing up and down on the end of the surprisingly elastic bar.  She lowered the colossal weight slowly and under control and backed away, amazed at what she'd just done.  Five hundred sixty five pounds, and it wasn't that hard!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was still stunned by her tremendous strength as she joined Holly on the treadmills for 20 minutes of hard cardio.  She pushed herself hard, and she was happy to note that Holly was trying her best to do so as well.  Holly had no hope of keeping up, of course, but she was giving it her all anyways, gasping for breath, the sweat pouring off of her, soaking through her workout clothes.  Her thick layer of baby fat giggled relentlessly, and Alison was grateful that Holly was wearing a good sports bra.  The bouncing in the young waitress' large breasts looked painful enough as it was.  Until her own recent growth the thought that bouncing breasts might hurt had never occurred to Alison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes in and Alison was dying from the heat, her sweatshirt soaked through.  She didn't stop to think that it was playing an important role keeping her changes hidden from Holly as she pulled it off and tossed it behind her treadmill.  It wasn't until she heard Holly's barely audible gasp that she realized her mistake.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one could fault Holly for losing it as she saw what Alison was hiding under her sweat shirt.  She tried not to stare as she noticed exactly how massively muscular Alison's body, now only covered by a sport's bra and a pair of stretch shorts, had become.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo late to worry about her mistake now, Alison turned up her treadmill to 14 miles an hour, the top speed of the machine, and maxxed out the incline as well.  She hoped the burning in her legs and lungs would help her avoid thinking about the fact that she was likely was going to have to think up a way to explain what happened to her.  But Holly was busy thinking up her own explanation, as she felt the sweat pouring from her brow washing the makeup from her face.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Alison hadn't planned on getting sweaty at the gym, so she neglected to bring a change of clothes or stuff to shower with.  She wasn't too surprised when Holly also decided to forgo showering, despite being soaked through with sweat.  By this time the makeup that the younger woman had so carefully applied to her face had pretty much run off, and the bruises she'd been trying to hide were pretty apparent.  She'd put on a ball cap and sunglasses, but it was too late, Alison had seen what she was hiding.  Alison didn't want to pry, but she couldn't just let Holly go back to what she assumed was abuse at the hands of her boyfriend.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, Holly.\", Alison started, nervously as they walked through the parking lot.  \"It's not really any of my business, but if you want to talk about, you know.\" she pointed up at her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly started to speak, ready to launch into a joking explanation for her black eye, but as she did, something just snapped inside her.  Her shoulders slumped down like a deflating balloon, her resolve broke and she started to cry.  Alison reached out to comfort her.  She cried for a few minutes before regaining her composure enough to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was Ray.\", she started, answering Alison's unspoken question.  \"We hooked up not long after I started working at his restaurant, and I've lived with him for a few months now.  He's always had a temper, but this is the first time he's hit me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" Alison inquired, dreading that it was somehow connected to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was the night after you were in the restaurant.  Even though he beat you, he was just pissed about something.  I didn't realize at the time just how mad he was, so I kept winding him up, being the tease that I always am.  I started teasing him about how he almost got beat by a girl, and it was driving him nuts.  Then I told him how I was going to meet you to train and soon I'd be as strong as you, he sort of flipped out.  Next thing I know, I'm on the ground, and I can't see out of my left eye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was kind of shocked that he'd hit me, neither one of us knew how to deal with it.  He just stormed off into the night.  While he was gone I packed up some of my stuff and took off.  I don't know where I thought I was going to go, I slept in my car last night.  I don't have any close friends I could stay with near here, and my family, well I burned those bridges a while back.  I can't afford a hotel, I don't even know if I still have a job..\"  Holly's voice trailed off into sobs again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holly, we need to go to the police about this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't.  You don't understand, but I just can't.  When I said I burned my bridges, well.. I came here to get away from my old life.  I have to keep a low profile, or else it'll catch up with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison didn't press any further.  The girl was in trouble, she wasn't sure why, but she was clearly trying to make a new life for herself.  Her heart went out to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come stay with me tonight, we can work all this out.  I have a lot of extra room, and I live alone.  We can work out what to do about this together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly's sobbing rose up again, she was touched at the generousity of this kind stranger.   After a few half-hearted protests that she couldn't impose, she relented and followed Alison back to her place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got there, Alison effortlessly carried Holly's four bags inside, and started to cook supper for both of them.  She added an extra chicken breast to the dozen she was going to make for herself and started stir frying in batches in her wok.  As she cooked, the two women talked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to go back to Ray's place and get the rest of your stuff,\" Alison said.  \"You shouldn't leave it there.\"  She was hoping that by minimizing Holly's ties she'd also minimize the chance that she'd move back there.  If Ray hit her once, he'd probably do it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't go back there now.  What if he's there?\"  Holly was clearly still frightened of Ray.  \"You never really know when he's going to be at the restaurant, he could come home at any time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go with you, he won't be able to hurt me.\"  Alison thought about her recent lift at the gym.  She was probably as strong as two Rays now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alison, you might be really strong for a woman with those magic muscles, but Ray's bigger and a lot meaner.  He'd hurt us.\"  Holly continued, changing the subject.  \"And speaking of them, what happened to you in the last two days?  You were skinny when you walked into the restaurant, now you're built like a brick shithouse.  How can you get so big and strong so fast?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question Alison was dreading seemed a lot less important now, but she still tried to dodge it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just covered up at the restaurant.\" she lied, unconvincingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, don't bullshit me, not now.  You've put on like 50 pounds in 2 days, all muscle.  I want to know your secret.  I want to do the same thing.  If I was as strong as you Ray would think twice, I could go back and everything would get back on track.  So come on, level with me, ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was against Alison's better judgement, but she just couldn't keep lying to Holly, not after what she'd been through.  So she told her all about the experimental treatment she was testing on herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is so cool!  Oh my God!  You have to give me som..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!  No fucking way!\"  Alison surprised herself with the forcefullness of her rejection.  \"No way, no chance.  This stuff haven't been tested on humans before me.  I still don't know what long term effects it will have.  I should NEVER have tried it on myself, that was perhaps the least ethical decision I've ever made.  I'm not going to make it worse by testing it on someone else!  Certainly not without a proper clinical trial and direct physician supervision.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a load.  Look at what that stuff has done for you.  You're a goddess!  Don't tell me you regret trying it on yourself.  I just want a piece of that, how can you turn me down after what I've been through?\"  Holly was getting angry.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holly, look.  I do regret it in some ways.  You're right, the changes have been incredible, I've never dreamed I could be like this.  Being this strong, this powerful is an amazing feeling.  But I still don't know what's coming.  A lot of the animals we'd tested this stuff on originally died after a few weeks.  Their systems couldn't handle the strain.  I can't subject you to that kind of risk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, I guess I understand.\"  Alison was a little surprised at how easily Holly backed down.  All the fight was knocked out of her a few nights back.  She was concerned, though, now that Holly was in the house, along with five more doses of the drug.  It had to be injected into a vein, so she didn't have to worry about Holly doing that, the girl clearly wasn't a nurse, but still.  She might try to take it and hurt herself.  After supper she showed Holly the bathroom so she could shower.  While she was showering, Alison took the formula, the inhibitor and her notes and locked them away securely in her office desk.  That would keep Holly out.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison wasn't the first person to underestimate Holly Armstrong.  At about 3 that morning, while Alison slept soundly, Holly crept out of the guest bedroom.  She walked slowly and silently to the office where she watched Alison go while pretending to be in the shower.  The desk was an old antique, the lock was pretty simple to force for someone with a bit of experience.  She slid the drawer open carefully, revealing two banks of syringes.  She pulled a short length of rubber exercise tubing that she'd picked up earlier out of her pocket, wrapped it around her arm and with the expertise of a former heroin addict shot herself full of Alison's drug.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made it halfway back to her room before the pain hit, doubling her over.  Thankfully, she passed out soon after that.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Alison groggily rolled out of bed at about 4:30. Getting up to eat in the middle of the night was starting to become a habit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison soon froze when she noticed light and noise coming from the kitchen. She quietly pulled on her new bathrobe and peered around the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only light in the kitchen came from the fridge, which hung open, completely empty. The counter was strewn with empty packages; and in the center of it all was Holly, greedily stuffing her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhf, yurr upf,\u201d Holly said sheepishly, with her mouth still stuffed with food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHolly? What\u2019re you doing up at this... Wait a minute...!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison ran to her desk and saw that the lock had been forced open and one of the vials was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did you get into my desk? How did you even know how to do the injection?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly hung her head like a kid caught with her hand in the cookie jar. \u201cLet\u2019s just say I picked up a few skills in my younger days.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison could feel her rage building at the thought Holly betraying her. \u201cYou\u2019re taking the inhibitor compound right now!\u201d Alison bellowed as she slammed her fist onto the counter with enough force to rattle the plates in the cupboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly didn\u2019t seem intimidated by the angry amazon literally twice her size yelling at her and making demands. Her anger rose to meet Alison\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! You saw what Ray did to my face. You have no idea how hurt and scared I was. I never want to feel like that as long as I live. And then here you come with a magic potion that could solve my problem. How could I not take it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison soon calmed herself down. Holly did have a point. And besides, given the formula\u2019s side effect of increased aggression, she didn\u2019t want to chance an actual fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, but you have to let me monitor your progress; both for my research and for your own safety.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly breathed a sigh of relief as Alison grabbed her laptop and started filling out a new subject file.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, now take your clothes off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly\u2019s eyes widened in shock. \u201cWhat?! Why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison was already in clinical scientist mode as she continued typing. \u201cI need to record your height, weight and bodyfat for your profile, and also I need to take some photos. Don\u2019t worry, you can keep your underwear on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGee, thanks,\u201d Holly said sarcastically. She was a bit embarrassed disrobing in front of others, especially in front of someone with a body like Alison\u2019s. She was suddenly a bit more self conscious of her slight muffin top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStand up straight so I can get a correct measurement,\u201d Alison hounded while trying to measure Holly\u2019s height. It took some additional prodding to get Holly to show Alison her weight and body fat percentage, not to mention having her picture taken in her underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI at least wish I could\u2019ve gotten gotten proper baseline measurements first, but judging by the food you ate, I\u2019d say you\u2019ve already added about 5 pounds,\u201d Alison said while scribbling down notes. \u201cAnd it looks like your black eye is gone too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d Holly said looking in the mirror. Alison began Holly\u2019s profile:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">\"Subject 002 female 5'5\" tall, weight approx. 145 pounds, body fat 24%. Subject took compound coded 0098847 at approximately 0300, Saturday, May 19, 2007. Subject appears to exhibit similar food consumption patterns as Subject 001, and has already consumed approximately 7000 kcals with 400 grams of protein. Elevated propensity for anger also seems consistent with previous subject. Accelerated healing factor may also be evident.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd, what size bra do you wear?\u201d Alison asked matter-of-factly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUm... I wear a 38D. Why?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow this formula affects breast tissue and body fat is an unforeseen side effect. I\u2019d like to monitor things more closely with you, seeing as you actually have some to begin with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly shot her a dirty look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh... breasts, I mean,\u201d Alison said, hiding her face behind the laptop screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd finally, how are you feeling... uh... sexually?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly\u2019s face turned bright red. \u201cWhat? Is that a side effect too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt appears so. I\u2019ve definitely noticed I\u2019ve been more... distracted than usual over the past three days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly thought about it for a second. \u201cWell, I guess; maybe a little.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison entered the data into her file.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay... all done. And I guess I\u2019d better update my own stats as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison went and slipped on her bra for modesty\u2019s sake before doffing her robe in front of Holly. She noted her own readings on the scale before posing for Holly to take her photo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow! You\u2019re even more ripped than you were yesterday,\u201d Holly gushed. \u201cAnd look at your legs! They look bigger than my waist. And your shoulders look like they belong on a NBA player. And your boobs! They\u2019re like...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust take the picture!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly snapped the photo, but stopped Alison before she could reach for her robe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCould you do one more where you, like... flex your arm?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Alison was starting to get embarrassed, but she obliged. Striking the most confident pose she could muster, she placed her left hand on her hip and flex her right arm as hard as she could, conjuring up a bicep bigger than a baseball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly cow!\u201d Holly beamed. \u201cMy brother was always bragging about his \u201818 inch guns,\u2019 and you have to be at least as big as him. I bet you wouldn\u2019t have any trouble putting Ray in his place now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison threw on her robe before Holly could make any more requests and started typing up her own report:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">Saturday, May 19, 2007, 0430 - 6'0\" 208 pounds, 10% bf. Excessive hunger and food consumption continues, with approximately 23000 kcals with 1200 g protein consumed since previous entry. Subject has gained approximately 25 pounds since last report, and almost 100 pounds overall. Skeletal muscle and mammary tissue continue to increase while overall body fat decreases. Muscular strength and endurance gains continue to exceed corresponding increase in muscle mass.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison could tell Holly was getting antsy as she was taking her time typing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere. All done.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly\u2019s excitement was palpable. She was like a puppy anticipating going for a walk. \u201cWell, now that all your paperwork is in order, we should go back to that gym! I already feel like I could lift a lot more than I did yesterday.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHolly, I \u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, this stuff need food to work, right? I still have the keys to the Ranch House, and I know how to run the grill. We could go make up for all that money you spent there and free that bastard of some of his precious steaks. What\u2019d ya say?\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Well...\" Alison responded, half to herself, \"If we are going to get a proper measurement of how this procedure develops, we should do daily testing and monitoring.  OK.  Let's go back to the gym to see how you've progressed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gym was a 24 hour place, but deserted at 5 am.  The crowds didn't start to show up until 6.  The room was cold, and both women wore bulky sweats that covered up their bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, we don't want to tax you too much today, Holly.  Your workout was last night, this is just for testing your progress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey started at the leg press machine, but even before Holly sat down, it was clear that she was a lot stronger than she had been the night before.  She carried the 45 pound plates that she struggled with the night before one in each hand, and swung them smoothly and with control.  Alison was impressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe workout went quickly, and Holly's strength had increased, impressively.  Holly was leg-pressing 500 pounds and benching nearly 150, for 8 reps. Even with those impressive gains, she wasn't gaining as quickly as Alison had the first day.  The scientist in her couldn't help but wonder why.  Was the forumala less efficient because Holly was younger?  Heavier to start with?  Or were they other hidden variables?  She'd have to do some research.  But first the two women hit the showers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was clear in the shower that Holly was putting on muscle.  Her shoulders were broader, her legs and arms thicker, and her breasts rode higher.  Oddly she didn't seem to be losing a lot of body-fat, though it seemed to be redistributing itself to her breasts and hips, and away from her belly. Aside from her own breasts, Alison had gained little fat during her growth, and maintained a very defined, even ripped physique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, it looked good on her, better than good, and Alison felt herself grow a little flushed when Holly lifted an arm to wash under it, propping her wet, glistening breasts up and shaking them as she lathered the soap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison quickly looked away, embarrassed, as Holly noticed her studying her body.  The younger woman smiled and moved closer to Alison, as Alison froze, terrified.  She stepped behind her and began to lather Alison's broad, rippling back.  Alison felt her skin explode into a million goose bumps as Holly caressed her.  She was frozen in terror; this was a public shower!  She could hear other early morning gym-goers in the locker room!  They could walk in at any moment!  But she couldn't ask Holly to stop.  Not yet.  It felt so good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly moved in a little closer and Alison could feel the other woman's large, slippery breasts gently brush against her back as she continued to soap her up. Her hands slid down her lower back and around Alison's waist towards the front, where she lightly brushed the soap up against Alison's hips and down her inner thigh.  As she did, two other women entered the showers.  That was enough to snap Alison out of her trance, she jumped and grabbed Holly's hand, carefully pulling it off of her body.  Holly looked at her and smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thought you could use the help on those wings you call a back.  I don't think you can reach back there yourself.\"  The younger girl smiled and winked, \"Maybe tomorrow you'll have to do mine too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo underscore the point, Holly reached both hands behind her and soaped up her own back, forcing her breasts up and out while she did.  Her eyes never left Alison as she slowly and sensually soaped up first her back and then the rest of her body.  She reached to turn the water to icy cold before stepping back under it and drenching herself before walking over to Alison and whispering in her ear, \"And yeah, to answer your question from earlier, definitely a heightened sex drive.  Good Lord, yes.\"  Alison felt a sharp pain in her ear lobe as Holly bit her before walking slowly, hips swaying, into the locker room.  She turned her own stream of water to cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey changed quickly and in silence.  Once in the parking lot, the women decided where they would go next.  Before they could decide, Alison's cell rang out.  It was her former lab assistant, Craig.  He needed to see her right away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Alison talked on the phone, Holly thought about where she would go.  She needed to get her last paycheck and things from the restaurant.  As early as it was; it was still before 8 am, no one would be around, she could let herself in quietly, get her stuff and leave.  She might even have time to cook herself a few steaks.  Holly had been eating a lot since getting dosed with Alison's compound, but she it was mostly carb laden junk food.  She was craving protein.  A lot of protein.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Allison got in to her car but just barely. She moved the driver seat all the way to the back and was cussing under her breathe the whole way. She made a mental note to buy a new vehicle either a jeep or truck. Then she laughed to herself and thought maybe a Harley. Either way she knew her little 2 door car was driving had to go. \"Fuck she thought more expenses without a source of income to pay for it all.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe eventually met Craig at an old parking lot. Her new bra was really digging in to her and her clothes were tight. She knew she was getting bigger. 4 minutes later Craig arrived. As he got off his street bike he ran up to his former boss and said \"Dam it must of worked.\" Craig had guessed his former boss must have gained well over 100 LBS of muscle and 7 inches in height. He hugged her and she hugged him back. He could feel her newfound strength in her powerful embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the short hug was done he came straight to business. \"Allison you need to burn all the evidence you have of our project.\" Allison was blindsided and asked in a stunned tone \"Why?\" Craig explainex how he overheard Sullivan and other members of the board explaining how they planned to sue her and press criminal charges. Allison was enraged. First these assholes did not even want to fund her research anymore and now they wanted her in prison. That was bullshit as far as Allison was concerned. She then in a pissed off tone asked Craig \"Why now why all of a sudden do they want my research back? I mean ours?\" Craig handed her an envolope with photos of Allison by the pool in her bikini. \"They believe they can isolate the research and get the natural boob job you have.\" Craig did have to admit that Allison had gained a rack recently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison was still panicked. There was enough evidence showing her as the lead research scientist. \"I have to go back to the lab\" she bluntly told Craig. Craig smiled and pulled out military grade server wipe disk and smiled. \"I got your back boss \" Allison hugged him and then kissed him. Thank you she said but I need to get rid of some stuff. They hugged again and both departed. Allison smiled. Karma she thought to herself.</span></div></div>",

No she had to correct herself she was larger as she flexed a massive 16.5 inch bicep with her right arm and cupped her left breast with her left hand. In more ways than 1 she laughed. With that she went up to her apartment and got out of her clothes. Allison went to her room to put on something else but she saw her bikini sitting on her sofa and thought \"What the hell,\" as she slipped it on. As she admired herself in mirror the reflection made it clear she had put on a few pounds of muscle in the last few days. With that Allison made a mental note to not make any more massive clothes purchases until her drugs had run their course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Allison grabbed her computer and wiped the hard drive after backing up every file not relating to her prized research. She then gathered every document she had on her research and shredded it. With the documents shredded she then flushed them down the toilet. In about an hour every last bit of evidence that her research existed had been erased. To be sure Allison performed another data wipe on her computer as she looked for any remaining evidence of her project. Then she recalled the safe right aw Holly walked in covered in sweat wearing a pair of Allison's workout clothes. In other words just a pair of shorts and a sports bra. Allison looked over Holly twice and could tell that in the past 24 hours she had made gains most people could only make in several years. Allison told Holly about what had happened. Holly said \"Well this Craig guy he deleted all the evidence at your old job right?\" Allison said \"He told me he did and I trust him.\" Holly then said \"You got rid of all the evidence here right?\" With that Allison stood up and said \"Follow me\" as both women headed to the safe. As Allison opened the safe sitting there on the top shelf was 2 more vials of the drug. Allison grabbed them and brought them to eye level and then said \"Here is all that remains.\" Both women Allison in a bikini that was kind of small and Holly in sweat soaked workout shorts and a sports bra looked at the 2 vials and each other and came to the same conclusion. </span></div></div>",

Sandra held it up to the light in her hand, the vial shone in the light, the green liquid glowing against her skin, she locked eyes with Hannah as she undid the cap, licking her lips in anticipation,<br>\r\n\"W-Wait what are you doing? Don't we need to do tests or something?\" Hannah said, concerned,<br>\r\n\"Fuck that, i want power and i want it now, i will test it personally!\" She said back,<br>\r\nAnd with that she downed the liquid, she could feel the liquid power course through her entire body within seconds, she began to do poses, over and over until she and Hannah saw her biceps grow, she smiled and flexed harder, watching as her muscles grew bigger, soon she was doing whole body flexes, her boobs and ass' fat being replaced with pure muscle, big spherical mounds of hard flesh on her chest that defied gravity, she let out a long and loud moan as finally, the bit she had bee wanting and waiting for began, her height growth, touching 7 feet in under a minute her growth began to speed up, she felt the warmth grow around her groin, prompting her to satisfy herself, but she held back, letting her body expand and grow to its fullest, letting her tits surge outwards, more muscle adding to their already obscene size, within a few minutes she was pushing 10 feet with ease, the orgasms building, the feeling of liquid gold in her veins, thats when the true side of the unstable serum kicked in, her muscle mass began to spiral out of control, she fell to her knees as her clit twitched and pulsed, she resisted touching it, she began to buck and writhe from her own pleasure, her back muscles growing so fast they grew over her head, her shoulders to the side of her filling with mass, growing up either side of her, encasing her head in a fleshy, muscular prison, she let out screams of pleasure as she grew, 11 feet became 12, and 12 became 13 in mere moments after, her solid, firm tits rose up and down with every breath, her nipples harder than diamond, she could puncture walls with them, she wanted to speak but moans took the place of words throughout her wonderful expansion, growing even faster she finally let it out, reaching 15 feet she lay down and spread herself out, legs open wide, her muscles began roaring with power, singing with boundless joy as they grew bigger and bigger, matching sofa sizes and beyond, abs like sofa cushions by this point, bunched up and growing in a 16 pack, \"MOOOOOOOOREEEEEEE!!\" Was all she could let out as Hannah gave in to her feelings and began to satisfy her new goddess, Sandra's clit was a huge, pink, glistening spectacle to behold, it was like trying to suck on a baseball, she began kneading it with her fingers, pushing it inwards, licking and kissing it, making Sandra cry out for more, juices shooting out of her and on to Hannah's skimpily dressed body, drenching her over and over as she sucked on what she could of Sandra's growing clitoris. Sandra was in pure orgasmic bliss, her body spasming in fits of pleasure every few seconds, growing even faster her muscles began growing in to the tables of equipment, \"OH GOD I DONT WANT TO STOP! NEVER! AHHHHHH, OHHHH FUCK MY CLIT!\" She screamed, this made Hannah play with her even more rough, until finally, at 20 feet tall, she shot her load, so powerfully it sent Hannah across to the other side of the room, sitting up panting in pleasure, she gazed at her behemothic, amazonian, godlike body. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"MY GOD.. I'M HUGE.. ALL MY DREAMS SURPASSED, CHILDLIKE NOW..\" Sandra said,<br>\r\nFlexing her massive arms as she sat up, each bicep was larger than a sofa and surrounded by equally large and smaller muscles, this applied to her entire frame, she was nothing but muscles, muscles were stacked on top of muscles, her back was bunched with tons worth of muscle, she had a 30 pack that shrouded her entire waist, her hips had flared out to give her an hourglass figure to go with the only exceptions of muscle of her, which were her huge fucking tits, nearly car size and the same with her ass, her monumental breasts had swept away tables and equipment with their vastness, Sandra hardly cared though, her legs were also huge, probably the most muscled things on her body, each was about 9 feet around and literally packed, she was immense, she had become more than just a bodybuilder, Sandra decided to shuffle her way out of the house and instantly, upon getting out, saw their car and smiled. <br>\r\n\"Ughhhh what the fuck happened..?\" Hannah said, slowly regaining consciousness,<br>\r\nLooking around to see their makeshift lab destroyed and the sound of metal screeching out the front, she looked down to see she was literally drenched in juices, lapping some up off of her face she instantly knew it was Sandra's, she began to stand when suddenly a car door flew through the window and landed at her feet, making her scream and run out of the house, smacking open the door to see her 20 foot tall behemothic lover one handing their car like it was nothing, she was nearly as tall as the house itself,<br>\r\n\"W-WHAT THE FUCK!? WHEN WERE YOU THIS HUGE!\" Hannah screamed,<br>\r\nStaring up in disbelief at her as she squatted down and said,<br>\r\n\"YOU WERE THERE WITH ME WHILE I WAS GROWING, LICKING MY FUCKING CLIT.. I SHOT MY LOAD AND IT SENT YOU ACROSS THE ROOM, HEH, MUST'VE DONE SOME DAMAGE, EVEN MY CUM IS SUPER STRONG!\" Sandra said with an evil smile, \"ANYWAYS I NEED YOU TO MAKE MORE OF THAT WONDERFUL STUFF FOR ME.. I CANT DO IT NOW AT MY SIZE SO YOU WILL.. MAKE IT.. AT LEAST 50x MORE POTENT AND UNSTABLE THIS TIME, I WANT TO GET A REAL KICK OUT OF IT.. AND FOR IT BEING UNSTABLE I FEEL PRETTY NORMAL.. I MEAN I LOOK LIKE AN OVERMUSCLED GODDESS AND THAT'S BECAUSE I AM BUT I WAS EXPECTING MORE OUT OF IT YANNO?\"<br>\r\nHannah couldn't believe what she was hearing, she wasn't against it though, of course she would make more, she loved this shit, she wanted her bigger if anything, and she had a few plans up her sleeve for the next batch of formula's. Sandra decided she was going to go and declare this town hers and began to walk to the town square, kicking down houses on the way and scrunching up cars, not caring if people were in or at home at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah watched Sandra stroll off down the road, causing destruction as she went on, and after a while decided she would need to clean up the lab again, getting started right away she started moving all the tables back to their respective places and setting up the right equipment on each, thankfully none of it was badly damaged and the computers were untouched by Sandra's growth and so with everything set up again she set to work scanning files for making the liquids more potent, digging for a good 20 minutes before two essential files came up, one on the instructions on how to make a vial even stronger, by up to 10x and the other effects on misc objects, she printed off both files, both about 30 pages each and started reading, it was going to be a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandra had reached the town square, scaring hundreds of people on the way in she decided to let out a roar and flex that froze the entire square, everyone looking at her behemoth body, barely able to see her face because of her gargantuan tits, she roared again in pleasure and ripped the roof off of a building next to her and smashed it against her muscle-tits, debris falling off of them and injuring some below, she heard the sound of police sirens in the distance and smiled, <br>\r\n\"LISTEN TO ME YOU PATHETIC RATS, I AM HERE TO OWN THIS TOWN, YOU WILL ALL OBEY ME OR I WILL GROW EVEN LARGER AND DESTROY YOU ALL!\" She uttered, flexing her arms once more, to this there was silence for a few seconds, followed by absolute chaos as people dropped what they were carrying and ran, nearly a thousand people all screaming and running away from the 20 foot tall muscle god, the mall right in front of Sandra seemed an excellent place to trap and destroy people, and maybe even make it her palace, walking in, destroying the glass front Sandra moaned as glass bounced off of her clit, making her squeal almost, she eyes the running people up and swatted some off the higher levels, laughing maniacally as they fell to their deaths, but then there were two girls in particular she saw that were overly muscled for their size, little did she know it was Allison and Holly, both starting at her blankly in fear, when suddenly behind them Craig appeared, and to this Sandra smiled, <br>\r\n\"CRAIG! NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN! LIKE THE NEW ME!\" She cooed to him, his face dropped, Allison and Holly turning to him, looking very, very pissed,<br>\r\nThey all darted for the exit, running for their lives, the two girls with there enhanced musculature running much faster than Craig, who was quickly left behind, Sandra was smashing through escalators and bridges that were in the middle of the mall to try and reach them, and for a good few seconds she was on top of them until the two girls made it out of a small emergency exit, Craig however was not so lucky, as Sandra plucked him from the ground and brought him up to her face, smiling as she dropped him into her cleavage where he clung for dear life. With that Sandra walked back out of the front of the mall, her arms out either side of her smashing in to shop fronts and the like, and upon coming out she was greeted by the armed police, who took no hesitation in firing all their clips right at her, the bullets either ricocheting or crunching up on her skin, those that hit her breasts or clit merely bounced off and served to stimulate Sandra more than thought possible with bullets, once the fire ceased Sandra began stepping towards the blockade of cars and vans and started to step, crush and kick everything in site, the entire police force of the town taken out in seconds by her behemoth form, satisfied with her work she began walking off back to her house, expecting results from Hannah, looking back every now and then at the wake of destruction she had caused, laughing as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly and Allison barely escaped and had made it to the storage basement of the mall, <br>\r\n\"What the fuck was Craig doing with her? How did she know him, and how is she so huge?!\" Asked Allison,<br>\r\n\"He must have sold on the hard drive, the one you said he'd destroyed goddamn it!\" Said Holly<br>\r\n\"No he couldn't have.. I trusted him, the bastard!\" <br>\r\n\"We need to find out where they went, its the only way of even hoping to stop this, we need to go now!\" Shouted Holly, <br>\r\nThey both got up from their rest and began to run once more, out of the basement and in to the mall and then out on to the streets, the streets littered with bodies and cum apparently, they decided to follow the pools of juices and began to run the direction they were in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the house Hannah had already started work on the next batch of vials, each one at least 100x more powerful than the last, but only she knew that, they were about 20% complete when she heard the thunderous steps of her lover coming back, that and the car alarms were kind of a giveaway, she left the \"lab\" to go outside to greet her back in.<br>\r\n\"Welcome back sexy, the next batch is almost do - who are you?\" Said Hannah as Craig dropped out of her cleavage, <br>\r\n\"THIS MY DEAR, IS CRAIG, THE MAN THAT MADE THIS SEXY MUSCLE GOD IN FRONT OF YOU POSSIBLE!\" <br>\r\n\"Oooo well then, we will have much you for you!\" Said Hannah, <br>\r\nThe two waltzed inside in to the lab as Sandra went to the back of the house to sleep in the garden, muttering as she laid back and dozed off, Hannah showed Craig around the lab, showing him the next batch of vials and keeping her secret, still very secret, they were now 50% done already, it was easy for her to make them now, that and she had found a catalyst. Eventually the two of them grew bored and decided to go up to the double bed to sleep, and maybe get busy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut on the horizon.. Kind of.. Allison and Holly had tracked them and found the house, with a huge hole in the side this had to be the one, getting closer they saw the huge muscular Sandra asleep in the back too. This was it.</span></div></div>",

We need to do this!\"<br>\r\nAnd with that the two scarpered out of the house and made their way down the street, reaching the house of Sandra they entered through the large hole in the wall and looked around for Craig, Holly went upstairs to start looking while Allison stayed downstairs to look around for the files, she came to a computer and logged on, luckily there was no password, and to her fear, they had all the files Craig supposedly destroyed, Allison couldn't believe it, she had trusted him with her life almost and this is what happened because of it. Holly was tip-toeing around upstairs, to the best of her ability anyways, she came across a closed door, opening it slowly to find it was the main bedroom, with two people asleep on the bed, she crept up to them, one was Craig and the other was some girl, naked on the bed with him, <br>\r\n\"Craig, Craig you son of a bitch, wake up!\" Said Holly as quiet as possible, dragging him off of the bed and waking him up, his eyes shooting open upon seeing it was Holly, <br>\r\n\"Oh shit.. Hannah! Get Sandra up, now!\" He shouted, Hannah waking up and screaming for Sandra out of the window, <br>\r\n\"Oh fuck..\" Said Holly, dropping Craig and running downstairs, and slamming in to Allison,<br>\r\n\"Ow what the fuck was that Holly, whats going on?\"<br>\r\n\"Time to go Al' like now!\" She replied, <br>\r\nAs soon as she had said that Sandra had smashed through the wall, debris and rock bouncing off of her tits, she stood there menacingly, a growl on her face, Craig and Hannah running downstairs the other side of the two, <br>\r\n\"Time to run?\" Asked Holly<br>\r\n\"Uhm.. Yeah!\" Allison said back, <br>\r\nThe two running out of the hole in the house and sprinting down the street, Sandra was just about to give chase when Hannah stopped her and told her to take a vial, happy to oblige Sandra picked one up, not knowing of the potency and how much more powerful she was about to become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout thinking Sandra threw the vial in to her waiting maw, crunching on the glass and swallowing the liquid, spitting the remains out of her mouth, she stepped out of the house with a content smile on her face, she took one step more and then fell to her knees, her whole body shuddering with pleasure,<br>\r\n\"GAH! UGHHH! OH FUCK, OH SHIT, HANNAH, WHAT DID YOU DO TO ME!\" Asked Sandra,<br>\r\n\"Oh nothing, just you know when you asked for fifty times more potency, well i made it a hundred!\" <br>\r\n\"WHAT, OHHHHH MMMMM, DO YOU KNOW WHAT THIS WILL DO TO ME!?\"<br>\r\n\"Nope, but i'm liking it so far, i wont even be able to kiss you clit at this rate!\"<br>\r\n\"GAAAAAHHHHH HANNAH! I WILL FUCKING KILL YOU! MMMM OH FUUUUCK! MORE! MOOOREEE!! OH GOD NEVERMIND, MORE! I WANT MORE! BIGGER, BIGGER!\"<br>\r\nSandra began screaming, every 2 seconds her body gained 5 feet in height and width, her muscles detonating all over, her biceps bigger than sofa's, even cars, her body began shuddering and shaking even more violently as she spasmed and bulged in the middle of the street, 55 feet in just 30 seconds, her muscles carried on roaring larger, eventually her traps and shoulders rose above and enveloped her head, burying her in a sea of her own mass, her pussy running gallons of her own cum down her leg, her tits literally caused shockwaves with every bulge larger, her ass developing majorly to match her breasts size and splendor, she had gained so many rows of abdominal muscle they couldnt even be counted anymore, her legs were double the width and circumference of her arms which by this point were bigger than vans on her ever growing and massive frame, reaching 80 feet she screamed, the power filling her being, warping her mind, wanting nothing but more!<br>\r\n\"FUUUUUUCK, OHHHHH YES! MORE, I CAN FEEL EVERY MUSCLE IN MY BODY LITERALLY EXPLODING WITH POWER, GROWING OUT OF EVEN MY ONW CONTROL, I WILL SURGE LARGER AND LARGER, GROW OVER THIS PATHETIC TOWN AND RULE THE WORLD! MOOOOREEEE!!\"<br>\r\nSandra uttered, her body still spasming as she rose to her full height of 130 feet, gaining 10's of feet a second her muscles blew out and doubled, then redoubled in size again! Her howls for more muscle were silenced into earth shaking grunts, her pectorals having gotten so big that they closed her lips shut at this point. Meanwhile, her traps had swelled so much that only her eyes were peeking out of her muscular embrace, glowing and glaring at all that her vision landed upon, the woman still letting out muscled screams of fury as she grew. Her bloated muscles only ballooning larger, and they weren't slowing down either every muscle fibre on her body twitching and squeezing against each other before expanding outwards, growing and surging unimaginably in all directions before they would explode with even more size, over and over, her tits were still the biggest part of her body and were determined to stay that way, every second an extra 8 feet of titflesh was added, her screams for more hardly heard over the sound of her expanding bulk, 160 feet came and went, muscles growing onwards, her screams for more muscle and strength blasted out for miles as her veins went into overdrive, pumping hundreds of gallons of blood around her body for even the simple act of moving an inch, she was a hyper muscle goddess now, just as wide as she was tall, and still growing!<br>\r\n\"I WILL RULE THE WORLD! FUCK, MY PUSSY IS EXPLODING HAHAHAAAA THE PLEASURE! THE POWER! SO MUCH.. YET NOT ENOUGH! HUNDREDS WILL DROWN IN MY CUM BELOW ME! UGGGHHHHH AHHHHHH YEAHHHHH!! ITS NOT ENOUGH, MORE, MORE!, MOREEE!, MOORREEEE!!!\"<br>\r\nHer body finally slowing at 190 feet and stopping at 200 feet, roaring one final time as a geyser of green milk sprayed from her nipples, soaking her breasts more, causing them to grow a little larger once more, she did not notice that however. Sandra tried to flex her monstrous and bloated muscle body, unable to do so she smiled and cried out for more, her grotesque muscles and endowments shivering with pleasure as she began to walk onwards back to town, she could sense the two were there, looking at her, everyone was looking at her, she loved it, she was beyond her own dreams now, bigger than anything ever was or could be, she wanted more, she gave out a muffled laugh as the ground below her groaned and cracked, giving way to her thousand tonned muscle god body, her nipples harder than ever, clit pulsing out of control, it wasnt enough for her!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tIt simply was just not enough! Sandra froze for a moment and felt her body, it's vastness, it's sheer beauty and magnitude. Realising then that she wasn't enjoying this experience in its fullest, after all how many women get to be like this? Then again how many of them deserved it or were even fit for it? This world needed time to worship her, to love her but destroying everything in her path in search for two insignificant mortals was not the way to begin her reign! She thought about this for awhile longer, standing still as she gazed upon the city ahead before then slowly turning back to the house, Craig and Hannah standing their. She looked to both of them and smiled however they were not smiling, and so they shouldn't have been. After all they should indeed be both very, very scared now, at how massive she had become. Sandra was, well, of course she was, right. This wasn't enough but it was enough for now. This world was soon going to be hers, she didn't need to pursue those to gnats. Let them come to her! Let their fear bring them to her. But little did she know what was really going on.<br>\r\n\"I'M GOING TO FINISH MY WEE NAP, LET ME KNOW WHEN THOSE TWO LITTLE CUNTS ARE BACK!!!\" She boomed as she strutted towards them, feet cracking the ground below. Craig and Hannah just stared in pure awe as her figure loomed past them and came to rest. Sandra lowered herself to her ass and then onto her back the seemingly difficult task now requiring huge amounts of effort. She had destroyed the two dwellings either side of her as she used them for supports to allow her to lower herself. Still the two didn't move unaware as to why Sandra refused to give chase but the would indeed soon find out. <br>\r\n\tMinutes passed before Sandra fell back to sleep. Both Craig and Hannah were now inside pacing in the make shift lab deep in thought. The extra vials of the serum sitting on the counter. <br>\r\n\"Under no circumstances can we tell her!\" Said Craig bluntly.<br>\r\n\"I know but, if she finds out by herself, we're dead!\" Hannah replied.<br>\r\n\"You think I don't already know that, either way she'll go mad and kill us both!\" <br>\r\nA moment of silence passed before them before Craig began once more.<br>\r\n\"Listen, she deserves this, no doubt about it. I'm not disputing the fact, nor suggesting we do something to diminish her power, for our sakes if anything. You know the minute I saw her I was in awe.\u201d<br>\r\n\"So what are you saying then exactly?\" Retorted Hannah. Craig and her stood in front of each other now she had her arms folded and was tapping her foot impatiently. Craig merely ran his hand through her hair and as his hand reached the back of her head he began to pull her towards him. He then took his free hand and cupped one of her ass cheeks and squeezed whilst whispering into her ear.<br>\r\n\"We give her more.\" his words caused Hannah to bite her lower lip. She was getting turned on. She came closer to him and wrapped her self around him.<br>\r\n\"More?\" she uttered in a deeply sexual voice. <br>\r\n\"No, we give her the lot!\" Hannah looked at him almost teary eyed.<br>\r\n\"Oh god yes.\" Hannah said almost crying.<br>\r\n\"Then hard drive won't matter anymore!\"<br>\r\n         Elsewhere Holly and Allison had the hard drive. They both sat in a lab creating the anit-substance that would hopefully shrink Sandra back to normal. Well, hopefully, it hadn't existed up until now.<br>\r\n\"Hopefully this will work\" said Allison.<br>\r\n\"It'll have to, otherwise the alternative is we grow and stop her?\"<br>\r\n\"Is that such a bad thing?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, we'll be blinded by power! Maybe even worse than her?\u201d Said Holly dumbfounded by the question. But in all this chaos what Holly didn\u2019t know is that the formula Allison had  actually created was a growth serum x1000 times more powerful that the one they had previously taken. Allison didn\u2019t know this but Holly had secretly been tampering with the construction of the formula whilst they were creating it. But it wasn\u2019t Holly that wanted to grow. She didn\u2019t want Allison either. Having seen Sandra in all her magnitude during her latest growth spurt she couldn\u2019t but feel the urge to give her more. She felt as if she deserved it almost. It was a most strange feeling but she wanted Sandra much, much bigger. Finally as she was lost in thought the formula had come to a finish. Allison held it to the light. <br>\r\n\u201cOk we need to test this, just to be sure that it works.\u201d Said Allison.<br>\r\n\u201cW-Wait, we need to what?\u201d asked Holly taken back by the question.<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re still pretty big and I know that you enjoy your size, so I\u2019ll test it.\u201d <br>\r\nHolly gulped, what was she to do? She stood up and made her way to Allison across the lab as quick as she could in an attempt to stop her. But it was too late. Allison had already taken the entire vial. Immediately she ballooned out to 20 feet in an instant, cum exploding out of her cunt as she cracked the ceiling. She stared at herself in disbelief, but the pleasure she felt was almost unbearable. She opened her mouth to speak but only moans came out. She shot a glance at Holly who just stood back as her body rumbled once more.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat have you done Holly?\u201d She pleaded.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m.. sorry.. Allison..\u201d <br>\r\nThe floor gave way as Alison fell to the level below but immediately shot right back up whilst she roared to the heavens.<br>\r\n\u201cI FEEL SO FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOODDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD!!!\u201d<br>\r\nAlison burst out of the complex and rose hundreds of feet into the air, she didn\u2019t even have time to adjust. Everything was so small now, so weak, so pathetic, so, so insignificant compared to her. 1000 feet came and went and soon so did 5000 feet and by the time she had stopped she was a whole 10000 feet tall, her muscles surging with power. He mind warped in ways that she had predicted it would but she cared not now, after all there was no turning back. Whether she liked it or not she had been given the gift of godhood. And she didn't like it at all, she fucking loved it. She scanned the horizon, and smiled and then that smile turned into maniacal laughter as she screamed whilst throwing both arms high into the air! \u2028\u201cYES! YESS! YESSSSSS!!! I\u2026 AM\u2026 GOD!!!\u201d<br>\r\n          Back at the house Craig and Hannah were right beside Sandra's head now with a number of vials in hand. The time was now, they both knew that this would be the second growth spurt that Sandra had no, well sort of, no say in. Well no say in how big she was going to become. But they knew, they both knew she was craving more and without a second more put to waist the threw all the vials into her snoring maw. This was it!</span></div></div>",

But they knew, they both knew she was craving more and without a second more put to waist the threw all the vials into her snoring maw, how she slept through the growth of Allison was beyond anyone, her growth was so explosive and fast it was like a nuclear bomb, all of a sudden a woman appeared, 5000 feet tall, and then another boom, she had doubled in size and quadrupled in mass, a god, looming over the cities below. Craig and Hannah had thrown the remaining vials in, each one 100x more powerful, meaning they would stack, she was about to be unfathomable, her body would reach the beyond with the size she was about to achieve, as soon as the vials were dropped in it started, her body rumbled, her eyes shot open, bloodshot, sphere mouth opened wide as she belted out deafening maniacal laughter, her body bulged to 400 feet, crushing the house and many others around, killing Hannah and Craig underbulk,<br>\r\n\"YES, YESSSSS YEEEEEESSSSSSS, OH G-GOD YEAHHHHHHHHH!!!

MORE THAN YOU WILL EVER BE, I CAN FEEL MY BODY.. CHANGING!

High up on the 50th floor of the company's father building, the sinister woman behind the phone had created a group, a cult almost, of like minded people, all believing one thing, that ultimate power could be theirs. For many years this small cult worshiped higher beings that they themselves had created. The sinister woman, stood from her chair to revel in her victory, standing at a tall 5'11 she was definitely not short, she had a lush hourglass figure that her business suit accentuated even more with how tight it clung to her waist and her body in general, her hefty bust straining the buttoned up shirt and her smart skirt threatening to rip from her bosom thrusting against it. She began striding out of her small office and hung a sharp left that brought her to another set of double doors, metal ones with warning signs plastered on them, it was once where the main generators that powered the entire company building, and its sister building next to it, however the power plants had been moved to a more secure underground complex just under the car park outside the building. Opening the doors the woman was greeted by darkness, candles and dull red lights vaguely lit the surrounding room, light merely focusing on the shrines and statues laid about the now cultist looking store room, a large stone statue of a woman with muscles beyond the realm of human stood in the middle, eyes glowing green, made of clear emeralds. The woman put on her red robes and sat in her throne looking chair awaiting the arrival of her \"colleagues\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA good 5 minutes later another 3 women entered, all of similar height and stature, all cloaked in red robes, hiding their faces, they slowly gathered around the statue and stared up at its majesty, the walls adorned with similar material of amazons and Valkyrie's all with mythical abilities and item's in their grasps. The sinister woman stood from her throne and the other women's heads snapped towards her as she slowly raised her arms straight up in to the air, letting her robe fall from her body, still in her business suit. The other women did the same all in similar clothing as though they had rushed up from their offices.<br>\r\n\"What news do you bare today goddess?\" The skinniest of the bunch asked, <br>\r\n\"Finally my sister's we have the key!\"<br>\r\n\"The key to what my goddess?\"<br>\r\n\"POWER YOU FOOL! WHAT ELSE HAVE WE BEEN SEARCHING FOR!\" The sinister woman snarled at her,<br>\r\nThese woman did bare real names, the sinister woman's name was Brooke Evergreen, and the other 3 went by the names Lexi, Erika and Leah. <br>\r\n\"Here my sister's is our key to godlike power, let us go to the transformation chamber\"<br>\r\nOpening another door in the darkest corner of the room they came to a very large and spacious room, with black marble flooring and black walls, no windows and was completely pitch black save for the one bright light that shone a cone of light in to the middle of the room, the 4 women stood in a circle around the cone of light and one at a time Brooke handed each one a vial, the 4 women all in their 30's and Erika even a mother of 2, they knew full well what they were getting into. First up, Lexi stepped into the cone of light and began chanting, holding the vial up to the light and taking out the cork, once she had finished she gulped down the small amount of liquid inside, and stepped out of the light, and as Erika stepped in her transformation began, moaning and groaning escaped Lexi's mouth,<br>\r\n\"Carry on my sister, and you will soon join her!\" Brooke uttered, <br>\r\nErika finished her chant and too gulped down the vial, stepping out of the light, followed shortly by Leah, and as she finished, Brooke watched as the 3 women transformed in front of her eyes, their muscles roaring, detonating with pure strength, the potency of the vials was unreal, unprecedented, had she miscalculated? No, she knew just how potent it was, and she reveled in it, watching them buck and writhe and finger themselves furiously, each one loving every moment of their individual ascension, growing and growing still, all the girl pussy's exploded with cum, basking Brooke in all of their juices from all sides as they soared up to 10 feet tall, Lexi in a clear lead in all aspects, followed shortly by the other two, and as their bodies began to shake the room, their weight began to crack the floor, Brooke undid her vial and said,<br>\r\n\"May my ascension begin, and my orgasms carry me in to the great beyond!\" Downing her vial milliseconds after, <br>\r\nUnlike the other girls, Brooke's transformation began in moments, her boobs blew out of her top, buttons flying across the room, her top shredding as her muscles tore through,<br>\r\n\"OH DEAR GOD-FUCK, I MEAN OH DEAR ME YES!\" She cried out as she reached 10 feet in seconds, her body bulging and hulking out doubling and redoubling in size and mass every second, doubling in height also as she reached 20 feet in seconds, her body widened and widened and finally stopped, her explosive transformation ending with a torrent of her love juice spattering the floor, her huge and engorged clit pulsating in the wind, her hulking, brutish and frankly hyper like physique stood out as she let out one ear piercing orgasm that shook the whole building, the other women's ascensions topping them out at just over 15 feet and over hulked also, nowhere near as much as Brooke but it was no the less imposing. Brooke's eyes darted about, flickering almost as she fought against her own desires, all she wanted to do was grow again, until the earth could be shoved inside her as a sex toy, but she held back, preventing her eyes from rolling to the back of her head she widened her stance and clenched her fists, cumming again, so hard that her torrent of cum cracked the floor beneath her, the other girls moaning as her warm juices rushed over their feet.<br>\r\n\"This my sister's.. Is just *bulge grow bulge* MMMMMM OH *bulge grow grow bulge* THE BEGINNING! *expaaaaaand* OOOOHHHHHHH!!\" Brooke cried out one final time as her boobs surged forth, her traps and shoulder engulfed her neck and head, she trembled with pleasure, and smiled sinisterly once more, as her boobs began to gurlge..</span></div></div>",

With that she went to the gym using a guest pass Allison had given her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n At the gym Holly noticed something interesting. After 3 sets of bicep curls using 75 LBS she was not feeling it on the 3rd set the way she did on the 1st set. On a hunch she put the 75 LB dumb bells back and grabbed a pair of 85 LB dumb bells. The first set was hard but the second set using the 85 LB dumb bells got easier. Holly quickly switched to squats and within 4 sets had increased the weight from 400 LBS to 700 LBS. Every exercise caused Holly to double her strength if not more and after 2 hours in the gym Holly felt the formerly large workout clothes pressing up against her body. On one hand Holly wanted to continue to work out until the gym clothes lost a battle against her expanding muscles but on the other hand she decided she could back up to Allisons place and do a home work out. With that she left the gym with every set of eyes focused on her.</span></div></div>",

Craig in his efforts to help Allison had also helped Julie by destroying the evidence of her copying all the data from the project. Julie had kept her activities hidden from Craig and Allison and now nobody would know. Well at least nobody would no until Julie was no longer a 5 foot 3 and 107 LB wimp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Julie had been spying on Allison and on her new friend Holly and the fantastic results had caused Julie's imagination to run wild. She had visions of being a massive muscle hulk out lifting even the largest meat heads at her gym. Braun to go with brain. Julie had also smuggled out 4 vials of the formual that had been refined out of the lab a few days ago. Now tonight she was going to improve herself in a way that she only dreamed about through high school and college. She had found a gym just 4 miles outside city limits. She got a membership since due to its remote location it never had more than 3 members inside working out at a time. Julie also had purchased some workout clothes of various sizes so that way she could cover up as she got bigger. With that she got in her car and drove to the gym.</span></div></div>",

After she was changed she looked at her waifer thin figure in a full size mirror and sighed but then said \"Not anymore.\" With that she got the first of her 4 vials opened and chugged it with only a single gulp. She then walked over to the sink and washed the vial out 3 times before throwing it in the trash. This took maybe around 1 minute and Julie went from being excited to being totally defeated. She panicked as she thought maybe she had aquired some placebos or maybe the vials were not compatible with her genes. Just as she started thinking about more scenarios she felt hot very hot. In a new panic she grabbed a bottle of water she brought with her and threw on herself. As the water made contact with her skin it hissed and the water turned to steam. Julie then got dizzy and tried to sit down but fell over. The dizziness passed quickly and Julie got back up. Julie then panicked yet again as something seemed off. Then it hit her she was taller. She was not sure by how much but she was taller. Her gym clothes were being stretched by this fact. She saw a height taking apparatus out of the corner of her eye and ran to it. She could not get a truly accurate measurement since it took 2 people but she was now around 5 foot 10. With one vial she had gained just under a foot in height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she turned to go back to her locker and put on a bigger set of gym clothes the ones she was wearing exploded off of her as her muscles erupted and her tits blew up like a ballon. Muscles piled on top if muscles. This process went on for 2 minutes but in that 2 minutes Julie aquired an 8 pack her tits went from a non existent B cup to 38EE. Her brown hair went down half way her back. That said it was the rest of her muscles that truly changed. Biceps now measured close to 15\" and her quads were now so huge they touched each other. Finally Julie got up and looked back in the mirror and gasped. Without so much as lifting a barbell she had exceeded her expectations. She saw a scale and quickly weighed herself. She had gone from just over 100 LBS to an impressive 225 LBS. One vial had given her over 100 LBS of muscle. She quickly picked up her destroyed gym clothes and threw them away. Then she ran back over to her locker and put on the largest gym clothes she had. They fit but they were tight and they left little to the imagination. Then Julie realized she had a choice.</span></div></div>",
