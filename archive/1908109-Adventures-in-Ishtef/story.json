Blue. Not a very interesting name, but if it were anything more complicated, you might forget it. It's not like you're stupid or anything. You're just... forgetful. Like most Inklings, you've never really been outside of Inkopolis, except to attend a few fashion shows to check out the latest trends, and with good reason. It doesn't take much to reduce you to an ink splatter, and if anyone manages to catch you in your squid form, you're calamari. Despite how vulnerable they are, all Inklings love a good fight, yourself included (even though you forget the rules sometimes).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday started like any other. You hopped right out of bed and took an ink bath. Despite being squids, water is practically toxic to you, so you simply clean yourselves with ink. \"*sigh* Man, I totally got stomped last night. Would've been nice if those suckas I got teamed with coulda told me the rules\", you gurgled to yourself as you sat in the tub of bright blue ink. Because of how forgetful you are, it sometimes takes a while for you to figure out what's going on. Despite that, your stats are pretty decent, though because they don't want to have to remind you of the rules and which team you're on, not many Inklings want you on their team. Because of this, you aren't very fresh. But you're looking to change that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou managed to score some tickets to see the Squid Sisters, Callie and Marie, for tonight's sold out concert. You could convince a few others to let you on their team for the extra tickets if you wanted to. Then again, if the enemy team wins, they could be jerks and take them from you as part of their winnings, which would suck big time. That is, if you even remember you have the tickets. \"Awright, let's do this!\", you yelled, jumping out of the tub and heading out of your apartment... and once again forgetting to get dressed.</span></div></div>",

Being in constant danger of being squashed underfoot or ending up as someone's butt sticker are just a couple of things that could happen if you don't pay attention. Of course, being in charge of organizing their transportation service means the bigger girls try to avoid squishing you if they can. Though, some are more mean-spirited than others, like your evil counterpart, who has been given the oh-so inspired name of \"Evil Sari\". She's the one that gives you the most trouble, especially if you're in your child form. Your allspark key allows you to switch between your forms once a day (child, teenager, adult, and full robot).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now, you're just getting back from making the schedule for everyone's route, and you'd really like to change out of your child form before Evil Sari decides to prank you. \"Darn it, where is that thing?\", you ask as you rummage around your belongings in search of your key. Despite an hour of searching, it doesn't appear that your key is in here. \"Oh geez, I hope SHE didn't take it\", you groaned. You didn't want to think of what Evil Sari would make you do to get it back if she did have it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, where did I have it last. I was helping out in the body shop, then I went to watch TV, then I set up the schedule... ugh! Where is it?!\", you cried as you walked into the hallway, trying to think of where you might have misplaced your key.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere do you look first?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After panicking for a little bit, you soon calm down. If your evil counterpart DID have your key, she would have gone out of her way to let you know she had it, and no doubt make you do something humiliating to get it back. You figure you had stressed out enough over it, and decide to take a break and search for it later. You head into the living room, which was currently empty, and scale the large couch to watch TV. Most of the furnishings here, aside from the restrooms and part of the kitchen, were made with the much larger Transformer girls in mind, which made you feel even smaller than your current form already was. However, having to find a comfortable spot somewhere in one of the large craters that was a butt indention was a small price to pay for enjoying the massive television.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter climbing up to the couch, you grabbed a throw pillow, laid back, and flipped on the TV. To you, the humans, and the mini-cons, the living room couch was more like a wide bed. \"Man, the cushions never last that long\", you whined as you scooted over to try and find a comfortable spot. You were too busy scooting around, that you failed to notice that someone else had entered the room. \"Ahh. Much better\", you said as you managed to find a spot on the couch that hadn't flattened out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you had managed to get comfortable, your vision was blocked out by two large, round gold objects. Looks like you weren't going to get to relax after all. All you were able to let out was an \"Eep\", before you were quickly smashed underneath the immense weight of the massive metalic ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, you had turned the TV up too loud for whoever was sat on you to hear your muffled cries for help. \"Huh, someone left the TV on\", you heard them say as they wiggled in the seat, grinding into you and crushing you even more. \"Oh well. Ya snooze ya lose\", she said as she sat forward and changed the channel. You soon heard the clang of a paint bucket hit the large table and you soon found out who had unintentionally made you into a seat cushion. It was Thunderblast. She always did her \"makeup\" while watching TV. This included a little bit of air brushing to her face, painting her nails, and applying a coat of paint to her lips (the Cybertronian girls equivalent to \"lipstick\"). If she was doing her makeup, that meant you were going to be underneath her for quite a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou soon heard the muffled screams of someone else under what was probably her other ass cheek. \"Oh shut up, Lori\", Thunderblast said, grinding her butt into the couch, bringing up more screams from who you guessed was Lori, and flattening you even more. \"I've warned you plenty of times: Scratch my paint, and you end up underneath it. Hope you're comfy, Lori, cause you're gonna be staying on my ass for the rest of the week\", she said, giving her gold painted ass a slap. This wasn't good. You had heard from Lori how awful it was to be trapped underneath a layer of paint and stuck to a part of their bodies. And given how often she makes trips to the body shop, you knew that you may be stuck to Thunderblast's booty as well. And since she didn't know you were there, you might be stuck for even longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTry as you might to cry out, Thunderblast simply attributed your cries for help to Lori, which were met with her mocking her little seat cushion as she did a few touch ups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, she had decided she looked good enough to head out, but not before grabbing a quick bite to eat. Grabbing her things, she  stood up and headed into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs she taking you with her?</span></div></div>",

As the robotic girl walked away, you were left flattened in the giant indention in the couch. \"Ugh... my head...\", you groaned. You looked like little more than a twitching yellow and brown pancake. \"Some... ergh... somebody help me...\", you moaned as you twitched, attempting to make any sort of movement. You struggled a little bit before you noticed a whirring noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously? Can you tiny things go five minutes without me having to bail you out?\", you heard a voice say as you were slowly peeled off the couch. You recognized that nagging anywhere. It was Nickel, the adorable little maintenance bot. She may have been just barely big enough to not be categorized as a mini-con, but the bigger girls knew better than to mess with her, lest they get the nagging of a lifetime. \"*sigh* Come on, Sari, let's get you to the repair bay. You'll probably have a smaller chance of being someone's bumper sticker there\", she giggled as she sped off on her wheel-feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Nickel\", you groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can thank me by being more careful\", Nickel quipped. \"I can't be following you mushy little goofballs all the time, you know, and I certainly don't want to have to implement an hourly butt inspection. I mean how're you supposed to organize everything if you're someone's bumper sticker?\" She continued going on and on, making sure to hammer the point home. \"...So maybe carry a whistle on you or something to let everyone know not to squish you, kay?\", she said, finally done lecturing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*sigh* Yes, Nickel, I'll keep that in mind\", you said, still aching all over as Nickel set you on a table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just gonna leave you here for now while I go get Red Alert. You techno-organics are too weird for me to get a handle on, and I don't want to mess you up too bad\", Nickel said while speeding off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you're just gonna leave me here?!\", you cried out. It was no use, though, as the little maintenance bot was gone. \"Oh well... at least I'm alone now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, you hear some clicking coming from above you. You shift your eyes up to the ceiling just in time to see a massive spider transform and land directly on top of you. *SPLAT* The massive purple booty seemed to belong to Blackarachnia, another techno-organic that lived in the house. However, just because her body was much softer, it didn't make her any less heavy. \"Hey, Red! I'm ready for my inspection!\" Her rough voice was muffled from beneath the spider's ass. She sat for several minutes, grinding her butt to get comfortable while waiting for the medic to arrive, scraping your already battered body into an almost unrecognizable yellow paste in the process. \"Come on, Red, I've got places to be!\" Her patience wearing thin, Blackarachnia stood up, your body stretching between her booty and the table for a brief moment before snapping off and sticking to the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have you know that you aren't my only patient\", Red Alert said as she walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm just the only one that matters\", the spider snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFear gripped your battered form as Blackarachnia neared the table again, her spider abdomen hovering above you as you whimpered at the thought of becoming the arachnid's butt sticker, worse yet if she found you. You had been turned into silk enough times to know to avoid her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?</span></div></div>",

He looks so adorably delicious.\"<br>\r\n\"Remember, there is a twenty-four hour time limit before he returns to me. Until then, you're free to do whatever you'd like.\" Upon arriving in Ishtef, your mother had purchased a special potion that made you return to her side exactly one full day after leaving her eyesight. This made her feel much less guilty about serving you as a meal. However, that still doesn't mean you enjoy the trips you made through people's bodies.<br>\r\nAs your mother left, you were left alone with the Princess. \"I-I-I-I...*gulp* I hope you think I taste good, princess...\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm sure you will. Humans happen to be a very rare delicacy in Ooo\", she said. \"But I don't think I've ever seen a human with such a high price. You must be especially delicious...\" Princess Bubblegum was interrupted by a rapidly descending figure. \"What the-?!\" *squelch!* You stared in shock as Marceline, the Vampire Queen, had just sat on the princess, squishing her into the seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" 'sup, Bonni. Heard you finally had the guts to try this place out\", she said, wiggling her butt a little.<br>\r\nAll you could hear were muffled expletives from the princess.<br>\r\nMarceline then turned your attention to you. \"Oh, man! You even ordered the owner's kid! You don't mind if I have a taste, do you?\"<br>\r\nYou closed your eyes and shivered in fear as Marceline bared her fangs. You heard a sucking sound, but oddly didn't feel a thing. She had only bitten into the cherry icing that made up your vest, drinking the pigment until it had become absent of color. \"Mmm, not bad.\" Marcy stood up and bent down to reinflate the princess. \"You mind closing your eyes, kid? She doesn't really like other people to see this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did as you were told. As you lied there, waiting to be eaten, a you started to feel weird. For the entirety of your short life, including the several months you had lived in Ishtef, and the countless bellies you had filled, you had never come into contact with anyone like you. Back where you came from, others regularly bullied you, mockingly calling you \"gum boy\" as they squished you and chewed you up like an actual piece of gum. You had finally found someone like you, who could maybe even help you understand your condition better, and she wanted to eat you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There ya go, Bonnibelle. Good as new\", Marceline said. Princess Bubblegum didn't seem very pleased.<br>\r\n\"Marceline, you know I can't stand that!\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah. Catch ya later.\" The vampire queen floated away, allowing the princess to return to her meal.<br>\r\nShe sat down and carefully picked you up. \"Now, then. Where were we?\" She opened her mouth wide, allowing you to see the back of her throat.<br>\r\nThis could possibly the only chance you had to be able to connect with someone who understood life as you saw it, more or less. If you didn't talk to her now, you might never get the opportunity again.</span></div></div>",

She seemed like a nice person. Even better than from the show. You remember the she seemed a little bit cold sometimes. But she wasn't like that here. Also, you didn't failed to notice that she made the \"being eaten\" experience a bit more pleasant. And, despite the facet that you came out of her butt, which didn't smelled bad at all mind you, you kinda looked forward to being eaten by her again. You didn't got your hopes high tough. It was rumored, often, that she and Finn were in a relationship. You kinda hoped that they weren't, you had a little crush on her. Perhaps you'll get a shot?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\"Hey there, kid.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned around and saw none other than Marceline, the Vampire Queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\"H-hi there miss Marceline.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\"Please, drop the formalities with me, okay?

Alright?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\"Oh, goodie! I was begining to starve!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe threw you to the gound and, litterally, ripped you clothing to shreds, except for you boxers. She then grabbed you by the shoulder and your world became darkness as her fanged mouth descended on your head. She then used her vampiric strenght to lift you up, so that gravity could lend her a hand. She gulped, taking in your neck. She then expaned her jaws a bit more to accomodate you shoulders. Next to go where your arms and upper torso. She kept gulping until she got to your waist. Once there, she got a mischievous grin. She ripped your boxers and grabed your manhood. You had to clap your lips to keep from moaning. Marcy then began to stroke and lick your hard on with her hands and skilled snake-like tounge. You were trying very hard to to be too loud, but Marceline wasn't having any of that. She increased the peace of her strokes and licks and, once she felt you were almost there, she engulfed your lower torso, wast and upper tights and drew them into her mouth, causing you to shoot your load down her throat and your head to enter her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\"Hmmmmm!!! Shho ymmmmmy (Hmm! So yummy).\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you were spent, she slurped what was left of your tights and your legs up like noodles and the rest of your body joined you in the depts of the Vampire Queen's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\"Uurrpp! You were quite yummy, you know?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\"T-thanks, Marceline.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\"No prob. Now, let's go search for Bonnie.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wandered the mansion looking for Bubblegum with you inside of her stomach, altough she took her time, so as to enjoy you being inside her as much as she could. After about two hours of searching:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"Hey, Marceline!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\"Oh! There you are, Bonnie.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"You were looking for me?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\"More like <i>\"we\"</i> were loking for you. The kid you ate today? He's in my stomach right now and wanted to talk to you. Hold on, I'll let him out.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarceline then used her gag reflex to help her bring you back up. Once you were in her mouth, she droped to the ground and let you out gently, so as to not harm you. Which came as a surpires to you and to the princess as well, because Marceline was usually quite rough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\">\"What? The kid is brave. He wasn't afraid of me when I found him. Rather, he was quite friendly, so I took a liking to him.\"</span>, she said, blushing a little. <span class=\"clgrey\">\"Anyway, I gotta go. See ya later kid! I'll be sure to stop by your mom's place again to get another tast of you soon!\"</span>, she said with a seductive grin and a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"Well I'll be. Very few manage to befrined Marceline on the day they meet her. Hmm... Interesting. Putting that aside, I assume your here to get some advice on your \"condition\"?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\"Yes, Princess.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"When you're in my home, you can call me Bonnie or Bubblegum, okay?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">\"Okay, B-Bonnie.\"</span>, now you were blushing quite a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"*giggles* You're so cute when you blush, you know?

She took out a spoon and scooped out some of your mass and set it on the table, using a tool to try and keep the hole open, though you simply reformed around it. \"<span class=\"cpink\">Interesting. Your body seems to act like a slime's</span>\", she said, taking a closer look at the bit of you she scooped out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clblue\">So, I'm like a slime? Is that why my skin gets so sticky when I'm wet?</span>\", you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Well, it's not really \"skin\"</span>\", she said, cutting the bit of you in half and getting a good look at the chunk of your \"flesh\". \"<span class=\"cpink\">If you'll look closely, it's more like a protective outer membrane, keeping the rest of you in one shape and making you appear to be human... do you mind if I...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed as PB held the little bit of you. \"<span class=\"clblue\">S-sure.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpink\">Thanks.</span>\" She then pop the little bite into her mouth and chewing it up. \"<span class=\"cpink\">Mmm.

Wouldn't want your clothes to get messed up\", she chuckled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, I... guess you're right\", you replied as you slipped out of your clothes. You were a little embarrassed of her seeing you naked, though you really shouldn't be at this point. You've seen enough people walk around school nude like it wasn't a big deal. Which, it really wasn't. You hadn't lived here long enough to really be used to it yet. \"Um, alright, I'm ready\", you said, covering your genitals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent. Since your body's properties are similar to mine, we'll start out with the gum test\", she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gum test?\", you asked. Before you could close your mouth, Princess Bubblegum grabbed you and squished you into a little ball before tossing you in her mouth. Her moans echoed around you as she licked your tiny gumball form, soaking you in her saliva. After enjoying your flavor for a minute, she wrapped her tongue around you and slid you underneath her molars. You knew what was coming next. You sat there and prepared for the inevitable as the Princess' teeth came crashing down out your tiny balled-up body, completely pulverizing you between her teeth. \"Mmm! Simply delicious!\", she cooed as she began chewing you up like a piece of bubblegum. If you hadn't been in this position several times before, you would find some sort of irony in this. PB continued to mash you between her teeth for several minutes before she suddenly stopped. You thought for a second that she was going to swallow you again, but your thought were soon answered as she began stretching you over her tongue. You were then pressed into the back of Bubblegum's lips as she began to blow you into a bubble, filling you with her sweet smelling breath. You were soon inflated into a large pinkish bubble with eyes, blushing a little as you were actually enjoying this a bit. It wouldn't take long for you to reach your limit, however, as you soon burst all over PB's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, looks like we have more in common than I thought\", the Princess giggled as she peeled you off. \"I'll let you sit here and reform while I get ready for the next test\", she said as she walked away. Your body had taken a beating, but you didn't feel too bad about it. In fact, despite what you had gone through, you seemed to be reforming much more quickly. Maybe what she said earlier had something to do with it. It didn't take long for you to return to your normal human shape. \"I hope you're ready for your next test\", you heard her say from behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, y-yeah whenever you-... o-oh.\" You expected her to have some sort of device to use on you, but as you turned around, your entire field of vision was directed to a large pink mass. You looked up, to find that she was looking over her shoulder, her bare bubble butt hovering directly over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now it's time for the booty test.\" You had little time to react as she allowed herself to fall back, landing ass-first on top of you with a *SPLAT!*. PB giggled as she ground her ass into you, squishing you into a fine fleshy paste. \"Wow, you're rather comfy\", the Princess said as she wriggled her rear on top of you. \"I may have to borrow you sometime. You make an excellent cushion.\" She stood up after sitting on you for a while, before slamming her ass back into your battered body, causing you to make an audible squelching noise as she repeated. You sort of enjoyed this treatment as she pounded you with her booty, though you had a bit of worry in the back of your mind. Since your body had the same properties as her, didn't that mean that you could potentially fuse with her? You weren't allowed to think too much about it, as she put her full weight on top of you and ground you hard with her ass, smearing you across her cheeks for several minutes before stopping, simply resting on you for a bit before getting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, I think I may have overdid it a bit\", she giggled as she stood up. \"But I think you did rather... uh, Jack?\" She turned around, expecting to see the boy-turned-butt imprint, but you were nowhere to be found. She figured that you had gotten stuck to her and looked behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat has become of you?</span></div></div>",

Maybe Princess Bubblegum can help me with that, too...\" You really appreciated that your mom went through the trouble of buying you that Curfew Potion, but sometimes it was more trouble for you than you would have liked. For example, you were never able to stay over at anyone's house for more than one day. You knew that your mother was only doing this for your protection, but you needed to be out on your own eventually. She couldn't baby you forever. You were glad, though, that the potion wore off after one year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter wandering around for about ten minutes, you stumbled across an open room. The walls were decorated with all sorts of weapons. Swords, axes, ect. Decorated... as in they were sticking out of the walls. It was pretty messy, too. \"This must be Finn's room.\" You started to walk around, admiring his weapons. You start to poke your chest and sigh as the little dent filled back in. \"I wish I could be strong... Fight bad guys and stuff...\" You noticed a particularly cool looking sword above the couch. \"Hmm. I don't think he'll mind if I take a look at it.\" You climb over the couch and up the wall and try to pull it off, but you're too weak. \"Hrnnnng! Come on, Jack!\", you push yourself as you struggle to pull the sword out. Suddenly, you hear the door slam shut. Panicking, you slip off of the sword and fall down onto the couch, your body squishing a little bit from the impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew! Infinite robot brawl's getting pretty tough!\" Finn was covered in sweat, dirt, and oil; having just gotten back from training in his own pocket battle dimension. Even when vacationing, he still felt he needed to keep from getting rusty. \"I think I need to chillax for a while.\"<br>\r\nBeemo jumped onto the table and tossed Finn his controller. \"Bet you can't beat my new game, Finn.\"<br>\r\n\"Haha, just you watch, Beemo!\"<br>\r\nJust as you started to reform, a shadow cast over you. You looked up to see Finn's ass about to descend. \"<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">Eep...</font>\" *Squelch!* Your entire body was flattened like a pancake underneath the hero, making a perfect mold of his butt.<br>\r\n\"Man, this couch is comfier than I remember. I've got a good feeling about this game.\" As Finn played the game, you tried to get his attention by wriggling. He was too heavy for you to squeeze out from under him. All you could do is hope that he noticed your struggles.</span></div></div>",

For one, your mom was going to be going out of town for a few weeks, and she said you had to stay here. Normally you wouldn't mind. It's not like you couldn't take care of yourself. However, Trish didn't see it that way, and had talked someone she knew into taking care of you while she was gone. This is what scared you. You didn't know any of your mom's friends (mostly because you had your face glued to your video games), and you had never bothered to ask her what they were like. Heck, you didn't even know if whoever your mom was taking you to was even very well acquainted with her. Still, though, Trish trusted them enough to look after you, so maybe they'd be nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave you a kiss on the forehead and sent you on your way, informing you that your things had already been taken inside before driving off. Where would you be staying for now?</span></div></div>",

Anyone?\" You sigh before checking the doorknob and opening it, seems they were expecting you. \"Hellooooo?\" You called out. Nothing. Was no one home? Did they just forget to lock the door on their way out? Various questions passed through your mind that you didn't even notice the red glint in the shadows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BOOTY BOMB!\" Yelled a weird gray skinned girl as she jumped from a corner of the ceiling and held her legs up. Your eyes narrowed as the fat jean clad ass slammed down on your gooey body, a load SPLAT filling the house as your form instantly molded to the girl's fat ass. \"Damn you're squishy! Your mom wasn't lying!\" She laughed, grinding her curvy rear into your soft and malleable frame before getting up, your body stretching between her ass and the floor. \"Damn, didn't think you'd like my ass so much, afraid I just had time for this one booty slam, don't worry, I'll be doing more.\" She laughed as she peeled you off her ass and let you splat onto the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a few minutes but you eventually reformed, shaking your head as you stood before a somewhat tall(er then you) girl wearing a white dress shirt with a pink evil looking squid head on it. \"Greetings, I'm Rose. I suppose you're Jack?\" She asked with confidence in her voice you wished you had some days. \"Y-yes, I'm Jack...You know my mom?\" You hadn't heard a thing about these people, you kinda wished you did now so that you would at least know who just turned you into an ass pancake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, she comes by often for uh...personal reasons.\" She chuckled before showing you through the hallways. You didn't really know much about your mom's private life, and you'd rather keep it that way. \"As I said I'm Rose, I'm co-house leader. Your mom has decided that it'd be best if you stayed with us for a few weeks. However you get the choice of where you'll be staying, sadly at the moment you can only pick from two rooms, the Lalondes, and the Pyropes.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think on this, you have absolutely no idea who'll be in each room, so you just bite the bullet and pick...</span></div></div>",

The Leaders of each house are called...House Leaders, and they're the ones who own the house and pay for everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules.<br>\r\n1.Anything is allowed, literately, ANYTHING GOES.<br>\r\n2.No Death however, as the city has Reformation chambers in every building which is required by law.<br>\r\n3.Please ask me if you wish to add an OC and please be clear on who and what they are.<br>\r\n4.Giants and Giantesses are another thing you should ask me about, as only four of each are allowed in Ishtef at a time, it is a kinky city, but they can't just have people tear everything down whenever they want.<br>\r\n5.Most Males are a no, I do like some males like Shippo from Inuyasha or Finn from Adventure time, but most are no's, so most groups are female only.<br>\r\n5.5: Please run any \"More/other\" options for girls pass me first, I really don't like having an interactive that's just \"And more\".<br>\r\n5.5.5: From here on out there will be only ONE \"More/Other\" option, any changes to other characters must be done in story.<br>\r\n6.Have fun!</td>",
