Jay stood by the toaster and waited as Lola wandered down \"hey where are mum and dad?\" she asked Jay simply shrugged \"no idea i just know they'll be back tomorrow\" he pointed towards the note on the table which Lola picked up and threw back down in a huff \"look I'll be going out soon so make sure your around to let me back in\" Jay heard the toaster go off and he turned and grabbed his toast \"did you lose your key again?\" he asks now slightly angry and Lola nods her head \"yeah it's in my room somewhere\" before heading back upstairs to leave Jay alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an hour Lola came back down now dressed to go \"I'm off bro\" she said and left without waiting for a goodbye, so Jay was left alone like always then again he could always call up one of his friends to hang out with,  but before he could decide the doorbell went off so Jay went to the door and opened it to see the local postman \"hey Mr Johnson hows your wife?\" Jay asked, Mr Johnson laughed a little \"She's fine Jay just a little under the weather\" Jay nodded and smiled taking the post \"well you tell her i said hey and that i hope she gets well soon\" Mr Johnson nodded and waved before leaving and Jay closed the door flicking through the post \"mums, mums, mums, dads, Lola's, hey whats this?\" Jay mumbled as he held up a small box \"i don't remember ordering anything\" Jay placed the mail on the table and opened the box to see a small bottle of Perfume \"oh it's perfume looks like a free sample\" he said looking the bottle over, \"this could make a good gift for mum or even Lola\" he said as he pulled the cap off and sprayed some taking a sniff \"hmm not bad this could make a good gift\" he said with a smile and as he put the cap back on and set the bottle down he began to feel a little odd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Happens Next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jay, ultimately decided to take a nap, laziness winning over as he curled up on the brown leather couch in the main room, flipping on the TV.   Nothing much was on as he yawned, moving from channel to channel stopping on one about dogs and how they had developed unique skills to read humans, like always looking at the left side of their owners face first to determine expression and mood.  Jay started to drift off almost immediately, feeling very odd and groggy and a little warm, passing out with his navy blue hoodie on, head crashing onto the pillow.  Several hours passed as Jay dreamed of running in fields on all fours, wagging his fuzzy tail and bouncing around, being a silly dog, always noticing a figure off in the distance, watching him, smiling and enjoying his company, knowing that he made her happy, being her pup.   He ran up to Korleena.. somehow he knew her name, sitting like a good obedient pup and wagging as she gave him a treat and petted him, the last thing he remembered was looking into her beautiful eyes, entranced.  He awoke with a start, hearing gunfire and seeing Predator was on TV.  It was late.. really late, the sun was already going down and the clock on the Directv menu read 7pm.  \"Damn.. I wasted the whole day sleeping\"  Jay reached down to the uncomfortable lump in his pants pocket, producing an Iphone 4s, checking for messages.  A few friends had texted him as well as one bot advertisement.  Jay dropped the phone.  It wasn't a shocking message that had bothered him though.  It was his hairy arm, or rather.. furry?  It looked like well.. fur.. a soft white fluffy fur.  In a panic, Jay rolled over fumbling for the lamp switch, turning it on and staring in shock at his furry hand and arm, panicking as his other looked the same.  To make matters worse his fingernails were more claw-like now in appearance, dark and curled around like an animals complete with soft, tough black pawpads underneath his fingers and palm.  His hand felt okay more or less.. if you could say that although it was slightly harder to grasp things now and everything just felt weird.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly hopped off the bed and ran through the kitchen and then upstairs to the upper bathroom, tearing off his hoodie.  Yup.  Fluff, white fluffy fur all over his body although his face just seemed slightly more hairy than usual.  he quickly put his hoodie back on and located some gloves to wear.  Fortunately it was getting cold out this time of year so no one would think twice about him covering up his furry paw-like hands.  \"Damn, it must have been something in that perfume or maybe my sister played a joke on me.. damnit this isn't funny!\" Jay said, still in denial thinking this was all some embarrassing elaborate hoax as he dressed up and quickly dry shaved the extra hair off his face, looking more or less passable to go downtown now at least.   Jay was debating calling the perfume company directly or the poison hotline or maybe just seeing if the emergency clinic was still open this late.  Maybe they'd be able to remove this stuff.. must be some expensive glue.  He made sure to grab some cash and leave the kitchen door unlocked in case his sis came home early from her party (he assumed given how social she was with her new friends lately).   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He turns around to see Emma, a friend he's known since they were kids.  \"Emma! you scared me! but it's good to see you, what are you doing here.. is everything alright?\"  Emma grins but then gives Jay a more serious look, \"Oh, I just came to give a coworker a ride to the clinic, she wasn't feeling well, but I'm sure she'll be fine.. but what about you Jay?  You don't look so well.. and ..  did you forget to shave.. ?  This isn't like you?  How are things going anyway, it's been a few months now, I've been thinking about you lately.\"  Jay just shrugs and rolls up his sleeve to a startled look from Emma before sliding it back down, \"Yea, I didn't sleep well, had some disturbing dreams earlier, but otherwise okay and yea, I think Lola did this to me, that annoying little brat, always playing pranks when my guard is down but I'll get her back.  I think it's some kind of expensive glue so I decided to come here although I feel kind of stupid wasting the doctors time over such a small matter\" Jay says, looking around seeing a few people that are legitimately sick, a woman with a coughing child, an older man rubbing his chest every once in a while and another guy about Jays age that looked like death warmed over.  \"Ah, yes, Lola.. you'd think by now she'd have grown up.. and wow.. that looks like a really expensive prank to pull.  it almost looks.. real.. can I .. touch it?\"  she say, curiosity taking over, sliding back his sleeve despite his protests, rubbing his soft silky fur, which.. Jay had to admit felt pretty good, sending shivers up his spine, having brief flashes of wagging and being petted, shaking it off suddenly, pushing Emma's hand away.   She looked at him more seriously, \"What is it?\"  Jay answered, \"Oh, nothing, sorry, was daydreaming.. I'm still a bit tired, heh.\"   Emma then softened a bit, \"That.. fur, you know.. feels really nice actually.. heh sorry, I know it's bothering you though, I hope they'll have some glue remover and well you mentioned dreams.  I had an odd dream too last night.  Was a weird day in general, some sample of perfume came in although I haven't tried it yet, although my coworker did,  she said it made her light headed.  That's why we're here now.  I hope it wasn't a chemical reaction like an allergy or something.\"  She said, suddenly lost in thought, ignoring the glare from Jay after mentioning how soft the fur was.  He was immediately concerned about the perfume though.  This was just too much of a coincidence he thought.  </span></div></div>",

She would know since she owned a dog, noticing how Jays paws.. er hands.. whatever they were felt very real, the pads even a bit sweaty like a nervous dogs would be.   It was too weird but it would have to wait until she dropped off Becca at her house, and then, it was off to the library.  She suspected something supernatural, like in the horror movies she loved to watch but didn't want Jay teasing her or worse alarming him.  Keeping calm was always the best practice in any situation.  \"Well text me later if you're feeling better okay Jay? Keep in touch\"  she said, leaning in and giving him a kiss on the cheek before heading out with a pale faced red haired girl, short of stature and slim in a loose green outfit.. who's face looked a bit unshaven as well.   \"Emma wait!\" Jay called out but it was too late, she had already walked to her car and left, as Jay wanted to ask about the perfume, completely distracted by the reunion with his childhood friend.  They used to hang out all the time but just didn't anymore due to work and time constraints.  Jay started to walk out but could have sworn he heard a weird sound from around the corner of the hall, like a dog laughing but it was short and only lasted a moment.   He was still wondering how any known drug could give him real pawpads or anything similar but didn't want to alarm Emma.  Maybe he'd take a sidetrip to the library, it stayed open late on the weekends for students and as part of a youth stay out trouble program.  This was too much like something out of one of these cheesy sci fi flicks he had grown up watching with Emma late night on weekends.  Could this be really happening he thought? Maybe he was turning into a werewolf... but.. those aren't real.. are they..?</span></div></div>",
