It's just some roach traps.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Roach traps?\" Ryan echoed, feeling creeped out by even thinking of the scurrying, repulsive insects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe prevention's worth a pound of cure,\" Silas said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan nodded. In addition to the headache, he now experienced some vertigo and felt unsteady on his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Although, there's always the old-fashioned way of dealing with them.\" He lifted one of his work boots and pantomimed bringing it down with a resounding stomp on the lounge tiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demonstration caused some queasy feelings in Ryan's stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilas reached over and gripped Ryan's shoulder. \"You're looking a little green, Mr. Dalton.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, it's Ryan,\" he said yet again, always embarrassed when the big hunk called him Mr. Dalton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, man,\" Silas said and slipped one of the roach traps into Ryan's hand. \"You mind shoving that under the fridge for me? I'll just take care of the boys locker room and leave you to relax.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I don't mind,\" Ryan said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilas grinned and departed.

The teacher, who had been planning a detailed study of insect anatomy, recognized a new peril. As he sank deeper into the sticky substance in the trap, the glue clogged the spiracles on each side of his insect abdomen. The tiny tubes, which carried air to his new form, clogged quickly with the thick glue as Ryan discovered that he was slowly suffocating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough he wished it wasn't the case, he knew nothing about Silas's background and upbringing. In particular, he didn't have a clue to the origins of the man's almost exuberant hatred for the pests that had plagued a difficult childhood growing up in various infested and squalid apartments. His upbringing made Silas a dedicated destroyer of insects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe transformed teacher clacked his mouth-parts together. \"Silas, help me,\" he cried wordlessly. \"I can't breathe...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilas, not the least bit squeamish about handling bugs, responded by plucking the insect from the sticky trap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Ryan rejoiced. \"Thank you for...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Silas turned the cockroach upside down and dunked its upper shell into the glue. He laughed as he then fixed the glue-coated roach upside down on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan kicked all six legs in an effort to right his body. \"Silas, no! What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilas raised himself back up to his full height before he made one last survey of the bug squirming helplessly on the floor. \"I could just have left you in the trap, but this will be more fun... for me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant raised once again one of his janitorial work boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan screamed for mercy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of a sudden stomp, Silas pressed the sole of the boot gently against the hard carapace of the bug. He felt the resistance as he increased the weight on the roach's exoskeleton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't,\" the teacher screamed. \"You mustn't! I'm not a bug!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt the weight of the boot increase steadily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Ryan repeated. \"I'm not a bug!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began to hear his exoskeleton crack and pop as fissures formed at various pressure points. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One less of you ugly bastards for the world to deal with,\" Silas spoke aloud and chuckled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA watery, yellowish fluid seeped from the fissures as Ryan's new form slowly gave way to the inexorable pressure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not a bug!\" Ryan's plea became a mantra. \"I'm not a...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSPLAT!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boot slammed down to the tiles when the resistant pressure of the cockroach's shell gave way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilas lifted the boot. Most of the shattered exoskeleton with its greenish guts, pale yellow blood, and assorted viscera remained on the floor, but some of the demolished remains adhered to the dirty sole of the boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilas lowered the boot's sole back onto the floor and scraped it back and forth over the tiles, getting most of the loathsome goo off his boot. He used a dustpan and hand broom to scrape the rest of Ryan's remains off the tiles and dumped them into a trash can. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe community never figured out the reasons for the admired teacher's disappearance, but Silas did pause to remember the polite, uncoordinated, but handsome-in-his-own-way man. He never had any reason to connect the disappearance of Ryan Dalton with the cockroach that met its demise beneath his work boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
