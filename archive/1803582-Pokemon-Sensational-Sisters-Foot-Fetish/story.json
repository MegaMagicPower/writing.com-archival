We used to just treat the entire third floor as one big house for all of us, but then we started bringing guys home, and...well, this works out better.\" Daisy commented as she stepped in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stepped in behind her, not believing your luck. Sure, you had things going pretty well for yourself. You were a top 20 trainer in the Kanto region, you made good money off your victories in tournaments, and seemed to always be reasonably popular amongst the ladies. But to be going out with THE Daisy Waterflower was something else. Current heir to the massive Waterflower estate and legacy, a prestigious family with an official Kanto Gym to their name. Recently ranked as the 2nd most beautiful woman in Kanto by <i>The Ladies of Kanto</i> magazine, the issue of which featured her doing a memorable six page bikini spread that found a home in the bedroom of just about every teenage male around. And here you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't imagine Lily was too happy about coming in 17th in <i>The Ladies of Kanto</i> last month,\" you quipped, chucking awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's young,\" Daisy replied dismissively, stepping to the left side of the door as you entered. \"Her body hasn't filled out all the way yet. Right now she's just cute. She'll be fine.\" She slipped her feet out of her red flip-flops. You couldn't help but watch this action closely, your mind getting excited at the prospect of seeing her barefoot up close for the first time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since the Sensational Sisters had started their shows a couple years ago, you had made a point to see as many of them as you could. Not for the swimming antics. No, there was more to it than that. You had always been simply captivated by Daisy Waterflower's feet. Feet had always been a point of attraction to you. Who knew why? A crossed wire or some childhood experience perhaps, but even as a child there was something about feet you liked more than anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy's feet in particular drew you in. One of the reasons she was such a fantastic swimmer, no doubt, was the pair of built-in flippers she had on her feet. Her feet were massive. Yet not in an ugly, man-feet sort of way. Even though her feet were huge, perhaps a size twelve or thirteen, they were not at all unattractive. They maintained their femininity and seemed very well taken care of, and you always kept one eye on them during shows. Whenever she did a photo shoot for something, you picked up a copy of the results in the hopes of seeing her barefoot, and she hardly ever disappointed. Her bikini spread the previous month had been like Christmas for you, but for different reasons than most other people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make yourself comfortable,\" she instructed as the lights on the ceiling flickered on and she strode across the red carpet towards the kitchen on the left side of the lounge room. \"I'll get out some wine.\" You couldn't help but notice her red-toenail paint matched perfectly with the carpet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should I take mine off too?\" You asked dully, pointing down at your shoes. Daisy turned around to look at you. \"Do you...do you do the Japanese thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy shrugged. \"I don't care.\" She turned back and walked into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took in a deep breath, then decided it would be polite and kicked your black dress shoes off. A few weeks ago, you met her at the Indigo League tournament during an after-party, and she was wearing white heels. She had been quite impressed with your performance in the tournament and wasted no time with subtly when flirting with you. And yes, part of your mind did recognize how pathetic it was that you could even remember her footwear, or had even bothered to think about it, when she was hitting on you so viciously, but fetishes are fetishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat yourself down on the couch, mind still racing with thoughts of feet. The first date had been to a particularly fancy restaurant, she wore brown ankle boots. The second date, a history museum, platform sandals. And tonight, finally, your patience was rewarded with a pair of flip-flops for a beach stroll. You snuck glances whenever you felt you could, but clearly you were doing something right. After all, you were here now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Red or white?\" Daisy called from the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, I don't drink,\" you said, leaning back against the back of the couch. \"What do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't drink either. I was hoping you would know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you have wine then?\" You asked, smirking to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno. It seemed like a good thing to have.\" She paused. \"I have grape juice. Isn't wine made from grapes? What's the difference?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...well, I'm sure the process is a little different, and grape juice doesn't have alcohol in it.\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I watched a thing on TV a couple weeks ago about how wine gets made. A bunch of grapes get put in a giant bucket and people stomp on them barefoot.\" Daisy came out of the kitchen, holding two bottles of grape soda in her hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bit your lower lip. Could...could she...no, how could she know? There was no way. It was a coincidence. Still, you started to sweat a little bit and could feel yourself getting riled up. You needed a topic change, fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought it looked sort of fun, but that's weird, isn't it?\" She sat down heavily next to you, handing you one of the bottles, crossing her legs underneath her. \"I mean, it's really kind of gross. When you're drinking wine, you're drinking something that someone had their feet in.\" She twisted the cap off her bottle and took a sip. \"Well, they probably have rules. I hope you have to clean your feet and take good care of them to do something like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...yeah, I'm sure they do.\" You smiled nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, she stuck her right foot straight out in front of her towards the large TV in front of the couch, flexing it around and wiggling her toes. \"I have nice feet, don't I?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groaned slightly. This wasn't fair. This was cruel. Your could feel your libido rising, but didn't dare look away from the sight of her wriggling foot. This sort of thing didn't happen all the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" you choked out, nodding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take good care of them too-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So! How's swimming going...lately?\" You blurted out, desperate to steer the conversation away from feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, really good, although...Violet did break my lap record a couple days ago.\" Daisy took another sip from the bottle. \"Had that record for months now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm sure you'll get it back.\" You took your own sip from the grape juice bottle, trying to relax your body again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I give her a hard time, tell her she's cheating.\" Daisy giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, she has webbed toes.\" Daisy smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-webbed toes?\" You repeated, face going taut as you lowered the bottle from your lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you know?\" She swung her right foot back onto the couch, resting it just a few inches away from your thigh, and spread her toes out wide. As you watched in rapt fascination, she bent her body forward and pointed at the small flap of skin between her big toe and second toe. \"She's got a little bit of extra skin right here, it goes up a little further, so they're a little more like flippers. She has them all the way down her foot.\" She pointed at the spaces between all of the toes on her right foot. \"Both feet. It looks pretty weird, but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay okay! You win! I surrender!\" You jumped up, face going red, hands nervously playing with the bottle. \"You win! You got me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy went slightly red herself, a blank expression on her face. \"I win what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did it! You got me more wound up than a music box! My motor is running on all cylinders!\" You responded, reaching up to tug at the collar of your dress shirt to release some heat. \"I can hardly remember my brother's name right now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued to blink dimly up at you, saying nothing, a look of concern on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I have a foot fetish, and yes, your feet are mesmerizing! I don't know how you figured it out, but you got me cracked like an egg!\" You shouted. \"...sorry, sorry! It's just...that was mean!\" You plopped back down on the couch. \"It's one thing to see them in magazines, but to be a couple feet away from them? I...damn, my head is spinning!\" You took in a deep breath. \"So is this the part where you kick me out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...you like my feet?\" Daisy asked, glancing down at her large, red toenail-painted left foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're amazing,\" You muttered. \"Breathtaking. Just like the rest of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you would be in to...worshipping them?\" Daisy raised an eyebrow. \"Like kissing them? Sucking on my toes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mouth fell open slightly and you looked over at her. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" Daisy crossed her arms over her chest. \"Are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a moment for you to process the question, and you finally croaked out the answer. \"Y-yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" she swung both her legs out from under her and planted her feet on your lap, laying back on the couch. \"Let's not beat around the bush!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gaped down at her massive, spectacular feet, than looked up at her smirking face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a lot to learn about women. Here's a tip: Most of us <i>love</i> the idea of having our feet worshipped by a man. Now, don't disappoint.\" She wiggled her toes back and forth again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou...</span></div></div>",

Slowly, you started to kiss the top of it. You moved up and down it, your lips touching down on every bit of skin. You could hear her moaning and noted with satisfaction her toes were wiggling back and forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're...you're good at that...\" she muttered, closing her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continued, making sure no spot on the top of her foot went un-kissed, moving all the way up to her ankle before you were satisfied. Shifting yourself slightly away from her, you took a hold of her ankle in both hands and started eagerly kissing her sole. This really drove her wild. She gripped the couch on either side of her and started to shiver in ecstasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer soles were so soft and fleshy, like a firm marshmallow. This was as good as you had even imagined in your dreams. You could press your face a little bit into her sole and it would give a couple centimeters, as if you were pressing your face into a pile. You left deep, tender kisses on every part of her foot that you could, the mixture of giggles and moans coming from Daisy turning you on and letting you know you were doing a good job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-don't...don't stop...\" she groaned, still shivering slightly, body shifting around in response to your kisses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gained some confidence and started to french right in the middle of her sole, the loud gasp and sudden jump from Daisy letting you know you were moving in the right direction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohmigod!\" She gasped as your tongue started to make contact with her sole. \"Oh...oh...\" she started to pant, being driven wild by desire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you left a soft kiss on each of her five toes and set her right foot down, watching with a smile as she came down from her high and slowly opened her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked down at her left foot, still untouched by you, waiting for her to prompt you to act.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still not enough?\" She teased, flexing her left bare foot back and spreading her red-painted toes. \"How about we mix it up a little bit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you have in mind?\" You asked, eagerly awaiting her instructions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Daisy put her right index finger up to her chin... \"How about...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"...you massage my left foot for awhile, and when you're done you get a reward?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded silently, hands grabbing her left foot. You had been waiting for a moment like this for a long time. Of course you weren't going to go around to strangers, or even casual acquaintances, and ask to touch their feet. No, your fetish needed to wait on the backburner, for a serious girlfriend, if not a spouse. It was going to be years, and you knew it, which was a reality difficult for you to accept. But you had accepted it, and now here you were. You began by stroking the top of her foot with your fingers, moving from her ankle to her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've done this before, I take it?\" She winked at you as you continued to stroke the top of her foot, as if you were trying to squeeze something in her foot out her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've...I've read articles online,\" you mumbled. She giggled. Grabbing her toes with your left hand, you pulled them back and pressed your thumb into the ball of her foot right beneath  her toes. You started rotating your thumb in a circle on that spot. She moaned and threw her head back, long blonde hair haphazardly splaying about around her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh! OOOOOH!\" She grunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do know what I'm doing, if that's what you mean.\" You made a couple more small circles before moving to another spot on the outside of her foot, just below her toes, and repeating the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clearly!\" She gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou repeated this small circle process all the way down her sole, applying extra pressure to her heel when you got there, each pressure point drawing gasps of pleasure from the gorgeous blonde. Lifting the foot slightly up in the air, you started to rotate it around at the ankle. You did this about five times one way, then rotated it back the other way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't just a rub...I feel like I'm getting a professional massage!\" Daisy muttered. You started to knead her sole with your left fist, pressing your balled hand into her soft foot with firm pressure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I...I try,\" you answered, taking in the feel of your fist sinking into her fleshy sole. God, her feet were something else. You had always hoped that your eventual girlfriends and wife would have decent feet, maybe you'd make sure they took care of them, but to have such an amazing pair right off the bat...it was more than you could have hoped for. You weren't going to squander this opportunity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you pinched her pinky toe between your thumb and index finger and gently rolled it back and forth. You loved the rich red toenail paint on each of her toes, a dark cherry that contrasted perfectly with her pale white foot. She groaned impudently as you rolled the toe back and forth, the other toes on her foot flexing around. Slowly, you moved down her foot, all the way up to her big toe, giving it a couple of twists back and forth before leaving a kiss right in the middle of her sole and ending your massage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, a promise is a promise!\" Daisy said, sitting up and placing her feet down on the ground. \"So...what sort of reward should I give you...\"</span></div></div>",

But you held back for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pants off!\" She instructed energetically. You wasted no time in pulling your tan dress pants down, exposing your black boxers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, don't be shy.\" She pointed down at your boxers. Shame and trepidation cast to the winds, you ripped those down your legs too, exposing your already erect, eight-inch long member.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there!\" She placed her feet on your stomach, letting her large soles rub back and forth softly on your dress shirt. \"I've never done one of these before...but I suppose there's a first time for everything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-are you...going to give me a footjob?\" You asked slowly, staring at her feet. You were so excited by this you didn't even stop for a moment to consider the fact that her dexterity was probably limited and she might end up hurting your dick in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not? You'd like that, right? You're okay with that?\" Daisy moved down your body slightly so her feet were now on either side of your crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-of course! Yes, please!\" You enthused, a massive grin breaking out on your face that you couldn't contain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave your shaft a small nudge with her left big toe to tease you, then stood up from the couch. \"Well, I suppose I should get some lotion first. Don't go anywhere.\" She spun around and skipped off to her bedroom, leaving you there on the floor with your pants and boxers down and a throbbing dick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou closed your eyes for a few seconds, mind racing. You had dreamed of this more than once. Six months ago, you had a dream where you were a powerful Sheik and Daisy was one of your harem girls, giving you an amazing footjob while singing about your manliness. You woke up feeling extremely silly, but requiring a change of sheets all the same. Now, reality had a chance to compare to the dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, you opened your eyes. You had been daydreaming for longer than you thought. Daisy was sitting back on the couch above you, legs crossed so her feet were pointing up, rubbing a generous amount of lotion into her soles. Just watching her do this turned you on even more. God you were easy to turn on!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright...sorry in advance if I mess up.\" She lowered her large feet down to your dick, your dick straining upwards as if it was longing for those feet to make contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, they made contact with either side of your shaft and started gently stroking it up and down. She was using the insides of her soles to massage your dick, the lotion making it go smoothly. She was slow and delicate, careful not to accidentally hurt you. From the very second she started, you were in heaven. Her warm, soft feet going up and down on your dick was the greatest feeling you had ever known. All others thoughts were driven from your mind as she stimulated your member to full-erection. The only lingering thought you had was to try to hold back on your orgasm, try to impress her with your endurance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't so bad,\" she said, picking her right foot up slightly and letting her sole rub back and forth on your tip. You shuddered at the sensation that was sent through your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-don't...don't stop...\" you moaned, eyes closed, hands at either side of your body gripping the carpet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe placed your shaft inbetween her big and second toe on her left foot and started slowly using that to stroke it up and down. You felt a few drops of precum leak out and heard her giggle as the white liquid pooled up on her toes. It was coming, and soon you wouldn't be able to stop it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started to rub her soles against your ballsack, a new move that stimulated you even further and grew a surprised gasp. She giggled again, enjoying your spastic reactions to her handiwork. She started playfully rubbing her toes against your balls as well, and you were ready to peak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you were ready to let it go, she started rubbing her left foot under your ballsack while using the right one to stroke the tip of your penis back and forth. Your eyeballs rolled into the back of your head, and you felt a stream of semen squirt up into her sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh!\" She exclaimed, feeling the cum drench her foot. \"You were certainly loaded tonight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had no response. The orgasm had completely taken over your body, flooding it with sensational feelings of delight. You just laid there for several seconds after the semen had finished squirting out, breathing hard, letting your head clear before you even thought of doing anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope I did okay. I've never done something like that before,\" Daisy said as you slowly propped yourself up into a sitting position. She tossed you a medium sized handtowel from next to her on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was...that was amazing,\" you responded, grabbing the towel and reaching up to wipe Daisy's feet of excess lotion and your semen. You went up and down both her feet several times with the towel, making sure both were clean. Then you quickly wiped your crotch off before folding the towel up and setting it down on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have to read some articles online to find out how to give a better one,\" she said, folding her feet back underneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd spend six hours worshipping your feet if that was the reward.\" You stood up, still staring at her, in partial disbelief over what just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what I think?\" Daisy smirked naughtily at you. \"I think this relationship might work out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou beamed. This was going so well, not even in your wildest dreams did you imagine this scenario playing out. You were maintaining a reasonable goal of just having a few month-long fling, maybe play with her feet once or twice, and that would be it. But...but this...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got any gas left in the tank, sport?\" She raised an eyebrow seductively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, speechless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she leapt up and threw her arms around your neck, giving you a deep kiss right on the lips. Your eyes flew open as you returned the kiss, your tongues dancing around in each other's mouths for several seconds before she pulled away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make love to me,\" she said huskily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took the initiative, pushing her back onto the couch and poising yourself over her, then falling down on her and rolling over so she could be on top, as you two began to kiss again, and you began to violently take off her clothes. Yes, this relationship was going to work out alright.</span></div></div>",

Daisy slowly returned her Seel to her pokeball, casually putting it back on her belt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, congrats! Come with me, I'll get you a cascade badge.\" She waved you to come forward, turning around as she did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on,\" you said, causing her to pause midstep. \"What about the rest of our arrangement? We had a bet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, she turned back around, a nervous smile on her face. \"O-of course, I'll get you two season passes to our shows-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That wasn't our bet.\" You shook your head. \"You know what our bet was. And I have witnesses.\" You glanced over at Lily and Violet, sitting on a bench on the side of the pokemon battle arena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wait, you were serious?\" Daisy asked, recoiling slightly from you. \"I...I-I thought you were joking. I mean who could <i>possibly</i> want to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not your concern,\" you interrupted. \"We had a bet. Since you seem to have forgotten the terms, I'll help you out. If you were able to win our pokemon battle and only used one pokemon to beat three of mine, I would clean every pokemon tank in the gym for free. If I won, and only used one pokemon to beat three of yours, I'd get an hour to do whatever I wanted to your feet. And I won the bet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I thought it was like...an euphemism, you know?\" She put her hands out to her sides, sweatdropping. \"Those season passes are worth thousands of dollars, they're the most valuable thing I can give you! Don't tell me you'd rather-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's exactly what I'm saying.\" You crossed your arms over your chest. \"You agreed to the bet. Enthusiastically, might I add.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...ah...\" she glanced around, long blonde hair fluttering around her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's right, you know,\" Lily said, placing her hand on Daisy's right shoulder. Daisy spun around. Her sisters had come up behind her while she was attempting to negotiate her way out of the bet. \"You did make the bet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your own fault,\" Violet added. \"You're really not much of a trainer, shouldn't have made the bet. You really hate cleaning those tanks, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy glanced down at her shoes, then spun around back to face you, scowling. \"Well, you know what? I refuse! Ew!\" she shouted. \"I'm not letting you...what made you think I would ever...ew! I'll get you your badge, I'll get you season passes, but I am <i>not</i>-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Violet and Lily both grabbed Daisy from behind, wrestling her down onto the floor. Violet wrapped her arms around her torso, pinning her arms to her sides, while Lily grabbed her legs and wrapped them up. They stood up, gripping her tightly as she tried to squirm away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Waterflower Sisters always honor their bets,\" Violet said, keeping Daisy pinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give us ten minutes to set her up?\" Lily asked, turning to look at you with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come up to the second floor in a bit,\" she said, as the two guided the struggling older sister away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One hour,\" Violet said, standing to the right of a yellow door in the hallway of the second floor of the gym. \"That was the bet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feet only,\" Lily added from the left of the door. \"We'll be watching on a webcam. You touch her anywhere else, the bet is broken.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks girls.\" You stepped forward to stand in front of the door. \"Thanks for the help, I kinda...figured she'd put up a fuss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's only fair.\" Violet nodded. \"She should hold up her end of the bet. Her fault.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, she's going to hate it,\" Lily said, giggling. \"You're a foot fan I take it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely,\" you replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we'll have to exchange phone number,\" she said slyly. \"I've always wanted to feel what it was like to have a man worship my feet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glanced down at her white flipflops. She removed her right foot from one of them and wiggled her toes at you before slipping it back in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll talk later,\" you said, feeling your face go slightly red. \"I'll be back soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you opened the door quietly and slipped through, silently shutting it behind you. On entering, you were greeted by the sight of...</span></div></div>",

That implied they were fighting back. They certainly weren't. And it was a truly beautiful site.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were in your fortress, a massive flying cube-shaped ship, almost casually floating in the sky over what was formerly Cerulean City. Two things were happening. First, the ship itself was launching attack after attack down on the structures, fire blasts and electric assaults seen from only the most powerful pokemon in the world. Buildings were being burned to the ground or knocked over into rubble. The local police station had already been destroyed, and the few remaining members of the local law enforcement team were already running in a mad panic. On the ground, a team of pokemon assembled in the very bowels of hell itself were running rampant through the streets, brutally murdering every single human or pokemon encountered. Machamps, Alakazams, Rhydons, and assorted other pokemon of extreme power were taking no prisoners. All according to your plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time national defenses showed up, there would be nothing left of the town and every single person who had previously resided in there would be dead. And it would have taken only half an hour. An entire major city reduced to rubble. That would be more than enough to at least get them to take you seriously. They might try to fight back, at least a little bit, see what you really had. But nothing they could do would put so much as a dent in you. You knew this. You had been planning this for years. Before long, the entire world would have no choice but to give in to your demands, lofty though they may be. You would rule the world, just like the kings and emperors of the old days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door across the room slid open, revealing a tall beautiful blonde, wearing a red swimsuit that was still slightly damp. She dashed in, big bare feet slapping against the hard floor, making her way over to your throne in the middle of the chamber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just in time,\" you remarked dryly as she ran over, arms pumping at her sides as she closed the distance between her and you. When she was about ten feet away, you lazily raised your left hand at her, and in the next instance she collided full-on into what seemed to be an invisible wall. She fell backwards onto her back, groaning slightly and shaking her head. \"I don't recall giving you permission to approach me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"STOP!\" She yelled, scrambling into a standing position. \"What are you doing?! Just...stop!\" She looked at you defiantly, scowling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, so you saw my handiwork on the screens outside?\" You smirked. \"Beautiful, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! It's horrible! You have to stop now!\" She insisted, looking up at the massive screen you were still staring at. \"Please, you've done too much already, just...stop!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sometimes, for true greatness to occur, sacrifices must be made. And your hometown, I'm afraid, is the sacrificial lamb.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy's mouth fell open, looking up at the giant screen in confusion. \"W-what are you trying to do?! I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You world needs leadership. A single voice to lead everyone else. There's so much confusion in the world, we need things to be simpler. Me, a man of my powers and abilities, I'm that single voice. Unfortunately, sometimes you have to take such a mantle by force,\" you answered. \"So, I'm going to show your world exactly what I can do. And when I'm done, they'll give me everything I want. This is just me making a powerful statement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to run at you again, but you simply raised your hand at her again and she found herself frozen on the spot, unable to move a muscle. With a flick of your wrist she was thrown back to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please...sir, I don't know who you are, or...what happened to you to...I don't know. But please, think about what you're doing. You're killing thousands of people and destroying millions in property.\" She slowly got back up to her feet, looking at you now imploringly. \"Please. I'm begging you, reconsider.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's too late.\" You pointed up at the screen. \"In less than five minutes there won't be anything left of Cerulean. It will be a memory. In fact, of the thousands who were in the city when I launched my attack, only three will remain alive.\" With that, you turned to look at Daisy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-...sir. Please. I'll do anything, just stop.\" She clasped her hands together in front of her, looking at you with big, pleading eyes. \"Sir, I'm begging you. I'll do anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're my prisoner. You'll be following my orders no matter what. Now, I've chosen to take you and your two sisters alive. The Waterflower heirs will no doubt make valuable hostages in the event that my show outside isn't enough to convince the world leaders of how serious I am.\" You paused dramatically. \"But that's not the only reason I kept you alive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy looked down at the ground, shivering slightly, starting to choke out little sobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DON'T!\" You said harshly, which shocked her right out of her crying. \"Do not cry, I'm talking to you, pay attention.\" You cleared your throat. \"I am a man mostly unfettered by the vices and obsessions of other humans, but one thing has always sucked me in.\" She stood there, still shaking, but listening. \"The Sensational Sisters of Cerulean City. Beautiful and talented. I confess, somewhat shamefully, I've always been rather obsessed with you three. But you, Daisy, in particular. Your beauty is unmatched in all the world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mouth fell slightly open and she looked down at the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I decided I needed to forcefully take over the world, I knew I had to have you three at my disposal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D...disposal...\" her eyes flew open and she unconsciously took a step back. \"You...you wouldn't-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! My sweet, I suppose I can understand you having a low opinion of me at the moment, but...but trust me, that is beneath me.\" You snickered. \"No, nothing so debauched, trust me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I don't understand.\" She looked down at her feet, voice meek and trembling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't want to say never, but...no, I have something else in mind. I've always been fond of one particular act, arguably sexual in nature, but certainly nothing like...well, what you were thinking.\" You nodded. \"I'm not entirely proud of this, but I suppose now, nobody can judge me. Tickling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this word, her pale skin went red and she unconsciously curled her toes. \"...what?\" She said in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tickle torture. There's just...so much to like. It's truly a form of torture if used on the right person in the right way, and gives a true feeling of power and domination over the victim. It leaves no marks and can go on for very long.\" You smirked. \"And you in particular, but also your sisters, will make lovely tickle slaves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W...w-well, I don't know about them,\" Daisy said loudly, hands firmly clasped at her sides. \"But I'm...I'm not ticklish anywhere, so you're wasting your time.\" She nodded furiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laughed. \"Please. In case you haven't noticed, I'm psychic. I knew every single thing about you the moment I made eye contact with you. Every thought, every memory, everything.\" You enjoyed watching her squirm under your gaze. \"Besides, no girl as beautiful as you could possibly not be ticklish.\" You closed your eyes. \"Why...yes, countless memories of when you were nine, ten, eleven years old. Bossy elder sister, Violet and Lily often put you in your place. Violet would jump you and hold your ankles down, Lily would run her nails all over your soles until you said you were sorry. The younger sisters have to stick together, I see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was...I was young-\" Daisy mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you still trying to convince me you're not ticklish?\" You glared at Daisy. \"Three months ago you took a guy home on a date. He tickled your foot during a foot massage and nearly caused you to pass out, then got you to spasm like a bronco with a rib and waist tickle when you tried to teach him how to dance. Stop wasting your time. You're as ticklish as a newborn baby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you snapped your fingers, and Daisy's arms were suddenly raised high above her head with her wrists locked together. Her legs went up, knees getting pressed against her chest, feet sticking straight out. Out of nowhere, a basket appeared underneath her bottom, and a collection of thin ropes began to wrap around her. They went around her wrists, your powers holding her arms far above her head. Her ankles resting on the rim of the basket, some ropes tied her feet down to that rim, and others went through her toes and pulled them back as well, so she couldn't even move her feet. She tried to squirm but could hardly move in her new position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now...how shall I break you in?\"</span></div></div>",

That sounds like good documentation to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man on the other end of the conversation sighed. \"We've been through all this before, Ms. Waterflower. We need detailed data on the battle for our trainer statistics. Pokemon used, knockouts, battle progression, time, video recordings...this is not the 1960s, badges alone don't cut it anymore. And that's to say nothing of badge forgery. This is the fourth month in a row we haven't gotten your report, and without those reports we are entirely at the mercy of forged badges, plus our entire operation looks unprofessional without the complete set of data!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small, skinny man came up to Daisy and tapped her right knee. Slowly, Daisy pulled her right bare foot out of the hot, bubbling basin of water in front of her chair and placed it up on the cushioned bar in front of her. The man picked up a medium sized towel and started drying her foot and lower leg off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, like, we're very busy!\" Daisy insisted. \"I mean, gym leader is just part of what we do. We have all the shows, the modeling, the...the-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's really not our problem,\" the man cut her off. \"None of the other gym leaders have this problem. I've been working here for eight years and the Cerulean Gym is the only Gym in Kanto to ever submit so much as a single report late. You are now four reports behind, and I'm sure you remember our conversation about a majority of your previous reports not being up to standard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man at Daisy's feet started to scrape dead skin off the left side of her right big toe. Daisy sunk back into the chair slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look. We know the rules of pokemon battles, we follow them, and if a trainer beats us they get the Cascade badge. I really feel like, in light of all of our other activities, many of which do contribute to the Pokemon League in terms of money and recognition, little problems with the reports-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps so,\" the man interrupted yet again. \"But there's a big difference between reports with small problems and reports that don't even exist. You've told us a dozen times that you're almost done with the report from four months ago, and it's very important that we get that data before the tournament starts next month. We are not some mom-and-pop organization. Hundreds of millions of dollars go into the league, and any gaps in our data make us look bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy grunted. \"Well, like, it's really hard to go back and-\" Daisy stopped to jerk her foot back as the man ran his small nail file against her sole, just below her big toe. \"Hey, careful. I'm really ticklish,\" she whispered, smirking as she put her large foot back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't like it?\" the man asked in a thickly accented voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I hate it,\" she said, nevertheless smirking and sticking her tongue out at the man as he went back to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" The man on the phone said irately. \"Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, I'm still here,\" Daisy said. \"It's hard to go back and find all the data from months ago, okay? You have to go all the way back in the video logs, watch the whole fight, take notes, snip the video clip out...it's a real pain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then start making the reports right after the battles!\" The other snapped. \"Look, I'm getting the sense that you're not taking this very seriously. Being a Gym Leader is a responsibility and a privilege, and for your services as one the Pokemon League does pay you and your sisters millions of dollars a year. I know you don't want to lose that money or status.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not too worried about that,\" Daisy said casually, looking down at the nails of her right hand. The man tapped her right knee again, and she raised it up towards the ceiling so her foot was flat against the cushion. The man started to paint her toenails a bright red. \"I've seen the polls, the Cerulean Sisters are the most popular gym leaders in Kanto and it's not close.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a long pause on the phone as the man started work on her toenails. \"What exactly is that supposed to mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you keep talking about money, and I'm sure you understand that you'd lose a lot of money if you suddenly got rid of your most popular gym leaders. I do read those pamplets you send out every month, you know. Fifty-eight percent of trainers polled say that we're their favorite gym, and sixty-five percent say we're the ones they'd like to see more of in promotional material regarding the league.\" Daisy switched the phone to the right side of her face. \"I know you think I'm just some dumb blonde, but I know what our leverage is, and it's high.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother long pause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are you implying?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll get the reports when you get them. Me and my sisters are all very busy, and most of our work is good for the league. And pestering me three times a week about it is not going to help get it done any faster.\" The man at her feet grabbed her lower leg gently and pulled it out so her sole was pointed outwards again. \"Now, I'm in the middle of something, so I really need to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, Ms. Waterflower,\" the man replied coldly. \"I'll report your responses to my superiors and we'll take whatever action we deem necessary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do that,\" Daisy said, hanging up as the man picked up a flat stone with steam coming off it from the table next to him and pressed it against her bare sole. She sighed contentedly, sinking further into the chair and closing her eyes. \"Anal-retentive pencilnecks,\" she said to herself. \"Life's too short for reports.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Red,\" Lily deadpanned as Daisy kicked her white slippers off by the door. \"How creative.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just because it doesn't look good on you,\" Daisy replied. \"The geeks at the league called me again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was it Warren again?\" Violet asked. The two younger sisters of Daisy were seated on the couch in the middle of the room, Lily playing with her smartphone and Violet reading a magazine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who else could it be?\" Daisy said, raising her arms up into the air and bending her waist to her left, stretching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's six times in ten days,\" Violet said. \"I think you two are now officially dating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The tournament starts in a month,\" Daisy said, stretching to her right. \"They want all our reports by then. We might want to get on that. Tomorrow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily shook her head. \"I'm doing a photo shoot in the morning and I'm going on a late night show.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViolet looked up at the ceiling. \"I've got a date.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy shrugged. \"A month is a long time, it won't be a big deal. Just whenever you can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm booked up for awhile,\" Lily said. \"I'm starting dancing lessions three times a week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy smirked. \"Dancing? Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems like it might be fun,\" Lily replied. \"So I dunno, we'll see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViolet cleared her throat. \"I don't have much going on this weekend, maybe I'll punch some win-loss data into the system. After this weekend I'm starting horse-riding lessons so who knows?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'll be great,\" Daisy said, giving her a double thumbs-up. \"It should at least be enough to shut the pokemon league dweebs up.\" Daisy walked over to the fat chair to the left of the couch and plopped down into it heavily, propping her feet up on the ottoman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy wakes up...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Daisy's eyes fluttered open, and then immediately flew wide as she realized something was very wrong. She attempted to move her arms, then kick her legs, but neither moved more than a centimeter or two. As she got her wits, she was finally able to make some sense of her very strange predicament. She was in her bra and panties, like she was when she went to bed, but that's all that was familiar. She was in a very dark room, not able to make out very much around her, but more alarming was her position. Her arms were bound up above her head, slightly bent at the elbows, wrists and upper arms strapped tightly in place. Her legs were also strapped down to some sort of frame, legs slightly bent behind her so her entire body was arched back in a C shape, like a partial hogtie. Bindings at her ankles, just above and below her knees, and thighs prevented any real movement. To top it off, she was suspended in midair, hanging from the frame she was tied to, hips pointing down towards the ground. She tried to move again, but succeeded only in causing the frame to rotate slightly back and forth. Straps around her waist and chest completed her bondage, and she was certainly not going anywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanicking, she tried to scream, but the sound was muffled beyond any hope of being heard. A rubber ball gag was in her mouth, forcing her lips open and wedged between her front teeth, capped off with a rubber piece in her mouth that kept her tongue down. Panicking, she frantically starting thrashing, but again could only manage rocking back and forth so her stomach and thighs would become the point on her body closest to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the lights in the room flickered on, a series of powerful white lights emitting from the ceiling. She blinked a few times as her eyes watered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, now, Ms. Waterflower, don't waste your energy. You'll be needing it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to turn her head to the right, where she heard the voice, but found her head was locked into place, forced to stare forward. She tried to say something, but it was of course lost behind the gag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have nothing to say that I want to hear, for the time being,\" the voice said. \"You've done enough talking to my employers over the past several months. We know the things you have to say, you've said them more than we stand to hear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a tall thin man wearing a black trenchcoat and black leather gloves walked into her view. Daisy felt a shiver run down her spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The pokemon league is often buried in a sea of red tape and paperwork, but when you push the right buttons you can get things done very, very quickly.\" He spread is arms to his sides slowly. \"Daisy Waterflower, you have pushed the right buttons. Not an hour after your latest phone call concluded were they calling me in and telling me what needed to happen. I must say, your challenge is a new one. The league hasn't encountered a problem like you before. So the solution needs to be equally creative.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy broke out into a cold sweat and started shivering. She knew that the pokemon league was upset, and knew they were a nine figure organization...but she didn't think they would ever do something like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't really want to seriously hurt you. You are, after all, a tremendous asset to the league. But we can not tolerate your recent behavior.\" He slowly walked off to the right of Daisy's vision before disappearing. She tensed up as soon as she couldn't see him anymore, terrified of what would come next. \"Fortunately, you provided us with an ideal solution on the phone today without knowing it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her mild relief, he re-appeared, pushing a three foot tall cabinet on wheels across the tiled floor. The mystery contents of the cabinet quickly restored fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Waterflower, on the phone today, I believe you mentioned that you 'hated tickling'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this line, Daisy's eyes widened further. The mystery man opened the top of the mystery cabinet and reached down into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been sent here to put that claim to the test.\" His hands re-emerged holding a series of small tubes. \"Unconventional, but ultimately a very strong solution. He began to slip the devices onto the ends of his fingers, revealing each ended in a little metal sphere at the tip. Daisy started screaming into her gag and shaking back and forth, trying her best to shake her head as well but ultimately failing. He shrugged. \"Come now, it was either this or sticking you in a coffin filled with tarantulas. Yes, we actually discussed that one. Surely this is better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Daisy kept shaking back and forth though, she wasn't so sure about that. She had countless memories of being tickled during the first nineteen years of her life, none of them pleasant. Her sisters, parents and other relatives could draw violent shrieks from her with a simple finger stroking across her bare feet, or a pinch on her tummy, or a quick rib squeeze. Sometimes an uncle would pick her up and torment her stomach and ribs until she earned her freedom by squirming and kicking away, howling the whole time. And of course, the handful of times a group of people coordinated enough to have her held down, it was absolutely terrible. Cruel fingers poking and prodding every possible spot, causing her to scream like a banshee and laugh like a maniac.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would have liked to believe she had outgrown her extreme childhood ticklishness, but that wasn't true either. She had a boyfriend not even six months ago who possessed devilishly roaming fingers that took every opportunity to exploit her most sensitive spots, and she still couldn't handle it. As the man finished securing the strange devices to his fingers and held them up in front of her, she redoubled her efforts to shake free and scream through her gag. Slowly, he walked out of her field of vision, causing her to tense up again. Her position wasn't helping her state of mind either. She was a pretty flexible girl and didn't have a problem with her arched position, it was nothing she wasn't trained to handle, but she was very much aware that every single sensitive spot on her body was completely open and entirely helpless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you really believe that the pokemon league, an organization that is rapidly approaching billion dollar a year status, would invest in anything but the very best bondage equipment?\" The man asked from behind her. She felt a knot in her stomach. He was right behind her. \"You couldn't escape from that frame in a decade. Speaking of which...let's see, the time is 11:43 PM...we'll plan for a 6:00 AM finish, sound good to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Daisy tried to give another gutteral screech and bucked even harder, rotating back and forth on the frame so much she nearly managed to get her face pointed down at the ground. The man grabbed the frame and forced it back into a position so her knees were pointed down at the floor and her feet would be pointing right up at him, then pulled a lever on the right side of it to lock it into place. She tried shaking again, but this time couldn't budge it so much as a centimeter. Dread filling her body, she was well aware that both her massive soles were pointed upwards and she would be completely unable to protect them in any way from this man. Whimpering, she finally stopped struggling and clenched her eyes shut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing happened for several seconds, each of those seconds increasing the fear that racked Daisy's body and making her feel more and more ticklish. She scrunched her toes up and tried flexing her feet upward, figuring that was the best defense she could offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweat ran down her body and dripped off at her knees, falling to the floor and pooling on the tile. Her stomach kept tying more and more knots the longer nothing happened.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Finally, she felt a cold point touch her heel and run down her wrinkled sole, flinching as much as she could before just barely managing to supress a giggle. Soon, a series of strokes were running down both of her soles in rapid succession, no doubt the tips of the finger attachments. She attempted to flex her feet the other way, flattening them out just to escape the strokes for a quarter-second, but this only opened up the entire sole for this man to play with. Then, she lost control over whether or not her feet were flexed, the sensations rocketing from her large soles up to her brain, stimulating them like never before. Laughter erupted from her throat and was stifled by the effective gag, and Daisy focused all her remaining energy in a futile attempt to thrust forward, away from the sadistic finger attachments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe screamed and howled as ticklish sensations overtook her, neverending strokes from her torturer robbing her of all logical thought processes. No normal fingers could tickle half this effectively. It was like every single nerve ending in her feet were being individually isolated and tickled. In a brief moment of lucidity, she cursed herself for just getting a pedicure, thinking this might be five percent more tolerable without one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Freshly pedicured,\" the man purred, slowing down and synchronizing his strokes along both soles. \"It doesn't get any better. Your feet are so big, so much surface area to stimulate, I really could spend six hours just doing this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he started drawing tiny circles with two fingers right on the ball of her foot. Daisy screamed into the gag and wrenched her ankles against their restraints. That spot in particular drove her up the wall. She shook back and forth like she was being electrocuted, mad laughter getting stuck behind the gag. She was sure six hours of this would cause her to lose her mind and never get it back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the tickle assault stopped. She panted through her nose, taking in as much oxygen as she could during the respite. She flinched as she felt him grab her left foot, but all he did was wrap something around her second toe. She felt her foot get flexed back, making her sole taut. She tried to flex it forward but found herself unable. She began to panic as she realized that he was tying her toes back so she couldn't scrunch her feet, meaning her sensitive soles would be completely exposed and open, with no hope of defensive wrinkles, and there would be nothing she could do about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could spend too much time dreading this, her other foot was similarly flexed back before she could even think to resist. And then, as suddenly as it had stopped, the tickling resumed. She cackled like a madwoman into her gag and flinched forward as the leisurely strokes picked right back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweat kept pooling up beneath her as her body became drenched in her own fluids, every now and then joined by tears that rained down from the inside corners of her clenched eyes. Every single individual stroke of the finger tools was like a branding iron on her sole, for all the agony it caused her. Her wails were so muted by the gag that she was dimly able to make out what the man was saying as he worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Over the years, the pokemon league has gone through extreme measures, at times, to maintain their sterling reputation in the world. When there's this much money involved, money always comes before morals. You may be the Queen of Kanto, Daisy Waterflower, but it's time for you to remember that the Queen is just a playing piece on our board.\" He started playfully scratching the pads of Daisy's toes with his finger tools, and she responded with a satisfactory yelp followed by the unmistakable sound of muted laughter. \"No one is bigger than the league. Not even you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was more than ready to give in. Really, she was. She was ready to give in as soon as she was threatened with tickle torture. Now? She would have done anything to make it stop. Convincing her to finish her overdue reports would have been easy. As he snuck his fingers between her toes and toyed with the webs of flesh in there, which managed to pull out a fresh scream before she melted into little hiccups of laughter, she couldn't manage to think of something she wouldn't do just to make the tickling stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't even get enough air to laugh anymore. As her super-sensitive feet were tortured, all she could do is spasm back and forth with her head hanging, every now and then managing a barely audible giggle. He kept her in this state for a few minutes, then abruptly stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took in massive gasps of air through her nose, stomach hurting from laughing so much, lungs burning from being denied enough oxygen. She was dizzy. Without even really thinking about it, she released her bladder and peed through her panties, urine joining all the sweat on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't tell me you're broken already,\" the man said. \"Pee already? It's not even midnight yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy was zoned out, just hanging there somewhere between consciousness and unconsciousness, not understanding what her torturer was saying. She couldn't even remember her name at that point in time, or what she had even done to get here. All she knew was that her world was a series of cruel, sadistic strokes on her bare feet that drove her ever closer to insanity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tensed up again when he grabbed her right foot, but he just let his thumb rub against the sole a little bit. The finger implements seemed to be off. \"I'll definitely be back here before we're done.\" She would have shivered at the words, but she was still zoned out to the point where words meant nothing to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds later, she was suddenly doused in a shocking blast of cold water. She yelped and struggled instinctively before realizing that the cool feel of the water was actually rather nice, cooling her off from the tickle session that had left her burning up and soaked in sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked around her slowly, holding up the hose and making sure to get everywhere. Once he was done, she felt like she could fall asleep and not wake up for a week. She was exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd be wise to not fall asleep,\" he warned, setting the hose back down on the floor. \"If it becomes a problem, I have ways of making sure you stay awake, and you won't particularly enjoy them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to slur some words out before remembering the gag. Slowly, she started to remember how words worked and what their connections were to each other. Suddenly, her eyes snapped open as she finally put two and two together and realized that, if it wasn't even midnight yet, then she had only been tickled for about fifteen minutes and faced another six hours of this hell! Unable to vocalize her duress, she started futilely struggling against her bonds again, shaking the frame back and forth ineffectively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that was a good warmup,\" the man said as he went back over to his cabinet and deposited his finger implements. \"But it's now officially midnight, so I think it's time to really get started.\" He glanced at her. \"Knock that off, you're not going anywhere. Those straps will saw through your skin well before the opposite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy was in no mood to accept her ticklish fate, even if part of her knew full well she wasn't going to escape the frame. At least she could say she fought this way, she figured. As the mystery torturer pulled out a pair of foreign devices that resembled miniature power drills, she began to consider the option of letting the straps cut through her skin if it might mean escape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man held the two devices up, allowing Daisy to see that, unlike actual power drills, they ended with three plastic tips in a triangle formation in place of the drill bit. He flipped a switch on either of the handles and the two devices buzzed to life, the tips vibrating to create a blur effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy was willing to bet anything the implements were designed to extract more ticklish agony from her sensitive skin, and would have given anything to avoid them. He approached her, and all she could do was scream into her gag and plead with her eyes.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>He unlocked the rotating rack and pushed it up slightly so he was directly facing her sexy toned stomach, abs showing through the skin thanks to her arched position. It was obvious where he was going now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sucked in her tummy the best she could as the vibrating tips approached, as if they were red hot coals. She almost wished they were. Soon, there was nowhere for her to go, and all she could do is whimper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tips pressed into her stomach and she immediately screeched and bucked what little she could, but her movements only served to press her tummy further into the tips and just make it worse. The tips may as well have been power drills, plowing holes through her abdomen, it would have made little difference to her. She twitched back and forth, stomach muscles rippling underneath her skin as she did all she could to pull away from the tools. She laughed like a madwoman underneath the gag as he started slowly moving the half-dozen tips around her exposed belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MMMMMMMPPPPHHHHHHHH!\" she hollered, eyes flying open as the devices slowly went down her abs towards her hips. She had never cared to make a map of where she was most ticklish, she'd rather avoid the nasty business altogether, but it seemed like her lower stomach region was as ticklish as they came. He approached her panty line, but slowly looped back upward before getting there, to her mild relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry,\" he said slowly, working the tips over every little bump and contour on her shaped abdomen. Her cackling was muted enough to barely make his words out. \"I've been told to avoid certain...private regions on your body. My employers at the league did extend you at least that courtesy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he pressed the tips into her sides, causing her to scream before resuming laughter, she was able to get outraged for about half a second over the thought that anything about this torture was courteous. But she quickly forgot about that as he started going up and down on her super sensitive sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've seen what these things can do...down there,\" he said, glancing downward as he said this. \"Those who actually managed to maintain their sanity afterward said it was an incredibly pleasurable experience, but the league specified that there could be no risk of permanent damage to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SSSMMMMMPPPPHHHHHH!\" Permanent damage?! As the man started using both tools on the right side of her stomach, making her pull towards the left with all her might, she felt like there had already been quite a bit of permanent damage caused to her, physically and psychologically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe kept on drilling those tips into her stomach area, all the way up to just below her large breasts and just above her panty line, all the way across to her side, drawing unpredictable ticklish patterns on her torso. He enjoyed watching her muscles tense and spasm as he tickled and tickled. Eventually she ran out of air to laugh and just hung there, giving little hiccups of giggles from time to time. Eventually, she released her bladder again, soaking her panties for a second time. As drool started to ooze out of the sides of her gag, he finally decided she had suffered enough for the time being and turned the tools off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked back over to his evil cabinet, leaving her to take in large heaves of air, now hanging limply from the rack instead of tensed up against it. Her stomach ached from laughing so much as her vision swam in front of her. She fought to remain awake, as every fiber of her being longed for the embrace of unconsciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA blast of cold water helped wake her up, as the man hit her with another long blast from the hose, sending streams of sweat down to the tiles below, down through the drains, and cooling her off nicely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute of this, he dropped the hose and walked up to her. She recoiled the best she could, but he went up to her face and grabbed the ball gag up to her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that's enough of this,\" he said, pulling the rubber bit out of her mouth and pulling the band up over her head. It was a very liberating feeling, and she gratefully sucked down lungfuls of air with newfound freedom. She closed her eyes and panted, mind finally settling back into place and allowing her to think straight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she opened her eyes, the man was holding a sports bottle with a large straw on top in front of her. It occured to her that her throat was parched, and she quickly wrapped her lips around the straw and sucked down a stream of cold water. She did this for several seconds before he pulled it away from her, before she could make herself sick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Ms. Waterflower. By all accounts you're a woman in good shape, so I think we're ready to start again.\" He clapped his hands together and walked over towards the cabinet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...nononono....Ican't....Ican't-\" Daisy babbled, still not completely coherent. \"Nomorenomore...nomore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gave you a nearly ninety minute break, Ms. Waterflower,\" the man insisted, opening one of the side doors on the cabinet. \"Surely you can handle another session now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy blinked dimly a few times. Ninety minutes? That felt more like five. Somewhere in there, she must have lost track of time or dozed off, but she sure didn't feel rested. She could barely get out coherent words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's almost two, if we don't start now we'll never get through everything on my schedule by six. That's what you want, isn't it? Surely that break has re-energized you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-please, sir, I'm sorry,\" Daisy choked out, trying extra hard to be coherent. She put extra effort into her speech, trying to get her words out as coherently as possible. \"I'll finish the reports, I swear I'll finish them...it'll never ever happen again, I swear, just lemme go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled his hands out from the cabinet, this time carrying no tools, and briskly walked back over to her. She tensed up as he reached forward and grabbed her thighs with his bare hands. He started to squeeze, digging the nails of his fingers into the inside of her thighs. She convulsed and started cackling again, this time no gag present to mute her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's bad luck Ms. Waterflower...looks like you've got ticklish thighs. I can't possibly leave here today without spending some time down here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BaHaHAHA STAAAAAHAHAP!\" she hollered, shaking back and forth on the rack. She had never been tickled on her thighs before, and found his fingers pulsing on the flesh on her inside thighs to be unbearable, and a little too close to certain areas for comfort. \"PPPAHAHAHAHAAAA PLLLHAHAHAHA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hands suddenly dropped down and found her knees, grabbing both kneecaps and squeezing repeatedly. She yelped in shock before dissolving into spasmodic laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And such ticklish knees! I wouldn't be fulfilling my contract if you left without having these get mercilessly tickled.\" He kept on pulsing his fingers on those ticklish caps, and she wondered what horrible things she had done in a previous life to deserve such a sensitive body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hands flew up to the hollows underneath her arms, nails stroking that sensitive pit back and forth, which was no less agonizing for poor Daisy. She shrieked and struggled in her bonds, her armpits stretched and completely defenseless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SttaAAAAAAAAHAHAP! STAAAAHHAP!\" she demanded. \"NOHAHAANO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And who could forget these precious hollows? No, Ms. Waterflower, I don't see any way I could possibly let you go early.\" With that, he stopped his assault and went back over to the cabinet, leaving Daisy to pant and babble as he reached down into the cabinet. \"Don't worry, it'll be over before you know it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll pay!\" she gasped, wheezing like a broken squeak toy. \"I have...money...lotta money!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I make a lot of money, Ms. Waterflower,\" the man replied. \"And I know exactly how much you have in your accounts and your net worth, assets and all, and there's no offer you can make me worth me risking my job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonono...nono...I'll do anything!\" she insisted, shaking her head in denial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Waterflower, you've been bad and you know it, now take your punishment like an adult,\" he said, standing up and holding up two large, stiff artist brushes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOOOnono...nomore...\" she begged, tensing up and repressing giggles just from looking at the brushes. \"I'll..I'll-\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a bright and sunny morning; a perfectly beautiful start to the day, and a perfect day to finally confess your love to a certain beautiful girl. Ever since you had first witnessed the sensational sisters' dazzling performances, you had fallen head over heels in love with them. You adored everything about them: Daisy's relaxed and gentle presence, Violet's cool beauty, and the youngest sister Misty who was practically born to be a mermaid. Misty rarely took part in their shows, having her duties as the Cerulean City gym leader to take priority over performing with her sisters, but she was always a fan favorite with her incredible finesse in the water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, your personal favorite was someone else. You never really cared for Misty as much as the other fans did, and your eyes always remained locked on a different sister. Lily, the adorable pink-haired goddess of the water that she was, was the one you had become the most infatuated with. She always looked so happy as she performed, wearing a cheerful smile on her face like a child who had just received a brand new toy, and her playful attitude lured you in like a fish to the hook. She just seemed like the kind of person who could find a way to have fun in any situation, and you simply couldn't help but adore her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor many weeks you have been keeping your feelings for her a secret, but today was the day that you had decided to tell Lily how you truly felt about her. With any luck, she might just end up returning your feelings. Heading over to the Cerulean gym, you enter the door while hiding a bouquet of flowers behind your back. You walk around for a bit, and soon a cheerful voice draws your attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey dude, what's up? Do you, like, need anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking in the direction of the voice, you find yourself staring eye to eye with the smiling face of Lily herself! You immediately begin to blush as you gaze upon her perfect figure. She was wearing a casual (yet still very attractive) outfit; a green T-shirt, an indigo skirt, and a pair of orange flipflops on her dainty little feet. The footwear revealed her slender toes to your view, and each of her nails was painted with a layer of pink nail polish. As you stared at her in awe of her youthful beauty, Lily waved her hand in front of your face to snap you out of your trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>He~llo!</i> Anyone in there?\" she asked in a cute sing-songy voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, um, sorry! I... Lily, I'm a huge fan of you and your sisters... I really love your performances.\" you stutter out nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah? Well thanks, dude! It's always nice to get praise from the fans!\" she said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily then winked at you and blew you a kiss. You thought you were about to faint, but you instead swung the bouquet out and presented it to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here! I... I got this for you, Lily!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, that's so sweet! Thanks a bunch, dude!\" Lily says, gracefully accepting your gift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah, you're welcome... Um, Lily, I know this is kinda sudden and all... But there is one more thing that I wanted to tell you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? And, like, what might that be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you see, ever since I first saw you perform... I've been crazy in love with you, Lily! Would you please consider going out on a date with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily's face turned to one of shock for a moment, before she soon began blushing as well. She was used to hearing fans ask out Daisy and Violet, but being the youngest of the trio, she herself rarely experienced this sort of situation. While she was still very confident in her own good looks, she still knew that she couldn't possibly compare to her older sisters. In fact, the only times she had been asked out so far were when a guy had already been shot down by Violet or Daisy. They would then try to get her instead, thinking because of her innocent appearance that they could win her over easily, and naturally she had refused all of them so far. Yet this time, a guy was asking her out directly. She didn't really know how to react to a situation like this, so she nervously mutters out...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You picked the lock and headed for the tanks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you wandered through, your stomach began to twist into knots. There wasn't a single Pokemon anywhere in the Gym! At this rate, you'd be the laughing stock of Team Rocket! As if in response to your panic, you heard a splash nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you hurried to investigate, you found it wasn't a Pokemon, but a human. Lily Waterflower to be exact. She had just finished up practicing a routine, and was drying herself off with a towel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid Daisy and Violet!\" she complained out loud to herself, \"Taking away all the Pokemon for themselves.\" your stomach churned at that, \"Lucky for me I swiped the rarest one to keep! No one'll know where it is but me,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a light seemed to be descending from above, your reputation could be saved! All you had to do was get the whereabouts of that Pokemon.

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">So today I was thinking, there's a lot of good foot fetish material on writing.com, a lot of it featuring popular anime characters. But three characters, admittedly minor ones, seem to have gotten no or next to no attention at all, which struck me as odd and unfortunate given that they are three characters who are renowned for their beauty in-universe. Yes, I am talking about the Sensational Sisters, or the Waterflower sisters, co-gym leaders of Cerulean City. Daisy, Violet, and Lily Waterflower. Three beautiful young women who seem like obvious targets for foot fetish stories, yet there's nothing out there for them. So, this story will be dedicated, entirely, to those three and their feet, as well as tickling of their bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of quick notes:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1:<br>\r\nDaisy Waterflower - Blonde Waist-Length Hair, Oldest, Most Grounded<br>\r\nViolet Waterflower - Blue Lower-Back-Length Hair, Arguably Most Intelligent<br>\r\nLily Waterflower - Red/Pink Shoulder-Length Hair, Youngest, Most Immature<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2:<br>\r\nMisty Waterflower is not being included as one of the primary characters (though she may be included in a side role) since there is more than a metric ton of foot fetish stories involving her on this site already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3:<br>\r\nAnyone is free to add chapters, but I will ask and expect that everyone takes it seriously and at least attempts to maintain a good level of quality writing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4:<br>\r\nI will try to create as many scenarios as possible so there's a wide variety of different things that can be done with this story. Please try to maintain this level of variety by coming up with different ways to tell the story.</td>",
