While it has a main story to be told, options will be available to branch out in to other stories for the sake of variety. Our main story follows 15-year old Sam Landry on an adventure in Japan with a considerable amount of ups and downs. He finds himself in the middle of a sinister plot, unable to do much about it. Just how will this turn out?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, we'll just have to see. The first option here starts off the main story, while the others will go on into alternates.

After a lot of aimless searching for your friend, you get distracted by the flashy sign of a beauty parlor. Right underneath the brightly colored entranceway, you see a bunch of Japanese women wearing the same style of uniform that are having an intense conversation about something. By the look of their attire and name tags, it is visually obvious that they work there. You don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about due to the conversation being in Japanese and they are too far away from you. Then one of those said employees notices that you are observing them and quickly walks over to you. You decide to wait and see what she has to say, hoping that she might give you some directions. When she gets within reaching distance of you, she starts enthusiastically asking you something in Japanese. Once again, you don\u2019t understand her but this time you begin to recognize certain words and phrases that you learned from your travel book the other day. You definitely recognize two specific phrases in particular that sound like, \u201cdo you want help with\u201d and \u201cvery special offer\u201d (in reality, she\u2019s actually saying: \u201cDo you want help with making yourself look absolutely gorgeous? If you accept this very special offer, we can turn you into the bombshell of your wildest dreams free of charge.\u201d). Even though you still don\u2019t know their true intentions, you simply nod your head in agreement. The employee then suddenly injects you with some sort of serum that makes you unable to move or speak. Then two other employees pick you up and carry you into the salon. Once you\u2019re inside, they sit you down on a salon chair and begin their services.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do they transform you into?</span></div></div>",

It felt like someone had stuffed him in an overly large fatsuit and left him to sweat on the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam clambered to his feet sluggishly, his arms and legs seconds behind his mind. Something on his chest jiggled incessantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh, man, what did that guy do to me?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ran a hand through his hair only to come up with a lot more than he was expecting. His eyes shot wide-open to see incredibly long black hair twined between his fingers. There were two problems with that: one, his hair hadn't been that long that morning, and two, his hair wasn't black. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam gasped. It came out incredibly breathy and high-pitched, nothing like his own voice. His chest jiggled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe glanced down into a valley of deep, sweaty, cleavage. He was still wearing the Atari T-shirt he'd put on before getting off the plane, but it was stretched by the massive breasts beneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam couldn't help it. He screamed, as loud and as long as he could manage. A few pedestrians turned his way, but not many, and not for long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I'm a girl? How am I a girl?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took a step forward and instantly ripped the seat of his pants. Whatever he looked like now, he was far too corpulent to fit into his own clothes. For some reason, that seemed really funny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I have to see what I look like. I have to...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe waddled forward towards a shop window, every inch of his body wobbling as he did so. What he saw in the reflective surface of the glass made his jaw drop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only was he a girl, he was a fat Japanese girl who looked a little bit older than he had just been. Twenty, at least. Her hair was stringy and unkempt-- she looked like a slob. Surprisingly, that didn't upset Sam as much as he thought it should.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What do I do now?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat old dude had done this to him with whatever he'd pulled out of his pocket. Maybe he should go after him....then again, that might be dangerous. He could call his friends and see if they might be of any use...but would they believe him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam caught a whiff of something delicious and turned towards a nearby food stall. Mmm...they were deep-frying shrimp...his favorite. His tummy rumbled loudly as he patted his stomach. Doing something about this could wait...he needed food and he needed it now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo! That was this body talking. He had to do something now before he lost himself! But then again, that food smelled so tempting...it was enough to make his mouth water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should Sam do?</span></div></div>",

At the current moment, their parents had decided to go out on a little romantic stroll, leaving the two boys by themselves to do whatever they should please. Normally, Penn would rather just rest at the hotel, but his parents urged them both to get out for some air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, in any case, Penn managed to acquire a map he could finally read, given his less than fluent Japanese. Turns out being an anime fan didn\u2019t exactly count as preparation. Still, he had done his research into the many attractions within Tokyo. There was the Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden, or even the Imperial Palace for a slice of history. That wasn\u2019t even to mention the Asakusa and the Senso-ji Temple. There was no shortage of places to see!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Penn couldn\u2019t access most of them, considering they would probably need a car to get to and they just had their own two feet. They needed something closeby. Right now, they were near a big park, simply enjoying the sights and seeing all the children play around with their parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, what else is there\u2026..\u201d Penn mused to himself as he inspected his map for nearby attractions.

Penn looked at it himself before looking back at the map, trying to see if the trail was there. To his slight surprise, there wasn\u2019t any evidence of such a trail existing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh, that\u2019s strange. There isn\u2019t anything,\u201d Penn noted curiously, which only seemed to brighten Brad\u2019s face even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOooh, then we get to explore!\u201d Brad cried, his interest peaked now more than any other point in their trip. He then suddenly sprinted down to the trail through the bushes. \u201cLast one to the end is a rotten egg!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBrad! Dang it!\u201d Penn cried as he ran after Brad, against his better judgment in all honesty. That boy could be a real pain when he tried, which he always seemed to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe good news was that it was pretty early in the day, so at least the path and everything that made it up was not all that hard to see. Still, they were still straying farther and farther from civilization, judging by the more unkempt the trail gradually became. However, as Penn made his way through, he began to see a structure just beyond the trees. Brad\u2019s laughter began to die down a bit as he simply stood near the end of the trail, allowing Penn to quickly catch up to him finally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGot you!\u201d Penn cried out as he grabbed his younger brother. \u201cDon\u2019t you ever do that again! Do you realize how Mom and Dad would have felt if you got hurt?!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ended up saying that a bit more harshly than intended, which was apparent in Brad\u2019s rather hurt expression. Penn could only sigh. \u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry I yelled...just, please try to be more careful, okay?\u201d he asked as nicely as he could. Brad\u2019s face brightened just a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll try to. Sorry, bro\u2026.\u201d Brad sincerely apologized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cApology accepted!\u201d Penn smiled a bit, letting the issue pass. He then looked back up at his surroundings and observed them. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Upon first glance, it looked like an old Japanese dwelling, with an older house and what seemed to be a small shrine of some kind. The house had it\u2019s front door wide open, though Penn supposed that even if anyone lived there, they didn\u2019t have much for burglars to steal or anything. There was a little fountain like he had seen in some anime, complete with little statues around it. All in all, was the quintessential Japanese setting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBro, can I just have a look around?\u201d Brad asked his older brother in all eagerness. \u201cI won\u2019t go far. I promise!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenn had many good reasons to turn him down, but they had already gone out this far. What was the harm in exploring further? \u201cOkay, you can look...but stay within earshot, alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, sir!\u201d the boy responded with a mock salute, before laughing as he jogged through the little trails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, Penn decided to walk through at his own pace. With the sound of the little fountain nearby, the entire place seemed quaint and peaceful, it not a bit eery. Penn almost felt like something could pop out at him if he so much as touched anything. In all honesty, he was starting to wonder if he should even be here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen again, I don\u2019t think anyone is owning this place. They\u2019re doing a crappy job if they are,\u201d he smirked to himself in an effort to calm himself down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, he passed by the house, opening the door on the other side. Nothing within the house stood out too much besides the dust. However, upon further inspection, there was a little something that stood out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm? What\u2019s this?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf this was part of the shrine, it was pretty small. There seemed to be a number of blocks scattered around the little area. As Penn got closer though, these blocks actually seemed to have some kind of Japanese runic characters. At least, that\u2019s what he guessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid they play building blocks in ancient Japan?\u201d he chuckled to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, he couldn\u2019t help but look them over even more. There were about a dozen of them in all, though he obviously couldn\u2019t understand what they actually meant. As he was holding them in his hands though, he couldn\u2019t help but feel a strange feeling, like\u2026.well, he couldn\u2019t describe it honestly. When he looked in front of him, there seemed to be an indention in the little shrine, probably just enough for these 12 blocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI feel like every movie I\u2019ve ever watched is telling me to not do it,\u201d Penn mused with a half-smile, not sure if he was being ironic or just tempting fate even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, since when did anyone turn down whatever stupid thing they were doing in movies? With a shrug, Penn kind of messed around with the blocks. Boy, would Brad ever give him some flak if he saw him playing around like this. Testing out his theory about the blocks fitting into the shrine indention, he carefully placed them into the appropriate looking places, until all 12 of them were nearly fitted inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd now we have\u2026.something!\u201d Penn said dramatically like he was trying to look smart, and failing. Nothing seemed to happen, as if Penn was expecting something like in anime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c....What am I doing?\u201d he slapped his forehead. \u201cWhat was I expec\u2026..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as he said that though, the runes on the little shrine began to glow, shining brighter each second before there was a burst of light! Penn cried out a bit as the light blinded him completely. He wasn\u2019t sure what was going on and frankly, he wasn\u2019t sure he wanted to find out.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The flash lasted for a few seconds before Penn could start to see the outline of trees and the little shrine coming back into his vision. However, just as they were about to register, there was something else! It looked like...a little girl, dressed in traditional Japanese clothing with long dark hair, skin as pale as light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing\u2026.here?\u201d Penn squeaked out at the very end. At first, he just assumed it was just a normal girl, until he found out that he could somehow see the shrine behind her translucent body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat am I doing here?\u201d the girl asks with an inquisitive look before simply giggling to herself. \u201cSilly stranger, this is my land that you have treaded upon.\u201d The girl then began to spin around while flying up to Penn\u2019s face, before putting her fist on her hips in a typical commanding pose, albeit a much more adorable one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMY NAME IS SENGEN, THE PROTECTOR OF THIS MOUNTAIN!\u201d she proclaimed with an authoritative tone that greatly conflicted with her squeaky little voice. \u201cYOU HAVE MESSED WITH MY SACRED ORNAMENTS! PREPARE TO DIE!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs squeaky as the voice was, Penn\u2019s face was still pale. Was this a real ghost? Or was it a spirit? Was there a difference? Well, whatever it was, Penn hastily took a couple steps backwards, which only succeeded in him falling on his rear-end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I was just messing around!\u201d he cried out. \u201cA-As you might tell, I-I\u2019m kind of not from around here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSengen only stared down at the heretical tourist with a look of great anger. Then, she immediately went into hysterics, floating all around as she lost control of her laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!\u201d she laughed and laughed before finally manage to compose herself just a little. \u201cYou really thought I was going to smite you, didn\u2019t you? Oh, that\u2019s adorable~! But you should already know that us spirits cannot cause death. We can only create life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenn seemed to be able to get his breathing under control once he was at least convinced enough that she wasn\u2019t going to kill him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell...that kind of depends honestly...\u201d he finally managed to say. \u201cSome people might believe that spirits could do just about anything, be it life or death. Not to mention\u2026.you\u2019re kind of the first spirit I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Penn finally got to his feet and dusted the dirt off of his jeans, he looked up at Sengen. \u201cSo...have you always lived here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill do, always will,\u201d Sengen responded simply with a small smile. \u201cStill, nobody\u2019s ever had the smarts, or at least the attention span, to put those blocks in the right places before you. So\u2026\u201d She raises the the sleeves of her translucent robe, causing physical confetti to shoot out of it, with accompanying sound effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCongratulations!\u201d the girl cheers with a large grin. \u201cYou, uh\u2026\u201d She looks down at the boy. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, Penn. Penn Madson,\u201d he replied after smiling at the confetti effect. How anime. \u201cAnd are you saying those blocks had a point to them? I didn\u2019t know what I was doing half the time. Not like I could read them. In case you couldn\u2019t tell, I\u2019m not exactly from Japan.\u201d He gave off a small smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere wasn\u2019t really a point, so much as it was a little game,\u201d the spirit explained with a small giggle. \u201cSee, I get bored, so I like to give mortals the easiest challenge possible and just wait and see how long it takes them to accomplish it. Then, whoever accomplishes it gets three wishes!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026.this means I\u2019m the first to ever get these wishes?\u201d Penn asked with a raised eyebrow. Was this girl a genie now? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, you\u2019re number eleven, honestly,\u201d Sengen responded with a giggle. \u201cBut still, pretty cool, pretty cool! I\u2019d be impressed if I were mortal!\u201d She then swooped down to the ground and sat with her legs crossed. \u201cSo? Got a wish?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Sure, he was pretty confident in her story of being a spirit, but wishing was quite out there. Heck, if he were to say, it would be like divulging his inner insecurities as well. Like one in particular\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell...I\u2019d kind of...like a\u2026.girlfriend,\u201d Penn said as his face went redder than a tomato. One of the more well-known things about Penn was his complete inability to get a girlfriend. It was really odd too, as he was a really nice, if not a bit quiet, guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, what was that?\u201d Sengen asked with an amused smirk while leaning in even closer to Penn. \u201cI\u2019m afraid your wish must be in the form of a wish!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now his face was a brand new shade of red, or purple at this point. Was this girl a spirit or a game show host?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wish for a girlfriend! THERE!\u201d he practically bellowed, taking deep breaths as he looked at the little girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSengen could only grin at the teenage boy before playfully patting him on the head. \u201cThere, there. That\u2019s all I need to hear.\u201d She then propelled herself into the air again, twirling all about as she did so. \u201cSo...is that it? I prefer to do at least two wishes simultaneously. Makes the game go by faster. Lots of people tend to wait years before making their second one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI...guess that\u2019s a good point,\u201d Penn nodded when he calmed down. Getting patted on the head like a little boy urked him a bit, but at least she didn\u2019t laugh at him like some girls did back at school. \u201cUm\u2026..\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That\u2019d be pretty dumb to waste a once-in-a-lifetime wish. As he tried thinking harder, his thoughts eventually went to Brad. He had hoped that Brad was following his word and not going too far off, but what were the odds of that. Oh well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then he had a thought. Brad wasn\u2019t as knowledgeable when it came to Japanese culture as he was. Okay, he didn\u2019t know a lot either, but he would have liked Brad to share at least some of his interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026.\u201d he looked at Sengen again. \u201cI wish that my brother, Brad, could come to appreciate your culture as much as I do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh~?\u201d Sengen coos with a surprised, but nonetheless intrigued look. \u201cA selfless wish for the education of another! Such a rare wish! So rare, in fact, that I shall grant it immediately!\u201d She then looked back down at Penn with a large smile. \u201cI shall return soon enough, Mr. Girlfriend! For now, I must teach!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd after that, she just blipped out of existence. There was no evidence that she even existed after she disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow\u2026.just like that,\u201d Penn stared at the little shrine. It suddenly felt so empty with the little ball of energy not present. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did wonder what she was really talking about. Was something like that really going to happen? Well, the fact that he actually met a spirit at all served to prove the fact that anything could be possible.</span></div></div>",

Out of curiosity, he was following the little creek that started at the fountain from the dwelling, trying to see where it went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s pretty cool,\u201d he smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could admire the creek any further, however, Sengen, now looking to be a regular, solid Japanese girl, suddenly pops out of the water. She then looked over at Brad and gave him a large grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, heya!\u201d she cheered before swimming closer to the shore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWOAH!\u201d Brad cried as he stumbled backwards on his butt. \u201cI didn\u2019t know there were other people here besides me and Penn. Do you need help?\u201d he asked while extending his hand out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah, I\u2019m fine, thanks,\u201d the girl giggled as she began to stand up out of the water. \u201cI think you might need some help, though. You must be really imbalanced to just fall on your butt like that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I was surprised!\u201d Brad retorted, though he chuckled a bit as well. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect to find a girl all the way out here. Do your Mom and Dad know you\u2019re here? I know that my big bro always gets stern when I run off.\u201d he added with a slight forlorn look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh, they don\u2019t really care,\u201d Sengen said with a shrug as she simply stood there, dripping wet. \u201cMy parents don\u2019t really care about what I do. Never had for hundreds of years!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad\u2019s eyes widened just a bit, before they went back to normal levels and he just smiled. Maybe she was playing a game! He liked to imagine cool stuff too after all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you just play whatever you want?\u201d Brad chuckled a bit. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty cool. You live here as well?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh, you could say that,\u201d Sengen responded with a small giggle. \u201cThen again, I live everywhere I go. I\u2019m like a...traveler, if you will. An eternal tourist.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, that\u2019s pretty cool!\u201d Brad smiled. \u201cIs that why your English is very good? I\u2019ve never seen a Japanese girl who talked as well as you. Not many can fully understand my brother and I here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I guess that\u2019s a good enough explanation, yes,\u201d Sengen answered with a smile of her own. \u201cThough, I couldn't help but notice how...confused you seem by everything out here. Obviously, you have an interest in the stuff, but you can\u2019t really understand the culture behind it, can you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad\u2019s face looked a little less bright at those words. \u201cYeah...my brother kind of says the same thing. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m really all that smart when it comes to this stuff. Penn doesn\u2019t seem to like it when I say that though. He says that I \u201cshouldn\u2019t limit myself\u201d or something,\u201d he added in air quotes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl simply nodded at the boy\u2019s words. \u201cI see...well!\u201d She began to walk around Brad with a childish smile on her face. \u201cWhat if I told you that I could help you connect with the culture a bit more?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad raised an eyebrow, but he was curious nonetheless. \u201cCan you really? I mean, if I could somehow learn all this better, that would be great.\u201d he added with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwesome~!\u201d Segen cheered while suddenly taking Brad\u2019s hands. \u201cAll I gotta do is recite the ancient incantation and you\u2019ll be right on your way to knowing even more about Japan than your knowitall brother!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-Oh, okay!\u201d Brad smiled back, his hands limp in Sengen\u2019s. He wasn\u2019t quite sure what she was up to, but he was kind of liking this game of hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay then, just hold on!\u201d Sengen then closes her eyes and begins to recite an ancient tome. \u201c\u3053\u306e\u30a2\u30b8\u30a2\u306e\u82e5\u3044\u30a2\u30e1\u30ea\u30ab\u4eba\u306e\u7537\u306e\u5b50\u3092\u4f5c\u308d\u3046\uff01\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad suddenly felt like something entered his hands briefly, making them wiggle just a bit. Before he could think about it though, the feeling was already gone, like it was never there to begin with. Oddly enough though, just before the feeling faded, his face had felt a small sensation, like it was being gently pulled at. He looked at the wide smile on Sengen\u2019s face. She seemed to be absolutely beaming, like she just did the happiest thing she ever did, which might not have been far from the truth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook in the water,\u201d was all she told him before suddenly letting go of the boy\u2019s hands and running back into the creek she had appeared from.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cHuh? W-Wait!\u201d Brad cried as he reached out to her, running up to the edge of the creek but not walking in. He looked at her expectant face, as if urging him even more to look down. Oddly, he felt hesitant, but he found himself slowly looking down into the flowing water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the boy\u2019s great surprise, he saw that not only was his blond locks now pitch black, but his eyes were...different. They were slanted, like he recalled one of his friends at school having. There was a word for the type of people with eyes like this, he just couldn\u2019t quite put his finger on it\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSengen suddenly popped out of the water, appearing right in front of Brad\u2019s face. \u201cEnjoying being Asian?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d Brad cried out, though he didn\u2019t fall over this time. It was a combination of Sengen appearing again as well as finding that word he was looking for. \u201cAsian?! I-Is this real?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep!\u201d she cheered. \u201cTold ya it\u2019d work! Now you\u2019re more Japanese than ever.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad was absolutely stupefied. Even as he looked over himself, seeing the face, dark hair, the slightly different skin tone, it was hard to accept it as real. The girl in front of him seemed to be enjoying it a lot, though. Brad then got to thinking. Whether this was all fake or not, perhaps this was the chance he was waiting for to show Penn that he could learn about Japanese culture just as well as him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis..is pretty awesome,\u201d Brad said as he cracked a smile. \u201cYou\u2019re pretty talented!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy, thank you,\u201d Sengen responded with a proud bow. \u201cI\u2019m rather happy with the results myself. Heck, I even changed reality so that you\u2019ve always been like this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad honestly didn\u2019t get that last part, but he figured it wasn't worth worrying over. After all, it was all part of the game from what he could tell. Still, he was growing rather curious about her constantly going in the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, my Mom said you could catch a cold if you stay in the water too long,\u201d he told the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh, I\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Sengen insisted with a small giggle. \u201cHow about you go find your brother, though? Maybe show him your new understanding of Japanese culture?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, sure!\u201d Brad smiled, quickly turning to try and find Penn again, before looking back at Sengen. \u201cYou coming along?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh...no thank you,\u201d the girl declined with a nervous smile. \u201cI...I don\u2019t do that good around older boys. Don\u2019t even tell him you found me, okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, okay. Well, thank you mystery girl!\u201d It took saying that for Brad to realize that he actually never got her name, but he was already running off back in the direction he thought he came from. Oh well, he could ask the next time he ran into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, he couldn\u2019t help but hear an odd giggle in the wind as he ran back.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Penn was pacing back and forth around the dwelling right now, just casually enjoying the sights. There was no whiff or sound of Sengen following that little event, making Penn somewhat question if it was real or not. Then again, he felt confident that it was real. He couldn\u2019t have made that up. Still, it would have been nice if the little spirit girl actually told him something about what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell whatever,\u201d Penn shrugged as he continued to look at the surroundings and the house. There wasn\u2019t too much else left to see though, as the house was pretty empty aside from a few things covered in dust. \u201cI kind of wonder if that girl lived here when she was alive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, bro!\u201d Brad suddenly called out to Penn as he came back into his view. He then began to rush over to his brother at breakneck speed, catching up to him in no time. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenn took one look at Brad, causing his eyes to open in utter shock when he saw his brother. Wait, was that his brother? The attitude was the same, but the appearance?....Not even close!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs...something wrong, Penn?\u201d Brad asked while looking up to his brother with a large smirk on his face. Looks like he was just now noticing his change in appearance. \u201cYou\u2019re acting like you\u2019ve never seen me before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenn shook his head a bit after seeing Brad, just to get his head on straight. Looking at Brad seemed to be bringing up some new thoughts, which seemed to be making more sense to Penn by the second. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d Penn shook his head just a bit more. \u201cJust didn\u2019t expect to see you running so fast.\u201d he added with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait\u2026\u201d Brad\u2019s smile began to droop. \u201cNothing? That\u2019s it? Aren\u2019t you going to ask about my face or my hair or anything?!\u201d He just didn\u2019t get it. A second ago, Penn looked downright flabbergasted at his brother\u2019s new look. Then, all of a sudden...it just looks normal to him?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I wasn\u2019t sure from a distance,\u201d Penn shrugged a bit. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think I could mistake that face for anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn all honesty, Penn did feel some confusion, but the more he tried to think about it, the more his mind said that nothing was wrong. Well, whatever the case was, he could figure that out some other time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad could only glare at his older brother while folding his arms. \u201cYou\u2019re messing with me, aren\u2019t you? Trying to act like nothing\u2019s weird. Or do you just not know who I really am?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure I know, Soma.\u201d Penn said with a straight face. \u201cWhat else is there that\u2019s weird? I thought you said you were going to wow me with what you know of this place or something.\u201d he added with a smile and shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo...ma\u2026?\u201d the little boy asked in total confusion. What was Penn calling him now?! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy are you calling me Soma?!\u201d he suddenly shouted at him. \u201cIs that some sort of Japanese insult?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenn raised an eyebrow at him. \u201cUh, no it\u2019s not an insult. That\u2019s your name, right? I mean, I get that I\u2019m just looking after you for your parents, but I surely wouldn\u2019t forget your name.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Looking after me for my-\u2019 Soma\u2019s eyes almost popped out of his head as he realized what was just happening. That mystery girl mentioned something about changing reality so that he was always like this. So that meant...he wasn\u2019t even Brad anymore! He must be this...Soma guy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuick, what\u2019s my last name?!\u201d he suddenly asked up to Penn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026.\u201d Penn put his hand to his head to remember. \u201cIt was...Akiyama, I believe. Pretty sure that\u2019s it.\u201d he nodded in confirmation, as if he was confirming that to himself as well. \u201cYou okay? You\u2019re not usually this pale.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI...I\u2019m fine,\u201d Soma responded with a nervous smile. \u201cI...I just gotta...go look around some more, ya know? See some more of my heritage?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good idea,\u201d Penn smiled. \u201cI know you wanted to learn more about it earlier, especially when we found out about this place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-Yeah,\u201d the boy responded with a nervous look before looking back over in the direction of the creek. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just...go on ahead. I\u2019ll catch up to you at\u2026.place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenn seemed a bit unsure at Soma\u2019s behavior, but he nodded after a second. \u201cOkay, that\u2019s cool with me if you want to have a little time alone. Just make sure you take care to not go too far.\u201d he added with a smile before starting to walk around a bit. He supposed that he might as well see more around the area if there was more than just the house and shrine.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Soma walked through the familiar path down the creek. It was funny how everything seemed familiar after just walking by it once or twice, but he was not in the mood for amusement right now. His own brother thought of him as someone completely different now. Up until that point, he had thought of it all as just a game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as he just learned, it was not a game. He really was actually Japanese, with even a new name to match. What did that mystery girl do to him? Was she still around? These were legitimate questions. Well, there was only one way to find out and after another minute or so, he was near that familiar opening to the creek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm...mystery girl?!\u201d he called out. \u201cAre you still here?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a sudden rustling in a nearby tree, before Sengen suddenly popped out onto one of the branches. \u201cOh, hey, uh...you!\u201d She giggled to herself a bit. \u201cI don\u2019t believe you ever told me your name.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it WAS Brad! Brad Madson!\u201d he said a bit more fiercely than intended. \u201cBut apparently it\u2019s now Soma Akiyama or something odd like that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh!\u201d Sengen suddenly cheered with an awfully joyful look on her face. \u201cSo then my spell worked then! You are now 100% authentically Japanese! Congratulations!\u201d She lifted her sleeve and let loose another batch of confetti.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s with the confetti?\u201d Soma said to himself before shaking his head. \u201cA-Anyway, is this really alright? I-I mean, my brother doesn\u2019t even think I\u2019m his brother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, why would your American brother have a Japanese brother?\u201d the girl asked quizzically while leaning her back against the tree and slumping down on her branch. \u201cThat\u2019d just be crazy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026.I guess that\u2019s true,\u201d Soma shook his head side to side a bit. \u201cBut now he seems to think of me as some kid he\u2019s just looking after. And by the way, who are you anyway, mystery girl?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, me?\u201d she asked with a large smirk before suddenly jumping off of her branch. The girl began to plummet to the ground, before stopping just five feet above it and slowly floating down the rest of the way. \u201cMy name is Sengen. And I am a spirit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn other cases, Soma would be more surprised, but given what had happened to him so far, it didn\u2019t seem all that weird at all. A stark difference compared to Penn\u2019s first reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell..um, Sengen\u2026\u201d Soma said a bit bashfully. \u201cSo..is this really supposed to help me learn better? I..don\u2019t really feel all that different aside from my looks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, really?\u201d Sengen asked with a curious look before putting her finger to her chin in thought. \u201cMaybe I didn\u2019t think this through entirely. Maybe I just needed to change your mind some!\u201d She then excitedly turns over to Soma. \u201cWhat if I made you think like a Japanese kid?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoma was intrigued at least. \u201cYou think big bro...er, I guess Penn, would like that? He..really seemed to like the idea of me knowing a lot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he would like that,\u201d Sengen responded with a soft smile. \u201cBut ultimately, it\u2019s not his decision. It\u2019s yours. I can only make you believe yourself to be Soma Akiyama if you give me permission.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Perhaps if he was really good at this, then maybe Penn would be more impressed. Besides, against his better judgment honestly, it still sounded fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll do it!\u201d Soma smiled. \u201cWork your magic.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay then,\u201d the spirit girl said with a quick nod and a large smile before placing her hand on Soma\u2019s forehead. Soon enough, said hand begins to glow with a beautiful, ethereal light. \u201c\u5f7c\u304c\u3067\u306a\u3051\u308c\u3070\u306a\u3089\u306a\u3044\u4eba\u306b\u3053\u306e\u5c11\u5e74\u3092\u4f5c\u308d\u3046\uff01\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Soma looked at the glowing hand on his forehead, his eyes suddenly widened, his rush rushing with all sorts of new information! New memories poured into his head, ones of a young boy hailing from Japan, only to move over to America, and finally return back to his home country with an older friend of his named Penn and his family. He could remember his past as Brad, but it all seemed much less clear and altogether unimportant at the moment. Right now, he was the one and only Soma Akiyama, and there wasn\u2019t anybody else he\u2019d rather be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow!\u201d he cried out, partly in surprise and partly in glee. \u201cThat was actually really cool! Thanks, Sengen!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo prob, Bob,\u201d Sengen giggled before picking up a small blade of grass. With one swift motion, the girl turned the grass into a small scroll with a message written in Japanese, which she then handed over to Soma. \u201cGo ahead. Tell me what it says.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoma grabbed it, opening up the scroll. \u201cUm\u2026.\u3042\u306a\u305f\u306f\u30aa\u30bf\u30af\u3067\u3059.....I am NOT a geek!\u201d he cried out, feeling like he wanted to throw the thing at her before it dawned on him. \u201cHey, I read that perfectly!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep!\u201d the spirit cheered before beginning to float in the air. \u201cCongratulations, Soma, on your new life!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, thanks Sengen!\u201d Soma cheered before turning. \u201cWell, I should probably see how he\u2019s doing again. You know, you should come. I\u2019d love to see Penn\u2019s reaction.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah, I\u2019ll just watch from the shadows,\u201d Sengen said with a large grin. \u201cThough, you know what\u2019d really be awesome? If you and Penn happened to be the same age! Then he\u2019d probably be a bit more interested in what you have to say.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Not that Penn was like that, but he was curious. Heck, it was probably better then him being his babysitter of all things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good idea,\u201d Soma nodded. \u201cDoes that mean you\u2019re doing the lines again?\u201d he added with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep!\u201d Sengen answered with a large grin before touching Soma\u2019s forehead. \u201cWell, here goes nothing then~! \u3053\u306e\u5c11\u5e74\u6642\u4ee3\u306e17\u5e74\u3092\u4f5c\u308d\u3046\uff01\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, Soma felt a surge go through him. Except, instead of his mind, this one went through his body, causing a considerable amount of discomfort as he wrapped his arms around his body a bit, groaning as the pressure inside builded. Through his partially-closed eyes, he could see the ground slowly getting further away from him, all of his limbs growing considerably as puberty took place on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh...grr..\u201d he grunted as the changes continued, his body still growing out until he mostly resembled Penn\u2019s age of 17. And when the changes started to calm down, he was left sweating and taking deep breaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry if that got a little extreme,\u201d Sengen said with a nervous smile while scratching the back of her head. \u201cBut if it\u2019s any consolation, you look like a total hunk! I mean, look at yourself!\u201d She touched the trunk of the tree, turning a small part of it into a full body mirror for her newly grown acquaintance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling good enough to get on his feet, Soma walked closer to the tree mirror, getting a good look. He gasped just a bit, seeing a much more mature version of what he looked like before. Looking over himself, his t-shirt and shorts simply grew with him, so no ripping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow\u2026.I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d get to see something like this for years,\u201d Soma actually chuckled just a bit in spite of it all. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s funny that you seem to have taken a huge interest in me of all people.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you just seemed like an interesting kid,\u201d the girl responded half-truthfully. \u201cBesides, I really like helping you and that Penn guy become closer. It warms my heart!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou seem to really know him too,\u201d Soma noted, but he shook his head. \u201cWell, whatever the case, I can\u2019t wait to see what he thinks now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen go on!\u201d Sengen insisted with a large grin. \u201cYou know where to find me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoma turned again, taking a few more steps to get used to the new longer stride of his legs. He looked back at Sengen again, all bouncing around as she always did. He kind of wished she would actually come long, but perhaps she didn\u2019t want to. Oh well, perhaps he could convince her if he ever came by her again.</span></div></div>",

Of course, it wasn\u2019t food or anything, just a wide variety of native fauna. There were quite a few flowers he saw that were native only to Japan, like the Yellow Chrysanthemum and the Japanese Apricot. He had heard about these online, but it was amazing to see them up close and personal like this, even for someone like him who wasn\u2019t the most outdoors kind of guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThese are pretty beautiful,\u201d he smiled to himself as he looked through, trying not to crush any of the flowers. Heck, if Sengen looked over all of these, he doubted she would take kindly to flower trampling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually though, when he happened to turn around, he could see a figure emerging from about 30 yards away or so. \u201cAh, Soma! Over here!\u201d he waved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, man!\u201d Soma called out while running over next to Penn. \u201cAre you just looking at flowers right now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Penn shrugged a bit but smiled all the same. \u201cI was trying to see if there was anything else to the area and just found this place. Flowers aren\u2019t usually my thing, but I have to admit that these look pretty nice. What do you think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey\u2019re pretty cool, I guess,\u201d Soma responded while looking down at them as well. He still couldn\u2019t get over how tall he was now! Still, he didn\u2019t seem nearly as excited about the flowers as Penn. Still, he could understand how his friend may be intrigued by Japan\u2019s exclusive assortment of plants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, my mother used to love Yellow Chrysanthemums,\u201d Somo suddenly said as he started to reminisce about parents he had not even know had existed until gaining his new memories. \u201cMy dad gave one to her on their first date and he\u2019s given her a new one on their anniversary each year. Even if he had to import them from America!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, that\u2019s pretty cool actually,\u201d Penn smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s cool that your dad actually went that far for such a thing. Guess it helps put things in perspective.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d Somo asked. Also, was Penn...philosophizing with him? Wait a minute...he knew what philosophizing was now! Awesome!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust that\u2026.\u201d Penn actually blushed a bit when trying to find the words. \u201cHow something that small could mean everything to someone like your mom. I\u2019m not exactly poetic in any sense, but it\u2019s very\u2026.romantic.\u201d he finished with a hard blush, as if he was one to speak about romance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of Somo really wanted to tease Penn right now, but...he really couldn\u2019t bring himself to. Ironically, becoming nothing more than a friend of Penn made him feel even more brotherly towards him, so when it came time to react, he could only pat his friend on the shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t feel embarrassed,\u201d Somo told his friend with a small smile. \u201cI get what you are saying. And yes, I suppose it is rather romantic. Sounds like my dad was just as much of a helpless romantic as you.\u201d Truth be told, he still couldn\u2019t resist some teasing. \u201cBut...maybe his method could work for you as well!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh heh heh!\u201d Penn chuckled to himself, albeit with a bit of spite. \u201cI\u2019d need to find a girl first to do that. You know, one I can actually talk to without stuttering like an idiot.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis words did bring up a tiny speck in his mind though, like something from the very deep parts of his mind. Like...he actually already talked to someone about his girl problems? Maybe even wished for help? Nah, that sounded kind of silly to be completely honest. Still, it was a thought.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cWell, luckily, you\u2019re in Japan,\u201d Soma noted with a chuckle. \u201cHome to plenty of beautiful girls. All you have to do is find the right one, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I guess so,\u201d Penn chuckled again, feeling a bit better. \u201cWhat\u2019s better than Japanese girls after all?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m saying!\u201d Soma responded with a good laugh. Funny how before all of this, he could care less about girls, much less of their ethnicity. Now, however, he had a pretty good idea of just why Penn loved them so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what do you say?\u201d he asked while picking a Chrysanthemum from the ground and handing it over to Penn. \u201cHow about you give this to the first Japanese girl you see and watch what happens?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s not the worst thing that can happen,\u201d Penn smiled as he took it. \u201cHopefully it doesn\u2019t wilt before it finds a taker.\u201d he added with a little chuckle. With that, he began walking off again, keeping the Chrysanthemum firmly in his hand. There was at least one more area in the vicinity that he hadn\u2019t looked at yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo!\u201d Soma clapped his hands together. \u201cWhere to next, Mr. Tourist?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I want to head north,\u201d Penn answered as he turned his head. \u201cI think that\u2019s probably the one place nearby that I haven\u2019t really looked. Maybe there\u2019s something there, too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, only one way to find out,\u201d Soma said with a small grin. \u201cLet\u2019s get going so we can head back to civilization.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue,\u201d Penn nodded. \u201cI think I\u2019ve lost track of how long we\u2019ve actually been in this property.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Soma followed closely behind Penn, taking in the scenery as they walked. He was really enjoying this so far. He and Penn had never talked like this before, and it was a lot of fun. Perhaps this was all for the better after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, with some more walking through bushes, Soma looked to see an indention in the mountainside. Looked like a cave from where he was standing. Huh, he didn\u2019t know there was one here. He wondered if it was connected to this shrine as well. Penn seemed to think so, given how he slightly picked up his pace when he noticed it, leaving Soma further behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait! Penn! Oh, come on!\u201d Soma cried but Penn was already ahead by quite a bit. \u201cSheesh, was I like that when I ran off?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProblem keeping up?\u201d Sengen suddenly chirps behind Soma while grabbing the boy\u2019s shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoah!\u201d Soma cried out with a slight stumble, eventually looking back at the floating girl. \u201cYou really like to do that, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKinda,\u201d the spirit admitted with a small giggle. \u201cI just couldn\u2019t help but overhear your little chat. I never knew you two were such...romantics!\u201d She gave a large smirk at Somo while beginning to float in the air again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoma blushed slightly at the remark of her listening in like that. \u201cWell\u2026.I guess that\u2019s true. Guess I know a lot more than I thought now. Still...it did feel kind of nice. Penn\u2019s always been a great guy, if not a bit unlucky.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s a crying shame,\u201d Sengen agreed while shaking her head. \u201cThen again, such is par the course for many a dogged nice guy. Not every girl can be as accepting of him as you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026.you\u2019d think there would be at least one girl,\u201d Soma shrugged. \u201cI guess that\u2019s why I\u2019m hoping his luck changes, especially with that flower. Hopefully it\u2019ll be a good luck charm or something.\u201d he added with a little laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI doubt any girl he knows will understand just how much a flower like that means,\u201d Sengen responded with a slightly sad smile. \u201cTruth be told, I think only you would. Too bad you\u2019re not a girl, though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoma would normally just laugh something like that off, but he knew this was a girl that could apparently do just about whatever she wanted. He looked at Sengen with a somewhat off look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose...that\u2019s true in an odd way,\u201d he said to her. \u201cBut..I don\u2019t know if I can go that far. I mean, it\u2019s probably odd saying that because I\u2019ve already gone from a little American boy to a Japanese teenager...but a girl is really out there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs it?\u201d Sengen asked with a small smirk. \u201cIs it really? Imagine Penn\u2019s surprise when he finds a beautiful Japanese girl hanging out in this supposed secret valley, one who actually understands him like none other could.\u201d She gave off a soft smile. \u201cI bet that\u2019d just make his day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I have no doubt he would, and if he was happy, I certainly would be too,\u201d Soma said while taking a step back. \u201cBut...me of all people?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Sengen asked curiously. \u201cWhy not you? You seem like the perfect candidate. You said it yourself: if he\u2019s happy, you\u2019d be happy, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026\u2026\u201d Soma found himself almost at a total loss for words. \u201cI...did say that didn\u2019t I?....But I really don\u2019t know if I can be someone like that, even with you around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomeone like what?\u201d the spirit asked while tilting her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know\u2026.a girl perfect for Penn,\u201d Soma said, his face now completely red. What did he know about girls and romance anyway?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you understand how he feels, right?\u201d Sengen asked with a weak smile. \u201cThe way no other person on earth does?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-Yes I do!\u201d Soma acted a bit defensively. \u201cY-You\u2019re right about one thing. No one knows him better than me!\u201d he said, his face probably even redder. After a second, he couldn\u2019t help but feel like he just got goated into admitting how he felt, judging by the cheshire grin on Sengen\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you said it, not me,\u201d was all the spirit had to say before dropping to the ground and smiling over at Soma. \u201cYou know what? How about just a trial? You can go into the cave your friend just walked into as a girl and, once you come out, I\u2019ll let you decide about whether or not you\u2019d want to change back. Sound fair?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing all the way to a girl sounded more extreme than anything else so far. Yet, she was offering it as just a trial so\u2026.was there really any harm? If anything, he could easily decide to just go back to normal once it was done.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cOkay\u2026.I\u2019ll play the game,\u201d Soma gave a little sigh. \u201cSo, do your thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSengen suddenly gave a happy squeal while levitating in glee. \u201cOh, you won\u2019t regret this, I promise! Just gotta say the magic words\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she took a deep breath before chanting \u201c\u3053\u306e\u5c11\u5e74\u5f7c\u306e\u53cb\u4eba\u306e\u5922\u306e\u5973\u306e\u5b50\u3092\u4f5c\u308d\u3046\uff01\u201d and suddenly swooping in to kiss Soma on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoma\u2019s face was already red enough when Sengen actually floated over to kiss him. \u201cHey, was that really\u2026..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, his mouth clenched shut when a new feeling surged through him. It was somewhat similar to the feeling when he became a teenage boy, yet different at the same time. He wasn\u2019t sure what to describe it. There was pressure, but it felt like it was slowly building. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoma wrapped his arms together and shivered as his body grew colder. As he did so, he felt his shoulders cave in, causing his arms to slowly slink down, while the arms themselves became longer, more slender, and completely devoid of his newly earned bodyhair. Something similar happened to his legs, though they became shorter rather than longer, though his calves gained some much needed tone. Just as Soma began to notice this and started to stare at his altered limbs, he noticed both his arms and his legs undergoing a simultaneous rebirth, with his hands becoming as smooth as butter as his fingers and nails grew out slightly, while his feet became smaller but no less daintier than the rest of his new ligaments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is too weird\u2026\u201d the boy muttered to himself in the rather sweet, harmonious voice of a teenage girl raised in Osaka while feeling his tingling face. Little could he see his skull\u2019s very structure being molded like clay as his facial features softened enough to include larger, shimmering brown eyes, thin eyebrows, and pouty lips that he could detect a small amount of lip gloss on. In the meanwhile, Soma\u2019s short, black hair began to lighten and eventually grow out, curling slightly as it rapidly grew down to his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the biggest changes were yet to come. The teenager\u2019s hips gained more than a little meat, giving him a generous curvaceous figure, while also causing his butt to inflate to a cute bubble shape. Speaking of bubbles, slowly but surely, two orbs of flesh began to slowly inflate upon the Soma\u2019s chest, causing him to moan a little bit as he felt them grow out and become more sensitive by the second. However, all of this pailed in comparison to the next change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh~oooooh\u2026\u201d Soma sighed while reaching down at the crotch area. Sure enough, she felt nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, before Soma could even begin to comprehend the changes to her body, she suddenly felt wiggling from her clothes, feeling as if they were shifting along the surface of her body. Her new sensitive skin began to notice just how different her shirt and jeans were feeling. They were much softer, almost like silk. The shifting continued, with her sleeves starting flow down his arms. Unlike most normal clothes, though, the sleeves continued to lengthen, draping over his arms and hands completely. Another interesting thing was that, after that, they actually split down the middle a bit, before recrossing over each other in a robe-like fashion. Off of the top of her head, Soma wasn\u2019t sure what was happening to them, but the continued sensation indicated that it was far from done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she felt a little tightness as the hem of her shirt and jeans were coming together, any space between them beginning to disappear, going against her curves. The changes caused more as they traveled further south. Her legs were forced together a bit, the individual leggings coming closer together until they touched. From that, they began stitching together, the difference going away as Soma could soon feel her legs beginning to touch each other. This continued all the way down, until her clothes were very much robe-like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy am I wearing a robe?\u201d she asked, the obvious answer not quite coming to mind yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, with the garment looking completely shifted, Soma watched it fade completely to white, looking pretty plain. Right as that did though, a wave washed over the robe, decorating it with a fascination of colors. Flowers of pink, blue, and yellow decorated it all of the way down, with a cute strawberry on the left breast. After that, Soma felt things forming underneath, causing her to peek underneath. A pink juban seemed to form underneath, forming another layer of clothing underneath. Another feeling formed underneath as something clenched around her breasts; a bra most likely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, it still wasn\u2019t completely done. A little flash of light appeared around her waist; a rather large obi forming out of it. The obi clenched around her waist gently, certainly much closer than anything she could have worn before, finishing with a large bow in the back. The color and design was also quite lovely; being mostly black but decorated with large blue and pink flowers. To finish it off, and cause it to be a bit more tight, a light blue obi makura belt formed over the obi, tying itself right in the front. Right underneath that as it formed, she felt something form over her groin. It didn\u2019t take a genius to know that it was a pair of panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the changes flowed further down to her feet. Her socks changed texture a bit, with them changing properly into tobi socks. That wasn\u2019t much on it\u2019s own, but it was at the same time that his shoes suddenly lost their laces and the top and sides began to fade away, showing her feet. The material softened much, with the only tops of the shoes forming a small lace. The bottoms then rose about an inch or so, adding just a bit to her height. The color was a nice combination of pink and white.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd if that wasn\u2019t enough, Soma felt one last change on her head. Her soft brown hair suddenly moved as if by magic, doing itself up in a nice style. Topping it off was a bright yellow flower decoration on the right side of her head, tucked in neatly with her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat just left <a class=\"duLink\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-5lAIXBh4TKA/T1srlWXfqxI/AAAAAAAACEM/yN2o_vVh_B4/s1600/ooshima_yuko.jpg\">Soma completely dumbfounded, garbed in an absolutely gorgeous kimono.</a> \u00a0<a title=\"New Window\" href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-5lAIXBh4TKA/T1srlWXfqxI/AAAAAAAACEM/yN2o_vVh_B4/s1600/ooshima_yuko.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cWhat\u2026..in the world?\u201d Soma couldn\u2019t believe what she was seeing. This was quite the stunning garment, something she certainly had never felt before. It was much tighter than anything she had worn before. \u201cWhy...why am I in a kimono?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust thought you\u2019d look cute in it,\u201d Sengen explained with an amused giggle while starting to circle over her new creation. \u201cY\u2019know, not to toot my own horn, but...I made you freakin\u2019 beautiful! I couldn\u2019t imagine a single boy that\u2019d pass you down!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSengen\u2019s praise actually made Soma\u2019s face go just a bit red. The idea of being \u201cbeautiful\u201d wasn\u2019t exactly something she had been used to hearing. In any case, she took a few experimental steps in the shoes, hoping to get a feel for them. Supposedly, people from the West who had never worn such a thing would feel quite \u201crestricted\u201d when wearing one, and she could tell that that was pretty much true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s...kind of hard to walk in,\u201d she said after a few steps. \u201cThough, I guess this is what you probably wore most of time?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBack in my time of the living, yes,\u201d Sengen answered with a rather bittersweet smile. \u201cEspecially around festival time. Oh...my grandmother would always make me the most intricate kimonos you\u2019d ever see.\u201d She then looks over at Soma\u2019s clothes with a hint of pride. \u201cGuess I was just trying to imitate her there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds like a lot of fun,\u201d Soma actually smiled a bit, which only served to show off her newly feminine face. Wow, Sengen wasn\u2019t really joking when she called her beautiful. \u201cWhat kind of festival was it? Was it around this time of year or something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf I\u2019ve been keeping up with the lunar cycles, it should be around this time,\u201d Sengen responded with a nostalgic smile. \u201cAnd it was a wonderful festival of firework and...and food! Dances! Rituals! Romance! Oh, you would have loved it.\u201d She let out a happy sigh as she merely laid down on the grass and closed her eyes serenely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow...so this is around that time,\u201d Soma smiled a bit. \u201cWell, I guess it\u2019s no wonder you picked out something like this for me.\u201d she added, feeling just a little bit more comfortable. \u201cSounds like a great time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBelieve me, it is,\u201d the spirit said with a large smile. \u201cYou really should go. There\u2019s a popular legend that if you kiss someone at the same second as the first blast of fireworks, your souls will be intertwined forever.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s quite a legend,\u201d Soma said back. \u201cThough, I\u2019m not sure if said festival is really around now, or if it\u2019ll really play any role in what I\u2019m about to do.\u201d she said, looking back to glance at the cave\u2019s entrance. Penn was long out of sight by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, the first rocket was always launched at sundown,\u201d Sengen stated with a small smile. \u201cSo...why don\u2019t you go find your man?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh...right,\u201d Soma nodded a bit, turning to face the cave once again. However, she had only taken one step before she just realized something. \u201cWait...I just thought of this...but I don\u2019t really look like a \u2018Soma\u2019 right now.\u201d She smiled weakly, while moving her arms a bit in the elongated sleeves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose you\u2019re right,\u201d Sengen said while starting to float back up to her feet. \u201cYou look more like a...Mariko to me. Maybe that could be your name for now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMariko\u2026.\u201d the girl said the name to herself, as if trying it out. It sounded rather nice honestly, and it wasn\u2019t like she had a better suggestion. \u201cOkay, I think that\u2019s a good one. Thanks, Sengen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnytime,\u201d the spirit said with a large grin. \u201cI\u2019ll catch back up with you on the other side. Just let me know how things turn out between you and lover boy in there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe other side? What\u2019s\u2026..\u201d Mariko started, but before she could continue, she noticed that she was talking to nothing. Sengen had apparently vanished off. \u201cSheesh, couldn\u2019t even wait to let me finish? We don\u2019t even know if I\u2019ll even be like this at the end of it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, with a sigh, Mariko turned back towards the cave. She had come this far after all, so it was best to keep on going forward. She started making her way towards the cave, getting a bit more used to the kimono and shoes with each step. It still wasn\u2019t really easy, but it was manageable. Eventually, she reached the cave\u2019s entrance, looking into the pitch-blackness of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026.here goes everything,\u201d Mariko sighed as she took her first step inside the rocky interior, beginning to make her way inside. Who knew what really awaited her at very end?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>On some level, Penn honestly wondered what it was he was trying to find here. For a cave that didn\u2019t look all that big from the outside, it almost felt like some kind of labyrinth on the inside. He was thankful for the dim light inside, but it didn\u2019t help much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt least the temperature is rather nice,\u201d he said off-hand. It wasn\u2019t too warm or cold, so it wasn\u2019t as bad as it could be, he supposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, he wanted to see where the cave went. He had already seen the rest of the area so the last thing he wanted to do was call it quits now. Still, the silence was more than a bit creepy. The only things Penn could hear were his steps along the gravel and the occasional drop of water somewhere. A bit frustrated, he sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAugh, will anyone just give me some dang directions?!\u201d he cried out, actually kicking a small pebble in his way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, after he calmed himself down, he happened to catch something in the corner of his eye, Curious, he turned to his right, seeing a little luminescent crystal on the ground. It didn\u2019t look like something he had seen in textbooks or on the Internet before, which therefore got his curiosity. It wasn\u2019t like he had anything better to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo...what is this\u2026.\u201d he got closer to the crystal, kneeling down to get a better look at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a nice shade of light green, looking rather pretty against the cavern walls. He could almost even see himself in the reflection. However, right before he could comment on that, what he saw against the crystal\u2019s reflection seemed to change. Raising an eyebrow, Penn looked closer. Whatever the image was looked hazy, but he caught a flash of...pink...and white? Was that what it was?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d he asked himself, no one there to answer. His curiosity was peaked, though. It actually gave him something to think about. It seemed like an unnatural phenomenon, and things of that nature always got him a bit hyped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****Meanwhile***** <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDang it, where is he?\u201d Mariko grumbled to herself while trying to make heads or tails of the stone labyrinth. No matter where she looked or how far she traversed the accursed cavern, she still couldn\u2019t find even a glimpse of Penn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, this is just great\u2026\u201d she sighed as she began kicking a rock around with her foot. It was then that a small glimmer of light reflected off of her eye, causing her to look up. To much surprise, she found...light! Indeed, there appeared to be a chasm of light around the next right, which was enough to make Mariko suddenly regain a sort of spring in her step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, the girl began sprinting over to the end of her cavern, careful not to trip over her sandals or kimono. She barely even registered the wall of dull crystals she passed up on her way to our potential escape. However, upon finally making the turn, Mariko was immediately met with disappointment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of a proper way out, all she was rewarded with was a wall of sparking crystals refracting light from a hole in the ceiling twenty feet above her head. Mariko gave out another large groan, before suddenly noticing something strange about the wall. The shape was rather distorted, but she still knew it from anywhere: Penn! He must have been on the other side of the crystal wall. So, in an effort to maybe get the boy\u2019s attention and see if her friend could notice her as well, she began banging on the wall.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Penn was currently looking at a wall of crystals that he happened to see along his way. He couldn\u2019t believe it at first; seeing all of these crystals in the same place. Needless to say, it was quite stunning to look at. He couldn\u2019t help but smile as he looked at them shimmering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAmazing,\u201d he said to himself while gently smiling at the natural beauty of it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat being said, about a few seconds or so after he started looking at them, a distorted shape seemed to appear in the reflection of the crystals. Penn turned around, trying to see if someone was behind him, but there was no one besides him there. It was pretty peculiar. When he turned back to see the figure again, he walked a bit closer, trying not to approach it too quickly. The figure immediately reminded him of that little flash he saw in the little crystal prior back. The flash of pink and white which seemed to match what might be clothes on the figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho is that?\u201d Penn asked himself, only to receive no answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he got closer to the image, he could make out some features, though not fully. The figure looked female, and upon a closer look, he could make out beautiful brown eyes clearly belonging to a girl of Japanese heritage. What seemed to be a flower or something on her head struck him as pretty cute for her. From what he could tell, she was very cute, even if he couldn\u2019t see her fully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat all being said, the figure didn\u2019t seem still. It looked like it was moving a bit, and Penn felt like her mouth was moving too. Was she trying to say something, or was he just being crazy. He got closer until his face was right up against the flat surface of the crystals, even though he couldn\u2019t make out any new features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you trying to tell me something?\u201d Penn asked, moving his right hand up to the crystal\u2019s surface, touching it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt lined up perfectly with the girl\u2019s outstretched left hand on the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****Meanwhile*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn it, he can\u2019t hear me\u2026\u201d Mariko muttered to herself while watching Penn\u2019s mouth move and remain just as silent as before. Still...amazingly, she could see almost every feature of the boy from this crystal wall, from his shimmering brown hair to his penetrating blue eyes\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, what did she just think?! The girl shook her head as if trying to regain control of her own thoughts. She figured the cave dust was finally getting to her. Still, the two still needed to meet each other despite their current physical divide. Looking to her side, Mariko noticed a long passageway that eventually took a sharp turn to the right. Maybe, just maybe, that could lead to a potential intersection for the two teenagers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, since Penn obviously couldn\u2019t hear her right now, Mariko simply pointed over to her left before looking back at Penn with an inquisitive look. Luckily, she was rather adept in body language, but it was still up to the boy on the other side to decide if her question would be interpreted correctly or not.</span></div></div>",

The blurry image seemed to be moving her left side, as if maybe trying to ask him to move in that direction. He looked over to his right, trying to see if something was there. There was just another long pathway, though there was a sharp turn to the left up ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs she telling me to go that way?\u201d he asked himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked back at the image again. The girl seemed to be still, though he couldn\u2019t tell what look she had on her face. It was just probably as good as he was going to see out of this crystal. Maybe something up ahead would help him out more. With that in mind, he turned from the crystal, walking down the silent corridor once again. Whatever the case was, he hoped that it was worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough...he had to admit that parts he could make out of that girl seemed to linger in his mind. What little things he saw, like her eyes, her clothes, and even her hair. He couldn\u2019t get them out of his mind. His face was even beat red as he was thinking about it. He shook his head all the same though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat am I thinking?\u201d he said to himself. For all he knew, whatever he saw might not have been real in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, he couldn\u2019t help but finger the Yellow Crysthanamum in his hand. He remembered Soma\u2019s words, to just give it to the first girl he saw and see what happens. He chuckled darkly to himself at that thought. Well, he seemed to have seen a girl, but not really one he could give a flower too.<br>\r\nWell, one way or another, he made his way through the corridor, beginning to make the sharp turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****Meanwhile*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMariko couldn\u2019t help by wrap her arms together and contemplate as she walked down the empty corridors of stone. There was that moment whenever she looked back at Penn through the looking glass and just...froze. She just stared at him for a moment and noticed just how...mystifying he seemed from her new perspective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith each change, her view of the boy seemed to change more and more, to the point where she could barely even recall what it was to be related to Penn or even live anywhere other than Japan. It felt weird, not to mention confusing. At first, Mariko only saw Penn as someone cheesy enough to hold onto flowers for a future romantic and stupid enough to go wandering into a giant cave by himself. But the more she wandered and thought about him, the more she started to think of him as...cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow else could she describe a boy naive enough to hold on to a flower and eagerly search an entirely unknown cave? He literally stopped to smell the roses! How more adorable could a guy be?! Maybe...Maybe her body was just making her feel this way with all sorts of new hormones and chromosomes and neurons and...science...but the more she thought about him, the more she seemed to fluster and mentally berate herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut...this is what she signed up for...right\u2026?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully for Mariko, the turn was finally coming into view, causing her to gain some much needed spring in her step. So, at a nice jog, she began running off to the end of the cavern and took a harsh right.</span></div></div>",

It almost felt as if the cave was getting stuffier the more he went inside. He just hoped that this cave even had an exit. Wouldn\u2019t be worth it if he just got trapped here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026.what\u2019s around here?\u201d Penn made the sharp turn, looking down the path to see if anything was new.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, to his disappointment, there wasn\u2019t much new, making him sigh again. He had no choice but to keep on going forward, even though his confidence seemed just a bit shaky. In any case, he kept walking in that direction, just hoping for something to tell him that he was on the right track.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, after walking a bit further, he slumped against a wall. Despite being just the same gravel as the rest, it seemed a bit lighter and dustier than the rest, but that didn\u2019t seem to mean much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, how long does this place go on?!\u201d his voice echoed a bit through the little hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side of the wall, Mariko\u2019s ears suddenly perked up. That sounded just like...Penn! \u201cWatashinokoegakikoemasuka?!\u201d she called out before suddenly shaking her head. Did she just...instinctively use Japanese? It made sense, considering she grew up in Japan and all, but it just felt rather weird doing it by second-nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNonetheless, she immediately cleared her throat and instead asked, in English this time, \u201cCan you hear me?! I can hear you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenn\u2019s eyes immediately widened at the distinct female voice. He looked around briefly, until he pressed his head to that wall. He knocked on it a bit, and it made a tiny echo. It didn\u2019t feel as solid as the rest of the cave. Perhaps this was how he could hear her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait\u2026.so that girl he saw for real?! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-Yes! I can hear you!\u201d Penn called back. \u201cAre you stuck in here, too?! My name\u2019s Penn!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMariko couldn\u2019t help smile at the boy\u2019s immediate enthusiasm. The first thing he says upon hearing a girl is ask if she\u2019s alright and then immediately introduce himself. The little dork was almost adorable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess you could say I am,\u201d Mariko responded in a slightly softer voice, seeing as how yelling didn\u2019t seem to be completely necessary in this situation. \u201cMy name\u2019s Mariko. Happy to meet you, Penn-kun~!\u201d She couldn\u2019t help but giggle at her instinctive use of the friendly honorific. Maybe she was really becoming more Japanese by the second. Maybe that wasn\u2019t such a bad thing either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat little honorific with the giggle at the end brought a little blush to Penn\u2019s face, making him kind of thankful that she couldn\u2019t see him. Boy, all he did was hear a voice and he already introduced himself. He wasn\u2019t sure if he was desperate or just a bit panicked when he said it. Well, whatever the case, it was established that he wasn\u2019t alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-Nice to meet you as well, Mariko,\u201d he smiled, lowering his voice as well. \u201cI...I guess you\u2019re stuck in this cave like I am?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI already told you yes,\u201d Mariko responded with a small smirk on her face before laughing to herself a bit. She was starting to see just why her brother could never really attract much female attention. \u201cStill, maybe if we work together, we can find a way out, right? Do you see anything up ahead?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUp ahead?\u201d Penn repeated to himself as he turned back to look. There was absolutely nothing down the path he already came through. However, when he looked to his right, he saw something in the distance. \u201cUm\u2026.I think I see a tiny light...or something like that. You see anything like that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, something like that,\u201d the girl said while bearing witness to a similar sight ahead of her. \u201cProbably just another wall of crystals or something. Still, it\u2019s something, right? Might as well keep moving.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure,\u201d Penn nodded, backing up from the wall. \u201cSo...meet you over there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure,\u201d Mariko parroted back with a small giggle. \u201cMaybe I could see your handsome, undistorted face this time.\u201d She smiled to herself in amusement of her own flirtatious nature, but truth be told, she was starting to have trouble figuring out in she was truly joking or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenn tried to control the massive blush on his face when she called him handsome. Did that mean she saw him like he saw her? Well, that could wait. They had more important matters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-Well then\u2026.I\u2019ll meet you there,\u201d he stuttered slightly as he turned from the wall completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Penn gave a light jog towards the small light, it getting slowly bigger and bigger as he picked up the pace. It was easier to run with an objective in mind for once. In fact, it really wasn\u2019t too long before what was glaring at him suddenly came into view.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Penn finally approached what light was glaring in his face, he finally got close enough to see just what it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm? What is\u2026.?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere seemed to be some kind of mirror, though it almost resembled the crystals he had seen before. To say it was beautiful though would be an understatement. The mirror\u2019s surface was so sleek and spotless, as if crafted by heavenly beings or something of that nature. Well, whatever it was, Penn pushed aside those thoughts, walking right over to the mirror. He wondered if it was like the crystals from earlier, and if he could see this girl. Yet, when he reached the mirror, he didn\u2019t see anyone there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope she\u2019s really there,\u201d Penn said, feeling a bit longing for the voice he only heard just a minute ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMariko casually walked over to the glistening wall, only to suddenly stop dead in her tracks upon seeing Penn\u2019s reflection, clear as day, within the wall\u2019s surface. For reasons not even she could quite explain, the girl began to fluster upon seeing a similar look upon the boy in the mirror. Still, she managed to give off a friendly smile and gave a casual wave at the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-Hey, Penn-kun. N-Nice to see your cute face again.\u201d Weirdly enough, those words felt surprisingly liberating. Her body grew slightly less stiff as she straightened herself out a bit and gave off a slightly more genuine smile. It looked as if she was finally gaining some much needed confidence around this...interesting boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInterestingly enough, her words seemed to have a somewhat relaxing effect on Penn too, making him smile and give a small wave back. Even he thought that it was odd that he was feeling calmer. This girl...there was something relaxing about her, not the usual gut-wrenching feeling he got around other girls. By now, both of them were at the mirror\u2019s surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd...it\u2019s nice to see your beautiful face as well, Mariko,\u201d he smiled at her, before scratching his head a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, was that too forward?\u201d he asked with a small chuckle. He even seemed to be able to laugh casually around her. Whatever it was, he liked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMariko felt like blushing a bit, but it wasn\u2019t like he was flirting with him any more than she was. Still, it felt surprisingly nice being flirted with, especially from such a sweet boy like Penn. Considering how such a good judge of character he always was, maybe it was a good sign that he actually seemed attracted to her. She almost felt...flattered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine,\u201d she answered back with a small giggle while beginning to play with her hands some. \u201cSo\u2026\u201d She began looking all around herself. \u201cI honestly can\u2019t think of much to talk about right now. Still kinda stuck in a cave. But\u2026\u201d She smiled back at Penn. \u201cAt least I know I\u2019m not alone in here. So that\u2019s comforting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSame here,\u201d Penn smiled back and nodded. \u201cI was honestly kind of worried, just hearing the constant silence of this place. Maybe we can talk more once we get out? There\u2019s gotta be an exit, I\u2019m sure!\u201d he said with a bit of returning confidence. Since seeing this girl, he was feeling more comfortable, and that seemed to serve as more motivation to find an exit for them both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCertainly sounds like a plan for me,\u201d Mariko responded with a large smile. \u201cMaybe we could find it together! You know, like Ch\u012bmuw\u0101ku! Er, I mean teamwork.\u201d Wow, she really was turning Japanese\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI like the sound of that,\u201d Penn smiled a bit wider. \u201cSo, um, what do you think? Just continuing to walk down the corridors?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure,\u201d the Japanese girl answered with her now naturally cheery disposition. \u201cJust let me know whatcha find, okay, Penn-kun?\u201d She strolled over closer to the mirror and smirked at him while putting her right hand against the glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenn couldn\u2019t help but chuckle as he got closer to the glass, raising his left hand. In all honesty, he wasn\u2019t sure if he was doing this on his own, but his hand moved against the glass, lining up near perfectly with Mariko\u2019s hand. He wasn\u2019t sure what it was, but it almost felt as if a surge of electricity shot down his spine when he did that, giving him goosebumps all over. He wasn\u2019t sure why, but for a brief instant, it almost felt like they were the only beings in existence, like nothing else mattered at the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight after that instant, however, he removed his hand and the feeling was suddenly gone, but certainly not forgotten. Penn felt a fluttering in his chest like no other. This girl...she was stunning in every way. What would she be like when he finally got to see her in the flesh? The thought seemed to have him surging with adrenaline. Now, he was more motivated than ever!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ll see you then, Mariko,\u201d he smiled one more time before beginning to turn. However, he ended up turning back briefly. \u201cAnd...you know\u2026.that kimono is really beautiful. Almost as much as its wearer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, he instantly ran off, face now a newly invented shade of red. He could NOT believe he just said that. What was he?! Some cliche anime protagonist?! The thought persisted in his head even as he began to run again.</span></div></div>",

For just a brief moment, there was no cave, there was no magic, no Soma, no Brad, no hormones, not even any glass separating the two. No, for just that one moment, there was just Mariko and Penn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd once they let go, she wanted to be that again.

Well, with reason of course. He still had to take note to not run into the walls in his excitement. Still, with everything he had seen so far, he was sure there had to be a way out. Why would there be such things in here without an exit?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on! Where are you?!\u201d he said to himself. He wanted some kind of sign. An indication of\u2026.light?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if answering his prayer, Penn noticed a dim light on the gravel around him. He looked straight ahead, seeing a somewhat stronger light around the corner. Was\u2026.was this it?! The very exit that eluded him?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarely able to keep himself from crying a victory yell, Penn ran as fast as his legs could, the sight of light becoming ever stronger as he rounded the corner. There were some Japanese ornaments around the end with some writing, but it wasn\u2019t like he could read them anyway. He had better things in mind. He climbed up a small incline in the ground, before finally approaching its peak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there it was. In front of him was a gaping hole in the mountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes!\u201d he cried as he ran once more, the twilight of the setting sun came into view. The sunset, while only beginning, was incredibly stunning to the eyes. The sight in front of him bore some similarities to the other side, with a soothing creek and breathtaking trees and flowers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, even as he looked around, seeing another hole in the mountain, he wondered about the even more stunning being he wanted to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****Back Inside*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, despite her newfound resolve, trying to run in a kimono wasn\u2019t exactly working. Mariko had slowed down a bit, catching her breath after her brief jog. Yet, she still wore a big smile, for she could see in the distance her exit out of the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFinally! It\u2019s so close!\u201d Mariko smiled a bit wider, picking up her pace just a bit. Her feet were just a bit sore, as the sandals weren\u2019t exactly ideal for cave exploration, but she was willing herself forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, as the small bit of light from the exit began to get bigger, Mariko got the feeling of a familiar presence, causing her to slow down and smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSengen...you\u2019re there aren\u2019t you?\u201d she smiled, shaking her head left to right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave I become that predictable?\u201d a familiar voice rang from the ceiling. Like a chameleon losing its camouflage, Sengen showed herself hanging on the ceiling of the cave like a bat, before swooping down and landing gracefully on her feet. \u201cJust thought I\u2019d...check up on you before you left the cave. The exit\u2019s right ahead, ya know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can see that,\u201d Mariko nodded, sparing a glance at said exit. \u201cAnd besides, I remember you saying that you wanted to meet me at the end. Have you been watching everything that happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe a teensy bit,\u201d Sengen admitted with a weak smile, visibly blushing of embarrassment. \u201cS-Sorry, I...I should have asked.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of seeming angry at all, Mariko just smiled and shook her head. \u201cIya, soreha daij\u014dbudesu,\u201d she blurted out, causing another giggle at her near-subconscious use of Japanese. \u201cThat sounds so natural now. I think I like the feeling.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo then...I take it you\u2019ve taken a liking to your new body?\u201d Sengen asked with a slowly growing smile. \u201cHave you come to a decision then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d There was no hesitation at all. Mariko just smiled at Sengen. \u201cI...I can\u2019t deny how I feel now. When we touched back there..well, kind of...everything just felt clear to me. Penn...he is who I want to be with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSengen could only smile back with certain warmness emanating from her heart. Having seen the small American boy blossom into a beautiful Japanese woman, it...it was one of her proudest moments in hundreds of years. She couldn\u2019t help but tear up a bit. Before Mariko could even get another word in, the spirit swooped down to hug her around the neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI...I\u2019m so glad to hear that\u2026\u201d is all she can say with a soft smile as a single tear drips onto her creation\u2019s neck. \u201cSo...ready to become little Mariko now and forever?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMariko was a bit surprised to see how she actually felt Sengen around her, but she happily pulled her arms around Sengen as well. The duo almost looked like two comforting sisters in a way. In any case, Mariko\u2019s answer was definitive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I am,\u201d Mariko looked straight at Sengen\u2019s face. \u201cI\u2019m ready to be who I am forever.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well then,\u201d Sengen said while letting go of the girl and simply smiling at her. \u201cI\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll end up forgetting all about me after this is done, so...I guess this is goodbye. Thank you, though. This was...fun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdmittingly, Mariko\u2019s smile dipped just a bit. Somehow, that wasn\u2019t too surprising, but that didn\u2019t make it feel good. She couldn\u2019t deny that she had developed a bit of an attachment to the excitable young spirit as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026.too bad,\u201d Mariko sighed, though she tried to maintain her smile. \u201cI kind of wish I could see you again somehow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe we will,\u201d Sengen replied with a trembling smile as well. \u201cWe can only hope. Until then, though\u2026\u201d The spirit closed her eyes and spoke in a quiet whisper \u201cBalse,\u201d causing Mariko\u2019s head to glow slightly, while she simply disappeared out of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMariko\u2019s eyes slowly got their focus back, readjusting to the light coming from the end of the tunnel. Did she just blank out for a second there? Her hand briefly went up to her neck, feeling something small and wet before bringing it to the front of her face. Looking at the little teardrop in her hand somehow filled her with sadness, like something was just lost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, looking where the light was coming, she also knew what something warm and inviting was also awaiting her. Slowly, she took one step, and then kept going from there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPenn-kun\u2026.\u201d </span></div></div>",

The scenery around him was as breathtaking as it was on the other side of the mountain. Truth be told, there seemed to many wonderful places to see in Japan, and this was just the first stop after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t long though that he soon heard gravelly footsteps from a ways behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm?\u201d he hummed as he turned his head back towards the twin exits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPenn-kuuuuuuuuun~!\u201d Mariko cheered as she sprinted out of the cave and towards the boy of her dreams. Before Penn could even get a word out, the girl practically tackled him with a hug, squeezing him as tight as she could, as if making sure he was truly real.  \u201cWatashi wa saish\u016btekini anata o hakken! Oh, you\u2019re so squishy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenn\u2019s arms instinctively wrapped around Mariko as soon as she hugged him, perhaps even tighter than he intended. Yet, the smile certainly hadn\u2019t fallen from his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re so petite!\u201d He laughed, noting the difference in height and size between them. It got a little laugh from both parties. \u201cIn any case, I\u2019m glad to finally meet you. For real I mean.\u201d he blushed just a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe feeling is mutual,\u201d Mariko giggled a little bit while letting go of the boy\u2019s neck, only to grab ahold of his hands and look up to the boy with the largest smile she could muster. \u201cI...I really don\u2019t know what came over me, but...as soon as we touched our hands together on that wall...I really wanted to meet you again so I could make sure you weren't just too good to be true.\u201d She blushes a little bit as well, but keeps a steady smile as she looks down at their conjoined hands. \u201cThey\u2019re almost as smooth as the glass, honestly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think yours are smoother..\u201d Penn said with a smile, his cheeks very much red. \u201cIt\u2019s...kind of strange. I\u2019ve never seen you before...and yet when I heard your voice for the first time...I was immediately entranced. I wanted to see what you were really like.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight after he said that, a light went off in his head, making him want to slap himself. He quickly removed his hands from Mariko\u2019s. \u201cGive me a second.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, he reached his right hand behind him, bringing out the Yellow Chrysanthemum he had been carrying. To some extent, he felt as if he was forgetting something about it, but his mind was telling him one thing: give this to the first girl you meet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026.I\u2019d like to...give this to you,\u201d he managed to say with a massive blush, holding out the delicate flower to the girl that had mystified him so.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mariko could only stare at the flower in the boy\u2019s hand. All of her life, she had seen thousands of the same kind, all physically identical to the one before her. Yet...this one just seemed to glow whenever she looked at it. If anything, she thought it to be just like Penn: maybe it was just one in a million, but there was  just something so innocent and pure about it that made it the most beautiful flower she had ever laid her eyes on. Perhaps this boy was being more than a little cheesy, but...that only made him all the more genuine. So, needless to say, she happily accepted the flower, plucking it out of Penn\u2019s hand with a massive smile that was bright enough to distract from the red that had overtaken her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the girl leaned over and gave the boy a quick peck on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenn\u2019s face didn\u2019t get any less red when the girl pecked him on the cheek, though his smile didn\u2019t decrease either. It was the first time he had ever received a kiss from a girl, and all he felt from it was bliss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI..I think it really suits you,\u201d he smiled again. \u201cIt\u2019s funny that I would think that, since I just met you. Yet...I can\u2019t think of anything better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know the feeling,\u201d Mariko responded before setting the flower in her hair. \u201cMaybe...Maybe this all fate or something...I dunno\u2026\u201d She gives a nervous smile as she starts absentmindedly playing with her fingers. However, her focus begins to shift as she starts to see the sun slowly drop down. \u201cOh! I...I didn\u2019t realize it was so late!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then looked over at Penn with a small smile before simply sitting on the ground with her legs crossed. \u201cC\u2019mon.\u201d She patted on an area of grass to her right. \u201cWatashitoisshoni suwatte imasu.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, okay,\u201d Penn nodded as he took the spot she patted for him, crossing his legs on the soft grass. He looked up and saw the setting sun. \u201cWow, this is a great view. You can really see the sun here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou see the sun almost anywhere, silly,\u201d Mariko responded with a giggle while playfully punching the boy, causing him to laugh a bit as well.. She then turned back to the sunset and let out a pleasurable sigh. \u201cY\u2019know...considering all that happened this morning...I\u2019m glad it ended up becoming the best day of my life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d Penn raised an eyebrow at her. \u201cWas today rather eventful for you? I mean, before you were in that cave with me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I was trying to make it to the fireworks festival, honestly,\u201d Mariko admitted with an embarrassed smile. \u201cBut it was apparently on the other side of the mountain. I\u2019m apparently terrible with maps and ended up wandering down this mysterious path. I know I probably should have walked back hours ago, but...something just kept drawing me closer down this path.\u201d She then gave off a warm smile over at Penn, both of their eyes glistening from the red sun. \u201cThen I ended up finding you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenn gave a small chuckle. \u201cIn all honesty, my story isn\u2019t too different. I was just trying to find an attraction to see in Tokyo. Then I end up finding a path out of the park and down to that shrine on the other side of the cave. From then on, I was mostly exploring. Though, that little flower did stick with me. I did hope to maybe...give it to a girl.\u201d His face slowly grew ever redder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, looks like you found that girl then,\u201d Mariko remarked with a small giggle before taking the flower out of her hair and looking back down at it. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s crazy. My dad gave my mom the exact same flower whenever he confessed his love to her. Guess goofy minds think alike.\u201d She let out another small laugh before looking back up at Penn. \u201cThank you for this. I shall treasure it forever.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing those words made Penn\u2019s face go a bit redder, though he felt extremely flattered. He never really believed he, as humble as he was, to really have an effect on someone. It felt nice in all honesty; a feeling he didn\u2019t want to lose. Oddly enough, he felt as if he had heard a story similar to that once, but he couldn\u2019t place that memory anywhere. Oh well, it wasn\u2019t important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d he smiled. \u201cI...I think it looks really good on you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Penn felt as if he could feel her sleeve against his arm. He looked down, seeing that the distance between where they were sitting was smaller. Was he slowly moving closer to her? Or was she moving to him? Well, guess it didn\u2019t matter, but it did surprise Penn just a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou...feeling cold at all? It is a little chilly here,\u201d Penn said, as there were a few chill winds with the setting sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI...I suppose I am,\u201d Mariko answered with a large smile before beginning to lean her head on the boy\u2019s shoulders. Despite barely even qualifying as contact, she felt warmer than ever before next to Penn. \u201cAre you maybe offering something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenn\u2019s breath hitched a bit. \u201cOh r-right!\u201d He cried a bit, using his right arm to curl around her shoulders gently, lightly grasping her right shoulder in the process. \u201cHow does that feel?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMariko could feel her heart flutter as she and Penn merged closer than ever. It was enough to make her close her eyes, blush a little, and just let the warmth that came from this wonderful boy just sink in\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s wonderful,\u201d she replied simply yet sweetly. \u201cThank you so much, Penn. You\u2026\u201d The girl began to curl her own arms around the boy\u2019s shoulders. \u201cYou are a wonderful boy. Thank you...for everything.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Mariko had curled both her arms around him, and he kind of moved as well until she was now sitting in front of him, making it easier for her to hug him. He smiled as he was able to curl his left arm around her as well in response, bringing close enough for their chests to touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a way, he felt strange. He didn\u2019t know this girl...and yet he did. He had just met her for the first time, but he had the feeling of knowing her forever. Even as he leaned back a bit, he kept thinking about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s funny,\u201d he started. \u201cI just met you, but I feel like we\u2019ve known each other for years. You feel like that at all?\u201d he added with a little chuckle, as if he wasn\u2019t sure if it was amusing or absurd, or perhaps both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe exact same, actually,\u201d Mariko replied with a giggle before looking lovingly into his eyes. \u201cI just feel this sort of...connection with you, I guess. Like, as soon as I saw your eyes through that crystal wall and heard those kind words with that innocent little face of yours...I just felt like I knew everything about you. I could see just how genuine you truly are just by that look.\u201d She then blushes a bit, though her smile barely wavers. \u201cIs that weird?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf it is, then I guess we\u2019re both weird.\u201d Penn didn\u2019t hold in his laugh then, complemented by a giggle from Mariko as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter opening his eyes back up, Penn felt struck again. The sun was really setting now, with it\u2019s orange haze practically making Mariko\u2019s skin glow in his eyes. Oh, it was almost criminal how lovely she looked right now; the sun off her skin, her slightly parted lips showing pearly white teeth, how her brown eyes just bore into him. It just hit him all at once, so much to the point that he didn\u2019t even really notice himself beginning to lean into her just a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Mariko couldn\u2019t tell if she was leaning in on Penn, if he was leaning in on her, or both. All she knew was that they were leaning ever closer, their faces closer than ever before. After that, the next two seconds seemed to happen in slow motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, the sun went down completely. Then, a mighty firework was launched into the sky. This was at the same time as when both Mariko and Penn\u2019s lips began to pearse together, only to touch the next second. Upon their lip-to-lip contact, the firework in the dusky night sky exploded into a beautiful display. The same could be said for the new couple, as both felt a sudden wave of pleasure upon connecting, cementing their feelings forever.</span></div></div>",

This moment felt unbelievable, certainly something he never thought would happen when he came to Tokyo, The kiss was simple, not much movement than simply connecting their lips, but that was all that was needed to convey everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt did not take long for the two to part lips. Luckily for the both of them, they chose to back off at the same time. Normally, this would only be met with disappointment, but the two knew that they were just as comfortable next to each other as when they were physically connected. The two then began to sit down and merely enjoy the fireworks while leaning against each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSore ga watashi no saisho no kisudeshita,\u201d Mariko admitted with a blissful smile as snuggled against Penn\u2019s shoulder. \u201cArigato.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Penn smiled as he continued to hug her close with one arm. \u201cMaybe I should actually try to learn to speak Japanese myself. I can understand what you\u2019re saying, yet I can\u2019t say it myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, so you can understand me?\u201d Mariko asked with an amused smile. \u201cAnata wa tada no yumede wa arimasen ka? Anata mo kanpekina y\u014d ni miemasu.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026\u2026\u201d Penn gave it some thought, before just shrugging with a smile. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure that was a compliment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot the best at it, are you?\u201d Mariko asked with a giggle. \u201cEh, it\u2019s fine.\u201d She then gave a small smirk at the boy. \u201cYou\u2019re just lucky I happen to be president of the Foreign Language Club at my school.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo kidding,\u201d Penn smiled, before smirking. \u201cThen perhaps you can be my Japanese teacher,<br>\r\n Miss\u2026.whatever your last name is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s Akiyama,\u201d Mariko responded with another giggle. \u201cAnd they\u2019re just called surnames around here. And you shall refer to me only as Akiyama-san, okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh...uh y-yes...A-Akiyama-san\u2026\u201d Penn said, suddenly feeling a bit flustered as a blush returned to his face. Boy, did he feel a little embarrassed from that. His lack of true knowledge about the culture seemed to be showing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m just kidding, silly,\u201d Mariko laughed while lightly punching the boy\u2019s shoulder before giving off a smirk. \u201cYou\u2019re just lucky you managed to get a girl that knows English as well as I do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d Penn lightly smiled back, more at ease now. \u201cThough...I was serious about the teaching part. I...would really love to learn more about Japan...and you as well, if it\u2019s alright.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have my blessing, yes,\u201d the girl smiled back. \u201cIf you want to know anything about me or my country, just go ahead and...how do you Americans say it? Shoot?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenn just chuckled. \u201cYeah, absolutely.\u201d he smiled while bringing her just a bit closer, his own head resting lightly on hers. There would be plenty of time to learn later. For now, it was enough to just enjoy tonight.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the two lovers talked amongst themselves, a lone spirit watched from a nearby tree, completely invisible to the rest of the world. Needless to say, Sengen couldn\u2019t help but feel proud of the love she allowed to bloom. Admittedly, there was the tiniest bit of remorse for sorta tricking the boy, but she didn\u2019t do anything the boy didn\u2019t agree to. After all, both seemed happier than ever before now, so it\u2019s not like there was a lot to complete about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet...Sengen couldn't help but feel bittersweet. As lovely as the new couple looked and as happy as she was certain they were...she was going to miss interacting with them. Unfortunately, the life of a spirit is a lonely one, and due to the nature of Penn\u2019s wish, she was very reluctant to allow either of them memories of their encounters with her. Penn did still have one more wish, but...he seemed happy enough as it was. There was no need to remind the other of their former, lesser lives just so she could solve another wish. Maybe...Maybe it was just time to head back to the ruins\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know\u2026.\u201d Penn started up again from their spot. \u201cI still find it funny how both you and me were lead to this very spot, almost as if something was at work if that makes any sense.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I get how you feel,\u201d Mariko responded. \u201cThere\u2019s no way I can just meet the best guy ever in a cave on a hidden path we both decided to go on, especially while you were just here for vacation.\u201d She gives a weak smile as she looks back up at the fireworks in the night sky. \u201cTo be honest, I have the vaguest memory of some sort of mysterious force guiding me. Like...like a spirit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm\u2026.you know, I think I can relate,\u201d Penn nodded. \u201cI feel as if some force was guiding me too. I guess it can\u2019t be coincidence if it was both of us. Though..if there was such a thing, then I\u2019m grateful. I don\u2019t know if I would have met the girl of my dreams otherwise.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cWell, there was a shrine back there,\u201d Mariko noted with a small smile. \u201cMaybe we were really guided by the spirit of that shrine. If so, we have an awful lot to pay he or she back for.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSengen couldn\u2019t help but stare at the couple even more than before. Did they...remember her?! No...no way, she...she was supposed to wipe all memories of herself, but...how were they remembering her?! The little spirit wasn\u2019t sure if she should have been scared or excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn all of her time as a spirit, all those centuries...not once did anyone she wiped the memories of ever remember her. Apparently, Sengen ended up playing such a major role in these two\u2019s lives that there was no way they could just forget her. They couldn\u2019t quite remember her, either, but they remembered her presence, all because she actually meant something to them. Honestly, that broke Sengen\u2019s heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Penn nodded with a smile. \u201cIf there is such a spirit, then we both owe him or her huge thanks.\u201d He paused for a second, feeling something warm as he thought about it. \u201cDo you think the spirit might be lonely here? Must be a pretty selfless one to go through the effort of bringing us together.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, really,\u201d Mariko responded with a small smile. \u201cMost of the spirits I\u2019ve heard of are simple tricksters that mess with humans for their own amusement. For one to go out of its way to bring true love together...well, I\u2019d love to meet such a spirit and thank it. They do live a lonely existence.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgreed,\u201d Penn nodded once again. He felt a strange feeling inside, as if reacting to what he was thinking. Still, he didn\u2019t exactly disagree with it. \u201cIn fact\u2026...I wish I could meet the spirit...and repay the kind of love we\u2019ve shared...if that makes any sense.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Sengen had a physical heart, it would have stopped. Did...did he really just wish for\u2026? And...And he still had the last wi\u2026.sh\u2026?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl suddenly jumped out of the tree in joy as she allowed herself to become visible to the mortals once again. \u201cHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEY!!!\u201d she called out before nearly landing on the ground on her head, only to stop in mid-air before hitting it. \u201cDid somebody call for me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenn suddenly jumped a bit, quickly turning behind him on the ground. His eyes met the spirit\u2019s own, unsurprisingly surprising him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA-A spirit?!\u201d he cried out. Oddly enough, he was hit by a case of deja vu, like he had already reacted like this somehow. Was his gut feeling about a spirit really true? Perhaps it was, because he oddly seemed to calm down a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHont\u014d no seishin!\u201d Mariko gasped to herself while covering her mouth with her hands. Honestly, she wanted to be more scared, but...there was just something about the spirit that seemed familiar. Yes, once she looked into the spirit\u2019s eyes, she couldn\u2019t help but feel a familiar presence, one she remembered that guided her to the love of her life. She could even remember the name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSengen\u2026\u201d the girl said with a soft smile. \u201cIt\u2019s...nice to formally meet you.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So\u2026\u201d She motioned to herself happily. \u201cHere I am!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenn seemed to find himself more at ease as he heard Sengen talk. Even the name was coming back to him when he heard Mariko mention it. He smiled at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSengen\u2026..\u201d he muttered. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026.nice to see you. I feel like I should know more...but right now I just feel happy that you\u2019re here...and for everything I know you\u2019ve done.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs you should be,\u201d Sengen responded with a prideful, but no less loving look. \u201cI believe I did some great work on you two. Some of my greatest work, actually. You have the right to be impressed!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three of them shared a happy laugh at that, the sounds practically echoing across the peaceful landscape around them. Even back at the shrine, it didn\u2019t sound so desolate with the sounds of laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I certainly am!\u201d Penn cried out, still laughing. Still, more bits were coming to mind for him. \u201cSo...I feel like...this is my last wish correct? Are...you just going to disappear again after this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI...I\u2019m afraid so\u2026\u201d the spirit admitted as her visible joy slowly melts away to bittersweetness. She was hoping to distract herself from their inevitable second farewell. \u201cI...I\u2019m just a spirit. I\u2019m confined to my land, which happens to just be this little plot of land of mine. I\u2019ll always be here, but\u2026\u201d She begins sorrowfully staring at the ground. \u201cYou won\u2019t\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell...that\u2019s just horrible!\u201d Mariko retorted with a very rare burst of anger, if only to try and direct her sadness of the situation somewhere else. \u201cI...I mean\u2026\u201d She turned over to Penn. \u201cYou wished that we could repay her, right? How is leaving her to be alone for all eternity anything anyone would want?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenn barely wasted a second with his response. \u201cYou\u2019re right. No one deserves that. Certainly not someone like Sengen,\u201d he said resolutely. \u201cEven when our memories were more faded, we didn\u2019t forget her. We can\u2019t let that go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, Penn stared directly at Sengen. \u201cSengen\u2026.I want to do exactly as I wished. I\u2026.We both would like to repay you.\u201d After saying that, he looked at Mariko. \u201cRight?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMariko looked back at Penn and gave an affirmative nod without any hesitation. \u201cOf course.\u201d She then looked back over at Sengen, who looked about ready to start crying. \u201cYou deserve a better life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, Penn nodded. \u201cSo yeah, that\u2019s what we think.\u201d he said. At this, he even offered his hand out. \u201cWhile it might seem a little selfish on our part...we\u2019d like you to come with us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC-C-Come with you\u2026?\u201d Sengen asked as she continued to tear up, even to the point of sniffling a bit. \u201cH-How?! I\u2019m...I\u2019m a spirit! A spirit can\u2019t just...leave! If I could, I would have done it centuries ago!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026..\u201d Penn tried to think. \u201cWhat if you weren\u2019t a spirit anymore? Could you...perhaps make yourself human?\u201d In a way though, the question sounded a bit silly. You\u2019d think that if she could, she might have done so long ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTurn...myself human?\u201d Sengen asked with a shocked look. \u201cI...I\u2019ve considered it before, but...I\u2019ve never been able to really do it on my own free will. I...I still think it\u2019d be achievable if someone wished for it, though.\u201d She then gave off a nervous smile. \u201cBut...you already used up all of your wishes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c......Frick!\u201d Penn swore to himself. Was that really all he could do? After everything that happened, was he useless to change anything? He stared at the ground, his face barely even holding some budding tears of his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, Penn, wait\u2026\u201d Mariko started to say while comforting her boyfriend by putting one hand on his shoulder. \u201cYou...You wished we could repay her for all of the love she\u2019s given us, right? After Penn solemnly nodded, she lifted up his chin and looked at him straight in the eyes. \u201cWell, I think the only way we could properly repay her is by making her human, wouldn\u2019t you say?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenn\u2019s eyes widened when the realization dawned upon him. When she put it that way, it sounded so obvious. Almost immediately, his expression completely reversed, smiling and nodding at his girlfriend before turning to Sengen again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou hear that? She\u2019s exactly right,\u201d Penn said. \u201cGiving you a better life like you did for us is the only fitting way to repay you. It\u2019s the least you deserve. I\u2019m sure you can twist the wish that much.\u201d he added with a little smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he even took one of Mariko\u2019s hands in his own. \u201cThink of it as a wish from both of us. It\u2019s only fitting that way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSengen could only stare at the two humans before her with wide eyes, a gape of wonderment, and tears starting to flow down her cheeks. What these two were asking for wasn\u2019t going to be easy to pull off, but it would still be the best thing she\u2019d ever done. So, she simply smiled as she looked over at the ground as her entire being began to glow. Nobody, not even herself, would remember this spectacle afterwards, but if they had, the entire city of Tokyo would refer to it as The Great Lightning Bolt: a fantastic display of color upon the mountaintop as reality shifted one last time\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Junior year high school was really a royal pain, as if he thought it could get any worse than last year. Well, at least he didn\u2019t have too much homework tonight, and what little he had was already done. Good thing, too, because he had something more important in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smile, he walked over to his laptop, quickly logging in and opening up Skype. It wasn\u2019t something he used much long ago, but it had a great use now. He smiled again as he went to the video chat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKon'nichiwa!\u201d He smiled at what he saw. \u201cSo, how was that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, congratulations!\u201d Mariko giggled back from the other side of the video chat, clothed in a modest uniform, much different from the extravagant robes she wore upon their first meeting. \u201cYou know the only Japanese word that most natives of your country do. At least you got the pronunciation spot on!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I was going for,\u201d Penn smiled. \u201cI\u2019ve tried continuing to pronounce all the words you showed me back then, and even the ones since we\u2019ve able to talk through this.\u201d He smiled again before adding. \u201cLet\u2019s try this then: Dono y\u014d ni shite, utsukush\u012b o shite iru nodesu ka?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWatashi wa totemo \u012b,\u201d Mariko replied with a large smirk. \u201cMotome itadaki, makotoni arigat\u014dgozaimasu. And how are you, handsome?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPretty good, aside from the usual,\u201d Penn replied. \u201cMy grades are actually a bit better, so my mom and dad seem to be giving me a little slack. Mom is still getting on me about what I might study in after high school.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh?\u201d Mariko responded with a small coo. \u201cAnd have you still not decided yet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell...probably going to go into business. That\u2019s the current idea in any case. Maybe into something like logistics. I am good with numbers after all,\u201d Penn replied. \u201cAnd what about you? I know you said a while ago that you were still thinking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Mariko fluttered her eyes a bit as she gave her signature flightly look as she fiddled with the keyboard in front of her. \u201cHonestly...I\u2019ve been considering becoming a manga artist after graduating. It might not be the most lucrative job, but I\u2019ve been told I have enough potential to at least land me an ongoing magazine job. Mr. Kotoro said I just need to send in a one-shot to one of them to land a job.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, that would be amazing,\u201d Penn smiled. \u201cI remember those drawings you showed me back in June. They were amazing, so I have no doubt that you could be a hit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis girlfriend looked about ready to respond, only to suddenly be interrupted by a certain visitor on her side of the screen. \u201cYou should see the pictures she draws of you and her kissing and stuff!\u201d Mariko\u2019s little sister Sengen budded in with a mischievous smirk as she nonchalantly walked past her sister\u2019s webcam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-Sengen!\u201d Mariko shouted at the girl, who merely giggled and ran away afterwards, before looking back at her boyfriend. \u201cS-Sorry, about her. Please don't\u2019 listen to her. Just...forget she said anything, alright?\u201d The girl tried her best to hide her embarrassment under a nervous smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t help but feel like we\u2019re in a manga ourselves whenever your sister shows up,\u201d Penn chuckled, only to be delighted to hear a soft giggle from the other side. Still, he looked back at her. \u201c...I do wish I was there to really give you kisses though...instead of always having to imagine them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I hope you don\u2019t imagine them too often,\u201d Mariko said with a small smirk before giving off the softest smile she could. \u201cLook, we already talked about me coming over for Christmas. I know it\u2019s still quite the wait, but we\u2019ve made it this far, right? We can wait a couple of months.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn all honesty, I\u2019m just glad your parents are okay with it,\u201d Penn smiled. \u201cAt least it means I\u2019ve made a good enough impression for a guy whose total experience in Japan totals 2 weeks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you made a pretty good impression as a guy I spent a couple of minutes in a cave with,\u201d she noted with a small giggle. \u201cNo wonder they instantly took a liking to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFair enough,\u201d Penn chuckled. \u201cStill, I can\u2019t wait to show you around. Christmas is going to be a lot of fun, and of course, I believe you\u2019re staying just long enough for New Year\u2019s right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCorrect,\u201d Mariko said with a nod. \u201cWhy? Got something special planned?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a work in progress,\u201d Penn laughed at that. He was getting better at this sort of thing, but he still needed some work getting things in order. \u201cAt the very least, the New Year\u2019s fireworks would be a perfect cap to our year.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMust fireworks be deployed every time we meet?\u201d Mariko asked with a playful smirk. However, her attention is suddenly turn over to a garbled voice from offscreen. \u201cOh poo.\u201d She then turned back over at Penn with an embarrassed look on her face. \u201cSay, uh...my younger cousin\u2019s about to have a birthday party here right now, so...I sort of have to go\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust one last thing!\u201d Penn cried out. He had just one more thing to say. \u201cI...I know I\u2019ve said this before...but I want to say it again.\u201d He took a deep breath before continuing. \u201cI will get over to your side eventually. Where we\u2019ll always be face-to-face.\u201d he added, his face blushing a bit, but he meant every word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI...I know,\u201d Mariko said with a small blush herself, but a nonetheless sweet smile. \u201cI know you will. And then we\u2019ll go right back in that cave and find each other once again. I know the drill.\u201d She then began to move her hand over to the mouse. \u201cWell...I\u2019ll be seeing you then. Oyasumi!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOyasumi!\u201d Penn replied right back, his hand on his mouse as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with two simultaneous clicks, they both exited the chat.</span></div></div>",

He didn\u2019t really care, as it was what he and his best friend were looking forward to for the past week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTyler, don\u2019t break it now,\u201d his mother told him. \u201cThat\u2019s Billy\u2019s game, remember?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, Mom\u2026\u201d Tyler sighed but regained his step after that, immediately turning upstairs and back towards his big brother\u2019s bedroom. \u201cHey bro, it finally came!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbout time,\u201d Billy sighed as he got up from his desk, leaving his latest Geometry homework laying down on it. Being four years the elder of his brother, he naturally had to look down to see his little brother with a square paper package in his hand. After weeks of waiting, he couldn\u2019t help but smile down at fruit of his patience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLemme see that,\u201d he said before quickly snatching the package out of Tyler\u2019s hands and already starting to tear it open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler watched as he watched his big brother tearing the package open, not taking too long to reveal it\u2019s contents. He saw the yellow and black casing of a game, something he had known his brother to want for a while, and what little he described intrigued him, hence why he was curious. He leaned over to get a better look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShin Megami Tensei\u2026..Persona 4?\u201d Tyler questioned as he read it out loud. \u201cThat name\u2019s a lot wordier than when you told me about it.\u201d He added with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMost people just call it Persona 4,\u201d Billy explained as he happily opened up the case and observed the perfectly reserved game manual and disc, just as the seller on eBay had promised. \u201cKeith has been ragging on me to get it ever since he downloaded the game on his Playstation 3. Now that I can play it on my Playstation 2, maybe I can finally see what all of the fuss is about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe too. I\u2019ve even heard some of my friends say some good things about it. Guess that M rating isn\u2019t too bad if even Mom is letting me watch it with you,\u201d Tyler said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike Mom has ever cared about ratings on anything,\u201d Billy replied with a chuckle before starting to uncover his long stored PS2. \u201cConsidering she brought us all to see Deadpool, I don\u2019t think she would care either way. Now, how about you go get the others while I set this old dinosaur up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure!\u201d Tyler smiled, getting back up to run out of his room. His best friend, James, who was around his age, was visiting today while his parents were having a night out. His and Billy\u2019s little sister Amy was there as well.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It didn\u2019t take too long to find them down in the family room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey James, bro is about to start the new game. Better come up if you want to see,\u201d he smiled before looking at Amy. \u201cCome on Amy, I really think you\u2019ll like to see this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou always say that\u2026\u201d Amy pouted, holding her Pooh stuffed toy with her. She didn\u2019t exactly object though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019mon, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll love this,\u201d James tried to assure the six year old with a comforting smile. \u201cI hear it has all sorts of pretty girls and romance. You like that, right?\u201d Probably best to leave out the existential dread and serial murders out from his pitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy was hardly old enough to really know the meaning of romance, but judging by the smile, she was intrigued either way. \u201cOh, okay!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust make sure you\u2019re all down here for dinner, alright?\u201d Their mother smiled as she walked by. \u201cDon\u2019t want to be calling you down for 10 minutes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a confirmation, the three of them went back upstairs, following the path back to Billy\u2019s room. Looking inside, it was funny seeing Billy still tinkering with his decade-old console.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill trying to get it to work?\u201d Tyler smiled and laughed a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait\u2026\u201d Billy muttered before finally plugging in the red AV cable, only to hear a familiar hum from his TV. \u201cThat should do it!\u201d He then brought himself back around before pressing the good old power button on the Playstation 2, only to hear yet another familiar hum. \u201cTyler, the lights!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRoger!\u201d Tyler saluted before running over to do just that. It was just about sundown, so just a tidbit of light came into the room now. Like it mattered as Tyler and James ran over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is going to work, right?\u201d Amy asked as she came over to take a seat herself behind the boys. \u201cDidn\u2019t you have trouble with the last game you tried on that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh, I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be fine. Right?\u201d Tyler replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be fine!\u201d Billy chuckled before the TV began to flicker slightly. \u201cI\u2019m...sure that was just a glitch. James! The remote!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight!\u201d James nodded before picking the remote off of his friend\u2019s bed and changing the television\u2019s input to AV2. Soon enough, everyone is greeted by the beautiful chimes of the PS2 logo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerfect!\u201d the eldest boy cheered before starting to sit down in his perfectly comfortable gaming chair with his controller in hand. Now let the fun begin!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, everything seemed to be going the way most of them had seen on the Internet. After the Atlus logo came the anime-like intro movie, starring Shihoko Hirata\u2019s \u201cPursuing My True Self\u201d which was quite the catchy tune that matched the game\u2019s mystery theme. Despite the great tune, though, Tyler couldn\u2019t help but catch something. For one thing, the movie seemed to be interrupting a bit, even more than it was supposed to given the TV theme. But then, there was a really glaring issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, Billy?\u201d Tyler slowly turned his head. \u201cIs it just me or some characters missing from the movie? Is this an unlockable kind of thing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI...I don\u2019t think so\u2026\u201d the older brother muttered as he kept on staring at the screen. \u201cProbably just a glitch or some dust in the old disc reader. Nothing major, I\u2019m sure. As long as it doesn\u2019t affect gameplay, we should be fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler just looked at James, who looked about as suspicious about it as he was. He hoped that it was nothing serious, but at the same time, he had never heard of a video missing stuff like this in a game. Usually if a game had a glitch, it would be during the actual gameplay. This mostly passed over Amy\u2019s head, who wasn\u2019t entirely familiar with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the yellow tinted main screen appeared, but it still seemed to be missing characters. Adding to that, the screen looked like it was going in and out. At one point, the screen went static for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay...I think something\u2019s wrong,\u201d Tyler sighed. \u201cEither something\u2019s up with the console or we really need a new TV.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease be the console, please be the console\u2026\u201d Billy muttered as he darted over to the console. He honestly couldn\u2019t afford his brand new TV short circuiting or something. He immediately went for the disc tray\u2019s eject button, only to feel a painful shock emanate from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOuch!\u201d he cried out before starting to suck on his shocked index finger. \u201cOkay, this is not normal. This...This can\u2019t be normal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuys\u2026\u201d James muttered as the screen started to violently flash what looked like waves of black and white rectangles. He wanted to look away, everyone did, yet...they couldn\u2019t...and soon, the entire room seemed to become enveloped in a blanket of pure light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, once the light finally subsided and the TV shorted out entirely, there was no one to be found within the room.</span></div></div>",

What had just happened a few minutes ago? There was that flash of black and white and then the sensation of falling\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat just\u2026.\u201d He grumbled, moving his body slowly on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFunny, it felt like he was on a field or something. Definitely the feeling of lying in the grass, that\u2019s for sure. Opening his eyes just a bit wider, as well as using a free hand to wipe them a bit, he blinked a few times,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere...am I?\u201d he asked out loud, to no answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was definitely a field, most likely a little park. There were some shaded tables to his left, and the sound of running water could be heard from a ways in front of him, ahead of a sidewalk. Certainly not a place he could recall off the top of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCould you maybe...lower your volume?\u201d James grumbled beside the boy as he slowly came back into consciousness. His eyes creaked open, only to find the same unfamiliar surroundings as his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWh-Where are we?\u201d He started to ask over to Tyler, gaining more and more panicked by the second. \u201cDid we fall asleep?! Were we kidnapped?! What...happened?!\u201d Unfortunately, the boy had a rather prolific history of asthma attacks and it appeared this was yet another one of them. As he began hyperventilating, he barely managed to take his inhaler from his pocket and give a nice, long breath of it, almost immediately calming himself down. Still didn\u2019t help with the current situation, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure\u2026\u201d Tyler trailed off a bit, getting up and helping James as well. \u201cI can tell I\u2019ve never been here before...yet I have this strange feeling I\u2019ve seen it on the Internet somewhere.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn\u2019t quite sure how though. He saw many things on the Internet, so what made this place stand out so much. It was also odd how the place seemed pretty bright, almost like it was out of a cartoon or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, before Tyler could speak another thought, he saw something that sent him for a loop. Two girls were walking into the park, casually chatting along. One being a girl with short brown hair and a green jacket. The other girl had long dark hair and a red-themed outfit it seemed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-Woah!\u201d Tyler cried now, not really caring if he was heard. He turned to James. \u201cYou see that?! Either those are the best cosplayers I\u2019ve ever seen or they\u2019re the real thing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe real thing?\u201d James muttered, still collecting his bearings from a moment ago. He eventually looked over at the two girls mentioned, though he couldn\u2019t really understand what made them so special. \u201cAre you talking about those girls over there? All because they\u2019re Japanese and look nice doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re cosplayers, idiot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler slapped his forehead. Guess that\u2019s what he got for being so vague. James wasn\u2019t as informed as he was regarding certain things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay...how about I say this clearer,\u201d Tyler said with a slightly deadpan tone. \u201cThose two girls look like Chie and Yukiko from the game Billy was trying to play. And it\u2019s not even slightly. They look like they jumped right out of the game.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, really?\u201d James asked as he looked back at the girls. Actually, now that he got a good look at them...they did seem sort of more...colorful than most people. Almost...cartoonish? \u201cNow that you mention it, something does seem a little off about them. Like they\u2019re just slightly...unreal or something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then turned over to look at his friend. \u201cWell, you\u2019re the fanboy here. What should we do?\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cUh...well\u2026.\u201d He wondered how to really responded to that. Was this just some bad dream? Surely this kind of thing wasn\u2019t real, right? Maybe...maybe it wouldn\u2019t hurt to actually get some information? As a matter of fact, he couldn\u2019t see Billy or Amy anywhere.Just to check, he reached into his shorts to find his cell phone. The whole thing looked out of whack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe\u2026.we should try talking to them?\u201d Tyler suggested, though he wasn\u2019t too confident. \u201cI know Mom told me about strangers...but I\u2019m not sure what else we should do here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, they\u2019re supposed to be the good guys, right?\u201d James asked as he looked over at the two slipping away. \u201cSo if they really are the real thing, maybe they could help us somehow!\u201d It wasn\u2019t much of a plan, barely even a concept, but it was the best the boy could think of on the spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, of course he spent no time running after the two cartoonish girls, hoping to catch up to them while they were still within his sights. \u201cHey!\u201d he cried out. \u201cCan you help us, please?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie and Yukiko both froze a bit when they heard a voice, Chie in particular turning to see James coming with Tyler a little bit behind. She smiled softly at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh hello,\u201d she said while looking at them. \u201cYou need help finding your parents or something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI...guess you could say that,\u201d Tyler said shyly, not entirely sure what to say. Did the fact that they looked so cartoonish mean something? This situation just seemed to get weirder by the second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, do you live around here?\u201d Yukiko spoke up, being as comforting as she could, offering her hand out. \u201cWe\u2019ll help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, thank you,\u201d James smiled as he shook his head in gratitude. \u201cThank you, thank you, thank you. I honestly thought we\u2019d be left on our own.\u201d He then gladly accepted the girl\u2019s seemingly cell-shaded hand. \u201cI can\u2019t thank you enough, Miss\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight as James had touched Yukiko\u2019s hand though, a bright light emerged from the point of contact, not taking long to envelop her before she could even react. Both Tyler and James barely had time to disgust what they were seeing before Yukiko\u2019s form started shapeshifting, shrinking and changing form until something small floated to the ground in her place, still shining until it eventually died down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2026.did you just do?!\u201d Tyler cried out at James.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I...I didn\u2019t do anything!\u201d James defended as he started panicking. He didn\u2019t right? This was just all one big coincidence, a dream, a shared hallucination, something! \u201cShe just...after I...I didn't do anything, okay?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie seemed rather confused at the moment, though. The two boys she had just offered to help were just suddenly bickering over something. Well, that\u2019s just what boys do sometimes, she supposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you two alright?\u201d she asked down at Tyler and James.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d Tyler snapped back, a bit higher and rougher than he intended, given how wound up he was. \u201cS-Sorry...just that...Wait, how did you not see that?!\u201d he added emphatically towards the simmering object where Yukiko was originally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee what?\u201d Chie asked in complete confusion before looking down at where Tyler was glancing as well. \u201cDid you just drop your card or something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCard? What\u2026.\u201d Tyler started before looking at the spot again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the light dying down, it indeed looked like a card there, one that Tyler had never seen before. Chie had already reached down to pick it up, though right as she did, Tyler tried to reach for it himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait! What if\u2026\u201d he tried to say before his hand brushed over Chie\u2019s on the card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately, Chie began to glow a golden light just like her friend as her form began to shift and shrink until it became unidentifiable as a human at all! Soon, a small, flat paper rectangle was lying on the concrete before the light began to die down. All that appeared to remain of the girl looked to be a playing card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-You just did the same thing!\u201d James shouted in horror.<br>\r\n\u201cBut..why is that?!\u201d Tyler cried out just as much in horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat in the world was going on? Nothing made sense at all. Not just the fact that two girls had just changed in front of them, but also that Chie seemed confused about it and not even looking at Yukiko\u2019s disappearance. Plus, how did no one else around them react? Were they the only ones knowing of this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler\u2019s head felt like it was going to explode from everything going on. Yet, he tried to remember what Billy always told him to do whenever he was in a pinch. The first and most important step was to calm down and think things through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay\u2026.deep breaths\u2026..\u201d Tyler mumbled to himself, trying to calm himself down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay\u2026.okay\u2026.let\u2019s just think this through, okay?\u201d With that, he picked one up, holding the card Chie became to himself while handing Yukiko\u2019s to James.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThink...Think what through?!\u201d James yelled back as he clutched the card to his chest. \u201cWe just turned two video game characters into playing cards! What else is there to think about?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was just too much for the boy to handle as well. He was in a strange park where everything seemed to be right out of a video game, their only potential help just turned into inanimate objects, and...and what else is there even to say? It hurt just to think of everything wrong at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClutching his own card, Tyler came right over and grabbed James\u2019 shoulders, shaking him like he sometimes did back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, get a grip!\u201d he raised his voice a bit. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to get anything done by standing around and panicking. That\u2019s what Billy always told me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd where is Billy?!\u201d James shouted back. \u201cWe don\u2019t even know where we are! If we\u2019re not just going to stand around, then what on earth are we supposed to do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then I guess we\u2019ll just have to find him ourselves,\u201d Tyler replied resolutely. \u201cBilly was with us in our room when this happened, so I bet he\u2019s here somewhere. Let\u2019s try looking around. If this really is a game, then maybe I\u2019ll be able to find something helpful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomething helpful that we won\u2019t turn into cards?\u201d the other boy asked dryly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re really not helpful, you know that?\u201d Tyler replied equally as dry before just grabbing his wrist. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s just go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, whatever,\u201d James conceded as he allowed himself to be dragged along. \u201cLead the way, almighty leader.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Both seemed to be too wound up to really start any conversation, though at least they weren\u2019t yelling anymore. It was about that time that Tyler began looking over his card. It had a picture of a knight of some kind being carried with two lions in the front, with a giant VII at the bottom. Along the top, he could point out a name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Chariot,\u201d he mumbled to himself. \u201cI wonder if this is supposed to be significant somehow. Makes me wish I had looked more of the game up yesterday.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames didn\u2019t really respond to his friend\u2019s statement of curiosity, though he grew slightly more curious about his own card. Looking down, he saw little more than the heavily stylized head of a woman in some type of a veil inside of a hole and with a hollowed out circle over her forehead. Other than that, there a giant II, which the boy was able to identify as the numerals for two based various sequels he had played before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Priestess,\u201d he also read out loud as he looked down at the name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing James talk, Tyler spoke up as well. \u201cMakes me wonder if there\u2019s anything special behind them. I don\u2019t recall touching people and them becoming cards being a thing in any game I\u2019ve played.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, as they were walking along, they were starting to hear more and more voices. Looking up from their stupor, they saw what looked like a decently busy street, seemingly filled with many shops along the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow...this place looks lively,\u201d Tyler said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess,\u201d James replied as he watched little more than five people walking nearby. \u201cDepends on your definition of lively, really.\u201d It would really help if he could read any of the signs around here. The two had to rely on context clues the entire time to make sense of the different shops, like the book store and...tofu shop\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell me, why are we becoming even more lost than before again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think standing in place somewhere is any better?\u201d Tyler snapped back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruth be told, Tyler wasn\u2019t feeling too confident, but no way would he let James know that. Someone had to seem like they knew what they were doing around here. Still, it would have been nice if Billy was still here. He could always figure out the stuff he couldn\u2019t, and that applied just as much to real life as it did to video games.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, this is a real pain,\u201d Tyler sighed, his hand moving up to twist a piece of his hair, a nervous habit he always had, especially in school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf his attitude wasn\u2019t so sour, he might have been able to recognize something, specifically how how his hair seemed just a tad longer, compared to a typical boy\u2019s cut anyway. Even the naturally brown roots of his hair were showing some signs of lightening, beginning to mix in a bit with the rest of his hair. The opposite was happening for James, who was just shrugging at Tyler\u2019s demeanor right now. His own brown hair was showing a couple signs of darkening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026\u2026.*rumble*.......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler\u2019s face immediately went from frustration to slight embarrassment, getting a shaky laugh from him. \u201cHeh\u2026..heh heh...I just remembered that we never got dinner...heh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe we should find somewhere to eat and run then,\u201d James chuckled a bit as instinctively pushed his bangs out of his eyes as he had plenty of times before, forgetting his haircut from just last Tuesday. One with a keen eye may have been able to notice how the boy\u2019s hair started to slowly extend down to his neck in a significantly darker shade of brown than before. Then again, the two were already distracted by much more important matters, such as where to go and where to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThink dining and dashing may be worth the risk here?\u201d James asked over to Tyler with a nervous smile, unable to decide on the moral quandary himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Mom would never like that,\u201d Tyler said with a sigh. Sure, that was the morally correct thing to do, but did they have any other choice at the moment. If only these adult-like situations could be easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment though, Tyler\u2019s nose caught a whiff of something nearby. Something...definitely new and exotic as far as he was concerned, yet quite enticing. Turning his head from James for a bit, he began walking just a bit, following his nose until he looked back up to see what he guessed was a restaurant. Would have been nice if he could actually read the big red letters above the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m going to guess this place will work,\u201d Tyler nodded to himself before turning back to James. \u201cI really don\u2019t like the idea of dashing, but we...well, we might not have a choice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes it really count if it\u2019s a video game world, though?\u201d James suggested with a weak smile before catching another whiff of the restaurant\u2019s hypnotic aroma. \u201cI mean...I\u2019m sure we can think of something else to do...after we eat, of course.\u201d Then, without even a second thought, he ran directly into the restaurant with Tyler right behind, no looking back.</span></div></div>",

There had been many times before that he had attempted to sleep, only to feel as if he was slowly down a large pit. It was a surprisingly peaceful sensation, up to the part where he reached the sudden STOP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly immediately woke up with a start, breathing heavily as his heart pounded within his chest. His breaths slowly became more manageable as he finally began to finally make sense of his surroundings. However, all he found were TVs and various other electronics within what looked like the Sears at the mall. Slowly but surely, his heartbeat started to rise again, no doubt accentuated by the various customers looking down at him with curiosity. Even more surreal, almost every onlooker looked Asian and the price markers had weird Ys with lines over the V parts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy slowly crawled back on the floor, unsure how to even interpret his situation. However, his backwards crab walk immediately came to an end after accidentally bumping into something behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOw!\u201d Amy cried after her eyes suddenly jumped open at the contact. \u201cWhat was that...for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little pause came when she happened to see what he was seeing. At first glance it seemed like every shopping department she had been to in the past except...who were these people? And why did it look like some kind of cartoon?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBilly, what\u2019s going on here?!\u201d she cried out as she got to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI...I really don\u2019t know,\u201d Billy replied as he looked back at Amy, followed by what he could only assume to be customers, then back at Amy, then back at the customers, then back to Amy. Everyone else definitely looked different from the little girl, like they were being shaded by a different sun entirely or...or like they were in a cartoon\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait...where are the others?!\u201d the boy suddenly cried out as he started looking all around. \u201cCrap, I bet they left us here! Wherever here is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, what do we do?!\u201d Amy cried out, perhaps a bit higher than she intended. \u201cI don\u2019t like being in a strange place, and I\u2019m hungry!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-Well...I\u2019m sure there\u2019s...something to eat here,\u201d Billy responded with a nervous smile, trying his best to keep the girl appeased, as he always seemed in charge of doing. \u201cBut I think we need to focus on finding help first. We need to find out where we are right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy just sighed. \u201cOkaaaaaay.\u201d she said not so enthusiastically. \u201cSo who do we talk to? Mom says strangers are bad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, sometimes strangers can be nice and helpful,\u201d he tried to assure the girl. \u201cYou just have to pick them out carefully. Like\u2026that boy over there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy looked to where Billy was pointing, in the direction of a boy in a uniform of some kind just standing there with an indescribable look on his face. Somehow, he kind of stood out from the rest, but Amy couldn\u2019t really figure out why. Oh well, guess it was something at least. She was about to follow Billy\u2019s advice, until a girl seemed to approach the boy. Amy was close enough to at least hear them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBack already?\u201d the boy asked quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, turns out they don\u2019t sell my type of phone\u2019s charger here,\u201d the girl sighed in rather dramatic disappointment, though she immediately perked back up. \u201cBut hey! Not like this\u2019ll impede on our little shopping adventure. How about we find you some new clothes? No offence, but your detective costume is starting to smell.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d the boy asked back with indignation. \u201cI never asked to come on your shopping trip in the first place, Rise. Really, there are other things I should be tending to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen why did you agree to come with me in the first place, Naoto?\u201d Rise teased. \u201cDon\u2019t act like you didn\u2019t have a say in the matter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMore like you dragged me here before I could give an answer,\u201d Naoto curtly replied, trying to ignore the slight tinge of red on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are they talking about, Billy?\u201d Amy asked up to him, before noticing the odd look on his face. \u201cAnd what do you look so surprised about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThose...those are two of the girls from the game\u2026\u201d Billy muttered as he stared at the pair, dark circles seeming to appear underneath his eyes. \u201cRise and N...Nato? Naota? I...honestly forgot her name.\u201d</span></div></div>",

She really didn\u2019t feel like worrying about another hormone-addled teenage fan of hers. With no offense to her fans, she had started to grow weary of her male 11-14 demographic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto turned her head slightly at the boys, her face her usual indifference. \u201cDo you need something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh us?\u201d Amy pointed to herself, which got the attention of both girls. \u201cUm, well we\u2019re kind of lost\u2026.\u201d she trailed off near the end, not real used to be talking to someone she didn\u2019t know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe...We\u2019re sort of a little...lost,\u201d Billy finally managed to speak up in front of the two girls. Though, wow, the blue-haired one really does look like a boy. Good thing he already read the game\u2019s Wikipedia article, or else this would be especially awkward. \u201cAs in...we have no idea why where we are and how we got here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow you got here?\u201d Naoto seemed a bit confused by that. \u201cYou implying that you didn\u2019t walk in here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, actually,\u201d the boy tried to explain as he rubbed the back of his head. \u201cWe...We both just sort of...woke up here. We\u2019re actually sort of from...America\u2026\u201d Oh boy, even in a world with an alternate dimension within TVs, that had to sound farfetched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, both girls looked perplexed. Granted, Rise had kind of written it off as a fan making something up. Naoto in most cases would have as well, except the boy and girl didn\u2019t sound like they were lying. They certainly didn\u2019t look like they were from around these parts for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell...I suppose I have seen weirder..\u201d Naoto mumbled to herself, speaking from personal experience there. She looked back up to the boy. \u201cWell, if you really are confused, you\u2019re right in the Junes Electronics Department in Inaba.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJunes...Junes\u2026okay\u2026\u201d Billy muttered to himself. That name sounded...slightly familiar. Maybe the article mentioned the name a couple times. Still, it pretty much confirmed his theory: they were inside the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you really falling for the kid\u2019s story?\u201d Billy\u2019s ears suddenly perked up at Rise\u2019s mention of him. \u201cNot to sound cold-hearted or anything, but I\u2019ve seen this sort of trick before. The guy probably just wants some sort of sympathy, maybe a pity hug or the ability to hold my hand like a little creep. Let\u2019s just go, Naoto.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, Rise grabbed her friend\u2019s hand and starting calmly walking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, no!\u201d Billy cried out as he ran towards his only possible tickets to getting out of this situation. He threw his arm out, reaching out for Rise, yet as soon as managed to touch the girl\u2026<br>\r\n<i><b><br>\r\nFLASH!</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy had to look away as he was assaulted by a near blinding light. Another glance, however, revealed not the teen idol that Billy had seen so much fanart of before even hearing about the game, but rather, a simple trading card. One that just floated in midair before just plopping onto the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAppropriately, the boy was freaked. \u201cWHAT THE HELL JUST HAPPENED?!\u201d he shouted out while clutching his hand, ignoring the countless eyes laid upon him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cB-B-Billy! W-W-What was that?!\u201d Amy cried out, not quite as high, though still noticeable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto actually cringed a bit, though it seemed to be more from the yelling. \u201cCould you mind not screaming? You\u2019re drawing attention.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoto\u2019s complete calmness threw Amy off. \u201cHuh?! B-But did you see that?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee what?\u201d Naoto asked with a confused look. She shook her head after that though. \u201cLook, we should probably get moving if you really need to get some help. Here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moved to offer her hand in help to Amy. The little girl was still shell-shocked from what just happened, even trying to back away a bit from Naoto. However, that proved fruitless as Naoto grasped Amy\u2019s hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe very same flash that had engulfed Rise just a few seconds before engulfed her as well, immediately lighting her up and reducing her to a smaller size. Like before, a simmering card was floating down in her place, gently falling next to the card where Rise once stood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy was sure her eyes were about to roll back into her head. She couldn\u2019t even scream. \u201cI think\u2026.I\u2019m going crazy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI...I saw the same thing, though\u2026\u201d Billy stated as he stared down at the very same card on the floor of the department store. \u201cR-Rise...the...other girl...just went and POOFED! She...turned into a card, too\u2026\u201d He looked back over at what he could only guess was the former Rise on the ground. His hand began slowly traveling down over to the card, trembling slightly as he came closer and closer to it. It took all of his might just to pick it up and inspect it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdorned upon the card appeared to be a giant black heart surrounded by the silhouette of a tree, along with silhouettes of a man and woman beneath said tree. The Roman numerals VI were written under the image, while the words Lovers was written above it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat...even is this?\u201d the boy asked as he started flipping the card all around, looking for some sort of clues as to its meaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHesitant but following her brother\u2019s que all the same, Amy slowly reached for the other card. Hers was strange itself. It featured a wheel-shaped object with a sword facing upwards in the middle. An image of an imp of some sorts was around the top of the card and a snake around the bottom. The Roman numerals X adorned the very bottom, similar to the other card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve...never seen cards like this,\u201d Amy mumbled, looking over the card, seeing a little something more at the top. \u201cWhat does \u201cFortune\u201d mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a...game show, I think?\u201d Billy replied, still dazed from his own experience. \u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s at the top of the card. See?\u201d Amy replied, even showing the face of the card to Billy. \u201cIt says it right there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see\u2026\u201d he muttered as he looked over at the card. \u201cWeird. Maybe these belong to some sort of trading card game then? Like Yu-Gi-Oh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t really explain why that happened when we touched them though,\u201d Amy replied, somewhat calming down from the experience. At least it seemed like people were moving on from their little show. \u201cI\u2019m so confused.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, join the club\u2026\u201d Billy groaned before suddenly hearing a soft rumbling in his stomach. \u201cS-Say, uh...maybe want to get something to eat first? I still have my wallet on me, thank goodness, so...maybe I can buy us something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNews of that nature brought a small smile to Amy\u2019s face. \u201cThat...sounds really good. I never got to eat dinner before this happened.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat seemed to improve the mood a bit, enough to get the duo going. Luckily, despite the new location, directions towards a food area didn\u2019t seem that hard, leading them towards an elevator to head to the top floor.</span></div></div>",

Didn\u2019t you say every girl turned you down in middle school?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-Yeah\u2026\u201d Billy conceded while looking away, visibly embarrassed and flustered. \u201cNo need to rub it in\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I heard that high school is even worse than middle school,\u201d Amy continued on. \u201cSounds kind of scary like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-Yeah, I\u2019m still adjusting to the idea of going this year,\u201d the boy stated as he quickly shoved the card back into his pocket and tried to hide his obvious unease with a smile. \u201cEveryone expects you to do everything, from dating to going to the dances, prom, clubs, e-everything...all while my mom and dad expect me to keep my grades steady.\u201d He gave a nervous cough. \u201cIt...It\u2019s not going to be easy for them-ME! It won\u2019t be easy for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm\u2026..\u201d Amy thought as she pouted a bit, seeing the numbers on the elevator nearing the top. \u201cAt least people will probably take you seriously in high school. Most people like Mom and Dad still laugh when I try to say something seriously.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen would a little girl like you need to be serious, though?\u201d Billy asked with a weak chuckle. \u201cYou\u2019re still young and...well, what do you have to worry about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy\u2019s pout got even bigger. \u201cBecause I\u2019m not stupid. I actually read stuff, probably even stuff you don\u2019t. It\u2019s kind of frustrating.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though Amy was only 6 years old, she already had developed quite the vocabulary, perhaps much more so than other kids in her grade. Not to say she was a prodigy of any sort, but certainly further along in some areas. Heck, she sometimes even watched things with their Mom and Dad, even if a lot of it still went over her head. Still, it hadn\u2019t helped much when dealing with others. To most adults, she was still just a naive kid, and that frustrated her at times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI...I suppose I can relate a little,\u201d Billy sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruth be told, he wished his parents had as little expectations for him as they did for Amy. According to his parents, he was nothing short of a prodigy, a genius that just had yet to exert himself, acting like he didn\u2019t already do that enough. They expected the world out of Billy, only to end up disappointed when they got only the best the boy could muster, just always below par.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conversation seemed to go silent at that point; neither sibling knowing what more to add to that. The oddity of their situation wasn\u2019t helping either, nor was the sudden little itch Amy was getting in her head. She always hated this season for that very reason. Reaching up, she took care of that, not exactly noticing parts of her hair starting to slowly darken, with even a few turning deep black in the process. In addition, while her hair was normally a ways past her shoulders, the furthest edges were crawling upwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t matter much though once the elevator finally opened its doors (longest ride ever) and let the shining sun enter the once dark space. Amy had to shield her eyes in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoah!\u201d she cried, taking a couple steps out into the sun. \u201cIt\u2019s like a theme park up here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo offense, sis, but it\u2019s just an outside food court place...thing,\u201d Billy responded, rubbing his eyes as they adjusted to the bright sun. \u201cNot quite Disneyland. Hopefully a lot more affordable, though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026.\u201d Amy shook her head. That last trip to Disneyland took quite a bit out of the family wallet, and not just for the plane tickets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019mon, let\u2019s go find something we can afford,\u201d Billy smiled over at his sister as he started walking off, signaling for Amy to follow him. As he started looking over the different vendors, the boy began to scratch his head slightly, barely able to see his blond hair darken slightly to a more dirty blond, not unlike his sister\u2019s case, though his began growing out past his ears. Billy barely acknowledged it, though. He was meaning to get a haircut soon either way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is starting to make me wish I had read more Japanese,\u201d Amy spoke out, looking around what was assumed to be the main vendor around. \u201cYou know...is it just me or are all these Japanese characters starting to make sense? Maybe I\u2019ve been looking at them too much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI...I think I\u2019m starting to understand them, too,\u201d Billy replied in complete amazement as well, staring at the characters as his mind starting sounding them out like a sort of mental Rosetta Stone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRa...men...ramen!\u201d he managed to sound out from the Japanese before him. \u201cHey! You like ramen noodles, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, they are good that one time we had them,\u201d Amy smiled for the first time in a while. \u201cSo, why not?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure,\u201d Billy lightly smiled back as he took out his wallet. \u201cHopefully they\u2019ll accept American dollars.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Despite the simplistic outlook, it had a natural charm that made the place look homey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they reached the restaurant, they couldn't read at all what the sign with the name of the restaurant said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't understand what those letters even mean, let alone thy to pronounce the name\"said James. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we are in Japan right now. It's obvious we can't\" replied Tyler. As they were pondering about the name, neither noticed that their shoes were changing. Their laces vanished , a small hell appeared at the bottom and their colour changed to black. In the end, they looked like normal black girl shoes. Also inside their shoes their feet became slighty bigger but also more delicate. Finally, they both aged a year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think they yould understand us Chyler ?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am sure he will Jakes. He must know some English.\" said Chyler , neither of them realising the new names they gained. \"And I don't know why but I feel like eating some meat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they aprouched the counter , the chef greeted them : \"Welcome to Souzai Daigaku. How may I serve you today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two were pleasantly surprised by the fact that they were addresed in English. Then Chyler ordered : \"Three steak skeweres please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chef smiled and began preparing the food. While they were waiting, Jakes asked Chyler : \"How did you know they had those on the menu? And why did you ordered three?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. I guess it came naturelly. And I think I am very hungry I guess.\" was his reply. Although a bit skeptical, they accepted that answer as granted, not even noticing that both the chef and  now themselves were speaking Japanese. While they were waiting, their socks wigged as they began changing. Chyler's became pure white, while Jakes's were turning black and also thinner than before.</span></div></div>",

Despite the money being American dollars and not yen, the chef didn't complain at all, everything semingly being normal. Once the bills were put in the cash register they conververted themselves to yen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey sit on their table looking at the skewerd meat with Chyler almost drooling at the its' aroma. Once they began eating , and tasting the protein, Chyler almost yelled:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is awesome! I have not eaten something so good in my life! Definetely, meat rules!\". He continued eating with gusto and would even eat the stick if it was edible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this sight, Jakes sighed a bit before bursting in a small laughing fit, which caught the attention of Chyler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you laughing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be...because it almost looked like you were inhaling it like a...air! \" said Jakes trying to catch his breath from laughter. Chyler was a bit werided out by this, but some side of him seemed  to take this as natural.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, not again.\" he grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they continued eating, the changes also kept on going. While Chyler was eating like his life depended on it,moving on to the second skewer, his white socks climbed out of the shoes and kept going upwards until they were at his ankles. Meanwhile, Jakes was eating slowly and carefully, showing proper table manners. His black socks also climbed their way up, but they became even thinner and passed the ankles, nearing the knee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they finished, they thank the chef and began leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"man that was good. next time I am gonna try the steak croquettes.\" said Chyler, still not fully stuffed. Jakes again subcounciously sighed at his friend, neither questionning Chyler familiarity to the place,...and meat.\" So what are we going to do next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the problem to get themselves out of the game arising again, Jakes replied : \"I think we should try to find the others. They must have also gotten here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea. Hey, how about we try looking for them at that big building over there?\" Chyler pointed at the back of the street. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, there was a decent sized building that looked like a minature mall up the hill not too far from where the too were right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is a good starting point. Let's go.\". After deciding on their destination the two began walking through the shopping district.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Just like Billy said, it wasn't anything special, but the lively atmoshere and diversity of stores made up for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are we going to eat?\" , Amy asked innocently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most of the food is is Japanese, so you might not feel to used to what they serve.\" replied Billy. \"But knowing how you always like to try new stuff I guess we will go the adventurous route.\" .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis sister smiled at that. Indeed, she liked to know as things as possible so that she could prove that she is indeed smart, despite her age. Naturelly , there weren't many food stands with american food around so, they stopped at a place which served the food Billy was always curious to try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi! Welcome to Junes! How may I help you?\" said the girl at the counter welcomely. The two smiled at her cheerfulness, despite Billy finding it a bit odd that she spoke English.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Two takoyaki please.\". Indeed , despite hearing the name of the food often, he never saw or eaten a takoyaki before. The second  and the food served almost immediately , proving that it was indeed a good product.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBilly pulled out some money, which already became yen and gave it to the girl, almost as if he done it before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have a nice day\" , the girl happily adressed them before serving the next customer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they searched for a table, Amy asked \"What is takoyaki?\". As this was going on, her shoes grew a bit and became dark blue. Despite the masculine appearance of the shoes her feet remained delicate as they grew along with her, becoming 8 years old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll see.\" said Billy playfully. Asthey kept walking his shoes lost their laces and became a bair of black loafers , just like Chyler and Jakes. By the time he found a table he also aged another year , becoming 11.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So much so that she didn't notice the misslip of his name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's the fun if there is not a surprise, eh? \" replied Biley , winking at his sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they arrived at their table, their clothes changed further. Biley's socks turned brown and thinned out a bit as they grew up unil they got at his ankles. Amy's socks changed only to fit her feet's new propotions, but her shorts began crawling downward a bit, their colour fading a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Amy got a better look at the food her brother ordered, she was a bit confused. The dish looked like some dumplings with some sause and some garnish on top with some toothpicks sticked in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure this is enough for us?\" she asked a bit worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry it will be okay Namy.\" assured Biley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHesitating a bit, she took one dumpling at bit onto it. After tasting it ,she exclaimed:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What's with this intriguing flavour?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it's because of the octopus...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Octopus?! I see. That explains the weird texture from before, but also the nice taste of seafood taste. All in all it's a really good dish.\" said Namy with an almost deductive tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow..! H-How do you know so many words?! You usually say that the food is either is good or bad. Have you been reading the dictionary recently?\" asked Biley, at a loss of words at his siters' knowledge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped a bit and began to think.\"I don't know. It just came to me.\"she said a bit confused also. \"But I guess I heard those words on tv and then I must've searched them somewhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it seemes my little sister is finnaly getting smart.\", said Biley while scruffing up her hair in a playful manner, while she giggled. However the changes picked off again with Biley's socks becoming fully brown and extending to just beneath his knees. Namy's shorts also continued lengthened just over her kness and became a slightly more softer material, while her hair shrunk further becoming almost like a girly bob cut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finnishing their meal with both of them liking the new flavors a lot, especially Biley, they thought their next move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what should we do? \"asked Namy \"We still don't know what happened to those girls and we don,t know where Cyler and Jakes are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we should try staying here. This place is pretty big so I 'm sure the guys will head this way eventually. \". Biley knew that if they would go searching for them they might waste time running around searching for each other, so remaining at Junes would be the most logical place to stay waiting for them, a thought Namy seemed to agree.\"Besides we could hang out if we are waiting. We can't just sit here. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two existed the food court and wnt downstairs<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But there was one particular store that made Cyler stop and drool at the smell coming from inside. Chinese Diner Aiya was its name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Chyler, we ate already and we have to find the others.\", Jakes said as he tried to distract his friend from another meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChyler groaned as he made his way towards Jakes. \"I wish it was raining so we could take shelter and try The Super Mega Beef Bowl Challenge.\" he thought to himself. Apparently, his atraction towards meat increased as time passed, however he knew they needed to move towards the big shop to try to find the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they were walking, Cyler's hair grew until it became a nice bowl cut and his hair lightened to a nice chestnut colour, while Jakes's reached to his mid-back and straightened become black in the process. Also their encounter with Chie and Yukiko began to fade from their minds, alongside some of their memories of home, being replaced with some new ones. These new memories were making them feeling more at home in the new world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say Chyle, can we stop by at the inn?\", asked Jakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? I thought you said you wanted to go to Junes and find our friends Jakeko\", replied Cyhle. None of them find it odd that they suddenly odd that they knew the name of the store, but also about the local inn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know but I promised that I am going to help them manage the inn today. \". As Chyle was sighing, Jakeko assured him : \"Don't worry, I will say we have to meet the others and then heat back to Junes.\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeft with no choice, Cyhle accepted.\"sure, no problem I will help too so we could finish quicker.\".

However, when the changes reached their thighs, a distinction between the two began to devolop. On one hand, Chyle's legs, despite their growth, there was little to no fat on them, growing well proportioned muscles, like anyone who would do sports on a daily basis. Meanwhile, although they were not as muscular, Jakeko's legs also became beautiful, with a soft, thin layer of fat at the thighs, while also becoming longer than his friends'. Also, their socks finished their change, with Chyle's white ones finishing at his ankles and Jakes' completely covered his legs, before joining up, becoming a pair of black opaque pantyhose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they reached the inn, a young lady in her twenties greeted them: \"Jakeko-kun, Chyle-san, it's good to see you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Kasai-san, the feeling is mutual.\" replied the black haired boy. No one noticed the familiriarity with this woman, or the fact that Jakeko just used Japanese pronouns in his sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it's not much to ask Kasai-san, can we leave a litlle sooner? I promised to meet my friends at Junes later. I also asked Chyle to help us out to finish quicker.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is no problem. There is not much to do today anyway.\". The two friends smiled at the prospect and eagerly began working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey helped around the inn cleaning, manging the rooms and restocking the pantry, however for a strange reason both of them were not allowed to work in the kitchen. As time went by, their minds changed further. their memories of their home were almost gone, and they were replaced with new ones, of them living in current one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew! Kasai san said there wasn't much to do but it's still enough.\", said Jakeko wiping the sweat from his forehead.\"Still it's not as bad as it is on a regular day\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think it's that hard, it's just that there is always a bit too much to do for a single person. Still I don't understand why are we not allowed in the kitche, even in YOUR inn \", sighed Chyle a bit dejected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. We've been practicing hard lately, and yet no one seemes to like our dishes. I know we improved since the curry.\" replied Jakeko, looking for confirmation, which was obviously seen in his friends' eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they were managing the last room, their shorts started altering. They both became softer and began decoloring to a black and grey colour, gaining a checkered design, and also began to restict their movement a bit. However their was an aditional change for Chyle, whose pants began oozing a black substance that encased his rear and thighs firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they finished, they headed to Kasai to tell her that they are finished. By the time they reached her, their pantlegs fused toghether, forming a pair of pleated skirts, with the addition of short black compression shorts for Chyle.</span></div></div>",

Despite their problem with Rise and Naoto changing into cards were still present, the two acted like the event never happened. Even Namy who earlier was bothered about it, didn't seem seem to mind her brother's lack of notice of the issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite not being a full fledged mall, Junes was pretty big. It had a variety of stores and shops that really fit the small town like a glove. While they were exploring it, despite walking toghether, the two siblings didn't seem as close as they were before. Even with Namy's somewhat curious nature, she would always stick close to her older brother, a bit scared of what they may encounter. But for some reason, Namy was feeling a bit more confident in herself, carefully analyzing her surroundings. And Biley's more bolder behavior seemed to be okay with his sister not beeing as clingy as before. It almost looked like they were acting more like friends, not siblings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was because of the shift in their memories, which not only made their new personalities and behavior feel like something natural, but also made them know better not just Junes, but also the town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh! Look at that shirt! So cute!\", said Biley, looking at a window. It didn't seem to register that it was a girl's clothing store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis sister sighed and asked him: \"Don't you have enough clothes already Biley?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You never know when you need more if the situation calls for it. Besides, we might find something for you as well.\", said Rise slyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What are you implying?!\", said Namy as she blushed. \"Please stop playing around and let's go.\". Biley pouted a bit before going behind Namy's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they were walking, Namy's hair roots began to turn dark blue and began spreading further. Biley's hair became longer until it was to his upper back darkening until it was a nice copper colour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry but I need to use the bathroom.\", said Namy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem.I'll come with you\", replied the new copper haired boy.

She looked down but she saw nothing. What was really happening was that her small rear was beginning to grow. In fact her whole figure was growing, with her becoming 11 years old. However, her fighure was a bit more devoloped than it should be for a normal 11 year old girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Biley was waiting for her, occasionally looking at himself in the mirror above the sinks. He decided to try to fix his hair a bit, when suddenly his hair moved by itself, forming 2 small pigtalils. He hasn't noticed anything unusual however, and continued to wait for his sister.<br>\r\nDuring this time, his socks finished growing at his thighs, becoming a pair of brown leggings and he aged up to 13.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinnally, Namy, existed the stall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure took your time Naomy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Riley.\",replied Naomy calmly \"But I don't think it took that long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it took long enough for me to fix my hair.\", said Riley teasingly. However Naomy remained compoosed to that statement. Normally, she would pout a bit whenever someone says she is too slow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she went to wash her hands, she noticed a blue cap near the sink and subcounciosly put it on her head. \"I guess I forgot it here when I entered the bathroom.\", she said to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter exiting, the two kept walking through the mall looking around. In the mean time, Naomy's shorts extended downwards, effectively becoming a pair of black pants. Riley's pants also began changing becoming softer and began to merge at the bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile they were passing a music store, a certain song played, making Riley to hum the lyrincs almost as if he knew them beforehand. That was because their minds were again devoloping into new ones. While Riley's became filled with song lyrics and knowledge of fashion, Naomy's turned into almost an information sponge, gaining more and more IQ points by the minute. Also they began thinking that Yasoinaba, the town they are in, which both of them suddenly know a lot better, is their home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Detective Prince, what do you say about some ice cream? Think your IQ will freeze if you eat it?\", said Riley, while his perky personality was becoming apparent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I don't really enjoy that name Riley-kun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, I am just messing with you Naomy-kun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know...\", sighed Naomy. \"But I think a little ice cream will make the time pass the time a bit faster.\". Riley smiled at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they made their way towards an ice cream shop, the changes picked up again. Riley's legs became shapely, with his thighs thickenening, becoming really atractive, almost like a model. His shorts fused in the middle, and became a skirt that was identical to Chyle and Jakeko's.<br>\r\nNaomy didn't suffer any wardrobe changes yet, but her figure was beginning to grow again, looking much more mature than normal.</span></div></div>",

Can we leave now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course Jukiko-kun. And Thank you for your help as well Chiyle-san.\",replied Kasai gratefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem.

You almost forgot these!\", Kasai pointing out to them a green jacket with yellow lines and some badges on the front of it and a red button up sweater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha..?! I can't belive we almost forgot them!\", exclaimed Chiyle, with also Jakiko, also taken slightly aback by their small mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they were putting the clothes on, a red hairband formed on Jakiko's head. Despite the magical phenomenon, no one saw anything out of the ordinary. As they finished dressing, the T-shirts underneath began to morph. They became pure white, with pockets appearing on either side of the chest, and a black collar with a vellow sailor tie devoloped around their necks. The collar, which now had a certain symbol on it, was visible on Jukiko, but again, no one saw anything odd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwards, they said goodbye to Kasai and began heading one again to Junes. As they were leaving, Kasai thought:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am sure that Jakiko-kun will become a great heir for the Amagi inn.\"</span></div></div>",

Why are you always naming my dog after Sengoku era warlords?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJakiko stopped a bit and snickered, before erupting into a laugh.\"C-Can't you s-see that he has the face of a Yukimura?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No he doesn't! And you used another name!\", groaned Chiyle. Jakiko kept laughing for a bit longer, before regaining her composure. Despite his quirks, Chiyle smiled at his friend. It was these weird things that he and Jakiko had that made their friendship more special.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese thoughts came from another memory change, but this time, their personalities were set in stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChiyle was always a martial arts enthusiast and would always do many outdoor activities to train his physical strength. He wasn't too great at studying, but when it came to P.E, he was unstoppable. His only weakenesses were his addiction to meat and ghost stories. He was a horrible cook, alongside Jakiko, but both were trying really hard to improve. He sees protecting Jakiko and his friends as a way to become stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJakiko was the heir of the Amagi inn, a place where traverlers and local people would stay to have a good time and rest. He was among the smartest of his class, and was always really polite and kind, except when he is angry, becoming quite intimidating, especially if his friends or his co-workers at the inn were mocked. His flaws were his random laughing fits which at times can really be tiring and his seldom inability to read situations correctly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they were walking, their lower bodies kept changing. Their hips began to get wider and their backsides followed suit. While not yet finished, it became visible that Jakiko's proportions were bigger. Their boxers also changed, as they lost their legs and softened, becoming panties. Chiyle' beame black and remanined simple in design while Jakiko's became pure white, while also gaining a lacier design.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Naomy's pink panties turned an aqua blue, keeping a basic design while a bra with the same colour formed on her chest. The weird thing about the bra was that despite her small, young breasts, it seemed to restrict them, almost like a bandage to keep a wound closed.Riley's boxers shrunk and softened, turning pink in the process. By the time they were done, they became a pair of hot pink frilly panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they were eating, their figures kept developing.

Naomy also grew, but her figure was already becoming more and more womanly by the second, hardly mathching her age.

When they reached the clothes store from before, Riley asked his sister:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we go in there to check out some clothes Naoyo-kun? Pleeease...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at her were two puppy eyes who desired her approval, in a manner which seemed childish, yet cunning. Eventually, she gave in: \"Alright Risley-san, we will enter the store.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yoohoo! That's great Naoyo-san!\", exclaimed Risley. Naoyo sighted, but admitted that deep inside she wanted to be more like him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir minds went through one more shift, furthering their existence in the new world. Risley was a teenage idol which went on hiatus a few months ago to get out of the suffocating lifestyle he lived. While not as smart as others, he was a wise boy, adapting quicky to the changes around him. Despite his confidence in his cooking, he always made his dishes to spicy, making the ones eating them fell like there was lava in their mouth.He is cheerful, outspoken, naughty and is quite boastful about himself, but he is a good person at heart. He is currently working in his family's tofu shop with his grandmother.He also has a flair for the dramatic, often shedding crocodile tears to make others accept his choices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaoyo was a wise girl who immersed herself in the world of detectives, following in her grandfater's footsteps. She often helps the local police, being called the Detective Prince as a result of her wit. However, she disguises herself as a young man, being very shy if she has to wear girly clothes and believing that fer feminine side is not as appealing. After her parents's deathin a car accident, she lived with her grandfather until he passed away. She is currently living with Yakushiji, a family friend, who doubles as her caretaker. Like Risley and Chylie, she gets spooked by ghost stories. Her hobby is playing the piano.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they entered the store, Risley immediatly took about 7 items of clothing, and ran towards the chnging rooms, with Naoyo waiting patiently outside the changing rooms. As she was waiting, her T-shirt became a white, long, collared shirt. She suddenly spotted a black button up jacket with a white symbol on the chest on a hanger near the changing rooms. He subcounciously put it on beliving it belonged to her. From head to toe, Naoyo looked like a teenage boy, but in reality, she was a well endowed girl, trying to hide her true appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the changing room, Risley tried the clothes he took. Despite all being feminine blouses, shirts and even a dress, he seemed to think it was all normal. While changing, his T-shirt's colour faded, with the neck part growing, thus becoming a nice white turtleneck. Next to it, a black blouse with a design similar to Naoyo's jacket, appeared next to the tutleneck. Its' design was completed with a yellow sailor tie and a white symbol on the neck part. Deciding that he shouldn't buy anything yet until he received his allowence, Risley changed back, not noticing his new wardrobe. He told the shopkeeper that he will return in a few days to buy some of the items. Being a fan of risley, he accepted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the two left the store,wondering around Junes once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the four haven't noticed was that the cards they acquired after their encounter with Chie, Yukiko, Rise and Naoto glowed faintly as their changes continued. Now however, with the changes almost done, they suddenly vanished, officially setting their existence in the new world.</span></div></div>",

Having both grown in Inaba, they know Junes pretty well, so it was easy for them to navigate through the mall. As they were walking they passed a supermarket which made them wonder:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think the guys are going to be happy if we cook them something? I am sure this time will be a lot better than the curry, even better than the omelettes.\", said Jakiko with confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It has to be. There's no way we will ever screw up as bad as then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe memories of them creating a curry that could kill and omelettes which were bland or awful tasting flashed in their minds. They had to prove the guys how much they have learned. And without eachother's knowledge, to impress a certain boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe people who were talking about were Yosuke Hanamura, a charismatic individual but also a bit clumsy and a pushover at times who happens to be Junes' manager's son, Kanji Tatsumi, a tough looking, but kind hearted boy, who takes a liking for cute things, Teddie, a being from another world, that takes the shape of either of a normal boy or a moving bear mascot, which is also very perverted at times and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYu Narukami. He is a 16 year old boy that transfered from the city to study a year in Inaba, because of his parents's work. He currently lives with his uncle, Ryotaro Dojima and his cousin, Nanako. While inatially cold and unaprochable, he became an open, supportive and kind friend of theirs'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was through his friends' that he understood the value of bonds, which in return, made him able to help their friends overcome their weaknesses. And made some of his friends to fall for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they were thinking about him, neither noticed their hips and rears finish forming, with Chyile being a bit small, but also with no excess body fat, and Jakiko's being slightly larger, but very well proportioned. Their waists began to compress, as they aged up to 15.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe after all the exams are over, we will try making dinner for them. What do you say Jukiko?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a great idea Chiye\", said Jukoko, accepting her friends'idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two nodded in agreement, as internally they decided on another goal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That has to impress Yu-kun. I'm sure of it.\", thought Chiye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If Narukami-kun has to like it, than I will give it my all.\", thought Jukiko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I am feeling tired.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we've been walking for a while. Junes is further from the inn than the school is. I guess we can take a break.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two saw an unoccupied bench and decided to stay a bit to regain their strength. As they were resting, they once again began to drift in their thoughts. This time about their mission<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mission was solving a murder case that plagued Inaba ever since early spring. But it's more complicated than that. The method of murder is literally throwing people inside the TV, which results in them being found dead the day after it rains, if they do not leave the TV world. The method they have to stop this is to watch the Midnight Channel, which always shows the person that is going to die before they are killed, and then to jump through the TV themselves to save them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it isn't the fall through the TV that keels people, it's the Shadows from inside that do. Shadows are surpressed human emotions, which signify the parts people refuse to accept about themselves. However, by accepting your faults, the shadow becomes a Persona, the human will to continue pushing forward despite your weaknesses. That's the way the Investigation Team acquired the method to save the ones thrown in the TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChiye' Tomoe of the Chariot Arcana and Jukiko's Konohana Sakuya of the Priestess Arcana were gained through such a method. The former has really high physical skill, and the latter specializes in fire attacks. The power to fight back against the murderer and to overcome their flaws was mainly thanks to Yu, who without hesitation, accepted their  and the others' downsides without pause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they thought about the bow they have fallen for, their waists became slim, with Chiye's also a bit toned. Meanwhile, something formed on their chests. They felt something, but immediately dismissed it as being normal. There was now a black sports bra on Chiye, and a white laced bra on Jukiko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm feeling reenergized! Let's go find the others.\", said Chiye vigorously. Jukiko nodded before adding:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too. I think we should try to search for them at the food court. And if they aren't there we could wait for them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a plan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they headed towards the escalator, their faces itched a bit. Both of them feminised with higher cheekbones, smaller noses and ears and longer eyelashes.Chiye's eyes changed to brown, while Jukiko's to black. Finally, their lips swellled a bit, with Jukiko's became slightly more plumper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey aged up one last time to 16 years old.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As time went by, Risley became more and more impacient as none of their friends came into view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee, what's taking them so long ?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Risley-san, please be pacient. I'm sure that there is a rational expalnation for them to be so late.\", said Naoyo calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as Risley said they were wandering around waiting for a few hours. However, he realised something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess Jukiko-senpai and Chiye-senpai might've taken a detour to the inn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seemes like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile they were talking, more changes happened. Risley's hips and butt finished growing to a delectable size, while his waist began to shrink.<br>\r\nNaoyo, however experienced the growth of a few years in a few seconds. Her slim waist and well devoloped hips and butt made her look like she had already the proportions of a woman, not a fourteen year old girl. Her breasts, also exanded in juste massively in a matter of minutes, gaining small D-cups, and which were still slowly growing. But because of her restricting bra and boyish clothes, she still looked the same as a few minutes ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suggest we should try waiting for them in the fourt court. It is afterall, our usual meeting place.\", said Naoyo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean \"Secret Headquarters\", don't you?\", said Risley cheerfully, with Naoyo giving a smile and a small giggle at that remark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile it wasn't so secret it was indeed the Investigation Team's usual meeting place, where they dicussed their next strategy for saving the victims and thwarting the killer. They also gained memories about Yosuke , Kanji, Teddie and, the ssubject of their affection, Yu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them, along with Jukiko and Kanji, were also victims of the killer, who were thrown in the TV, and left for dead at the hands of the Shadows. But with Yu leading the Investigation Team, they were saved, and in the process faced their own Shadows, giving them their Personas. Risley's Himiko of the Lovers Arcana isn't able to fight, but has the ability to find the enemies' weaknesses and can also boost the party's power, defense and speed. Naoyo's Sukuna Hikona of the Fortune Arcana, while being a potent physical attacker, it specializes in non elemental attacks, and has also mastery over light and darkness. Although undoubtedly both of them have fallen for Yu, Naoyo doesn't show her affertion too much, hiding her feelings until the right moment, like Jukiko and Chyle, Risley on the other hand, openly shows her affection, always trying to be close to him as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you're right. We always go and spend time toghether there. They have to go there as well.\", said Risley, with Naoyo nodding in agreement. \"So what are we waiting for? Let's go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they made their way upwards, their faces transformed. Risley's nose shrunk, his eyebrows thinned and his eyelashes grew, as it became the face of a very beaitiful girl. His lips swell and became puty and kissable with a touch of  pink lipstick to make them more appealing. His eyes also became brown. Naoyo' face didn't change too much much with the exception of her eyes changing to blue and gaining a sharper expression, and her lips also gained a small, almost unnoticeable pit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they reached the food court, they aged up one more year. While 16 year old Risley was not done with his changes, Naoyo, with her age maxed out at 15 and with her breasts growing one more time to DD-cups, her new identity was completed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She is the brain of the Investigation Team, and a very driven individual that always thinks the for the best course of action for her friends. She is a first year student at Yasogami High School. However, because men are much more frequently found in detitive work, she made others believe that she is in fact a boy, by dressing herself as one and talking with the tone of one, thus the nickname \"Detective Prince\". Because of that, she doesn't have much confidence in her feminine side and becomes really embarrassed if she has to show it. However, Yu tries to make her understand that she has no reason to hide herself from others and that she should embrace her true nature. As a result, she began to open more to others, something she is very grateful for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two kept looking, as their usual table was already occupied. After scanning the area, Naoto eventually saw on open one in the corner, to which she signaled Risle. As they were walking, Risle's waist finished becoming waspish, and her stomach flat, creating a gorgeous hourglass figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe table was one with five seats. Seeing this, Risle pouted: \"Aw...There aren't enough for all of us.\". In their minds now, they had to meet the whole crew, not just Chye and Jukiko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they were getting seated, Risle felt something pinch his ears. When he checked, he realised it was just his pink spherical earrings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope at least Senpai comes. It would be kind of a letdown if we waited all this time just to have a meeting without everybody, especially him.\", said Risle, not noticing that his voice pitch increased by a few octaves. While she was thinking about that, a pink silk bra formed on his chest. At that remark, Naoto sighed at her friend's declaration, while also envying a bit her boldness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It's much faster this way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the two walked inside, they waited until they reached top, each thinking about Yu and their motivations. As the elevator was acending, their nipples enlarged and darkened, with small swellings already beginning to develop. It is to be noted that Jukiko's growth was happenging a bit haster than Chiye's. Inside their panties, their manhoods began to wane, becoming smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the elevator stopped, they began to look around the food court, trying to find the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you see them Jukiko?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not yet. They must've chosen another place to stay than the one we usaully use.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man, I hope we didn't came here, only to be the only ones to do so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they were still looking Chiye's breasts reached A-cups, while Jukiko's just entered B-cups. When they were about to give up, Chiye, spotted something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jukiko, look! It's Naoto-kun and Risle-san!\", pointing towards a table in the corner of the court.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good job Chiye! You sure have the eagle's eye!\", exclaimed Jukiko, making Chiye blush a little while scratching his cheek.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nWhen they began going to their friends' location, their testicles burrowed inside of them, forming ovaries. Also in their pockets, two motorcyle licences appeeared with the names Chiye Satonaka and Jukiko Amagi. While not having motorcycles, they had scooters, which the licences allowed them to drive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever the names on the licences were changing, with the \"y\" in Chiye's name disappearing and the \"j\" in Jukiko's began to change its' shape<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Jukiko-senpai! You've come! \", exclaimed Risle at seeing her friends. No one one noticed as their voices became that of teenage girls with Risle's also becoming perfect for singing, given his newfound experince.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you been waiting for long?\", asked Chiye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not quite. We were looking around Junes until recently. We waited here for only a few minutes.\", replied Naoto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry for the delay. It's my fault that I forgot that I had to work at the inn, so I asked Chiye to help me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem Jukiko-senpai. When it comes to the inn, you are always giving your best to help out.\", said Risle assuringly. Chiye and Naoto nodded at the comment, making Jukiko relieved and happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking their seats, they were a bit worried about the size of the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure its okay sitting here? Even if we bring other chairs, I don't think there is enough space for everyone.\", inquired Jukiko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We tried to look for other open tables, but currently there arent any. I guess we have to wait here until one becomes free.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or we can just ask Yosuke to give us a better table.\", suggested Chiye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring their conversation, Chyie's and Jukiko's breasts ended growing, with the former now having large B-cups and the latter medium C-cups.<br>\r\nAlso, between their legs, a slit opened underneath their manhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\"Still, it wouldn't be a problem if only Senpai came.\", said Risle, wishing for that to happen. Still daydreaming, she wasn't bothered by the itching on his chest. His nipples grew and his areolas exapnded, with small fat deposits forming beneath them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others sighed at Risle's behaviour, knowing that he meant having Yu only for himself. However deep down they also wished the same thing.<br>\r\nWhile thinking about what they could do toghether, Chiye and Jukiko's manhoods shrunk into their slits and became womanhoods. This effectively made them not just girls, but also residents of Inaba, their licences showing their new identities.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

I kind of felt a shiver, but it''s nothing. How about you, Yukiko?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm the same Chie. Perhaps a cold breeze hit us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone accepted the answer as their conversation continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the place of Chiye, the was now Chie Satonaka, a 16 year old stuent at Yasogami High School. She is a tomboy who loves martial arts movies, especially the \"Trial of the Dragon\" series and a very energetic and outgoing indivdual. She and Yukiko have been friends since childhood, after making her smile, after she and her parents had an argument about her keeping a dog. She now is the owner of the dog, which she named Muku, and like her is, a really big eater. Initially she wanted to protect Yukiko just to alleviate her inferiority complex towards her in regards of her femininity. However, after facing her Shadow, she realised that despite her envy, she still considers Yukiko her friend, which made her vow to herself to protect not just her, but all of fer friends. Thus, she desires to become a police officer in the future. Yu also helps her in her training and tries to make her comfortable with her own feminine side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, Jukiko became Yukiko Amagi, a 16 year old, who ike Chie is a second year student at Yasogami.  She often scores the best during exams, she is very intelligent and often repeats the material with Chie. She also truly appreciates and cares about her friends, as well as her parents and staff from the Inn, and often vows to become an even stronger, more dependable person so that one day she, in turn, will be able to support and protect them just like they have did to her in the past. However, she was formely reluctant to inherit the family inn, feeling that she is being chained down, wishing instead to become an interior decorator. But after coming to terms with her Shadow and with Yu's support, she decided to inherit the inn after all, not being able to leave her friends and co-workers behind. Yu also serves as a guinea pig for her horrible cooking, which she tries very hard to improve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the conversation continued, there was a question Chie wanted to ask Risle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Risle-chan, don't you think you are a bit too clingy to Yu-kun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?!\". The sudden inquiry surprised Risle, as his breasts grew to small B-cups and his manhood began shrinking.</span></div></div>",

You're just jealous my cooking is way better than yours'.\", said Risle while puffing his cheeks. As he said that his breasts grew to C-cups and his testicles went up inside him, nestling on each side of his pelvis, becoming ovaries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside his pocket, a motorcycle licence appeared with the name \"Risle Kujikawa', with the \"l\"beginning to vanish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing his declaration the two girls became angry, with Chie yelling: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?

You made me faint with your omelette.\", said Yukiko while fuming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yosuke-senpai told me your curry did the same thing to him and Yu-senpai.\", replied Risle, further angering the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please calm down everyone!\", shouted Naoto, gaining everyone's attention. \"You all said you trained in the kitchen, so I'm sure that mocking each other's knowkedge of cooking based on past mistakes is unfounded.

Besides, I'm sure that if I trained a lot, Chie-senpai and Yukiko-senpai did the same.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was thinking his breasts finished at small D-cups. \"Still, if he wants to meet me on Valentine's Day, I will make him a habanero pepper chocolate. It has to have something that will differentiate the taste from normal chocolate.\" As he was fantasizing about her ideal Valentine's Day with Yu, his smaller member burrowed into the slit, leading to a flurry of sensations as his womanhood blossomed and his new identity was completed.</span></div></div>",

She went on hiatus a few months ago, tired of her busy schedule and of the fact that she believed that her fans were just loving her as the persona \"Risette\", who was an identity created by the marketing companies to make her more famous. That's the reason she felt that she was losing her real identity, and decided to move to Inaba to try and find herself again. But with Yu's and the Investigation Team's efforts, she was able to overcome her Shadow, accepting that she is her own person. After interacting with Yu, she began to acknowledge that all of those fake selves she presented to others were actually just other sides of her true personality. Because of this, she admires Yu for his kind, selfless and honest nature, stating that she wholeheartedly loves him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs their conversation became once again friendly, Yukiko explained her's  and Chie's idea to cook dinner for the boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a great idea! We can now show them how much we've improved.\", exclaimed Rise \"And also to impress Yu-senpai.\", murmuring to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Chie and Yukiko having the same thoughts and motivations, Naoto, after hearing about their horrible cooking from Kanji, tells them:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-Let's follow the cookbook this time .

They were all 10 years old, but despite how young they were they were all pretty outgoing and smart for their age, thus their parents had no issue leaving them on their own. The only exception was Aaron, who was a bit unsure when he was alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat made today different, however was that Brandon had to take care of his little sister, Erin. Being only 6 years old, she was still pretty shy and would always cling to her bigger brother. Brandon really liked his sister's company, but he would often grow a bit tired of her childish and clingy behavior. She was currently waiting on a nearby bench, waiting for her brother to finish his game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more minutes, the boys tired themselves and all sit on the the bench Erin was staying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man... Today was a really good game.\", said Brandon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Totally. I can really imagine ourselves as professional football players in the future.\", replied James.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You maybe. I want to become a firefighter or an astronaut. I think it's way cooler what they do.\",said Brandon back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or a resercher.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaron....You are really the only one who likes stuff like that. You need to be more daring.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-It's fine to sometimes go the safe route. Don't you agree Erin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Huh? Y-Yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on... Asking my sister is so unfair. She would never do something unsafe. We were all like that when we were her age.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing so young surely gave the young boys a wide variety of possible future jobs, form professional foortball or baseball player to archaeologist to doctor. But Tyler would always give the most unlikely jobs he could think of, especially from his cartoon that he would watch. And today was no different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or how awesome will it be to become ninjas?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three boys sighed as Erin just looked a bit confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm.... Tyler. I thought we told you already but we don't think that we could become that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or princes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or pirates...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I know you said that, but....Behold!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom his pocket he took out a small gold coin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An old lady I helped cross the street gave me this coin. She said it has the power to grant us one wish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tyler....It's just a regular coin. She must've told you that because you thought magic exists.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInterrupting the conversation was Erin who asked:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What's a ninja?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a group of warriors who fight from the shadows, to bring peace and justice to the people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa....O want to be a ninja too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great. Now she also believes this.\", groaned Brandon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why the sour face? Don't you really wish to become ninjas?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just make a wish and see for yourself. Besides, I don't think there could be a group of ninjas that would accept Erin. She is too small.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good point. Then...\", he griped the coin firmly and shouted. \"I wish we could become a group of ninjas that would also include Erin!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, a bright light came from the coin as it enveloped the five. Moments later, they were gone.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You could've asked for anything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! Ninjas are awesome. Didn't you guys wished to be ninjas as well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When we were 7 maybe. But now....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wish to become scientists.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron became upset hearing Tyler's remark, with small tears forming in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon. You don't have to be so scared. We are in the most awesome place we've seen so far, and all you do is worry. Are you that scared you want to go to your mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I am not scared! I am not!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVisibely upset, Aaon yelled and with tears in his eyes, he ran out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Aron, wait!\", yelled James.

Let's go after him and then let's leave this place. Tyler, you still have the coin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough he didn't want to leave until he could meet some ninjas, Tyler searched his pockets for the coin. But...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Guys, I can't find it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I dropped it when we got here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile James was really getting mad at Tyler, and Erin was just standing a bit scared, holding her brother's hand ,Brandon said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. New plan. James and Tyler go after Aaron, while me and Erin wait here, while looking for the coin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a plan. Let's go big mouth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said I am sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the two boys left, looking for Aaron, Erin shyly asked Brandon:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big bro, are we going back home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course we are. We promised mom and dad we will be back until dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin smiled, feeling a bit relieved after her brother reassured her and toghether began looking for the coin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what none of them knew was that their place home was erased. The coin changed history so that they weren't born in their world. They were now in a whole new world, and despite Brandon's earlier remark, thew are going to become ninjas.</span></div></div>",

But we have to find Yamon-san.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two didn't notice the honorific that appeared in Jomues's statement, because thie thoughts and memories were changing. They began to think of the place as a school now, and like Yumi, they began to know some general knowledge about \"shinobi\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, their hips began to spread outward as their arms became longer and slimmer, with Jomues's muscles also becoming stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the changes stopped for the moment, the two were feeling a bit confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you feel like something is off here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes. S-Something is indeed strange.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mylem? Why are you stuttering?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I don't know. Maybe it''s f-from all the chaos so far.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJomues accepted the answer, but inside he was a bit confused by that statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wasn't he excited about all of this a second ago? Well, this can make anyone lose this cool. It certainly made Yamon-san.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the two neared the stairs, their thighs began growing, beginning to strain thei shorts. Speaking of which, they also changed as Mylem's turned a snow white, as Jomues's began to become two-colored: a light green on the top and dark on the bottom. They also began to become softer, but it is to be noted that Mylem's were becoming more than Jomues'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment they began to climb the stairs, they aged up again. Jomues to 14 and Mylem to 15.</span></div></div>",

But you know that I am sorry for what happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that.

So why is there, like, a cafeteria in here? Don't ninjas eat in their room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right Ehini-chan.

But he didn't have an explanation for this. The same was with Ehini. But neither noticed their new speech patterns. Mindon sounded more childish than he did in the beginning, while Ehini gained a more ditzy way way of speaking. But they weren't getting any less intelligent. On the contrary, the became a bit smarter than average kids of their current age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they were thinking, they continued changing. Mindoi's thighs finished growing, becoming more eye-candy and muscular as his hips folowed suit, beginning to grow outwards. His shorts fused toghether, becoming an orange skirt, as white frills formed on the bottom. It also began to grow upwards, currently covering his waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEhini's sleeves went all the way up her fingers, encasing her arms, becoming a pair of black gloves. Her clothes also finished their transition to pitch black. Her figure has also grown, but despite being only 12, her chest, butt and hips were slightly wider than average.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I think it does make students, like, interact with eachother more. So it isn't really an issue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. And this way, young shinobi can know each other better, making them work better toghether.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike their friends, they also gained knowledge about shinobi and the ninja school.

While initially it seemed that the two boys were wandering around aimlessly, the more they explored the school, the more they knew about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they were walking, their T-shirts began to change.

But as they were walking aound, they began to shrink and lose their legs as they changed color: yellow for Muyakem and pink for Joakues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about 15 minutes of searching, Muyakem opened a drawer in one of the rooms, and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found it!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Joakues made his way towards his friend, they both aged up again.

Even if I was dead tired and somehow forgot it here, why would it be inside a drawer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJozakures began to analyze the situation. It is true that Muyakemo finished cleaning duty late last night, but she couldn't have forgotten the mask inside the drawer like that. It definitely seemed almost like somebody put it there. And given how Ehini always teases Muyakemo about him hiding his face, it really made her seem like the culprit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he was deducting, thier underwear finished changing. After becoming a pair of bikini bottoms, they both gained some extra designes in them. Jozakures' became adorned with white polka dots while Muyakemo's gained some brown spots, giving his bikini the imprint of jaguar fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah...Shiki-chan....I hope you didn't cause all this ruckus just for a laugh.\", thought Jozakures a bit disappointed and concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, we have found my mask. Let's head downstairs now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait. I think that we should wait...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment they heard some footsteps on the staircase to the third floor. As they waited, wanting to see who it was, thier shits continued changing. Jozakures' bottom part began to turn the same sea-foam green as his shorts as a small pale blue sash with white flower imprint appeared just below his chest, to keep his top tighter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile's Muyakemo's longer T-shirt suddenly separated in two. The bottom part which was now blue positioned itself around his larger hips as the material folded itself as plate of armor formed on the bottom layer. The cental part thinned itself a lot until there was only a light purple ribbon that connected the two side parts. It wasn't really that much material, but it covered his bikini perfectly. The upper part of his shirt began to turn a dark brown as it began to harden, just like his sleeves.</span></div></div>",

Not as much as siblings, but close nonetheless. As the two were walking, Mindon's small backpack began to grow and become larger, while losing most of its small pockets, as the main one became bigger. It also began to change color, becoming orange, with patches of white, pink and black forming on its back. At the same time, the visor on Ehini's cap began to spread around as the middle portion began to grow upwards, with some fabric growing form it and some white spots appearing on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they finally reached the bathroom, they each to a different stall, leaving the backpack and cap near the sinks. It didn't struck them that they both entered the women's reatroom, however. As they were doing their business, their underwear changed. Ehini's pink frilly panties hardened, becoming a pair of bikini bottom before becoming black in the middle and white on the sides. Then most of the material disappeared, covering only her privates, while the back part almost comletely vanished, giving the impression of a thong. Her figure was also growing, becoming much more womanly as her breasts grew to B-cups. To cover them, a black and white bikni top formed over them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMindon's boxers tightened on him and became sturdier, before losing their legs. Then they began to get more snug on him as they became orange with yellow lines. The tightness would be became emphasized as his rear finished growing, beoming large and firm.

Mindoi was a bit taken aback by this, but she happily hugged her back. It missed the two that Mindoi and Shini were no longer siblings, but loved eachother as such. They were both first year students at Gessen Academy for Girls, a school where they were trained to become shinobi. They were taken in by Kurogane, a legendary shinobi, who was Hanzo's rival.

The two were still wet around the years, always liking to play or mess around, but they were really dedicated nonetheless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile they were hugging, their clothes continued changing. Shini's dress split into two, the back  moving away from her body and becoming softer, as the underside turned mangeta, becoming a cape, while her collar became the section that kept her cape in place, with a pink heart buckle appeared to keep it in place. The front part became much tighter, showing her figure, as it began to recede around various sections of it, especially around her growing hips, and shrinking waist. White lines were appearing around her waist and breasts as black straps formed to connect her gloves and boots to her dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMindoi's skirt grew all the way up, encasing his shoulders, becoming an orange dress. Around his waist a large pink bow appeared around his dress as a small hamster clip materialized on it. His shirt also began to change as the neckline plunged, showing his collarbone, while beginning to turn itself white. A pair of green bracelets, matching his anklets, appeared on his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two didn't notice that Shini grew taller than Mindoi, he remaining quite short, despite being 15 years old. When they broke their embrace, they looked in eachother's eyes, which both changed. Mindoi's changed into green, while Shini's turned burgundy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Mindoi-chin. I really care a lot about you as well, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that, you dummy. But thanks.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two then began to wash their hands.</span></div></div>",

Hanzo? Where are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanzo was nowhere to be seen in the room. He looked around looking for clues when he noticed a piece of paper on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he looked at it it had his current information and name, \"Yamin\". What was special about the paper however was that it was a document regarding the membership at Gessen Academy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this doing here...? And why does he have this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was thinking, his shirt's neckline plunbed to just above his chest, while his sleeves grew up to his elbows and continued growing. His skin also paled a bit. Meanwhile his memories were almost completely rewritten as his head was filled with how he spend his childhood with Kurogane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was pondering where Hanzo is he heard some voices from downstaris, one of which he recongized as Hanzo's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did he leave like that...? And who is talking to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a matter of seconds, he recognized the owners of the other voices. They were his classmates' after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jozakures-san and Muyakemo-san are there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began to walk down the stairs, in order to ask Hanzo about the paper and to meet the others. As he was walking, his face became that of a beautiful girl, as his dark haired hair finished growing to his shoulders, as a white ribbon with blue stripes appeared on the back of his head, styling his hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then again...He is really disciplined for someone his age.\", he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was waiting, he heard some voices downstairs alongside some rustling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm? Is there someone down there? And why are they making all that noise...? I really doubt that there are intruders in here... But I suppose it could happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanzo carefully went towards the stairs, not noticing one piece of paper falling fro his bag. By thr time he reached the bottom floor, his steps were almost inaudible. And then he jumped from the blind spot of the stairs and gor into a fighting stance!  But...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hanzo?\", asked Jozakures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? It's you two.\". In front of him, Jozakures and Muyakemo were stunned by his sudden appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What were you doing?\", questioned Muyakemo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For a second, when I heard some rustling, I thought that somehow some thieves breached the perimeter and began to dig through your belongings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You thought we were thieves?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. I knew that it was unlikely, but I found it odd that someone would search up the room like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. We understand. Wr would've done the same thing. Sorry to have alarmed you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs an awkward silence filled the room, the two boys continued changing. Muyakemo's shirt and sleeved hardened, becoming pieces of armor. Then his top part of the armor receded, exposong the top part of his chest and most of his back. The armor itself began to be resembling a corset, as a crimson ribbon appeared, tying her armor in place. Meanwhile Jozakures' skirt was tightened around his waist by a pale blue sah with the smae design as the one below his chest. The coloring of his clothes finished, the top section being white, the middle green and the bottom teal. Then small white, lavender and purple dots appeared on his outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir figures also became more womanly as their waists caved in and toned themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why are you exactly here? I don't remember being called for a meeting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...It is something specially made for you all. But I plan to tell all of you at the same time, so once Yamin-kun comes down...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Yamin's footsteps were heard. As he made his way down, he maxed out his age at 18 years old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speak of the devil...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I know you said it was time to practice, but I have interrupted the session for this.\". The excuse that was on his mind was spoken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is no problem Muyakemo-san. It couldn't have been helped.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they were conversing, Yami's sleeves reached his hands as they have gotten wider, giving enough room for his arms. A thin blue line on the edge alongside some stripes with the same color on the ends of the sleeves completed his kimono. A white obi appeared on his back as second layer of material grew form it. It wrapped around his waist like a belt, before some material grew from it as well, with an identical design to kis kimono. Also his skin finished paling itself, becoming nice and peachy as his bare shoulders evidentiated it perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others' clothes also changed. The dots on Joakures's clothes turned into flowers, giving them a beautiful design as Muyakemo's hip armor completed itself, with the cloth keeping it in place also gaining a flower imprint, as a red-trimmed hakama materialized on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way Hanzo. I found this...\", said Yami as he handed Hanzo the paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! I never noticed it fell.\", replied Hanzo. \"Can I have it back. I will make a big announcement and I want everybody to hear it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three were a bit confused and surprised by this. But decided to wait and see what Hanzo had to say. As they were contemplating, Jozakures aged up to 16, his maximum age, while Muyakemo grew as well, aging up to 18 years old. Their faces also feminized, with higher cheekbones and bigger eyes . But for Muyakemo, his' couldn't be seen as it was covered by his mask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed. I should also have something to tell Shiki as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What do you mean Muyakumo-san?\", asked Yami, as a blue and white bikini top, matching his bottoms materialized on him, while his nipples grew wider, small swellings forming beneath them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Muyakumo thinks Shiki hid the mask here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you say...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the papers with the names of the shinobi Hanzo had, two more names appeared: Muyakumo and Jozakura. Shiki's name was also already there as her change finished by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanzo watching the scene unfold, suddenly gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A mask...Uh oh.\"</span></div></div>",

I thought we finsihed checking ourselves out...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just looking at my makeup, Mindoi-chin. You will understand one day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed there was some dark eyeshadow, faint red blush and pink lipstick on her face. Despite not putting any makeup before, they both had memories of her putting it on this morning. She then took out her cap, which fnished turning into something reminescent of a witch's hat completed with a big skeleton design, with the two strands coming from it looking like claws. Her figure also grew again, becoming much more womanly as her breasts reached D-cups. Lastly her hair finished growing to her mid-back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Mindoi swung his backpack over his shoulders and began to carry it towards the exit, not noticing its' drasting change. It became almso as big as him and then some protuberations grew from its' sides, bottom and top as most of its color changed to orange, save for the blotches of color on its' front. Meanwhile his face softened and feminized itself, a small nose, higher cheekbones and longer eyelashes. It wasn't as alluring as Shini's but it was very pretty nonetheless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two then exited the bathroom and began walking back towards the main room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man.... I can't believe Muyakumo-chin is making all this racket just for his mask. She needs to be more bold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know....Say, Shini-chan...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What is it Mindoi-chin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to upset you... But did you hid Muyakemo-chan's mask again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait... You think I hid it?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry... But you always tease him about it and you did hid it in the past.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's true... But I wouldn't hid it so that she wouldn't find it on her own. Besides, you know I care for her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Shini was internally upset. She knew the others would think of her as the culprit. Mindoi looked at her with concerned eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they were walking, Shini's outfit finished changing. Her clothes became a black bustier suit outfit, which reavealed most of her body, especially her hips, waist and breasts. The top part was kept toghether by a peace sign-like buckle, which then crisscrossed around her neck. But despite showing a lot of skin, her swimsuit was carefully hidden underneath her outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they appoached the central area, a white headband appeared on Mindoi's head as he told his former sister:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just for you to know... I am aware that you like pulling pranks on Muyakumo-san, but I do believe you when you said you didn't do it. And I am sure he knows as well. After all, you are my \"sister\".\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing his declaration, he wiped a small tear forming in her eye, as Shini aged up to 15 years old and her breasts grew again to EE-cups, completing her change.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That is why he was a bit stumped by Shiki's display of affection. Normally she would just smile back if someone supported her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you feeling okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I guess I got kind of sentimental. Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-Don't be sorry! You did it because.....Ah....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mindon-chin?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small migrane hit Mindon. His former memories of him and his former sister were gone. Instead new ones, being raised toghether with Shiki, Yami, Jozakura and Muyakumo by Kurogane entered his head. Despite not being actually a familt, they cared for eachother as if they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he was coping with his headache, his brown hair flew in the air as it was pulled into two tinglets, forming two pigtails. His white T-shirt gained some pink trimmings on the front part, as a pink ribbon formed on the front. His sleeves also became a bit puffier as some pink lines formed in its edges. But the end of his sleeves began to color in pink, leaving only a white stripe not colored. Lastly, he aged up to 16.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mindori-chin, are you feelong alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...I just felt a bit dizzy there for a second.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so... I am relieved.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were really worried? Well, if you don't want to see me in pain again, how about you play with me later?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you, like, trying to blackmail me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...I don't feel good...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You poor soul... I guess I will have to recite you some lines from tye Heart Sutra to soothe your pain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha....Again?! You read it to me like about a hundred times by now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you don't wanna play later?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You''re blackmailing me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And who started it?\", said Shiki with a sly grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMindori sighed as he thought: \"It was worth a shot...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again this was Shiki. She would often tease others, be on her phone or play instead of doing her job, but she would always be dedicated when the situation arised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two were talking, they haven't noticed that Mindori's backpack expanded in volume, the patches of color from before formed a face of a cartoon hamster, with the big blotch of white becoming his \"belly\" and the bulges from before became the hamster's legs, arms and ears. It now was massive and would normally be impossible to carry. But not for Mindori. On his chest, an orange and yellow bikini top materialized.</span></div></div>",

But I will figure it out properly when I ask her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the conversation was going on, some finishing touches were made to the boys' appearance. Muyakumo's long brown hair was tied in a ponytail by a dark purple ribbon, while Jozakura's dark blue hair was styled in a sort of bobcut as a cherry blossom appeared on the left side of the head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the sidelines, Hanzo was getting a bit panicked and thought:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They seem to care about this mask deal quite a lot... Why did I had to go on my little investigation during the night...? I must think of an good excuse for this....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Yami's breasts brew to B-cups and continued growing as she said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyways, let's head downstairs. We finished our task and we need to meet up with the others in order to start.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other boys sighed. He was always dedicating to his training, even when the situation didn't actually appropiate. Underneath their tops, bikini tops formed. But while Jozakura's was a perfect match to his bottom, Muyakumo's was really different, having a white squares with blue lines design.

But deep down I know she doesn't mean any harm. And I know she wouldn't go as far as to make him this distressed. After all, we all know that Muyakumo-san is quite fragile without his mask.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJozakura was thinking something similar:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shiki always fools around like that... But Yami is right. We shouldn't accuse her without proof. Besides she would never play a prank that could upset Muyakumo like that... There has to be an explanation for this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the they were walking, Jozakura's and Muyakumo's breasts began to bud, reaching AA-cups for the moment. Meanwhile, Yami's breasts grew to D-cups and were almost done growing. Also his manhood became half of its original size, as a slit opened beneath it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Hanzo stopped and told the girls:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... Before this whole situation gets out of control... I must confess something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three girls stopped and looked at Hanzo's direction. As this was happening, Jozakura's and Muyakumo's skin finished tanning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does any of you know of the Mask of Visions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Mask of... Visions?\", asked Yami really confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is a mask which Kurogane told me about. Apparently, if you focus your mind and spiritual energy, while wearing the mask, it can give you a glimpse of your future.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three boys were at a loss for words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! Grandfather told you about this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.

Suddenly a thought entered Yami's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did grandfather knew that he would be banished? That he and Hanzo would walk on their separate ways..?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was thinking, his breasts became large DD-cups, as his manhood became just a small nub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That he would meet us...?

Even the leader of the Gessen Academy.\", said Hanzo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYumi nodded silently before asking:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So grandfather ever showed you the mask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. And whenever I asked him about it, he just brushed it off. But now, after all these years, I think i was just a joke to rile me up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others sighed in relief hearing that. If an artefact so powerful would exist, Kurogane would've told them about it. In the meantime, Jozakura's and Muyakumo's breasts began to grow faster, reaching C-cups as their manhoods began to wane and shrink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this is what you've wanted to tell us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three saw Hanzo was getting a bit nervous, which was a bit unsettling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was a bit excited to tell you the news I told you about and I reached the school last night. I knew you all must've been asleep, so I decided to wait until morning. But...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The curiosity got the best of me and began to look inside for the Mask  of Visions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I thought you said it doesn't exist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew that. But back then I thought \"What if it exists?\". So I looked around the school for it. At one point, while I was looking in a room, I found something that looked like a mask and then I took it to look at it closer. But when I looked at it...It was an ogre mask...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\"\"You took it??!!\"\"\", asked the girls in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't noticed you sleeping, being to absorbed by the mask. And it was too dark to see exactly how the mask looked like when I took it. Then after I realised my mistake, I heard someone walking on the stairs, so I hid the mask in a drawer and then I got out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you didn't put it back?\", said Muyakumo a bit angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't want you to think I was spying on you....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe revelation left the three quite upset with Hanzo. Meanwhile, he was nervously fidgeting, thinking of what punishment he will receive for this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they were thinking, Jozakura's and Muyakumo's breasts reached DD-cups as their manhoods began to invert into womanhoods.</span></div></div>",

Meanwhile, Jozakura's and Muyakumo's breasts finished their growth at E-cups, with the latter's being slightly larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand that having such an item in your grasp would make anyone tempted to try and find it.

So you will not receive any punishment this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if it happens again...\", said Muyakumo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... You will put Kotato and Kagero to \"play\" with me...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... Not quite that bad... But you would still get a pounding.\", continued Jozakura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanzo gulped as he understood that this had to be the last time this would happen, given how much panic it caused. Luckily, he still had the announcement to make, in case they were still upset with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Jozakura's and Muyakumo's manhoods disappeared, with a new reproductive system taking their place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Yozakura-san, Murakumo-san, with the whole mystery solved, let us go back to the ninja room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I am sure those two got really bored down there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus the four continued to head downstairs. But murakumo had something on her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to apologize...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, in the ninja room, Shiki and Mindori were paciently waiting for the others' return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say...Do you think they found it?\", asked Mindori.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so. They have been up there for quite a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile they were waiting, a green choker, with a small, round bell and a red ribbon attached to it formed around his neck, as two green hairbands appeared and pulled his hair into two pigtails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shiki-chan...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it Mindori-chin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still feel that something is wrong here. I know it sounds weird, but the whole thing with us being shinobi....It feels a bit off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, his nipples grew larger and more sensitive, as small fat deposits grew beneath them. Also, he gan to feel a tingling in his groin, as his manhood started to shrink.</span></div></div>",

I don't blame you, I agree it was kind of unsettling, but we both saw that there was nothing wrong. I guess we were just a bit tired from searching the mask, and we became a bit lightheaded as a result.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing Shiki's explanation, he wanted to say something, but the weird thoughts from earlier faded from his mind, as frills grew from the top of his shirt, covering his existing cleavage. Speaking of which, they grew to C-cups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right Shiki-chan. Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, they heard footsteps, and when they turned around they saw the other girls, alongside Hanzo.Yumi-chan<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone! You've come back!\", yelled Mindori. Down below, his manhood continued to shrink as with a wet rip, a slit began opening underneath it, as his testicles began burrowing into his body, popping in with a wet sound. They changed function and matured into functioning ovaries, nestling on opposite sides of his pelvic area, as his organs re-arranged and shifted to a new reproductive system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?! Why is Hanzo here?\", asked Shiki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanzo scatched his head as Yozakura simply said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a long story.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMindori dropped his backpack as he went closer to Yumi and whispered to her:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yumi-chan... Is grandpa Kurogane happy that we are shinobi?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nS he asked, his breasts finished their growth at large DD-cups, slightly smaller than Yumi's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you saying, Mindori-san? Of course he is. We all promised to him we will become Good Shinobi and we are on our way to become fully fledged shinobi. Besides, we all all \"family\", aren't we? Growing up toghether has been the most important thing in our lives. So don't worry. We are all happy with being shinobi. And I am sure he feels the same.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that, he smiled brightly and hugged her. Just as this happened, his smaller member burrowed into the slit, as his womanhood blossomed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, \"big sister\"!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big...Minori-san...Y-You haven't called me that in a long time! Why now?\", asked Yumi a bit flustered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. Maybe because I think you are my big sister? Hehe..\", she said innocently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYumi was a bit taken aback by this statement, but she smiled as she hugged Minori back. The others also smiled at the scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir wish was fulfilled. They became ninjas.</span></div></div>",

And grandpa told you that such thing exists, so I understand why Yumi-chin decided not to punish you.\", said Shiki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I also have to apologize, Shiki. I initially thought that you were responsible for the theft. But I now realize that thought of you too lowly. You would never be mean on purpose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, Murakumo-chin. I know how often I pull that prank on you, so I knew that you would blame me for this as well. But I always do it to try and boost up your confidence. I mean, seriously, you have to be more bold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right Murakumo. You have to get out of your shell more often. While I don't really approve Shiki's method of encouragement, you need to depend more on yourself, not only on the mask.\", said Yozakura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right. I will see what I can do...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's what a family is for, trying to always help eachother. Right Yumi-chan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heheh... Indeed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe five girls were the elite of the Gessen Academy, all of them being students and adopted granddauthers of Kurogane, one of the most virtuous Shinobi. Despite having his goal to destroy all evil, he realized his perception of \"evil\" was too one-dimensional, in his late years. Even after his death, Yumi and the others carried out his initial dream, although he wanted not to have them make the same mistakes as he did. However, after a Shinobi Battle Royale between them, Hanzo's students and two groups of supposedly \"evil shinobi\", they realized their mistake and since then became really good friends with the others, especially with Hanzo's students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYumi is the leader of the group and is a third year student. She gives nothing but one hundred percent when it comes to achieving a personal ambition and will go to any lengths to realize a goal she has set out for herself. Despite her outwardly icy appearance, she holds a big sister's love for her teammates. Yumi is only hard on her comrades because she genuinely cares about them and wants the most out of each of them. This often leads to her trying to push them too hard and forgetting to allow both them and herself to relax every once and while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike Yumi, Murakumo is a third year. She keeps her face hidden under an ogre mask, which gives her a frightening persona in battle. However, when her mask inevitably comes off, she has a very shy and introverted personality, getting so nervous that she stammers and stutters on nearly every syllable. Despite her friends' repeated assurances that there's nothing wrong with her face, she remains insecure, and will do anything to retrieve her mask if she's ever parted from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYozakura is a second year student and is the oldet sibling from a family of twelve. She knows how to discipline her peers, which comes in handy in her work as Yumi's right-hand woman and chief enforcer. She rarely allows her own discipline to slip, but she does know how to party, and when pushed far enough, she lets loose \u2013 not only with her huge gauntlets, but with the full verbal force of her hometown accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiki is a fist year and initially could be depicted as a carefree, free spirited party girl who seems to not have her priorities in order. However, despite this Shiki is actually more intelligent and insightful than she appears, and enjoys reciting the Heart Sutra. She also enjoys to read and is shown to be quite tech-savvy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinori is also a first year, who, for whatever reason, acts like a much younger girl all the time. She's innocent and loves to play games, but is also determined to do right by her friends by becoming a worthy shinobi. She has a major sweet-tooth and loves to eat snacks all the time. Minori is extremely playful and even considers her work as a shinobi as 'playing.' She believes that everyone in the world should spend more time playing than fighting because it would make everything better.</span></div></div>",

You are not pullin' our legs here, are ya'?\", asked Yozakura in her accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all. What makes this island so special though is the fact that there is one of the most high-tech shinobi camps.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What?! Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. On the outside it looks like a normal resort, but it actually is a place where shinobi both train and relax. And the best part is that it is a private island, so there will be no noise, crowds or \"unwanted guests\".\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I really don't know what to say. Why the occasion?\", asked Yumi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For completing the Shinobi Battle Royale and for the revelations you all gained from it. And also because my students wanted to see you again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, they don't know of my idea yet, so it will a great surprise for them as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls were moved by both Hanzo's generosity and the Asuka's and her friends' kindness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you say Yumi-chin? Are we going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to Yumi-chan! We will have so much fun toghether with Hibari-chan and the others!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed. I also want to talk to Ikaruga and probably gain some inspiration for my next novel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Yumi. It seems everyone is really wanting to go. Myself included.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYumi would normally refuse such an offer, wanting to train more instead for the upcoming battles. But she also missed Asuka and her friends and wanted to have fun as well. A thought then entered her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will under one condition: To have Homura's and Miyabi's teams coming with us as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanzo was a bit surprised by this and asked back:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course we are!\", said Shiki. \"I want to see if Mirai-chin finished her new book!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I want to play more with Hikage-chan and Murasaki-chan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And probably talk with Ryobi and Ryona.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanzo was stumped. The ones that were so much against evil not too long ago were actually happy to spend time with the ones called \"evil\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am very happy that you feel this way. The fact that you became friends with them is something monumental. But to desire to strengthen your bonds... it is really something else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heheh... We just do what Asuka would do.\", smiled Yumi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanzo was proud of his' and Kurogane's students. They made bonds with \"evil\". Bonds that were irreplaceable and very precious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were one big \"family\".</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was beautiful, sunny day today. And also it was a very special day for Brandon and his friends. He, along some of his classmates and friends were selected to go to a small resort on the beach after their school won the opportunity to have its' students go on a small trip. And on top of that, they were also allowed to have their siblings come with them as well. But it wasn't actually a real resort. The students were split into groups of four into small cabins, with a central dining area, with a relatively big patch of sand leading to the sea. So it was actually a sea-view camp rather than a full-on resort. But that didn't seem to mind Brandon and his friends.... Well, most of them....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon, toghether with James, Tyler and Aaron were the first ones to arrive. They were all 9 years old, all from the same class, and they all wore their swim trunks:<br>\r\nblue with with black lines on the sides, dark red, black with white accents , and sea-blue respectively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, why did they lie that this is a resort? It obviously isn't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be that upset Aaron. It is still a vacation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brandon is right. You just believed that we are going to a resort that Matt told us about. That is only on TV. There is no way that we would go to a tropical resort or anything.\", said James.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a special chemistry between Brandon and James. There were friends ever since they were just 5, and they grew together, becoming a sort of rivals if you could call them that. Aaron pouted, but accepted James' answer, while Tyler.... was busy playing with a piece of paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Tyler, what is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... just some magic paper.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What... do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A few days ago, me, Blake, Eric and Gabe went to this magician's booth we found in town. After he had shown us some tricks, he game us some paper, telling us that if we write our wishes on them, it will come true. We decided to have only two wishes, not to get too confusing, since we had to write down all the wishes on every paper, since it was a common thing. He then gave us some pens with invisible ink to write down what we desire. So what me and Eric wished us... to become ninjas!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, the other three paused and sighed, before Brandon said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaron, don't take me wrong, but I think you got pranked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, it obviously was a trick. Only you and Eric would believe in this sort of thing. I am pretty sure Gabe accepted to play this game not to make you upset and Blake maybe thought of it as just a pass-time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why ninjas of all things?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because they are awesome! They can throw fireballs, create electricity and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got it wrong! It is not like that Japanese cartoon you told us about. Ninjas are all about.... you know, being stealthy, agile and quick on their feet. They are not superheroes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did Blake and Gabe wish for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They just wished for a great beach trip with a very modern resort-like features.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at least that sounds a lot more reasonable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! When I told Miles about it, he seemed thrilled to become a ninja.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You told Miles?! Great, the means he will make the same wish like you all did then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you so upset?

This is amazing!\", exclaimed Tyler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\"\"No it's not!\"\"\", yelled the other three boys, which made Tyler flinch at the outburst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Why are you guys so angry...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because we are in the middle of nowhere, with no way to get help, with a jungle of wild animals behind us....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And guess what? We are not ninjas!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, calm down Aaron! It isn't so bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is it not bad?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Well.... Oh! I know! We are not alone! In the wish we also wished for a resort. Maybe we are on an island resort afterall....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That.... kind of makes sense. I mean, we wouldn't be sent here for no reason. So it must be a resort on this island.\", said Brandon calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... But then why aren't we ninjas?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am sure it will come to that part as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More like it made real the wish that can be possible to accomplish Tyler.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean James?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now come on ... ninjas are something of.... let's say Japanese Middle Ages. They are like knights. For something of the past to be on the same page as a modern resort is really impossible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyler pouted at the statement: \"W-Well... Maybe they live among us....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said... They are not superheroes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon then tried to get everyone's attention. \"Guys, let's forget about that for a second. Tyler, do you still have the paper?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... No. The old man said it was a one time wish, so it disappears after we make it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. Then all we can do now is to find somebody here to help us. With a little bit of luck, if there is a resort on the island, maybe we can ask for their help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree\", said James. \"But I think we should split up. Maybe we can find somebody easier this way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a plan. I will go with Tyler. James, you go with Aaron.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Let's go now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with this the two groups headed to opposite directions, with James being somewhat grateful of the choosing. Not having Aaron and Tyler bickering with eachother was a really good idea, as the two would barely make 100 feet without starting arguing. Although he wanted to go with Brandon, he figured out this would be much more productive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was something on both Brandon's and James' mind: If the resort wish is to become true, why wouldn't the ninja one also come true? James said earlier it would be impossible, but still...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle would they know, it would actually come true as well.</span></div></div>",

However Tyler was still a bit too excited given their predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so cool! We are going to a luxury resort and we are going to become ninjas! Isn't that great?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't know much about the resort yet, or what it has, but as for the ninjas.... Do you think that part will come true?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It might be just me, but James makes a point with how things are at the moment. I don't see how we can become ninjas. You even said that in your show they had to learn how to do things, right? So how are we going to learn? Because obviously we are not ninjas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".... That's true. But maybe someone will come to teach us. I mean, if half of the wish came true, why wouldn't this part come true as well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was indeed true. They got sent to a remote island after all. Which meant that if the paper made the wish true, it means that a resort or a hotel should be on it. They don't know that yet, but it had to make sense.... It would be really unlikely for the wish to pull a prank on them. But as for the ninja part,... Brandon began thinking that maybe they will become like the modern ninjas he saw on TV. It wasn't as credible like the takes he herad of before, but it could work in theory... given the wish knows about this fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they were walking, they didn't notice that they began to grow a bit in height. It was a subtle change for the moment, but was quite odd for a sudden growth spurt. Also, their feet grew a bit in size as well, but their toes actually became thinner and more delicate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But still, why did Aaron get so upset?\", asked Tyler aloud. \"This isn't so bad. I mean it is not like we are in danger or anything... And if we are to become shinobi on top it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shinobi? What's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! It is another way to say ninja. I saw it being used in that anime show. Doesn't it sound a lot cooler?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes. It does\", replied Brandon. \"He really doesn't feel alarmed by this. I don't know if he is just excited or just curious about this place. The again, it beats getting scared and wondering around...\", said the boy to himself. But as he was ready to turn his head, he noticed something. \"Huh? Did Tyler do something with his hair? It looks a bit lighter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally both Brandon and Tyler were both blondes, only that Tyler's hair was a more dirty blond color, while Brandon's was more towards honey-blond. Currently, the two boys' hair color changed between them. </span></div></div>",

Or could be just another shampoo he used.... But that isn't important.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm? What is with the serious look Brandon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just wondering why are you so calm. I mean... we are stranded here, and we don't know if there are people on this island.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... to tell you the truth, I am just confident in what the old man told us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? Was he anything special?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! He isn't like one of those magicians you see on TV, he could practically do real magic tricks: like making things levitate, making light from his hands and having objects disappear from just a twist of his wrist. And he could even make fire and ice from his hands! How cool is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon was indeed impressed from what he heard, but then again he could be just a professional at what he was doing. There was just one thing that was a bit odd...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... About the last part. How did he learn that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I asked him, but he just said he learned it when he was practicing in Japan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Japan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, he said he traveled the world a lot to learn new tricks, but he said that most of them he learned them from a man in Japan named Hanzo. He didn't knew much about him other than him being sushi chef. But he told him so much that he even questioned how he knew all these things. But he denied being a magician from what I heard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that was curious. A man who wasn't even a magician told him so much about \"magic\"? Brandon could feel that there was something wrong with this image, but couldn't point out how did know so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile thinking, their feet grew some more while staying delicate. Their calves also began to change as some muscle formed in them. This made the two grew in height a bit more as their legs grew a bit longer. But this time, they also aged up a bit, both growing to 11 years old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So did he said that the paper trick came from this Hanzo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He didn't tell us exactly... but I think he did Brandan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see- Wait. Did you misspell my name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? No. I don't think so. I think you just heard it wrong Brandan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Brandan was about to argue, he decided to let it slide for the moment. \" Calm down. Tiyler is just joking with you. I should ask more about this Hanzo rather than worry with this.\", he thought while putting his hand on his chin. He didn't notice that both of their hands slimmed down a bit as their digits grew a bit longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

We couldn't have believed him even if he told us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo matter how Aaron wanted to be angry, he knew that James was right. The only way Tyler would've convinced them was only if he could show them the real thing. Accepting that, he began to regain his composure. James himself was also starting a bit relieved that his friend was starting to calm down. He didn't had as less patience as Aaron, but he couldn't withstand a whole walk with nothing but him complaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile they were walking, their feet started to grow slightly. This made in turn their legs to grow a bit as well. What was a bid odd however was that their feet were gaining a pedicure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides, he only wished for us to become ninjas. The resort thing came from Blake and Gabe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Hah. I guess you're right.\", said Aaron wih a sigh. \"Although, what were the chances of sending us all the way to a tropical island?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said it. I just thought we were going to a modern resort from the coast, not somewhere this far.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At the very least, it looks more like the tropical paradise Matt told us about...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I still want to go home! How are we going to explain this? We can't just tell them some magic paper sent us here. What are going to say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down. We will think of that when we find someone, then we ask what to do later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames knew he had to keep Aaron cool to not waste more time. It was tempting for him to just backtrack and get to switch with Tyler to be with Brandon, but he knew that doing that was wrong. He was a loyal friend after all, so he wanted to try and help Aaron get over his indisposition as quickly as possible. And maybe that will ease himself a bit as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he was thinking, he didn't notice that his chestnut brown hair was starting to darken a bit. Also, Aaron's raven black hair also started to lighten a bit.</span></div></div>",

From what I understood, the guy seemed to know quite a lot about the Japanese lore and old shaman magic that they have there. He told him some stories about demons and all sorts of really confusing magic techniques.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Hanzo was familiar with the lore... That wasn't actually too surprising given that he also was quite old and learned it a lot during his years. As for the magic knowledge... he probably just researched it somewhere. But it was weird that something out of those tales, like the magic paper actually EXISTED.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile pondering, their hands continued to change. Their nails grew a bit longer as the hand itself became quite dainty. But interesting enough, their grip strength actually increased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, he said that Hanzo looked quite well-built for someone who was just a mere chef. When he asked about him being an athlete in his youth, he was quite vaugue about his past. He said he had another job before that needed a lot of physical work, but he didn't disclose any more than that.<br>\r\n\"I see... Wait a second. When did you learn words like \"vague\" or \"disclose\"? I heard them before, but they seem to be really complicated words.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile it was unusual for someone so young to use, let alone understand the meaning of those words, Tiyler just smirked at that. \"Heh. I guess that I must be getting smarter then. I wonder if Yaron would play a little game to see who knows more words.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandan was really surprised of his friend's response. While it was true that Tiyler was at times taunted by his limited vocabulary, for him to actually propose a small challenge to prove that he is smarter was a bit... out there. He didn't notice however the new name that he called their friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother thing he didn't notice was that their hair changed a bit more. With Brandan's getting a shade darker, while Tiyler a shade lighter. It also started to grow out, but while Brandan's was starting to cover his ears and grew a bit longer in the back, Tiyler's just became a little more unkempt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there something else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that's all I think. Can we talk about something else now?\", asked Tiyler with a slightly tired expression. \" I don't remember much more anyways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah... Sure.\"</span></div></div>",

Tiyler, tell me about the wish about nin- I mean shinobi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe.

Weird. I think I forgot to mention.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do they do on the show?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They can use the power of elements, they have guardian animals that they can summon...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds more like sore sort of wizards rather than ninjas... But did you actually wish for these things?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I just wished to be shinobi. I did mention that I would have some sort of powers... but I can't actually remember.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is strange... Before I remembered everything about the wish... But now it seems a bit foggy for some reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you still feel a bit dazed about the situation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn reality, his memory was starting to fade about the wish. Actually, both of their minds were starting to change, certain details about their lives starting to fade from their minds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, they once again grew in height. Their legs became longer as their calves become more toned. Their thighs also began to thicken and gain some muscle as a small layer of fat was forming on the surface. This put some strain on their swimsuits as well, but they ignored the feeling. They also aged up again, but this time,there was a big difference between them. While Brandan grew to 13, Tiyler became 15, being slightly taller now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyways, I think I know why the wish couldn't come true.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In that anime you watched, were there resorts?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I think there were hot springs and inns, but nothing else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe because there was this modern resort that didn't fit in with the rest. You don't know any shows of modern shinobi, so I guess that is why it doesn't work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think so?... Well I am not about to give up on my wish just yet Handan. We will see in the end what it will be of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHandan sighed as he thought: \"He sure is obstinate, that Tiyli... Wait. Did he misspell my name again? Ugh.

He then approached Yaron and gave him a small nudge. \"Besides, you said you wanted to go to a place like this before, haven't you?\", said Ames with a small smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInternally, Ames was a bit surprised at himself. Usually, he wouldn't act so cheery, especially in serious situations. But he found himself compelled to act this way. It wasn't anything bad however. It was from his desire to make Yaron feel comfortable with the situation. This also calmed himself a bit, as it meant that he knew how to make something good of this without losing his cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnaware of it, their hands grew more slimmer as their fingers and nails grew longer, and gaining a manicure in the process. Their arms grew a little longer as well before gaining some muscle, making them stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, Yaron replied back: \"I guess I could... I need some way to relieve my stress after all. This whole situation really tensed me up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So does that mean we could spend time toghether at the spa?\", asked Ames with a bit of excitement in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... But only after we find a way to explain how we got here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah... You never change, do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew that Yaron was a bit of a order-loving guy, liking things when they were safe or advantageous, but he knew deep down that he only cared for their safety. He didn't notice that his hair grew a bit longer while Yaron's lightened up a bit more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the two heard some noise coming from the front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. It came from behind that rock in front of us.\"</span></div></div>",

A person!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go talk to them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two then began running towards the dock, hoping whoever was there wouldn't leave by the time they got there. As they ran, their legs changed further. While they were quite sporty, the muscles in their calves seemed to give them a little boost in their speed, almost like they would run daily. This further proven by their thighs which expanded quite a bit as muscle began to form in them. They began to feel their legs a bit sore from the running, but that feeling quickly disappeared as they grew in height again. This also made them age a bit more, but Yaron aged a bit more, given that he was now a little taller than Ames. The former was now 14, and the latter 13.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got close enough to the dock, Ames yelled: \"Hey! Wait for us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe person looked at the direction of the shout, seeing the two boys running up to them. When the boys stopped to catch their breath, they were a bit surprised to see a woman in her mid-twenties with long brown hair tied in a low ponytail with a white T-shirt and black shorts. When they regained their breath they figured out that judging by her clothes and boxes, she was most likely a worker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you two got here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... We got a bit lost...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see... From where do you come?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... not too far, like about 500 meters or so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmes was trying to find for an explanation as to how they got there, but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you the guests that Hanzo-sama told us about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hanzo-sama said that we are to expect quite a lot of guests today. He said that it was a way to have his students and their friends a little free time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yes! we are two of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! I will take you to the main compound! But can you please help me with these boxes? They are a little heavy and some members of the staff couldn't come today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, no problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! I almost forgot. My name is Natsumi. What is yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Ames was ready to talk, Yaron spoke in his stead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Yarin, and my friend is Amus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yarin and Amus. Got it! Now shall we get started?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys nodded and began to put the boxes in the boat. But here was something that Amus found a bit strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's weird... This lady seemed to accept that we are guests here without even asking how we got here.... And Yarin just stood quiet. I really thought he would object or panic... Is he trying to get in the role here?... And Hanzo... Why does this name feel so... familiar.\"</span></div></div>",

Is there something else I should know about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHandan was continuing with the act of being interested in shinobi to try to pass more time. He was still a bit sceptical it would actually come true, but he found himself somehow starting to accept the idea...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... they are divided into two groups. Good Shinobi and Evil Shinobi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What do you mean \"Evil\"?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just a manner of speaking. In reality they are shinobi like all the others, the big difference being that they think a lot more flexible. They  believe that it is actually better to commit certain sins if the goal you are to achieve is pure. Sure, there are some who use that excuse for money or fame, but not everyone is like that. Yhe Good Shinobi believe in the purity of one's deeds in achieving that which you want to accomplish. But they end up having more stiff believes as a result, so they deem the Evil Shinobi to be \"sinful\" because of their more ideas. But like the Evil Shinobi, there are also people who want to understand the thoughts of the ones called \"evil\". So to be precise, there are Good And Evil Shinobi who interact with eacother to understand their thoughts....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the explanation, their thighs continued to grow as more muscle formed in them. Also, their hips began to spread outwards as well. This made their swimming trunks become even more strained... Bu that quickly changed. They started to mend on their new proportions as they clung on them tighter then originally. Then, they started to shrink. Initially, they were just above their knees, but now they were around mid-thigh. Their color also started to change. The black lines on Handon's began to expand and cover the blue, while the white accents on Tiyli's  also grew, beginning to swallow up the black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the explanation, Handon was with his mouth wide open, speechless belief at what he just heard. This made Tiyli a little surprised of his friend's reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What is it? Did I say something wrong...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No! It's just that... you said it like you know this much already! Did you research it somewhere?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... And don't try to flatter me. I only said what you asked me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I know...but still...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHandon was certainly not expecting this. He heard Tiyli tell his nin-shinobi tales before, but he didn't know it was actually this deep. He just heard him tell about the action scenes, and not the actual plot, but... it really was impressive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way, which one do you think suits you better? A Good or Evil Shinobi?\", asked Tiyli.</span></div></div>",

I would personally go with Evil Shinobi. They seem to have more freedom of thought than the Good ones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHandon was mentally trying to process a reply to the inquiry, but there were some other things that were on his mind as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why does he know so much?!... I mean, I know it is common knowledge, but... Wait... Is it?... Yeah, I think it is. I knew all that stuff already... But for him to know about it this good is really... In any case, I should think of an answer...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHandon put his hand on his chin and began to think, while Tiyli was paciently waiting for his reply. as they were walking, once again they grew in height, this time quite a lot more. They became quite tall, with their legs being shapely and athletic as their thighs grew one last time, becoming really appealing. Their hips also grew as their rears began to expand as well. This put quite a lot of strain on their trunks, but they once again grew to accommodate their lower regions as they continued to shrink, now being at their mid-thighs. Their color kept modifying as Handon's as now mostly black, while Tiyli's was almost white, but in the case of the latter some yellow lines also formed on the sides of his hips. To finish it all up, they aged again: Handon to 15 and Tiyli to 19.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of thinking, Handon gave his reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I would go with Evil Shinobi as well. I would go with Good, but having a little more freedom to what I can do is more appealing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. Very well Homdan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if possible I would like not to have to work under someone. I want to find my won path at the end of the road myself, not with someone telling me what to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe answer stunned his friend a bit, but with an acknowledging nod and a little smile he said: \" I see.. Thanks for telling me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem.\". In his mind, Homdan thought:\" I think he seems pleased. Wonder where that question came from however... Anyways, I am happy that we talked about this. It was a good way to say what we know about Shinobi... And I am glad that Tiyali finally said my name right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two were walking, the sun shone brightly over them, which caused their skintone to change as well. Tiyali was gaining a yellowish tan, while Homdan's skin became tanned a bit more, like he was spending a lot of time in the sun. The only parts that didn't was the area around his crotch and surprisingly enough, his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The sun is very hot today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... I am glad we were in our swimming suits today.\"</span></div></div>",

There were full of various sport sport equipment like volleyball or softball, some waterguns and so on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you going to do with these?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, they are for you and the other guests. We took some extra just in case.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is no need to thank us. You came here to relax, right? We are doing our jobs for that. Besides, I am sure you all wanted a vacation.\", said Natsumi with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmus nodded and smile back, with Yaron also giving a small smile back. While they were working, the boys' skintone began to change. Amus' tanned a bit while Yaron's went the opposite route and paled a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Natsumi left the two boys alone a bit, Amus whispered to Yaron: \"Can I ask you something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't you said anything before? You seemed to be pretty calm given that we just went with the flow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, Yaron would immediately panic when saying a lie, especially one of this caliber. While it was true that the wish was to have them spend time at a resort, they didn't knew anything about Hanzo or the group that was scheduled to arrive. So Amus expected some sort of nervousness from his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am sorry. But I do not understand what you mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? You know, about being the guests they were expecting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Again, I do not see what is wrong. We are their guests after all. I wasn't really sure what to think about this trip, but I accepted nonetheless. It would be disrespectful not to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is the matter? Is something wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmus was really not sure what to make of this, his mind trying to find an explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does he mean by that? And why does he not find anything odd with what he said? I mean, Hanzo did sent us here to relax, but... He did? But we got here from a wish...! No wait... That... really sounds silly. If only wishes would work that way... He is right though. We were supposed to come here as means for us to have fun and get to know eachother better... Why did I think that what he said was wrong?... I guess that was just a weird thought. Yeah, it has to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the two of them were crouching, their thighs expanded even more. As Amus was thinking, they finished growing nicely, with strong muscle in them and a small amount of fat on top of them. In the meantime, their hips also began to expand, putting even more strain on their trunks. But as they became skintight they began to shrink as well. Their colour also began to shift as Amus' began to whiten while Yaron's was lightening up a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to have his friend worry, Amus replied back: \"Everything is all right. I just felt something is off. Hehe...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I see... In that case, shall we continue?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither noticed that their personalities were changing as well as Yaron was getting more pacient and well-mannered and Amus more perky and slightly playful.</span></div></div>",

We are happy that we could help.\", replied Yarin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. It was also a good work-out.\", continued Amus with a smile. At that time, he remembered something. \"Ah, we almost forgot. A couple of our friends was also with us when we came here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Where are they right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't know... They went the other direction, trying to find someone from the resort.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. You guys can wait in the boat a bit, while I call someone to go look for your friends, all right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys nodded as they made their way in the motorboat. It was fairly big if it could contain about a dozen of boxes in the back and some bigger ones in its' trunk, so there was plenty of space for the two boys. As they were ready to get seated, they one again grew older. This was accompanied by one more push in length of their legs as the thighs became thick and strong was their hips grew once again. Yarin was now 17 and Amus 15.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the two got seated, Amus felt something was off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think the seat feels a bit off Yarmin-san?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Why do you ask Amusa-san?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The seat feels a bit cushy to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It could be just a feeling. I feel okay with my seat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right... I don't know why I thought so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cushy feeling was acutally their butts which began to grow to better fit their legs. Their swimming trunks also changed to better fit their larger hips and butts. They continued growing smaller and tighter as they started to gain some patterns on them: Yarmin's which was now heading towards a baby-blue colour began to grow some white polka dots as Amusa's which was now mostly white gained some different colour lines began to form; they were blue, yellow, red and green, almost in a rainbow-like fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later Natsumi came back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. I told a friend of mine to go looking for your friends. Luckily she was already touring the island, so she should find them quite easily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. Thanks a lot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a big deal. Oh, and by the way.\". Natsumi took a pair of white T-shirts and handed them to the boys. \"The sun can be quite hot while we are on top of the water, so wear these to not get some sun burns. You surely do not want something like that to ruin your day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\"Thank you.\"\", replied the two boys in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsumi then turned on the motor and the boat left the dock, heading towards the resort.</span></div></div>",

While Homdan was initially really confused and a bit surprised at the knowledge Tiyali had about Shinobi, the more they talked, the more things they discussed about the subject were becoming clearer and more natural to him, as if he knew those things before. Also, their personalities were changing as well. Tiyali became a bit more prideful and serious, losing the excitement he had at the start, not smiling as much, while Homdan became a little more acceptant of Tiyali's behaviour, getting a cool atmosphere around him, while feeling a little more competitive as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two were walking, their skin tanned a some more. While Tiyali was getting an uniform tan, in Homdan's case, the process not only seemed to happen faster, his skin darkening more, but uneven as well as the chest region and a small area around his privates seemed to be tanning at the same degree as Tiyali. Homdan took notice a few times, but merely brushed it off as a simple trick of the light, not even bothering being something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they were walking, the sound of an engine suddenly appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that the sound of a car?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Where is it coming from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's coming from behind us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they turned around, a big white convertable Jeep came in their views. In a matter of seconds, it stopped at a few minutes from them. They were a bit surprised to see who the driver was when he came out of the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew! There you were! I was wondering where you might be.\". The driver was a woman in her twenties with short black hair that reached her nape. Seeing the surprised expression of the boys, she giggled. \"Hehe. What's the matter? Were you expecting some kind of a race guy to be at the steering wheel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah... Kind of...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It happens all the time, and I can't get enough of the surprised expressions of the people who see me. My name is Asako. What is yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Tiyali.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I am Homdan.\". They were feeling a bit awkward at the situation, trying of seem not too surprised when they answered Asako, which made her let out a small giggle again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, Homdan and Tiyali get on board! We can't have the guests wonder here all day. So let's go. But first, please put these on.\", said Asako giving them both a black T-shirts. \"It is pretty hot today, and the last thing you need on the day you come is for a sunburn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Right. Thank you.\", said Homdan as he was getting a bit overwhelmed by the woman's excitement..., this being something Tiyali is also experiencing. After putting on the shirts, they went in the car along with Asako and they began to drive off. They didn't notice that their hair changed further. Homdan's became a hazel-brown and continued to darken as it grew past his shoulders as Tiyali's now covered his ears as the colour lightened once again, some streaks almost becoming white.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

But I think for about an hour...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. I am sorry for what happened. We were supposed to come take you from the harbour, but there was a small disconnect with HQ, and you were left at the place we originally settled for. It was initially for a little trip through the forest, so you were left around the starting point, am I correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHomdan was struggling a little to remember as his memories were starting to get hazy. In his stead, Tiyali replied back: \"Yes, that is correct. There was a marked path that went into the forest, but we decided to not go that way because we were afraid some wild animals might attack us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't worry about that. There aren't any carnivores in there. There are mostly birds, reptiles and insects. They won't attack you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. Thanks for the info.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHomdan was surprised to hear Tiyali's answer but he quickly accepted it as more mental changes happened. While he still had the feeling that something was indeed off, Tiyali accepted everything so far, including the new memories that were replacing his old ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir bodies continued changing as well. Their hips grew to their final size as their butts also finished grew, becoming firm and soft. Their trunks completely lost their legs as the tight material was now showing a bit of their young boyhoods that curiously enough, didn't grow at all despite their age jumps. The swimsuit still had a few more changes to undergo, but they were almost done reaching their end form. Their T-shirts also changed. They lost their sleeves and collars as they grew tighter on them, as like with their trunks were receding as well, as their lower ends now being along their bellybuttons. The material also got a bit sturdier and stretchier, and in Tiyali's case, whiter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am sorry to interrupt, but can I ask something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure. What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was wondering... who does this resort belong to?\". Homdan was still remembering a bit of the whole magic paper wish, so trying to recall the details from it, was now wondering the identity of the owner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there facility belongs to the Agency, but you could say that Hanzo-sama owns the resort since it is written under his name. He couldn't come due to some issues at HQ, but he told us to make you feel as good as you can here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Homdan heard the name \"Hanzo\", his mind flew to his earlier conversation with Tiyali about the man who told the magician about the magic paper, but as the memories were getting harder to remember, he just thought:\" It must be just a coincidence.\". He wouldn't know that soon he wouldn't remember anything about the wish, paper of magician... Tiyali already did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they continued driving, the boys' waits began to compress a bit as stronger muscles were starting to form in their abdomen. </span></div></div>",

Looking better, they were completely speechless at what they saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\"No... way....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat lied on their left was a tall, five storeys building with the front made out of glass. Around it was a sports court, an outdoor and an indoor pool, a few restaurants, each with a different theme and a small greenhouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-This is the resort?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite impressive, isn't it? Hanzo-sama made this place exclusively for shinobi to relax and to have a great time. He rarely comes here due to his obligations, but he denied making this place for himself. Just like I said before, this is a place where both Good and Evil Shinobi are welcomed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so.... Huh?!\", asked Homdan in pure bewilderment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there something wrong Homdan-san?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you say- Argh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a headache overcame him. He was trying to recall his earlier conversation with Tiyali about shinobi. His memories were changing so that instead of talking about a show, they were instead talking about their beliefs in the shinobi's code.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright Homdan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should we go to the doctor's office?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his memories reformed, he tried to ease Tiyali and Asako as the migrane suddenly disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I am fine. It just came out of nowhere, but it's gone now. So don't worry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I am okay Tiyali. But thanks of worrying for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is why we are friends, to look for each other, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... And one again, thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you are feeling all right, then let me park and then I will go find somebody to show you around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsako parked the car and then told the two boys to wait for her to come back. As they were waiting, they began to stretch a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The car ride sure took a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I felt a bit numb there for a second.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they were stretching, they once again aged up. Homdan grew a bit taller, now being around Tiyali's height as their waists thinned further as they became toned.  With a few exceptions, they had the bodies of female athletes. Their trunks also finished shrinking, becoming a pair of bikini bottoms. Homdan's shrink to the point where the tan line between his pelvic region and the rest of his body was shown a little as they became pure black while Tiyali's gained some orange accents around his hips. Their tops also shrunk as the neckline plunged and the back region was beginning to disappear as the hemline was now above their bellybuttons. In the end, they both reached their final ages: 17 for Homdan and 21 for Tiyali.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the changes were done, Asako and another woman came up to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning Homuda-san, Tiyabi-san. I am Otome, and I shall be your tour for today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told Otome about your situation. She will keep you two company until your friends come alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, thank you for everything Asako-san.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two waved back to Asako as she left with her car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, shall we go inside?\", asked Otome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys nodded, being quite curious as to what awaits them inside. On their way, they felt their eyes stung a little, but the feeling quickly faded, thinking that only some dust got into their eyes. Unknown to them, their eyes just changed color: from blue to green for Homuda and from green to yellow for Tiyabi.</span></div></div>",

The island was quite big, despite being a place which doesn't normally appear on most maps. Even if there was a resort on it, the rest of the land was untouched, the nature being left the way it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's beautiful, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... It is indeed quite a view.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two were looking outside, their white T-shirts began to change. Their sleeves receded as the necklines plunged a little as well. They also became skin-tight as they slowly crawled all the way to their belly-buttons. Their waists also slimmed down as they became more toned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you guys want, we could take a small break if you want to see the landscape.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we?\", asked Amusa with a bit of excitement in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure we can. We aren't that far from the resort anyways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsumi stopped the engine, leaving the three right in the front of a small glade, where beautiful multi-coloured flowers were decorating the view of the three.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! They are so pretty!\", exclaimed Amusa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-Indeed. They... look lovely...\", continued Yarmin trying to contain his emotions regarding the view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These were already here when we came. Hanzo-sama said it would be too much of a pity to let them die just because we had to make a resort here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Where did Hanzo decide to make the place then? Not near the forest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, he wouldn't have the heart to go and ruin a forest for something like that... There was this open space on the east-side of the island, where it was mostly the shore. He decided to clean the place a bit, and then built the resort there. Hanzo-sama loves the nature, so he wouldn't dare destroy the ecosystem .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He actually said that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... not exactly with these words. He was more about the communion between humans and the nature that surrounds us... I don't think I can explain it to you exactly like he said, but he surely made the resort without harming the nature on the island.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two wanted to know a bit more about the project, but decided to settle on the matter for later. Amusa especially was feeling a bit proud of Hanzo from what he heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is always so careful with everything... Now only if he would drop a certain quirk... Huh? That was weird. Where did that thought come from? Oh well... I don't think it is that important.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Natsumi was talking, their skin tones finished changing. Amusa's gained quite a nice yellowish-tan, while Yarmin's got quite pale, his snowy skin giving him a more exotic appeal. </span></div></div>",

It won't take long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys nodded at her as they patiently waited for her to finish. During that time, Amusa asked Yarmin:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I know this is a bit of a weird question... but do you feel that something feels off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In what regard?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,... for starters does your body feels all right? I got some weird sensations today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As a matter of fact yes, but I think it is just us being a bit tired. We didn't get dizzy or felt sick, so I am assuming it is because of tiredness... or we suimply try to adjust to this climate...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough...\", replied Amusa, accepting the explanation for now. \"The other thing is about Hanzo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I have the feeling that I know quite a lot about him... Do you find it odd?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this question, Yarmin gave him a weird look. \"...I am afraid I don't understand what you mean with that. You of all people should know him best. I do know him just from that absurd trial that he gave us a while ago. I do not mind the end result, at all if I can add, but seriously, there had to be a better way to solve the problem than just agitating us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two were talking, their bodies continued changing. Their hips grew nice and fit as their rears now formed beautiful heart-shapes. Their trunks also chsnged as they lost their legs completely and became a pair of bikini bottoms. Their color also changed: Yarmin's were now baby-blue with white polka dots, while Amusa's rainbow pattern design was complete. Their shirts also became tighter as the material now resembled that of their swimsuits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Amusa wanted to ask about Yarmin's statement, Natsumi, who had just finished her call, turned to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what do you know? Looks like your friends had just arrived at the resort?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. My friend just told me she left them with Otome, one of the guides from the resort. We should go as well. We don't want them to wait, now do we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not. Let's go!\", exclaimed Amusa, with Yarmin giving a small sigh and a smile at his friend's excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsumi then revved up the engine, ready to go. With the boat suddenly starting, some water splashed the two boys on the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops. Sorry about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two were rubbing their eyes, they changed color. Amusa's brown eves became a bit darker, while Yarmin's green ones became a light blue. As they were on their way, a feeling was starting to from in Amusa's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder how Homuda is doing. I really want to see him. I am curious to see what he thinks of the resort.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A few minutes later, the boat reached a small gulf, with a tall white building at the shore. The very sight made Amusa and Yarmin have their mouth open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\"T-That's the resort?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, yes it is. Quite fancy, don't you agree?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fancy? More like futuristic. It looks like a place for rich people, not shinobi!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it is indeed a bit more modern than what you usually see, but I can assure you, it fits your needs perfectly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYarmin was still a bit sceptical about the resort, but right now, he was quite curious to see what would be awaiting them inside. While Amusa was feeling the same excitement, there was something that Yarmin said that bothered him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shinobi? What is that?... Oh right. Ninjas. But why did he brought that up. Well, Hanzo is a shinobi, so it makes sense to send us here... Wait. How do I know that? Something is really weird around here. Maybe Homuda would know what's up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, they reached the harbour in front of the main building. It was small and rustic, with some shops on it, giving the impression of an old port harbour. As Natsumi was docking the boat, the two boys aged up one last time. At the same time, their waists finished thinning out as they became toned as well. In the end, Amusa was now 16, and Yarmin 18.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter docking the boat, Natsumi and the two boys walked along the small harbour. The boys wanted to look around more, but decided to wait until they would meet up with their friends. While walking, Yarmin was a bit lost in thought, which drew Amusa's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something the matter Yami-san?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, nothing important Asusa-san.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure? You don't look too thrilled about the resort. Do you still feel a bit uncomfortable about the vacation?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's not that. It's just.... I still must think what to say to Tiyabi-san.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I see. You still think you can't become good friends?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kind of...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. Me and Homuda-san would always fight each other in the beginning, so there is no need for you to overthink about it. Just talk to him just you talk to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure everything will be okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I am sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well... Thank you for your support.\", said Yami with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what friends are for, Yami-san.\", replied Amusa giving back a smile as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they were walking, their tops shrank further, now resting just below their pectoral region. Their color and design also began to match that of the bikinis as their backs started to disappear. The two boys also felt some discomfort in their backs so they pushed them in the front the bit to alleviate the pain. They didn't notice that they gave themselves permanent arches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they reached the main entrance, Natsumi told them: \"Now please wait here a bit until I go get Otome. It won't take long.\". The two boys nodded as she went inside, looking for her colleague.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

During this time, the boys' minds continued changing. Right now Tiyabi believed to be a genuine shinobi, which currently wasn't too far off the truth. But his initial excitement of the prospect was now gone, a more mature personality taking the place of the original childlessness. His memories also changed as well, being replaced with new ones that would soon fit his new persona. His hair also finished its' change as it became pure white as now covered his ears in an unkempt style.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHomuda's mind changed as well, forgetting completely about his earlier conversation with Tiyabi regarding the wish. His memories and personality also have gone through some adjustments, but while Tiyabi was now more determined to respect certain principles, Homuda's beliefs were now more open, believing more in the freedom of thought than just acting on someone else's morality. He still had some worries regarding Hanzo and some feelings of uneasiness about the situation that prompted him to feel that something is indeed wrong. This however didn't make him or anyone else notice that his now dark-brown hair grew to his back, or that miraculously it flew up in the air before being tied in a high ponytail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of talking, a woman appeared behind Otome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Otome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Hello Natsumi-san. Have you arrived already?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a couple of minutes ago. I hope I didn't let you wait too much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, we just arrived in the lobby not too much time ago as well.\". She then presented her friend to the boys. \"Homuda-san, Tiyabi-san, this is Natsumi-san, a really good friend of mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning! Nice to meet you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you too! Are you the ones that Asako brought?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes we are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She gave a call while we were on the sea to tell me that she dropped you two safely. Did you two arrive for long?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, only for a few minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. I brought your friends as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean Asusa and Yami are here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. Now can you wait here until I bring them over?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can go meet them...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is no need, please wait and relax. I am sure you are feeling a bit tired since you came this early, you can order some drinks as well if you like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Otome-san, we will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two decided to wait for their friends while Natsumi would go to bring them over. Meanwhile, their tops finished their change as well. The only thing left of their backside was now a thin line as the front shrunk to the point where they covered only the pectoral region. After the material hardened one last time, they became a pair of bikini tops that fiit the design of their bottoms: pure black for Homuda and white with yellow  accents on the top for Tiyabi. </span></div></div>",

Where are they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are right in the lobby waiting for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what are we waiting for? Let's go!\", exclaimed Asusa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike their friends, the two also experienced more mental changes. Yami, like Tiyali is almost done, with only a few details to be sorted out before he would become a true shinobi. His personality was also finished as he became a more calm and collected individual as well as more well-mannered. He gained quite a sense of justice and need to keep things under control as well. The original frustration at the situation was now gone, now being replaced with some apprehension and a bit of curiosity. His hair is now a dark-gray color of medium length, which became pent up slightly in the back by a white bow that has blue stripes on the ends that appeared out of nowhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsusa's mind was also nearly done changing, as a more open, friendlier and perkier personality started to take over. His memories were also nearly completed except for two instances: his relationship with Hanzo, which he began to question after some of his thoughts were now about him, and the shinobi thing which he found kind of odd and out of place in their earlier conversation with Natsumi. His now dark-brown hair went to his upper back before being styled in a ponytail by a white ribbon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir tops also ended their changes as well. They gained the same pattern as their bikinis: light-blue with polka dots for Yami and white with multi-color lines for Asusa, before becoming a pair of bikini tops, each tied in the front by a knot: like a ribbon for Yami and knot-like for Asusa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon they reached the lobby and on a set of couches near the windows, there sat a woman in her twenties with parted short blonde hair and next to her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Homuda-san!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? Asusa! You've come\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsusa and Homuda immediately met their gaze with Tiyabi on the side getting a bit surprised at their excitement before giving out a small sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the two got up to them, Asusa said with a smile: \"I was sure we would meet you sooner or later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did? Well I thought the same. Didn't you Tiyabi?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course we would've met with each other. It is not as if they would've left the island without letting us now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to agree with Tiyabi-san. It is not like...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be so stiff, you said you wanted to be a bit more laid back didn't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYami became silent at Homuda's reply thinking what to say next. Asusa just giggled on the side as Tiyabi got out snother sigh. As they were talking, their faces changed. Their cheekbones rose higher and their lips became poutier as their noses and ears shrunk and their eyes got bigger. When everything ended, they had all the face of beautiful young women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Yami realized something and turned to Tiyabi. \"Tiyabi-san, can I ask you something in private?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiyabi was a bit confused by the sudden request, but he complied. \"Sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two got some distance between them and their friends before they started to talk. With their minds already integrated for their new personas, their final changes started as their nipples grew larger more sensitive as small tingling sensation began to manifest in their groins. Meanwhile, Asusa and Homuda still had to wait a bit more before their last changes started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you what he wants to talk about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I have an idea.... But I wanted to ask you something. I felt that something feels wrong\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You too huh? Well I think this is a good time to ask I guess.\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After making some distance between themselves and their friends, Tiyabi and Yami stopped. Wanting to know why did they had to be alone to talk, the former asked: \"So what did you want to talk about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well.... I wanted to tell you ....\". Yami was having some problems as to how to tell what has been on his mind without giving the wrong message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, their chest began to slowly grow. The small mounds were currently A-cup breasts,  but they were nowhere near done, and slowly their growth rate started to accelerate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing Yami a bit flustered, Tiyabi inquired a hesitantly: \"Hey...  It's nothing embarrassing , right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?! Goodness, no!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just that... I wanted to apologize...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apologize? For what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".... Do you recall our first meeting when I said you were \"evil\" without having a proper knowledge about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I do. But if you want to apologize for that then it's okay. It was quite a while ago...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True... But ever since then, and especially after I talked with Asusa-san, I kept thinking about what truly means the word \"evil\". I realized soon that just because some are branded as Evil Shinobi that doesn't make them bad people... It is just as Hanzo once said: We are just people with different ideologies, but with the same sense of honor...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already apologized to Homuda-san before about the misunderstanding. He didn't paid too much mind to it because he and Asusa-san already have been through the same ordeal once before... But to you, a person which I didn't know and who never once committed a sin so grave as to be called\"evil\"... I apologize from the bottom of my heart for my mistake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiyabi was having now a rare moment of being completely left speechless. It is true that he felt a bit insulted by his comments before... but he never knew Yami regretted the act so much as far as to make such a heartfelt apology....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring their talk, their chests continued to grow, as their breasts were now around C-cups and continued growing. Their minds and pasts have already changed to fit their memories and were now on the last stretch to finish up the changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a bit embarrassed Tiyali told Yami: \"P-Please... Don't apologize like that. It was just a misunderstanding\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I went as far as to start a Shinobi Battle Royale against you and your school...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know..  But I began one as well against Homuda's squad as well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Regardless, that was for something else, not-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah... You are indeed as stubborn as thought...\", interrupted Tiyali. \"You had your turn to talk about the past. Do you mind if I say something as well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYami was taken by surprise by Tiyabi's interruption, but decided to stop talking to see what he wanted to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn their bikinis, their boyhoods started to get a bit smaller as their testes went their way up inside them. After they climbed all the way to their lower abdomens, they changed function, becoming ovaries.</span></div></div>",

Including the fact that my mother died at the hands of a yoma.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I do...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I also know that your parents died when you were young, and that Kurogane who became your caretaker and adoptive grandfather also passed away not that long ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is correct... Bu what does that have to do with...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you see it? We both became shinobi through ordeals that made us become who we are today. The past does hold a lot of painful memories, but within those memories we see the truth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Truth...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do not believe in fate, but I believe that what we have been through is a way to show us how shinobi live. I respect your ethic and beliefs and I know that you are doing your best in trying to honour their lives. The same goes for me and my mother. We are called \"Good\" and \"Evil\", but I realized that this is just a manner of speaking, we are all shinobi who have to live our lives for our beliefs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYami was stunned by how deep the statement was. He also found himself that there is indeed a lot in common between Good and Evil Shinobi, something which has been shown to him by Asusa and Homuda. While Tiyabi was talking, their breasts continued growing. They went do DD-cups but went past that size as well as they finished growing at a proud E-cup. Meanwhile, their small members continued to shrink now being invisible though the bikini's material.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Homuda and Asusa also had their trials in their past, which made them who they are today as well. I will never forget my time I spent with my mother before her death as I am sure you value the memories of your loved ones. I am really not mad at you for what you said before, now that I found out about your past.\". Tiyabi then stared Yami in his eyes. \"So please stop apologizing for something like this. We know that we aren't so different now and that we regret having our misconceptions we had in the past. That is why... I can see in you a friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeft speechless for a second, Yami closed his eyes and them grabbed Tiyabi's hands. This made him confused for a second before Yami spoke to him in a relieved voice:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see now... It is just as Asusa-san said. He and Homuda became good friends after overcoming their differences, but I thought we wouldn't be able to be friends due to our animosity which was a lot stronger than theirs. But Asusa-san assured me that there wouldn't any reason for us not to be friends. But it looks like it was all just in my head.\". He then held his friend's hands tighter. \"I also want us to be friends, Tiyabi-san. So let's try to do our first step today.\", said Yami with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, their boyhoods completely shrank away as their young womanhoods bloomed. With this their new identities were complete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl with her hands grasped tightly showed a rare smile and replied to her new friend: \"Yes... From now we are friends Yumi. And I would gladly have you so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Miyabi-san... But I think thee is still somebody we have to thank first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see what you mean. You're right. Let's go thank them properly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls then headed back to their friends.</span></div></div>",

I did have some weird thoughts regarding how we got on the island.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean? Didn't we got here by ferry? We ended however at the place where the tour of the island should start instead of the harbor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did we? My mind is a bit foggy about that part. Natsumi-san also said that, but I don't know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If she said so, then that must be it. I also have some problems remembering about what we did this morning, but I am sure we got here by ferry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see... What about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Firstly, there was this talk I had with Tiyabi about... a wish of sorts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A wish? What was weird about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't... actually remember, but it was something about a magician.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was it about someone he saw on TV? The the \"wish\" part was one of his tricks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so... But I feel that it could've been something different...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can ask him again later, to clear things up if you want to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will try... but there is something else I wanted to ask you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too... On our way here with Natsumi-san, the conversation went to the subject of shinobi which I thought it was kind of out of place...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Shinobi? I wanted to ask if you know someone called Hanzo. Tiyabi kept mentioning him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Hanzo? That's.... Oh....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Asusa? What's... wrong....?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... suddenly feel... lightheaded.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do... too...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feeling happened at the same time the testes of their friends went up inside them, signaling some more mental changes for the two. Their thoughts about the odd sensations they felt so far were overwritten as their memories changed as well as their thoughts regarding Hanzo and shinobi. On their chests, their nipples widened and pinkened as some mass was starting to well up beneath them. This process continued as the boyhoods of their friends continued to diminish as their breasts grew past A-cups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think... it's starting to... go away...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...it's beginning to... fade...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen their breats grew to B-cups, the lightheadedness stopped... just as Yumi and Miyabi ended their changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was weird...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what caused them... So Homuda-chan, what did you wanted to talk about grandpa?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted to know more about this place. For regular shinobi to be here... it is a bit much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is true it is a bit more extravagant than what I expected, but I am sure he made this place for shinobi to relax.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But is it okay for me to be here? I am not attending a shinobi school anymore...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. Grandpa wouldn't have let you come if there was a problem... And besides, I wouldn't feel good here without you.\", said Asusa with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't say...\", said Homuda while scratching his cheek, which became a little red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, look! Yami-san and Miyabi-san are coming back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHomuda turned around to see their friends returning. Just then His' and Asusa's boyhoods started to tingle.</span></div></div>",

Everything went great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, mind telling me what is going on? What went well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yumi-chan was a bit afraid that she and Miyabi-san wouldn't be able to become good friends. But I told her that there is no need to worry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And right you were...\", said Yumi \"And there is something I want to tell the both of you as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should be thanking you two as well. It was as much of an inspiration for me as well.\", said Miyabi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What exactly did we do?\", asked Homuda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We wanted to thank you for showing us the possibility of bonds between Good and Evil Shinobi, and to show us just how strong these bonds can be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys were taken aback by the statement. It was true that their friendship was something unheard of in the shinobi world before, but they didn't expect someone to thank them for something like that. On their chests, their breasts grew one last time to D-cups as their boyhood were being pulled inside them, now being less than half of their original size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What do you mean by that?\", asked a slightly flustered Asusa. \"We became friends because we wanted so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Asusa is right. We didn't become friends to erase the barrier between the factions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We know that. But it is indeed an eyeopener for us. We both had such strict morales and beliefs that we couldn't think that there was any friendship between you when we heard of it. But when I initiated a Shinobi Battle Royale, you immediately jumped in Asusa-san's help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not to mention that when I attacked you, you claimed you wanted to defeat Asusa first before meeting your end. This is proof that you are more than just rivals, you are friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... how did this help you become friends?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I said before, your bond was an eyeopener for us. We wouldn've thought of something like this before. So we decided to follow your example.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And like you two, we don't do this to just break the barrier between Good and Evil Shinobi, but to be able to understand one another.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys didn't know what to say anymore. But just as they were ready to try and say anything, Otome, who left earlier to let them have their talk, interrupted them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am very sorry, but would Yumi-san and Miyabi-san come with me for a minute? There is something we have to talk if it isn't a problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two then left with Otome for the main desk as Asusa and Homuda were amazed by what they just heard. Their boyhoods were now just tiny nubs that were ready to go away, along with their old existences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't have guessed us becoming friends would mean so much...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You tell me. But let's be honest here... Who would've thought that just forming an alliance to take down Dogen would be our stepping stone to become friends?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is true. Although I think that it happened before that. When we were fighting each other, we both wanted to understand each other as well. I think that then everything started...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think so?... I guess you are right...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Homuda-san, can I say something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Sure.

I wanted to tell you how much I enjoyed our time togheter ever since we became friends. But since you are in hiding most of the time, we didn't get to spend that much time toghether, but I never found the right opportunity to say it. But since we were on the topic of our friendship, I thought this was the perfect opportunity... And also... I didn't want to feel embarrassed if I say it like that since you always say how great you are on your own...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Embarrassed?! By what?! Asusa, you are my best friend! I could never feel ashamed of you. I am also in your debt. If it wasn't for you, not only would I be under Dogen, but I wouldn't have been able to be more open in my thought... Not to mention you are a great warrior, so crossing blades with you is the best way to train, in my opinion. There, are you happy...?

I also think you are my best friend!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, the pulling sensation in their groin ended as a new reproductive system finished forming, making the two boys not only teenage girls, but also geniune shinobi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Asuka d-don't hug me like this! We are in everyone's sight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't matter Homura-chan! We are best friends forever, aren't we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is true, but please.

And I am sure they don't mind two girls showing their affection for each other?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-Don't say it like that!

It is kind of tiresome at times.... but I can't deny that I also enjoy it a bit...\", thought Homura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Yumi and Miyabi came back, with Homura barely being able to fully conceal her flustered expression from before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you finished?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes we are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did Otome-san wanted to tell you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She wanted to tell us that the swimming pool and the spa are ready for us to use.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes it is, but there is a small problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know where the others are?

They all wore their swimming trunks: black, dark-blue, white and red respectively and a white T-shirt which they all received as gift for coming to the resort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, breakfast wasn't all that great, but they sure know how to make some good pancakes.\", said Rick, while rubbing his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but you shouldn't eat too much, you don't want to get fat or anything.\", replied Zach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With how sporty we are we don't have to worry for this, besides we are about to go a great day in the water!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sucks that it really isn't much to do...\", said Matt with a small disappointment in his voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now be reasonable....\", said Matt with a small sigh. \"You know it was impossible for us to get on a luxury trip or anything like that.

You just tagged along with him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake was the type of guy who would bluntly say what is on his mind, except when he was bored and was willing to go with the flow sometimes to relieve his boredom. Matt was a bit more boastful than the rest of his friends usually trying to act so that would attract the others' attention. As for Zach and Rick, they weren't exactly the best of friends, but they were pretty similar in their tastes and preferences: sport, comic books, games and so on... only that Rick would often display a more childish demeanor and would act a bit more spoiled than Zach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way...\", interrupted Zach. \"Do any of you see Brandon or the others?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys then looked around, looking for their friends, but were surprised to not see anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that's weird...

Eric had jet black hair that was a bit unkempt, Brad had short blond hair, Mark had the same brown hair like his brother and May had a slightly lighter hair color than his cousin that reached her mid-back. They were all 8 years old, being one class lower than the rest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry it took so long. May had to style her hair.\", said Billy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't put the blame on me! You guys were the ones that had to go and find your shirts!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys were wearing the same white T-shirt like Blake and his group and all had matching black swimming trunks while May was wearing a one-piece pink swimming suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That aside...\", said Mark, trying to prevent a fight to erupt between the two. \"I don't see Brandon or James anywhere bro. Do you know where they are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark was like Zach, rather polite but also a bit more timid. Billy was a bit more introverted and would often complain if the others would do something stupid, at least in his eyes and would also try to avoid Matt since he couldn't stand his arrogant attitude at times. May was like Matt, really vocal and would often try to point out others' mistake, though without any trying to make people feel bad. Eric was the childish one of the group, often fantasizing about random things he thinks that are cool in his eyes. And speaking of that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think they went to the resort Blake wanted to go to.\". The others looked at him a bit weird before he continued. \"I see you brought your magic paper like I did. Now let's make the wish and go to them!\", he said while taking a piece of paper from his pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others, sans May were trying to decide if they should laugh or sigh at Eric's declaration. Blake face-palmed himself as Eric asked:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter? You don't want to go anymore?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, what's he talking about Blake?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it Eric...! A few days ago, me, Eric, Gabe and Tyler went to this magician's booth that Tyler found. He have shown us some magic tricks and at the end, he handed us some paper which he said was magic. He said that if we were to write down wishes it will come true. Me and Gabe wished to go to a fantastic resort like the one Matt described, and Tyler and Eric wished....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... To become ninjas! Just imagine how cool it will be! We could do all the crazy stuff ninjas do and have a fantastic vacation!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys began to snicker a bit, especially Matt, as Blake with a frown and a sigh told Eric: \"I told that this thing is not real! Do not believe everything that old man said!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you angry? You seemed really exited back there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before Blake was about to continue, May said loudly: \"I want to be a ninja on vacation too!\". This made Matt, Blake and Mark remain still for a second before she continued: \"If he says it's going to be real, than what are we waiting for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it's just-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blake, just make the wish.\", said Zach with a sigh. \"Just do them a favor, okay? It won't hurt anybody.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And knowing my cousin, she won't stop complaining until we do it\", continued Matt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake was really not in the mood to do something he thought was really childish, but knowing Eric, he knew he had to at least do it for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... All right, I'll do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks! Now take your paper and aim it at the sun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I really have to say that line?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Otherwise it won't work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two put their papers in front of the sun and yelled: \"\"Make the wish come true now!\"\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next instant, a bright light engulfed all of them before they disappeared. All that was left were the papers that just burned down in the Sun's rays.</span></div></div>",

On each and every side, there was just the blue ocean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-How did we end up here?!\", asked Blake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yoohoo! This is awesome!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome?! Where are we Eric?!\", yelled Billy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't it obvious? We are on the ship that will send us the resort Blake asked for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group turned their attention towards Blake, trying to get a better understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did you asked us to be sent?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I-I didn't.... I just said to send us to a really nice resort. I don't know where we are going right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-Then what are going to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Rick was starting to panic a bit, someone came up to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning.\". Everyone turned to see a foreign looking woman in her twenties with long black hair tied in a low ponytail, wearing a white T-shirt and black shorts. \"I was wondering where did you all go. If you wanted to go swim a bit you could've said.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um thank you...\". Blake was trying to think of a way to ask where are they going without looking like they are completelly clueless. If the wish was right, everyone should already know who they are and where are they going. \"I was wondering when we will arrive?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, we should  arrive at Hanzo-sama's resort island ina two hours at max.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Private island....?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it is closed normally to the public, only a select few know about it. But since you are his guests I am sure there is no problem..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His granddaughter, Asuka-san and some of her friends arrived not that long ago as well. I am very sorry you all had to take a different ship than her, but it was due to the fact that she and her friends had some business to take care of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I see....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyways, the cafe is open right now and if you wait a few minutes, we will bring the towels and the rest of the equipment for the swimming pool. If you need my help, you can find me at the reception.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lady left leaving Blake to talk with the rest of what he's found out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A private island? Isn't that so cool?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does \"private\" mean? Is this Hanzo owning a whole island?\", asked May.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are we supposed to do?\", asked a slightly panicked Rick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well there are two options.\", said Zach calmly. \"We can either ask the lady where are we going exactly or...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can ask this Asuka girl.\", continued Blake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait... Why her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The lady wouldn't believe the whole magic paper thing, but she could if we could explain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what should we do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess we can relax. If this is a luxurt cruise that will take us to a fantastic resort, I am all for it.\", said Matt with a small grin on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...  Matt, you go with Rick, Mark, May and the rest while me and Zach ask the lady, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt and Rick nodded their heads as Zach came vlose to Mark and told him: \"Please listen to what Matt says while I am gone, all right? He is a bit stubborn, but he knows what he is doing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got it bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone sans Blake and Zach left for the indoor cafe to relax a bit as the two boys stood behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am a bit surprised you weren't against not having Rick with us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He will be fine. Besides, the two of us are already enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two walked inside as well, but unlike the others went towards the lobby. As they walked, something came to Blake's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait... Did that lady say Hanzo?... Isn't that.... Nah, it has to be a coincidence....\"</span></div></div>",

I can totally see why Matt would be stoked for this. Too bad that we came here through a wish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, I wanted to ask you something Blake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\". The two boys stopped for a bit as they began to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eric said that we are supposedly going to become ninjas which I find a bit odd since so far only your wish came true.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah... I wonder why it didn't work. We wrote all our wishes on the papers, so it strange.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe because it seemed really unlikely to happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But the resort thing wasn't unlikely? And I didn't say anything about a cruise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe the wish made a few changes to better fit reality. I mean going at a resort just because of a wish seems a bit too ridiculous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's true...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two were talking, they didn't noticed that started to grow a bit in height as their legs grew longer. Their skin also started to gain a yellowish tan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, but what about the ninjas? There has to be something about that part as well. I mean, even if it is a bit far-fetched it has to become true.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't know that yet. It probably couldn't work because a modern resort and ninjas wouldn't mix together. So I think the paper made real only the more likely wish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But aren't there supposed to be some modern ninjas as well? It is possible. And I don't mean the ones that Eric and Tyler told us about in those Japanese cartoons kind of ninjas. I mean more like people who scale walls, wield swords and throwing stars and move in the shadows?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... That could work... But they sound more like a sort of spies with weapons that are impractical to use to me. And I don't see how we are supposed to become ninjas in this situation. Even if this happens later, we can't just be like\"poof\" and we are suddenly masked warriors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir feet started to itch as bit as they began to grow slightly larger but delicate as well. Their calves also began to transform as muscle began to accumulate in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess it makes sense. Besides I doubt we have to do some sort of ninja training or something for this, because it has nothing to do at all with the vacation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly.... But there is something else that bothers me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\"</span></div></div>",

Did you wish to go to a private place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I just wished to go a modern and elegant place.I didn't say anything about being private. Maybe the wish simply changed some details like with the cruise. Who knows, maybe it will be a luxurious resort if that is the case.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe.... Say, what happened to the paper?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... don't know. I looked for it when we got here, but I couldn't find it. Either it was left behind at the camp or it just vanished.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's unfortunate... I hope that Asuka would help us. From what I understood she is the owner's granddaughter. Hopefully she will understand our situation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope she does, although... I have my doubts....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's worry about that later. Now let's go to the reception.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake nodded as they continued to walk. In the meantime, their calves became stronger as they became toned and shapely. They grew in height a bit more as they both aged up to 11 years old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you ask for the lady's name Byali?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?... No... I didn't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Then I guess we have to hope we will find her there. It would be kind of awkward asking around the name of somebody we're supposed to know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the brief discussion, Byake was a bit confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did Zichu say my name wrong? Nah... It must be my imagination... But still, I wonder if the Hanzo the lady talked about is the same the old man said.... I must be overthinking it... It is an odd name but there must be somebody else with that name as well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe still had some questions regarding who this Hanzo might be, but for the moment he let it slide. As they were walking, their short hair began to grow as now they covered their ears. They also began to change their color, as Byali's started to lighten as Zichu's was going in the opposite direction as it darkened slightly. </span></div></div>",

Matt and Rick were \"appointed\" as the caretakers of the younger group and had to make sure that no one got lost or injured.... But Matt was a bit more preoccupied with what was on this ship and Rick was still a little panicked over the whole situation. Luckily, Mark was quite able to keep the others calm. His main worry was May, who he feared was way too naive and curious for his own comfort. Billy remained silent as he stood at the back of the group, not wanting to get too close to Matt, hiding his nervousness. Eric was more excited than anything else, hoping that they would hurry up and become ninjas as he was also interested in what awaited them on the ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of them noticed however that they began to grow in height the more they walked. It was subtle at first, but some differences began to appear. Billy, who was the second youngest after May was now almost as tall Rick and Matt. The boys' feet also changed, now being the same as May's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon they reached the cafe. It was nice and elegant, with some paintings on the walls, nice wooden chairs and tables and big counter in the front where they would serve drinks and desserts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! This place looks cool!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More like refined Eric. But don't mind.\", said Matt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It surely is elegant. This place looks like one of those French cafes you usually see in town.\", said Mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is really nice! I wonder what they have here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't know if we can buy anything May. We don't have any money....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't sweat it Rick. If all of this came from a wish, then I am sure we don't have to pay for anything. After all, if we are going to a private island of all things, I expect to be treated as guests here. There is no way the wish will pull a prank on us as to having to pay for all this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, chill. Let's enjoy the moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the side Billy was frowning a bit seeing Matt's attitude. \"I wish he would be less talkative, even more than Rick....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all they took a seat at the counter, waiting for someone to come to them. As they were waiting, their calves altered as muscle formed in them, as they all began to get a slight tan, some more than the others. </span></div></div>",

We don't know what do you serve.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about some really cool milkshakes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds great!\", exclaimed May.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right. Then please, tell me which flavor would you like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they were deciding, with a little help from the girl, they all grew taller once again, and this time they also aged up a bit. Mark, Eric and May were now 10 years old, but Billy was now the same age as Rick and Matt, being all 11. Another interesting aspect is that Matt didn't grow as much in height as Billy or Rick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way, I forgot to introduce myself. My name is Miki. What is yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt stood up a bit and named his friends: \"I am Mrast.

He did also that to himself...\". When he looked at the others, he was surprised to find them not reacting at the weird names. He then came close to Haye who was sitting next to him and asked her: \"Don't you think he called our names wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaye however shook her head as she replied back: \"No, Mrast said our names right. You probably miss-heard it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMasurk took a second to process this before asking himself: \"Did I hear it wrong?... But Mrast... Wait, why did I call him that?... Something weird is going on here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMasurk was distracted by his thoughts that me missed his brown hair staring to grow and lighten a bit. The other boys' did the same as Mirk''s got a shade darker, Illy's began to transition into a sandy blond and Mrast's hair began to turn dark purple at his roots. Surprisingly, Haye's was going in the opposite route. Not only did her roots were turning green, but her hair was actually starting to get a bit smaller.</span></div></div>",

The only ones besides them being a few women in some uniforms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sure is a private cruise if there is barely anyone here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No joke... Are we really the only people here? What was the reason for taking just us on the boat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we can ask the lady after she finishes talking with the others.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems like that is indeed our only solution at the moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two decided to wait until she finished so they began to talk more casual things while doing so. Byali wanted to tell Zichu about the whole magic paper thing, but was a bit surprised that he didn't even brought up the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's weird... Usually he would've asked what I know about the whole wish thing... Guess we should focus on knowing where we go first...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they were waiting, their felt some tension in their legs but they quickly dismissed the feeling as just a small numbness. In reality, their calves finished growing as their thighs began expanding as well with muscle and fat accumulating in them. Their hair also continued to grow as it now was around their chins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the other women left, Byali and Zichu came up to the front desk to talk to the lady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, excuse us...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Hello! Do you need to ask me something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... First of all, you didn't mention your name...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm so very sorry!

I am sorry for not telling you sooner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay. We're...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know who you are. Byali and Zichu, correct? I received the list of guests before you boarded the ship, so I knew your name already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys were confused by what they just heard. They didn't actually boarded the ship, they just popped on it because of the wish. But before they could inquire more, their memories began to change as some details about them getting on the boat... as well as the new names of their friends filled their heads. Nozomi then asked:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there something else you want to know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is something. Firstly, where exactly is the island?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The island is located about 150 miles away from Tokyo Bay. The climate is appropriate for the region with the temperature not exceeding 30 degrees Celsius during summer. The island is private and it doesn't appear on most maps. Only the select few know about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tokyo Bay? Like Japan?\", thought Byali. \"It sure is an exotic place. Happy that Mrast will be satisfied with something... It doesn't help much that it isn't on any maps. I think that looking for help there would be better than asking Nozomi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, their hands which rested on the table started to morph. Their fingers grew slimmer as their nails became longer as the rest of the hand became delicate and petite while staying strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is something else we want to ask you, if possible.\", said Zichu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. What do you want to know about?\"</span></div></div>",

What exactly do want to know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First off, how does he own the island? Is he that rich?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no.... He is quite famous so he was given money to buy and build a resort on the island. However recently he has retired from his main job and works as a sushi chef.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So he is famous?\", thought Byali. \"That means that it sure isn't the guy the magician told us about. He is a chef as well, although I think it is just a mere coincidence. I wonder what he worked as before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing their hands, their arms changed as well. They became long and slender, but maintained their power in the process. Their clothes began to change as well as the sleeves of their T-shirts vanished. However no one noticed anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to ask something as well.\", said Byali.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it just me, or there aren't much people around...? It is a bit big for just the ten of us and a few others.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's true... But we couldn't find another boat in time for you after your friends departed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We initially prepared a yacht for you to take to the island... But we didn't foresee how many of you would come, so there wasn't enough space. You stood behind as we came with the ship.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nByali was really confused by that, but was even more so when he noticed that Zichu didn't say a thing regarding what they just heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why isn't he saying anything? And what friends is she talking about...? Oh... I feel a bit dizzy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNew thoughts entered his head as several images began to form in his head. Four images appeared, but three of them were quite blurry. Only one was clear: a girl in her teens with with long brown hair tied in a ponytail, blue eyes and tanned skin... It was Homura... Zichu was also going through the same process, with Asuka, the owner's granddaughter being the only one clearly visible, though in his case, he was embracing everything that was changing,... something Byali would do the same from now on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this time, they grew in height and age once more, to 14 years old.. Their thighs finished their growth becoming strong and large, with an ideal distribution of muscle and fat to compliment their looks. Their hips went through a change as well as they began to widen. This has put some strain on their clothes as the shirts now revealed half of their stomachs and the trunks were getting really tight on them. But they changed as well as not only did they grew to better fit them, and the shirts became skintight as the material was starting to resemble that of the trunks. Their color also changed, with Zichu's starting to darken as Byali's was beginning to turn towards a lime green, with his shirt coloring in two different tones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that everything you wanted to know Yali-san??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Yes, that would be all.\", replied Yali, now completely calm after his mind changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am happy I could help. If you and Ichua-san would like to have a mineral bath, we have one available right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, but we need to return to the others....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am sure they are fine Ichua-san and are having a great time.. Let's have some fun as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right... I guess it wouldn't hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect. Now, please come with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys followed Nozomi out of the reception room as they made their way to the mineral baths.</span></div></div>",

Only Masurk was a bit confused over the whole name issue from before. But while initially he was trying to ask Haye about it and why does she thinks it was normal, the thoughts were gradually starting to fade from his head, as he began to accept the new names.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they were waiting, they continued changing, their calves became strong and toned as their thighs went through a similar process, gradually becoming thicker. Their hands also grew more feminine as the boys' now resembled Haye's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Miki finished and served them their shakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please enjoy guys!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome were really thrilled to try  while others were still anxious over the whole situation, hoping the milkshake would calm them a bit. After they all took a sip, they were all pleasantly surprised with how good the shake tasted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, this tastes awesome!\", exclaimed Masurk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am happy you like it. They all have been made with fruits that were bought from the market last night, so all should still be fresh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It does have a refreshing effect, now doesn't it?\", asked Eroac.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-It does...\", said Mirk back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It tastes really good... Do you like it Illy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I do. Thanks Mrast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the others were commenting on the flavor, Haye remained unusually silent, which made Masurk a bit confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter Haye? Don't you like it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. It tastes good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why aren't you excited for it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just a great tasting shake. It's not really a reason to yell to say you like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that's true.... but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer behavior was definitely odd. She would normally feel much more exited for good tasting food or drinks, but she seamed much more calm and collected about it. Masurk also noticed that the others were acting a bit strange as well. Eroac for instance was more mature in what he did as he stopped talking out loud or asking various questions about the stuff on the ship. Mirk... was still a bit panicky about the situation but seemed a bit more flustered with his words than usual, even stuttering at times. Illy still remained mostly quiet but he didn't seem as uncomfortable talking to Mrast as he now replied to most of his questions instead of trying to ignore them. As for Mrast himself, the arrogant tone in his voice that he usually has wasn't as present anymore as he became almost as quiet as Illy.... As for Masurk himself, there was indeed something different about himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did I felt excitd there for a second...? The shake tastes nice, but... why do I feel like talking how good it is...? Oh well, it isn't a bad thing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were all too absorbed drinking that they ignored the feeling that they were starting to sit on a cushion. That feeling was becasue that the more they drank, the more their rears were growing.</span></div></div>",

What about you guys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just want to look around the ship to see what's around.\", said Illy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess I'll tag along then...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want to Mrast...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a bit odd seeing Mrast and Illy wanting to spend time together, but strangely enough, nobody said anything. As they were talking, everyone aged up once again, this time with some age differences. Masurk, Haye and Mirk all aged to 14 years old Mrast and Eroac went up to 13 and Illy aged the most, to 15. The boys' thighs finished their growth, becoming nice and sleek as their hips started to follow. Haye went rapidly through puberty as her changes happened faster. She gained quite a well-developed figure as her breasts grew to about mid B-cups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir swimsuits were starting to feel a bit tight on them, but they adjusted to better fit their new proportions. The boys' shirts also began to crawl up a bit as the material began to get a bit more elastic. Haye's swimsuit split into two parts at her abdomen as the color began to transition from pink to a dark orange. Also, a snake tattoo formed on her left breast, currently being impossible to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing up, and thanking Miki for the shakes everyone decidd to split up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right. So me, Hiaye and Yoacu are going to the arcade.\" Miraki is going after Ichua and Yali and Murasat and Imly are going around the ship for a walk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is correct Katsurk.\", said Yoacu. \"I guess we should all meet on the front deck once we finish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like like a plan. Okay guys, later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, everyone went their separate ways for the moment.</span></div></div>",

It seemed like they had the effect of curing backaches, stiffness of the limbs and offered an overall rejuvenation of the body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This thermal bath must be quite popular if it has so many effects on the body...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is in fact one of the most demanded features of the ship for the ones that wish to spend most of the time relaxing. We plan to make another one as well as our current one only fits a bout 3-4 people at a time. By the way, do you wish to invite someone to come with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as the two were deliberating over who to invite, a voice echoed through the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yali! Ichua!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three looked in the direction of the voice to see Miraki running towards them. During his time looking for them, Miraki underwent more changes. His arms became slimmer and his hair started to darken towards a dirty blond as it grew to his shoulders. His swimming wear changed as well as his trunks was starting to change their colour from red to yellow as it began to shrink as his shirt, while staying white, also began to develop some blue lines over it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miraki? Why are you here? Did something happen?\", asked a slightly concerned Ichua as the boy was catching his breath after running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No.. Everything is f-fine... B-But I need your help...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stuttering in his voice was very apparent, but neither Yali, nor Ichua noticed anything wrong with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What exactly do you need our help for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was wondering if you w-would help m-me find something...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, we'll help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Really Yali?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But only if you come with us in the thermal bath first.\", said Yali with a smirk on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNozomi explained the details about the bath as Miraki stood and listened about what was it about. In the meantime, Yali's and Ichua's butts began to inflate, making their swimwear even tighter on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oh I see... I-It does sound quite appealing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, are you joining us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes... I think I-I will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect.\", said Nozomi with a broad smile on her face. \"I can assure you all that you will enjoy it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three smiled and nodded as Nozomi lead them inside. Their hair continued go grow a bit longer as now it reached the upper-backs as Ichua's and Miraki's continued to darken and Yali's to lighten.</span></div></div>",

There were a few showers on the side as well for people to wash when they were done and to cool off as well as a few racks of towels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know it doesn't look that spectacular but trust me, the feeling is one of a kind. Now please hop in as I make the preparations.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three stepped in the bathtub as Nozomi was adjusting the settings for the Jacuzzi. It didn't bother any of them to take off their shirts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you said you wanted a mineral bath, so please wait a few minutes. I already turned it on, and you should be feeling the effects soon. People stay about 20 minutes, but you can turn it off if you want to. I'll let you enjoy it now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNozomi left the room letting the three boys relax in the warming water. Soon, the minerals kicked in and the thee let out some pleased sighs at the feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She wasn't lying... It feels great...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... It is very relaxing indeed...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-It feels like a massage almost....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sure does...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the three were enjoying the bath, they changed further. Their hips finished their growth as their rears were also nearly done, the mass pushing them towards the surface a bit. Their swimsuits changed as well as they were now barely covering their thighs as their color shifted once again. Ichua's was now mostly black as Miraki's was now completely yellow with some brown spots appearing on them as well. Yali's was the one that changed the most however as besides the fact that it was now a lime green with some lighter stripes on it as well, but some material was sprouting from the top, starting to cover the rest of the suit. It was half the same lime green and half white, with a line with the opposite color forming around their edges. Their shirts didn't change as much, with the exception of them residing just above their waists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey also aged again, growing in height as well, with Miraki being the tallest now. Miraki and Ichua were now 17 and Yali was now 15.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I wanted to know... How were the two of you doing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you ask Mirakio?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was j-just curious....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, nothing is different for me than the usual. I was harvesting bean sprouts yesterday, so I guess they should grow by the time we go back...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure like your bean sprouts Yoali-san...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's because they are very nutritious Ichuaga-san. Not to mention they are really cheap and easy to prepare...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I remember the times we ate them when we were small Yoali-san... I am still surprised y-you like them... But I-I am happy you can make them taste so nice. I-I never thought they could be so good...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe... Well I am very knowledgeable about bean sprouts... How about I make you one of my new recipes Ichuaga-san?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I would be delighted...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a bit amazing to see that a talk about bean sprouts was making them closer, but to them, having a good subject to talk about was enough to have them enjoy their time together.</span></div></div>",

Since there wasn't anyone but themselves and a few employees from the resort, there was plenty of choices for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa! This place is cool!\", exclaimed Katsurk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were about 5-6 arcade machines on either sides with plenty of traditional games as well such as air hockey and a pool table. Also, in the back of the room there were 3 flat-screen TVs, each hooked-up to a different gaming console and a stack of games on the side of each one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodness... I didn't think there would be so many...\", said Yoacu, surprised by the big variety of games in front of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... It is much bigger than I thought as well...\", continued Hiaye in a more monotone tone, while still having a bit of surprise in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the three were looking around, some more changes happened. First the boys' arms became slimmer but stronger, especially for Yoacu's whose arm strength was much bigger than either of his friends. Next, their hair changed their color again. Yoacu's whose initially didn't change much save for getting a bit more voluminous was now having its' roots turn from jet black a dark-blue color. It also didn't grow much as it just covered his ears but it did become a lot smoother as his locks were straightening. Katsurk's continued growing up to his shoulders as it became a dirty blond color, as Hiaye's hair was now just below her shoulders as the green color was spreading from the roots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so what should we play? I am really excited for this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't know you were a big gamer Katsurk-san.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not, but I like playing a few whenever I feel like it. Do you play game Yoacu?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not really. I sometimes play board games with Yumi-san and the others, but never too often.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That seems rather boring...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, that's rude Hiaye-san!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me on this. Until I met Katsurk, I wasn't that much into games myself. But after that, I played once and I started to like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really? Do you have a console?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do, but please don't tell Homura. She likes fighting games a lot and sometimes goes to an arcade just for those. I do not want her to buy games for herself and then to take over my console just for her to say we must share it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of them noticed that Yumi and Homura, two people they shouldn't know at the moment, were brought into discussion, or that Yoacu who was once an avid gamer said he didn't play any games before. And on top of that, Hiaye who disliked them ,was now seemingly into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they talked, their hips finsihed growing as the boys' bottom halves now matched Hiaye's. Also, Katsurk's legs became a bit stronger, almost looking like they wanted ro rival Yoacu's arm strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a small grin on his face, Katsurk asked Yoacu: \"If you haven't played any games before, then how about we play one right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? You mean it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, just pick one that looks interesting. You can choose any console as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoacu was feeling a bit nervous, but decided to look in the game selection. </span></div></div>",

But I am not sure there is a way to play together...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am sure there is a multiplayer. Now let's but the game in and let's have a blast!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the they were setting the game and making themselves comfortable on some bean-bag chairs, their swimsuits changes again. The trunks lost a lot of leg cover, being around their upper thighs as the color changed as well: as the black lightened quite a lot becoming white and light-pink for Katsurk and Yoacu respectively. A pattern was forming on them as well as some blue stripes were starting to form on Katsurk's andsome white dots on Yoacu's. Their shirts shrunk a bit more, now being above their stomachs. Hiaye's swimsuit became fully a dark-orange as some brown spots were emerging from it as well. The top split a bit in the middle as a triangle formed above her cleavage as the material crawled to the middle of her neck as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter plugging in the game, the three looked a bit on the rules of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we must defeat enemies as we complete certain objectives at the same time. And there are also some secret conditions as well... Man, it really is a lot more than just beating a mob of enemies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sure is... What do you think Hiaye-san?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks interesting... Definitely a game I haven't played before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, me neither. Well, there is a start for everything. Let's pick a stage and see how good we do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three decided to let Katsurk and Yoacu go first. They both then picked their warriors. All of them were quite surprised by the big variety of playstyles, and took a while to decide on who to pick. As they were deciding, they aged up again. Katsurk and Hiaye aged up to 17 years old as Yoacu went to 15. The boys' rears finished their growth, forming really nice heart-shapes as Hiaye's figure continued to develop as her breasts almost doubled in seconds, being now large C-cups as together with her hips and legs, had almost the appearance of a model.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I will settle with this one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why a spear fighter Yozacua?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, he kind of resembles Mirakio-san in terms of using a spear. What about you Katusari-san?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if we are going to go with playstyles that resemble our friends, then I will go with the dual-wielding sword guy. It resembles Asuka's style a bit, so I think he will do. I wanted to go with someone that resembles Ichuaga, but the guy who fights with a katana looks a bit too scary for my liking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. Did you find a warrior you like Hiyage-san?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did... But I will keep the surprise for when it is my turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, let's start already. I am really curious how this works.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey then started the game. It didn't bother them that their current personalities were almost polar opposites of their original ones... Almost as if this was the way they were...</span></div></div>",

The two weren't specifically looking for something, but decided to check out the ship to see what was around. Despite his initial dislike for him, Imly began to grow more patient and respectful around Murasat... but there was something that confused him quite a bit recently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Murasat, why are you staying behind? You can come closer if you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just... wanted to give some space... Is there a problem?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, not exactly... And why are you speaking so quietly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am sorry....I wanted not to make much noise...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it's not a problem...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMurasat, who normally would be quite talkative and try to boast about his knowledge about things that he saw before and others didn't was now actually quite meek. Not only that, but his confidence was slowly evaporating, acting even more shy than Mirakio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is he acting like that?\", thought Imly. \"I do not mind him not talking as much, but still... It is a bit worrisome. I wonder if something happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two were walking, their hair grew once again. Murasat's purple roots began to spread as his hair was now around shoulder-length as Imly's turned completely into a sandy-blonde as it was now down to his chin. Their swimsuits also changed a bit as black trunks started to turn dark-green as Murasat's was turning purple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more minutes of walking, the two came across an open door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's odd... I wonder if someone if someone forgot to close their door.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-Can I... Can I go inside for a moment?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?! Why would you need to Murasat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel like like... there is something inside... that belongs to me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImly took a few glances around before replying back: \"All right, you can go inside, but only for a moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you... Can you come with me as well...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I must...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two then entered the room. It was a decent size, with two big beds next to each other and plenty of space in the room as well. On the side, there were some luggages that were partially packed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what exactly are we looking for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... You will see when you find it...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImly was a bit dubious about that statement, but decided to look around nonetheless. As they were searching, their arms slenderized as they became as toned as their legs. There was also something that bothered Imly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is my vision blurry all of a sudden? Did I get some dust in my eyes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Found it!\", exclaimed Murasat suddenly.</span></div></div>",

What was a bit odd about it was that it had some make-up on its face: some lipstick and eyelashes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is what you were looking for?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... I was wondering where he was... But I am happy to see him okay...\", said Murasat was embracing the toy as he jumped on a bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImly was really speechless at seeing Murasat of all people hug a weird-looking teddy bear. As he was about to comment on it, some thoughts entered his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why does he... always hug that thing? I know it is dear to him, but... there is no need to consider it a real person...\", thought Imly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs this was going on, they aged up once more: Murasat to 15 and Imly to 19. Their roles seemed to have completely switched between themselves, but they thought that everything was natural. Their figures developed as well as their hips and butts finished their growth. What was more curious was that Murasat, despite being younger seemed to have much bigger proportions not only than Imly, but more so than the other boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir swimsuits changed further as their legs started to vanish as the coloring took some modifications as well. Imly's was becoming multiple shades of dark-green as it looked almost like a camouflage color, while Murasat's was gaining some white spots on it as it began to grow some lace around the edges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you need to take him with you Murasati? It-He was safe here anyways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone could've come in our room while we were away and could've taken him Imy... The door was open...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was... I have to tell the receptionist that there could be a problem with the lock. They made it having these key cards they have given to us as a way to unlock them... Maybe it didn't register it as we closed it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMurasati noticed that Imy was rubbing his eyes constantly which made him open a drawer and give him a pair of glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thanks. I don't know how I forgot these here to begin with...\", said Imy, seeing better now thanks to the glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMurasati then handed Imy a pair of black scrunchies to tie up his hair as he took a black ribbon that he promptly putted on top of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Say Murasati, do you want to go outside and swim a bit as we wait for the others?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We must...? I kind of want to sleep?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the middle of the day?! No, way, you have to get outside as well. You can't just spend all your time in your room with Bebeby and on your computer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the two left, and this time made sure to lock the door properly, they headed outside, to the pool. What was initially an awkward relationship between the two bloomed as time went by. While they still had a few disagreements over certain things, undeniably a strong, almost familial bond was emerging between the two.  </span></div></div>",

It sure was a long time since I last felt so relaxed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Me too... I-I think effects that Nozomi-san told us about are actually true... I-I was a bit doubtful a bit at first, but not anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This proves that the mineral bath is an efficient way to heal your body. I totally approve their idea to make more on the ship.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three talked a bit more about the bath as they took out some towels to dry themselves up. They didn't thought it was odd for them to still have their shirts on and not be bothered by how wet they were. That was because they changed to match their bottoms. Their trunks finally lost their legs as they tightly held their large hips and their newly-formed bubble-shaped rears. Their color transition finished as well: pure black for Ichuaga, yellow with brown leopard prints on Mirakio and lime green with some darker green stripes for Yoali. The latter also gained an additional layer over the his swimsuit as a two-layered skirt that was the same material as the swimsuit strapped over it. Right now, they were without a doubt wearing bikini bottoms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir shirts, after losing their sleeves began to lose a lot of their material as they were now resting only below their pectoral region as the color started to change to match that of the bikinis. But that didn't happen for Mirakio as opposed to turning yellow, the shirt was actually turning a dark-blue with some patches of white still remaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir hair has also grown longer in the time that passed. They were all at their mid-backs as their color finished changing: black for Ichuaga, light-blond for Yoali and dark-brown for Murakio. As Murakio was styling his hair into a side ponytail using a red ribbon he found on the counter next to the towels, he asked Ichuaga:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I am sorry to ask so suddenly, but I-I was wondering... How are you and your brother these days?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's true... I haven't ask you that in a while myself. Do you two get along better?\", asked Yoali, as he put a green hair clip in his hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... me and Murasame... haven't talked with each other in a while... but last time I met him, most of the envy and distaste in his voice was gone... Actually, he seemed much more reserved than before...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is he still upset about the whole family lineage thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think he is angry more at himself rather than me... but he decided to let me go down the shinobi path as he had begun making preparations to take over father's company. He doesn't have the skill to become a shinobi... but he is really capable of leading the company.... I am happy for him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the moment, Ichuaga had now another family, with Murasame being his brother rather than Katsusari. Not that they could be seen as siblings given their really different appearances. He still cared a great deal for him... and he considered him like a sibling even if he wasn't one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... I-I am sorry to interrupt, but would you two come with me to my room a bit?\", asked Murakio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-Is something the matter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I can't find something and I want your h-elp if I can to find it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\"Sure. Of course we'll help.\"\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMurakio smiled at his friends' reply. After Yoali turned off the jacuzzi, they all left the bath to Murakio's room. </span></div></div>",

There aren't many people around, so I-I thought it wouldn't be a problem to let it open.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. And it would be kind of problematic to take it with us while we are in our swimsuits. I left mine at the reception.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three went inside to see two large beds one next to each other with a few organized stacks of clothes on one of them as well as some pieces of luggage that were half-done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what exactly are we looking for?\", asked Ichuaga while coughing a bit afterwards. He alongside his friends were feeling something in their throats as their voices started to rise in pitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You will see when you find it. I-I'll look under the beds. Y-You please look in the drawers and the closet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis friends were a bit confused at what would they be looking for, but decided to look at what it would be first, seeing that Murakio was unwilling to tell them yet. As they were looking around, their waists compressed as their backs curved to better fit their anatomy. After 5 minutes passed, their waists were small and waspish with some muscle still being prominent as well. Soon, in a drawer, Yoali found something inside and gave out a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this what you were looking for?\", asked Yoali, showing the others a scary-looking mask with yellow horns and fangs, a monstrous face and a patch of black hair on the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! There it was!\", exclaimed Murakio as he rushed over to Yoali and picked up the mask and put it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Now everything is fine.\", said Murakio in a deeper, more threatening voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis friends sighed as the feeling of something clogging their throats was gone. As a result, all of them, even Murakio had now much higher-pitched voices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you simply wanted us to find your mask, you could've sait it, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... We thought you said you would try to leve it behind during the trip to try to boost your morale.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... said that. But I wondered: \"What if something comes up and I will need my mask?\" It could scare away people or animals that are getting too close.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But the whole idea was to get others closer to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... Right... I... forgot about that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does Yozacua-san know about this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She does... He sighed when I told him that I am bringing over the mask.... But I just... feel a lot more comfortable with it. I can't help it.\", said a slightly dejected Murakio as he sat on his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing him down, Yoali and Ichuaga nodded to each other and decided to sat next to him on the bed.</span></div></div>",

It is true that you feel scared of others whenever you encounter them without your mask, but you fail to talk to them properly because you believe the mask in the only way to speak with them.\", said Ichauga softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is true, but... This mask, it gives me courage... strength and confidence. I do not know if I can talk to others properly without it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been with you since the beginning. You've always hid your face to comfort yourself when others treated you badly. But whether if it was a paper bag or and ogre mask, you always gained more confidence if you covered up your face. Why is that? You are beautiful and strong. You don't need to hide anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they were talking, their faces rounded up and became softer as their eyes changed color. Murakio's green eyes got a shade darker, but nothing more than that. Meanwhile, Ichuaga's brown eyes became dark blue and Yoali's blue became green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what are you saying Yoali, but... This mask is also a gift from Grandfather Kurogane.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I was little, he gave me this mask to try to make me feel a lot braver when I wore it. Soon, I found that I had a lot of confidence just by wearing it, so from that day, except a few instances, I never walked outside the school without wearing it. It is something that came from grandfather, so I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then wear it as a charm instead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you do not want to part with it I understand. I would feel as well if it was something precious to me. But wear it not as a means to hide yourself, but as a reminder of what you have accomplished.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMurakio was amazed by Ichuaga's words. It is true, the mask is something he will never discard and he never had the courage to not to wear it... but what if he just had it as a talisman that have him hope and courgage. Kurogane told him before, that one day he would need to stop wearing the mask, but he never said he had to discard it.... It was something that never crossed his mind so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile pondering, they grew up to their final age: Yoali to 17 and Ichuaga and Murakio to 18. Their tops changed further as well as they lost their backs and were now clinging to them just by two small straps of material that held them on their shoulders. As the color was also near completion, Yoali's also gained a few fills at the edges specifically on the top part which gained a large patch of white material. His skirt bottom also finished growing, covering his bikini and the top of his legs before fusing with the swimwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Icharuga is right Murakimo. You can't just deceive yourself that you need to wear it just to protect you. Like I said before, you do not need to hide yourself from anyone. If the mask is important to you, I understand, but don't wear it as an excuse not to fear others' rejection. We have spend our childhood togheter, so of course I know that you did the same before. It is time to move forward now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I....I see.... Thank you, Icharuga, Yoli. I really appreciate what you just said. I feared that I will lose grandfather's memory by not wearing the mask. But in reality, I was just trying not to get hurt.... I will try not to wear it today. After we land, I will... try and take it off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am happy to hear that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... Me too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two then hugged Murakimo and shared a moment of silence before Murakimo remembered something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I almost forgot. Weren't we supposed to go and meet the others at the pool?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right... We should go now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three then left the room togheter and headed towards the pool. The three haven't changed too much in terms of personality, but whatever was happening to them, surely have made them a lot closer.</span></div></div>",

As they were playing, she continued changing. Her bottoms became a pair of bikinis as the top finished morphing, with a big black line serving as the ends of her top on the sides. The color also finished changing as it became dark-orange with brown spots all over it, almost like a giraffe pattern. Below the end of her top, a few more snake tattoos formed on her neck, but like the one on her breast it couldn't be seen at the moment. Her hair, which was now mostly green now barely touched her shoulders as two unruly bangs were now framing her face. Being a girl, meant that her tansformation was quicker, so she should finish up soon...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, this game is more difficult than I thought...\", said Katsusari, in a slightly higher pitched voice, as his character almost got hit by an enemy general. \"I thought we just had to run on the battlefield and attack the enemy, but all these missions they give us makes it much harder...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed... I am quite surprised they managed to make a game to keep you this focused on the task at hand.\", continued Yozacua, again in a higher voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sure doesn't make you feel bored...\", said Hiyage in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two had to defend their base before launching a fire attack on a big group of enemy ships which had been tied together as a part of a plot. Then they ran along the hips defeating enemy generals as well as helping their allies. Katsusari managed by accident to unlock a secret winning condition by telling an enemy officer to retreat, which in a way scored a few more points for him. But the stage was nearly over as both headed to finish up the boss of the stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they were playing, their trunks ended becoming bikkini bottoms: white with blue stripes for Katsusari and pink with white dots for Yozacua. Their shirts also lost their backs and were starting to shrink further, showing a lot of theri chest region as the color was starting to match that of their bikinis. Their hair also ended their transition. Katsusari's long blond hair flowed all the way to his mid-back as a blue headband with a ribbon on either side formed on top of his head. Yozacua's became dark-blue that was styled in a bob-cut as a cherry blosson flower formed on the left side of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as they finished this session of changes, Katsusari managed to defeat the boss as a quick cinematic movie played after they finsihed the stage, with the officer Katsusari spoke to appearing at the end to meet the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, who do you think won?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you did Yozacua. Wou had almost 100 more people KOed than me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, but... You defeated the boss and you were the one that unlocked the special condition, so I think you won.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woohoo! Great!\", exclaimed Katsusari as Yozacua gave out a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir personalities did a complete 180 degrees from what they once were at this point. Hiyage, who would often be much more energetic and perky became quite cool and downright calm person, who didn't show much emotion. Yozacua, who one would act childish and quite hyperactive was now not only well-mannered and pacient, but also seemed to act as the voice of reason. And Katsusari was now a lot more fun-loving and competitive as he decided to take a more direct appoach on things then he would ever have done before... and not to mention that at times would steal glances at Hiyage'chest from time to time. Not to mention, that right now, he and Icharuga were no longer siblings, but he didn't bother about this, since in his mind, they never were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... are we going to play a game as well Katsusari?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bet we will Hiyage! Game on!\"</span></div></div>",

Like before, they had a few characters to pick from, all of them different than the ones from before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh... So we have three new guys, plus the one we recruited last stage... I think I will go with this wild-looking guy that wields a... Is that a polearm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it is called a voulge. Grandfather Kurogane mentioned it in one of his lessons in weapons.\", said Yozacua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Figures you would know something like that. So which one are going to pick up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiyage looked a bit at the screen before making his choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take this one.\" The character she picked was shorter man than the others with a big hat and his face covered up, with his weapon being a what looked to be some sort of fan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Why him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He looks interesting.... And I want to know how he fights...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And he is the one that linked the ships in the previous fight...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Wait... Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that you mention it, he is... I never noticed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see things differently when you are a spectator. And that doesn't apply just to games.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys were quite surprised at Hiyage perception and silently nodded to themselves to that as well... in games and training...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stage began as the two began to fight the enemies near the camp. In this time, they all had to rub their eyes as they itched a bit. Unbeknownst to them, their eyes changed color Katsusari's brown eyes became a greenish-blue as Yozacua's light-blue eyes became dark-blue. Hiyage's was however the most prominent as her brown eyes not only became amber but also slitted. Also, on her left hip, another snake tattoo formed, but despite being visible, no one noticed anything being different. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the battle progressed, Hiyage noticed something strange and decided to go on another path than the one he was instructed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are going the say way as me? Weren't you supposed to go the other way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is something that I must confirm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter defeating a few more enemies, they reached a garrison in which Katsusari went to the next section of the map as Hiyage looked a bit around... and saw a ladder on the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bingo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter climbing the ladder, suddenly, an ambush unit appeared out of nowhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Where did they come from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I thought... There was no way they would just leave a portion of the map so unguarded...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys were amazed by her tactful insight, but Katsusari had to continue playing. After making short work of the ambush, Hiyage continued fighting with her unti on the side of the map as Katsusari continued the assault from the center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the fight, Katsusari stole a few glances towards Hiyage, especially towards her chest. Her breasts grew to a large and proud D-cup as the split section of her top became a square which revealed a fair amount of her cleavage. But Katsusari didn't notice that and was almost hit by an officer after looking too much in a different direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at the game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oh. Sorry.\"</span></div></div>",

They had to rescue their commander and had to deal with a surprise attack in front of the enemy base, but their efforts combined really eased everything a lot. After defeating most of the enemies inside the enemy's castle they reached the final boss and the one who finished him off... was Hiyage. Afterwards, a small clip in which they shown the people accepting their commander as new ruler of their land with Hiyage's character, watching from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I think it is obvious. You beat the boss and you unlocked the secret condition. You had definitely won, Hiyage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sure was an entertaining game though. The others must get a load of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... I am sure Yumi-san would be interested in such a game as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know Homura would be....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter complimenting the game, Katsusari took a look at Hiyage. But this time, he didn't look at her impressive bust, but rather admiring her. A single, simple earring appeared on her left ear as one last tattoo formed on her left shoulder. Lastly, her hair became completely green and her face gained a slightly sharper expression despite her stoic and emotionless behavior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I've always envied you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Why?\", asked the girl a bit intrigued by the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To start off, you always keep your cool in battles. That is why you beat me so bad the first time we met. You were always calm, which made you a lot better that ever once before that. I know I told you need to put more passion and emotion when fighting, but you always look so collected that makes me think that being more observant than just rushing in, like what you do, should be the way to go...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatsusari looked down as he knew that he just said something that goes against his principles, but he decided to say it anyways. Yozacua was also silent after his friend's comment. The same thing happened during his battle with Katsusari, as he rushed in to end the fight quicker rather than being methodical, but he eventually defeated him in combat in their second fight. It was really close, but Katsusari won by a hair in the end.... But it seemed that he still doubted himself over his battles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they were pondering, the boys' faces changed, becoming more rounded and softer as their eyes also did the same. They also felt a tightening in ther necks, but ignored the feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiyage gave out a sigh, as she put her hand on Katsusari's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are saying that as if it has relevance?\". Katsusari immediately looked at Hiyage as she continued: \"Being calculated in battle is one thing, but not taking action is something else... You always have been the first out the gate to fight, and have always given 110 percent when others would just enter the fray just to aid others instead of doing something themselves. And that applies to life as well. You enjoy every day with all your heart and never think that something is monotone and repetitive. I was bored of this world and only did what I was instructed what to do... but you ignited a flame in me when we fought that day... A flame which despite being small, still burns brightly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys remained silent, letting her finish as Katsusari was now really eager to know what she thinks. In the meantime, the aged up one last time. Katsusari went up to 18 years old as Yozacua went to 17. Their waists slimmed down quite a lot as they became toned. Their backs also went into a permanent arch, giving them much better flexibility. Lastly, their vocal chords tightened as their voices became those which befitted girls their age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiyage however, with her aging up to 18 years old, and her body growing a bit bigger in her chest and butt as well as tanning a bit more, finally finished her change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... And that is why I am grateful to you. Thank you for reminding me to live your life with passion, Katsusagi.\", said the girl with a rare, small smile on her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking a second to process the information, Katsusagi blushed a bit and scratched his cheek as he replied back: \"T-Thanks Hikage... Although, all I did was to fight you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was more than enough. And I would like to fight you again soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean a sparring match? I'm in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the side, Yozacua looked at the two interact and gave out a peaceful smile as he slowly closed his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you silent Yozakua? Are you feeling lonely?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Huh? No I'm not!\", said the boy with a small accent in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say so... Well, it's time we head back. As much as I would like to keep playing the game, we have to meet the others.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others nodded as they turned off the console and left and arcade. Katsusagi got closer to Hikage and slyly asked her while performing a grabbing action with his hands. : \"Well, if you are grateful to me, do you mind if I ask for a reward?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a monotone voice, Hikage replied: \"Maybe later...\"</span></div></div>",

We should return back to our room....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Murasati, you are not a ghoul or a vampire. Stop complaining, it is getting tiresome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am sorry... If you are upset than I can leave....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not upset. But please understand.... I just want you not to be so secluded.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMurasati meekly walked alongside Imy as the latter sighed and thought to himself: \"Why is he so fragile? I have been harsh with him before, but he should know by know that I don't want to actually hurt him... I just wish not to feel like is a burden... I wish Miyabi would be here to support me on this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two were walking, their waists began to compress, Imy's much more than Murasati's. Their shirts have alos gone up to just below their pectoral region as their neckline plunged a bit on top of that. Lastly, their color and started to match that of their bottoms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, they reached the outside pool, which at the moment was empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Murasati, let's go for a swim.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I don't think Bebeby would want to take a bath yet...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just leave him on the sunbed, nobody will take him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please Murasati, just leave him for a few minutes and swim a little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...\" Murasati was unwilling to let Bebeby out of his grasp but realized that he would make Imy upset if he resused. So he decided to make a compromise this time. After he carefully let Bebeby on a sunbed beneath an umbrella, he walked together with Imy, who put away his glasses to the edge of the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImy jumped in the water as Murasati went down using the pool's ladder. The pool wasn't too long or deep, but it was without a doubt longer than the one you would find at a regular school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The water isn't too cold is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... it is all right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So is there something in particular wyou wan to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just the float stance... But using the arms as well this time...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere weren't many swimming styles Murasati knew, so Imy decided to go with whatever choice he made. The two went into position and after pushing the wall with their feet, they began to swim. As they were moving, their hair, which was floating in the water finished changing. Imy's became a light-brown color, as the wair grew a bit through his scrunchies, as the portion that was not held grew to his upper back as two long bangs were now framing his face. Murasati's became completely purple as it continued to grow more and more. It finally stopped once it was at his rear's level, the boy now having a beautiful mane of hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile swimming, the two each wanted to ask the other some questions, but at the moment, neither of them knew what to say.</span></div></div>",

Imy was going much faster than Murasati who was now just slowly striding through the water. As they swam, their trunks finished becoming bikini bottoms: Murasati's were purple with white dots adorning them while Imy's was now a camouflage-green color. Also, as water splashed over their faces, they softened and rounded out as their eyes became bigger. Imy's became a few shades darker of green than his usual ones, while Murasati's blue eyes became a really dark purple, even more so than his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey however were lost in thought, and the changes went under their radar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I too stubborn?\", thought Imy. \"It is true that I am trying to make him more open to the others and less like a hermit, but... Is my approach too forceful? I can't really tell since he is constantly apologizing  when he thinks he did something wrong and complaining about being outside whenever I try to get him out... There really is no reason to always stay inside on his computer and with his toy... But I haven't actually tried to put myself in his shoes, did I? Maybe this is just his way to feel comfortable. He became like this because of what happened that day... Damn my weakness...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMurasati was also in deep thought: \"Imy... I wonder if he is angry at me again... But I don't want to stay outside so much and he knows it. I speak more often now and I don't want to just stay alone in my room all the time anymore... So why isn't he happy? He knows I can't just change and become an outdoor person... And yet... He could be just trying to break the walls I made... For a long time I just wanted to be with only Bebeby and let Imy be with Miyabi instead of me... What should I do...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two were going through some pretty deep matters right now regarding their relationship. Gone was that awkwardness between the two, now that their personalities pretty much reversed themselves. Murasati became now so shy, that even Murakimo wouldn't compare to him right now. And on top of that, he was really withdrawn and had really low self-confidence that made him really difficult to appoach. Only a few manged to get him to open up, one of them being Imy. Speaking of him, unlike before, when he just wanted to remain silent to escape the situations that he deemed uncomfortable or annoying, now became quite vocal in everything he did, speaking his thoughts in brutal honesty. He also admires Miyabi now a lot, and is a really good friend with her, as his memories changed to fit that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of memories, they pretty much forgot about their whole initial predicament and was now just spending their day like any other day. As for the relationship between them, there was now more than a fraternal respect and care for one another... They were now siblings.</span></div></div>",

Eventually, Murasati finished as well and went next to his sibling. There was an awkward silence before Imy decided to speak up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Murasati... There is something I want to say to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted... to apologize.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F-For what?!\", asked a baffled Murasati, clearly not expecting such an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I always push you around, and try to get you out of your room to interact more with others..  without taking into account your feelings. I know I do what I do because I want to make up less secluded... but you always were so reluctant. Initially, I thought it was just because you grew accustomed to your way of living, but soon I realized that you are doing it because you feel scared of what could happen. I now you still blame yourself what what happened that day... And I am sorry for not noticing it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImy was surely feeling quite guilty for being ignorant to his brother's turmoil for so long, and what was worse is that he never actually noticed it until recently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was talking, both of them aged one last time: Imy to 21 and Murasati to 18. Their backs became arched as their shoulders rounded and their waists slimmed one last time, with Imy's being a couple of inches smaller than his brother's. Finally, they felt something in their throats, and they swallowed a few times to get rid of whatever it was. After a few gulps, the feeling was done as both of them had voices which belonged to girls their age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Murasati shook his head and looked at Imy with a serious gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are with nothing at fault big brother Imyu!\" Imyu was really surprised at the sudden outburst as his brother continued. \"It is true that you usually try to make me do things I don't like... But that doesn't mean I deny that they are good for me. Going outside, speaking with others, not spending so much time with Bebeby... I would've denied that I need such things before, but after I became an elite shinobi with you, I decided to give everything a try... At first, it was really uncomfortable, to the point I wanted to go back home, but in the end I started to accept all these new things... And I even enjoy them now. So I thank you for that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Murasatki...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just...\". He began to lose the confidence in his voice as he continued to talk. \"You always seem so displeased or disappointed with what I do and how I act, so I thought that you might think I am just dead weight to the group... or that I am simply bothering you and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not true!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot it was Murasatki's turn to remain wide-eyed as Imyu continued: \"I could never thought of you as such! I push you from behind not because I want you to change or because I am annoyed of waiting for you to do something. I do it because I want you to stop this cycle of self-loathing that you fell in... I know that you have a low opinion in yourself, ...but how many would protect his friends in earnest the way you do? You are just like me and Miyabi, nowhere near inferior. I consider you to be as reliable as Miyabi... and not to mention that I am your brother... I can't just feel anything but admiration for someone who is willing to do something he doesn't like... and to say he likes them later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMurasatki was silent for a few seconds before embracing his brother, trying not to cry after hearing his words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you big brother... For your kind words I feel very relieved that you think of such of me... I am happy we are siblings...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImyu would normally try to hide acting too clingy to others, but this time, he gave out a smile and with a pleased sigh he embraced his brother back. It sure felt nice to have someone to talk to like this... Besides Miyabi, he didn't think there was anyone else who could made him feel comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too... I am happy I have you for a brother.\"</span></div></div>",

I think it was done for a larger number of shinobi. It could also be some sort of planning spot. I saw a conference room on our way here. I think we had to walk so much because we didn't went through the reception... We did went another way than the one we came.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of walking... It is really okay of walking in our swimsuits like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Murakimo-san. We are only girls on this ship and there is no reason to feel embarrassed about that. I am sure we've been walking like this before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... Although we must find-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys! Didn't think I'll find you here.\", said a voice from the corridor perpendicular with the one they were in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking in the direction of the voice, they say Katsusagi waving, with Yozakua and Hikage next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Katsusagi-san? What are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Going to the pool like we settled. But what are you guys doing here? Wasn't the baths area on the other side of the ship?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We went another way than the one we came so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got lost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's rude Hikage-san! We didn't get lost! We just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Decided taking the scenic route...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah... There is nothing scenic inside Murakimo-san.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIcharuga sighed as Katsusagi gave out a small laugh at their exchange. As they were talking, their swimwear finally reached completion. Icharuga's, Katsusagi's and Yozacua's tops became identical matches to their bikinis as Yoli's gained a white silk fringe, with a black string, forming a knot in the front side on the top of his swimsuit besides becoming a perfect match to his lower swimwear. Only Murakimo's became a different pattern: white with blue square lines all around the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So did you have fun in the arcade?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure did. Yozakua found an awesome game to play, so everything went fantastic!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait... You played a game Yozakua found? What was it about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was a hack-and slash game, where you were an officer of an empire where you had to fight the enemy horde as you complete different missions given to you. This made it harder, and if you are paying attention, you will also find some hidden objectives to complete.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That really sounds like an interesting game Yozakua-san. Nice job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heheh... I only found it... But I do like the system and controls. Let's hope Yumi-san would accept playing this back home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\", said Murakimo a bit skeptical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how was the bath?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was fantastic. We've never felt so relaxed before. You have to try it Hikage-san!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe later...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, me too... I wouldn't mind a good relaxation...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way, do you know where Murasatki-san and Imyu-san are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Maybe there are already at the pool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, most likely. Well, let's not keep them waiting then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this the group continued walking towards the main deck. As they walked, the boys' faces changed. Their cheekbones rose higher as their noses and ears shrunk and their lips became fuller. Their skin also finished tanning, giving each a yellowish tint in different quantities. Lastly, their hair styled itself a bit, giving them new haircuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith two particular exceptions, they had the bodies of teenage girls.</span></div></div>",

The sun was still quite powerful since it was still morning, but some clouds appeared on the sky, almost like trying to dwindle the sun's strength by just a bit. After a couple more minutes of walking, they reached the pool area, with Murasatki and Imyu drying up after they swam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys!\", yelled Katsusagi. The two looked in their direction as Imyu waved back at them. Like their friends, their swimsuits were just done, the two now having a military-green and purple with white dots bikini. Their face also feminized, with Imyu putting back his glasses. Lastly, their skin and hair finished going through their changes as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting close to them, Katsusagi asked: \"We didn't let you guys wait too long have we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really We have been swimming up until a few minutes ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so you two swam? How was the water?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was all right. The sun warmed it up enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImyu was casually talking with the rest as Murasatki was on the side, nervous, listening to them. Seeing him like this, Yozakua came closer and told him: \"Do you like playing games Murasatki-san?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... Yes...Why do you ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYozacua proceeded to tell him about the game he, Katsusagi and Hikage were playing before coming outside. Despite being nervous, Murasatki became a bit interested in the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see... It does sound quite appealing....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like to play it with us later?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... Sure...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMurasatki was slowly starting to open up to Yozakua, with Imyu looking at him on the side for a second before smiling to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith everyone together, the last changes for the boys were starting. Their nipples tingled as they enlarged and became pink as some mass was starting to form beneath them. The lumps all grew at different rates between them, with Hikage noticing for a second the growth until she merely brushed it off, thinking it was normal. At the time, Imyu's was the smallest, at about small B-cups, Icharuga's was around BB-cups, Katusagi's, Yoli's, Yozakua's and Murakimo's at medium C-cups, and Murasatki's already at small D-cups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a closer look at his friends, Katsusagi was starting to laugh a bit sneakily while having her arms at the ready to grab something. Unfortunately for him, Icharuga and Yozakua noticed him and with a frown they asked him:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What exactly are you doing Katsusaki-san?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Getting ready for some fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... It's always the same with you, isn't it? This is why I didn't want to go outside just in a swimsuit...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Icharuga, don't be so stiff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He isn't stiff, you are too perverted. Sometimes you can even rival Hanzo in that aspect...\", said Yozakua as he was supporting Icharuga on this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, being compared compared to him is an honor, you know?\", said Katsusagi with a smirk on his face. \"Besides, I know that for a fact, you don't seem to mind it so much lately Icharuga...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha?! What are you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone! Look!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a red face, Icharuga was ready to object to his friend's words, when Yoli's voice directed them all to something.</span></div></div>",

Everyone went closer to the ledge to take a closer look at their destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There it is! Finally!\", exclaimed Katsusagi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. It looks like we are really close to the resort now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverybody stood at the ledge looking at the island as they came closer. As they stood there, they all felt a slight tingling in their groin. Their young boyhoods began to grow smaller as their testes were slowly getting pulled inside them as they were changing function.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, Icharuga came closer to Katsusagi as the others were looking toward the island and told him:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why in the world did you say that out loud?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was there a problem?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course there was! Now the others think I like being groped by you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I was that much off base? You didn't complain as much lately. And you usually don't say to stop because it's indecent anymore, but because you don't want to be seen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you think anybody likes to be seen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now don't say it like it is something offensive. It is just a sign of affection... Or you don't want me to be affectionate with you anymore?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! I never said that! What I meant to say was-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha... I was just messing with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... It's not funny...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that.... But you want a little breast massage later?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I know you will do it regardless of what I say... So fine...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatsusagi laughed a bit as Icharuga gave a sigh at his friend's behavior. But in reality, he really didn't mind the whole groping action that much. As the two were talking, their breasts grew once again: Icharuga's just entered D-cups as Katsusagi's were now bordering E-cups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two were talking, the others also have gotten in their conversations as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Hikage-san, have you and Katsusagi-san had a great day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could say that. We played a cool game and had fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't seem too excited however of what happened today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you know me. How was your day with Icharuga?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was perfect. We talked together with Murakimo-san about bean-sprouts, had a very relaxing bath... I actually think I should try one of my new recipes and give it to Icharuga-san once we come back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am happy that you feel that way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you don't show it, but I can feel you mean it. Hehe...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHikage gave a small smile to Yoli's observation as the latter also smiled a bit. Yoli's breasts continued to grow in the meantime, to small E-cups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have decided to wear my mask less today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... I have created a barrier around me because of how insecure I felt... But grandfather Kurogane still remains with me even if I don't wear my mask. My friends made me understand that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Friends, huh.... It is really amazing that not too long ago we didn't even try to conside that we could talk to those we consider being \"evil\", or those helping the \"evil\" ones...  But I guess there is really a start for everything....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sure is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So when are you going to take it off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Today... Maybe...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYozakua gave a sigh and a nervous laugh at hearing Murakimo add \"maybe\" in the sentence. Some things could never change... Their breasts also grew to E-cups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yozakua-san told me about a really nice game...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You aren't going to buy it and stay in your room are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Actually, he said we could play it together later...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... I also want to play it with also big brother... if you don't mind it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Sure. Sounds like fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImyu as a little proud of Murasatki, being already eager to try new things, as Murasatki himself was curious a bit of how it will turn out. Their breasts grew as well, with the former's being C-cups at the moment, and the latter's EE-cups.</span></div></div>",

They saw the lush jungle, and they could spot a bit of the beach as well. But there was something which confused them a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is tha big white thing in the front? And why is it reflecting the sun's rays?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think that is the resort?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That big? I doubt it. There has to be something else...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they waited to better see what the white thing was, their breasts finally finsihed their growth. Imyu's were the smallest, at around medium D-cups, Icharuga's was at about E-cups, Yoli, Katsusagi, Murakimo and Yozakua's became EE-cups, and Murasatki's were the biggest at F-cups. Despite the weight on their chests however, they seemed to have no problem at all with them due to their physique. Inside their bikini, their boyhoods became so small they weren't visible anymore as their testes became a pair of ovaries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they came closer to the island, they saw the white from before took the shape of the building, and when they entered the bay, they became speechless at what they saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-That's the resort?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's huge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Icharuga, Hanzo didn't say we were going to a real resort, did he? That is way too big for a shinobi resting place...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I don't know... It certainly is much bigger than I anticipated...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what Asuka thinks of this... Guess we'll find out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone then left the deck slowly as they headed to the reception. Their memories of their old lives were now replaced with new ones, of then not only being shinobi, but a much more complex pasts and histories. Soon, they encountered Nozomi at the reception.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I was just about to call you come here. We will arrive in about 15 minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we will go take our bags.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. When you finish please come back here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone went to their rooms to pick up their bags and afterwards went back to the recption. They felt a slightly stronger tingle in their groin as it signaled that their new lives were near completion. New emotions and character traits were forming in the boys' minds as they got their bags ready. Hikage was already done, her new self only suffering a few mental alterations as the boys neared the end of their transformation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the ship reached the shore, and the ladder was lowered, they were almost immediately greeted by their friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Icharuga-san! Katsusagi-san! Everyone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey saw Asuka waving them as she came together with Homura, Yumi and Miyabi. At that moment, when they saw their friends, their changes finsihed, as virgin flowers bloomed between their legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the group reunited, they split among themselves to talk with the team's captains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was wondering what happened to you guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're sorry Asuka. Me and Ikaruga simply had our hands tied with the whole lack of space situation... By the way, didn't I tell you to call me Katsu-nee? The way you said it sounded way too formal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... It was a simple Misatake... Haha...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't mind it. But you must pay a little compensation for it.... Hehe\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Katsuagi-san! We just have gotten off and you start off with this already?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chill Ikaruga... I wasn't actually going to do it... too much... but I guess we should tell you what we did as we came here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Homura's group...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A mineral bath huh? I heard of those. Is it true that they give a boost to your physical capabilities?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We didn't test that out yet, but I guess so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting. Thanks for telling me Yomi. And what did you do Hikage?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Played a hack and slash game with Katsuragi and Yozakura.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A hack and slash game? Now I'm curious. What is it like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Yumi's group...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The details of the game sound quite complex... Is it also a strategy game Yozakura-san?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It could be. It has quite a few missions to complete that make it much more intense. And the fighting styles are also really diverse...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I cannot deny that I am intrigued a bit by this game. I guess we should buy it and try it myself to see if it leaves up to its reputation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I say something Yumi?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it Murakumo-san?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I leave my face unmasked after we meet up with everyone? I want to see how it goes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Sure. If you want to, then please...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Miyabi's group...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to talk more with others Murasaki?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... If you can... Can you and big sister help me doing that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. I would be honored. What do you say Imu?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll accept this without pause Miyabi. You are also part of this family...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-Thanks...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we... play a game later as well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. What kind of game?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone present became shinobi, and all upheld their own principles and sense of justice, with one purpose: to try and make the world better however they could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs everyone was busy discussing how their morning went, there was something that bothered the group...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder where the others are....\", murmured Asuka.</span></div></div>",

His group consisted of himself, his friend Jake and cousins Erin and Tracy, the former being at odds with Gabe at times. The girls wore matching light-blue one piece swimsuits and the boys wore their swimming trunks: dark-green for Gabe and black for Jake. The girls had both chestnut-brown hair that fell to their shoulders as the boys' hair were black, with Gabe being a shade darker. They also were 9 years old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind them, not too far behind was Miles, together with his group which contained himself, Terry, Gabe's younger brother, Zane, a really good friend to the two and Cory, someone who would often get along with mostly everybody, with the exception of Jake. They were all 8 years old, Terry and Zane have jet-black hair, and Miles and Cory blond hair and they all wore dark-blue swim trunks that were given to them by the resort for accepting to go to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the groups reached the shore, they were all a bit surprised by the lack of people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now this is weird.\", said Gabe. \"I know for sure Brandon and the others said they were going out earlier this morning. And where are Blake and Eric?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know those two. Maybe they decided to go inside after they got bored. If they don't find anything too interesting they go and do other things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That could work for Eric, Jake.\", said Erin \"But Blake wouldn't go and leave the beach just like that. And what of the others?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's true... And even if they left, where would they go? There is only a pool table and a small gym here.\", continued Tracy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say bro, I noticed something at the mess hall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it Terry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I said to Zane earlier that we wished this place would be like the resort Matt told us about, the lady at the counter was a bit confused, almost like he doesn't know the name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that you mentioned it, when we talked about May, it was a similar situation... I wonder why.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe they got the name confused Erin. There are 20 of us here. Of course the names could be mixed.... But still, I wonder where everyone is? Sure the beach isn't really amazing like we thought it would be, but is still better than nothing. I wonder where they have gone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe they made the wish you guys made.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone looked at Miles with confusion, except for Gabe who had a question on his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you even know that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tyler told me about it. You forgot yours in the room Here you go.\", said Miles, as he handed Gabe a piece of paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is he talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGabe gave a big sigh before he turned to the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A few days ago, Tyler had shown me, Eric and Blake this guy who can apparently use magic. After showing us some tricks, he gave each of us a piece of paper that he said can fulfill wishes. We decided to write the same wishes, so me and Blake wished for a great resort, and Eric and Tyler... wished to become ninjas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ninjas? Really?\", asked Jake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did it so that he wouldn't feel bad about it. I didn't want to disappoint him. But I didn't know that he told Miles about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got curious. Say, can we make the wishes now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to see if they come true. What do you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGabe was ready to refuse, when Terry stopped him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give it a try bro. I doubt something will happen, but just in case it is real, you should try it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm with Terry on this one.\", said Zane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too. Both things sound pretty good. There is no reason not to.\", continued Cory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGabe looked at Jake who gave out a sigh and then at the girls who giggled a bit at the whole situation, before admitting defeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right... Let's do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two positioned themselves and the papers before the sun before exclaiming: \"\"Make the wish come true now!\"\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, a bright light came from the papers that enveloped everyone. After the papers burned down from the light faded. In the end, safe for the remains of the papers, everyone was gone.</span></div></div>",

Vases of flowers completed the design of the room, giving it a nice touch of elegance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is this?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-Bro, did the paper sent us here?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is amazing! Isn't this what you wished for Gabe?\", asked Miles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Well... I-It looks nice, but... I never thought it would actually work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group was still amazed by the whole wish thing and were admiring the decor, when Erin realized something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! How are we supposed to go back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wished to get here, not to also go back! Now were stuck you dummy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, why is it may fault? I never went into details with the wish because I thought it was merely a trick, not the real deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what are we supposed to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Erin was about to continue her little rant, a woman in a white sundress came from the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! There you were! I was looking for you.\" Everyone looked the the woman in question, wondering what she meant. She seemed to be in her early twenties, with her black hair being tied in a low ponytail. \"Good morning! My name is Mira and welcome you to the resort! We are sorry for the inconvenience with your transport here, but we are willing to have us make your stay here as pleasurable as possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oh. Thanks.\", said Miles meekly as Gabe also nodded at the woman with a bit uncertainty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! If you need me, I will wait for you at the reception. The restaurant and the cafes are to the left, right after the bathrooms. The spa is just outside to the right, and if you go upstairs there is also a gym as well.... Oh! And I almost forgot! We also have an ice cream bar open as well! Anyways, once you feel like needing anything, please come and see me...\" With that, she bowed to the children before she left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... That was informative...\", said Zane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... At least we now know that we are guests here. That means that the wish got this part right...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we still we don't know how to get back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax Erin, we will just talk to that Mira lady and she will give us a boat to return home. But first, I think we must ask as much as we can out of her, such as where is the resort and what did she meant before with \"transport inconvenience\".\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say,Gabe. Can we look around the place while you are doing this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean by that Tracy? Don't you want to go back home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do. But not enjoying this trip while we're here is a bid nope.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She... is kind of right, bro. I mean, you wished to get here. I say we enjoy our time here as long as we can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chill out man.\", said Jake with a calm smile on his face. \"Me and Tracy will take care of Terry and the others. You and Erin can go ask Mira and we can have some fun in the meantime. You guys can join us later.\" He came closer to the two and whisperers to them: \"Besides, you don't want want to have these guys upset, or they will chew you off the whole way back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two gave a big sigh before Erin said: \"All right,fine. You can go have fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay!\" Exclaimed Tracy. \"Let's go at the cafe then!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone left the lounge and headed to the cafe area safe for Gabe and Erin who headed to the reception. On their way, both Gabe and Miles wondered something:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\"Huh... I wonder what happened to the ninja part...\"\"</span></div></div>",

As they walked they admired the decor and looked at some of the employees doing their job, waving at them as they passed them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This would be quite nice if it wasn't for your slip-up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, I am sorry. Don't be mad at me for not giving too many details for something I didn't even think would happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not really mad. I just said you should've thought better of the wish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Whatever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two weren't actually disliking each other, but they found themselves disagreeing over quite often over things. Not to mention that Gabe had the tendency to go and ignore Erin at times to focus on other things, which really irritated her when he did that. In turn, she would lecture him over that which he found quite annoying. Other than that, despite rubbing each other the wrong way at times, they got along pretty well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two walked, the two rose a bit in height as Gabe's feet became a bit more delicate, as he gained a pedicure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am worried over Terry. I hope he is okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You worry too much. He and his friends are with Jake and Tracy. They are older than them after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, by a year...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now don't be so pessimistic. Besides, Tracy might act a bit preppy at times, but she can be serious if she needs to. And Jake is not the person to let someone get out of his sight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you're right...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, they got into a big room with a marble floor covered by a really inviting red carpet. After walking a bit more, they reached the reception desk, with Mira sitting there, looking over some papers. Noticing them , she smiled and greeted them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hello! Can I be of any help to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yes. I was wondering if you could tell us a bit about the island.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. The island is at about 150 miles from Tokyo Bay, the weather is most of the year sunny, the wild-life and the vegetation is almost untouched, with the exception of the western region of the island, where we organized small safari trips for our guests, but we don't disturb anything nonetheless. Other than that, the tourist beach area is from the front of the resort to about half-way to the other side of the island.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two were really surprised at what they just heard. Just as they wanted to ask for more, Mira's phone rang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, please excuse me. Hello? How can I help you. Oh, I see. Thanks you.\" After putting the phone down, she turned to the two and said: \"I am very sorry. I need to go somewhere for a second. Do you mind if you wait on the couches a bit until I come back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. No problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira bowed to the two before leaving as the two sat on the couch, taking in the information. As they did, they felt an itch on their scalp as their hair grew up a bit. Also, Erin's brown hair darkened a bit as Gabe's did the opposite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tokyo Bay? Like in Japan? This is where we are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so... Jeez... I never thought we would end up this far away....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You never said anything about Japan in your wish, did you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, of course not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... there's something that bothers me...\"</span></div></div>",

Didn't you say that Tyler and Eric also said they wanted to become ninjas? Do you think that is why we are close to Japan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... don't think so. Maybe the wish just seemed unlikely and the paper didn't make it true because it was impossible. Maybe it got us close to Japan as compensation. There was no way we could meet real ninjas anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you're right.... But wait a second... Miles said earlier that they weren't at the beach because they already wished to get here. Do you think they are still here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah! But... I don't know if that's the case. I just happened to take the paper with me, and Miles may have just taken his to check it out. I don't know if the others brought the papers with them... And even if they did, then where are they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should ask Mira when she comes back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two waited for Mira to come back, they started to age up a bit. They grew to 11 years old as their limbs grew with them. Gabe's were longer, but they remained quite lanky in appearance. Also, his calves altered as they became more muscular and shapely. Erin's did the same, but with her frame not growing much and already being a girl, it didn't leave that much of an impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Eirin, I was wondering...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on. Did you spell my name wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I don't think so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Was that just me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably... I wanted to ask if one of us should go check on the others until Mira comes back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Just relax. It's not like they are leaving or anything. And nothing is going to happen to them either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Understood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just what is up with him?\", thought Eirin. \"It's really rare for Gabye to worry for his brother this much... Maybe he just is a little jumpy... But man I wish he would chill up a bit... What could happen anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two decided to wait for Mira to come back, and possibly to give them further details. But while the two were waiting, they started to feel a bit more calm and comfortable about the resort, starting to accept the situation a bit more.</span></div></div>",

Since they already had breakfast, they decided to settle for just something to drink. There were quite a few cafes outside, each having different themes form Hawaiian to French-inspired. After looking around a bit, they settled for an American-looking one with a few exotic items around as well. After they sat down, a girl about 18-19 years old came to them and asked them:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello! My name is Azusa! How can I help you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we saw you had a few milkshakes that you serve here. Can you suggest which ones are better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All of them are great! Most people go for the chocolate one, but my personal favorite is the banana.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then , let's be 3 banana and 3 chocolate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right. Now wait just a minute. I will come with them right away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Azusa left, the group began talking with each other. The boys's feet started to slim down and became dainty as well as a bit bigger. Tracy's grew a bit as well, but other than that no other changes happened to her at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted to ask you this Miles...\", said Terry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you ask bro about the wish in detail? I am feeling that the ninja part is really out of place with hot things are right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I feel that too.\", continued Zane. \"I don't see how we can become ninjas in this situation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerry and Zane were getting really well together due to their similar interests. They also spend quite a lot of time playing with each other. They weren't really best friends, but they were quite inseparable at times. Miles kind of falls in the same group activities as the other two but is a bit more into understanding the talk that adults do at times, which made him susceptible to believing what older people say at times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it will take some time...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I doubt that.\", replied Cory. \"It sounds really impossible. Maybe it just fulfilled the wish that was more realistic. And why didn't you wished for something else anyways? And why did you even go to the magician's place anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now don't be like that.\", said Jake. \"He did what the others did. So stop being hard on him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCory was a bit more pessimistic than the others, which made him more of a lone wolf. The others didn't pay much attention to this, except for Jake. For him, somebody that doesn't see the bright side of things when they should, was a killjoy. This caused some friction between the two, but it was nothing serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chill out guys! Who cares about the wish now? Erin and Gabe are going to get help, and then we can go home. Until then, let's have fun!\", exclaimed Tracy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was was preppy and more child-like than Erin, who tried to stay serious most of the time. She also enjoyed trips quite a lot, which made her feel more relaxed with their situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others gave a little thought, before agreeing to Tracy and continued to talk with each other. AS they were talking, their hair grew a bit as their color changed as well. For Jake, Terry and Zane, their hair started to lighten from their usual black, Terry's the most. Tracy's brown hair began to transition into a blond color as Miles' did the opposite. Lastly, Cory's hair color became a bit more vibrant, going for a more honey-blond color.</span></div></div>",

What awaited them was a refreshing taste that really made them all happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is really tasty!\", exclaimed Terry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! It's really yummy!\", continued Zane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he couldn't deny the taste, the way his friends expressed their pleasure made Miles a bit confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it just me, or did they sounded a bit more childish than usual? I know for a certain that Zane wouldn't say \"yummy\" like Tracy would....\" He took a glance at the girl and he was a bit relieved to see her not act out of the usual \"I see that she is quite normal. She really likes it if she licks her lips so much... But what's up with those guys? Maybe they just like it a bit too much... I mean, it is good after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther than the outburst there was no more weird happenings as everyone enjoyed their shakes. As they were drinking, they all grew in height and age. Interesting was that the boys' calves vibrated until they were shaped like Tracy's, but no one noticed that. In the end, everyone was now 11 years old, save for Miles who grew to 12 years old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they were nearly done drinking, Tracy asked the others: \"Say guys, what do want to do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have something in mind Thacy?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As a matter of fact I do. I wan to check out the spa. Does any of you want to come?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The spa? Isn't that for girls?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Tirri, you dummy. Boys can come over too. You can have massages, all sorts of treatments, stuff like that. In other words, you just let yourself be pampered.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! That sounds really nice? Can we go Jyake?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please! Please! Please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJyake was a bit confused by his friends' behavior, and was about to say anything until Miles sat up. \"Leave Tirri and Zinei to me and Thacy, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure everything will be all right Mires?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. Don't worry. What about you Cyory?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... kind of want to just check out the place a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want to, then I am gonna stay with you. I can't just leave you alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter everyone finisihed their shakes, Jyake and Cyory remained at the table as the others headed for the spa.</span></div></div>",

But something was getting weird about Gabye, as he began to ask of he could go and check on his brother a number of times, with Eirin refusing to let him go as to not miss Mira when she would come back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly, can you calm down a bit? Nothing is going to happen to him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But just in case... If something is to happen...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what? Eating too many sweets? You worry too much. Besides, he isn't alone. And I doubt anything bad could happen here. Now stop worrying. It's starting to get on my nerves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't done with his objective, but for the moment, he decided to listen to Eirin, to not get her mad. As they waited, his thighs grew larger and thicker as muscle and fat was starting to form in them. Eirin's did the same, but they didn't grow as much as Gabye, despite being a girl. Also her swimsuit started to darken a bit as the material became a touch more durable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, what's taking her so long? I know she said she had something to take care of, but it had been almost 15 minutes since she left...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe she had some business on a different part of the island and maybe it takes a while to get there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably... Say, can I ask you a bit more about that magician guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do want to know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like how he did his tricks. Maybe it was actually real magic like the paper was. Did he tell you way to undo the wish?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... He said that he traveled the world to learn magic, so I do not know from who he learned the most. But the magic paper thing was thought to him in Japan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? By whom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I forgot his name. But it was an elderly man who worked as a chef, but also had another job he didn't want to talk about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think he was also a magician?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. It could have been. But he didn't say anything about how to undo the wish. What was curious was that regardless of the wish, it always made it come true, he said.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... That contradicts the situation we are in. We are in a resort, like you wished for, but we surely are not ninjas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe the shinobi part would come later. Or maybe this a resort where shinobi come. Or-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on. What is a \"shinobi\"? I have never heard of this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It also means ninjas. But it is a more specific way to say it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEirin just thought that he was pulling her leg with that word. Or maybe it was something that he got from television. But regardless, it sounded harder to remember than ninjas. However the more she thought of the word, the more familiar it got. She even began to think of ninjas as shinobi instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two were talking, their hair continued growing. Their hair grew to their upper backs as Eirin's hair turned a dark-brown. Gabye's hair continued to lighten to almost an ash color as a few streaks of his hair started to turn white.</span></div></div>",

My colleague Otome, who also works at the front desk needed my help regarding something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is she then? What what did she need help with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She had to make a few preparations for the restaurant. We had to make an inventory about our stock and needed me to help her with carrying them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you needed me for something else? You wanted to ask me something before I left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was wondering... How secure is this place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEirin was surprised when she heard Gabye's question, not expecting this sort of inquiry to pop out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is a very secure place, I can assure you. Since the island doesn't appear on most maps, there are very rarely people coming here. And we have our own medical center here at the resort as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mira was talking, the two aged up again, this time to 13 years old. Eirin didn't grow too much as she was still quite petite, but some signs such as the small breasts that were starting to form on her chest proved that she was indeed getting older. Gabye's change was much more drastic. Not only did he grew more in height, his thighs grew becoming really eye-candy to the others. Complimenting his legs, his hips also started to grow wider as with his increased height, his waist also started to compress a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is Gagye doing? He shouldn't be asking things like these.\", thought Eirin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there also something you wanted to ask me Eiran-san?\", asked Mira, turning to the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Oh yeah... I was wondering. If this is a island that doesn't appear on maps, does it mean that it is a private island?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is improper to say that. But yes, only a few select people can come here. You came here as a gift from Hanzo-sama so there is no problem for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEiran once again thought: \"So this Hanzo gave us permission to come here... He sounded Japanese, so I guess that is the tie with Japan. This woman also looks foreign and- Wait... Did she also spell my name wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we go look in our rooms?\", asked Gagye, interrupting Eiran's train of thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. The rooms are on the second floor, to the left. Here are the passwords for the door.\", said Mira as she shown the two a piece of paper with the passwords.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. Let's go Eiran.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey! Wait for me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEiran ran up to Gagye who walked faster than him, disliking the fact that he had longer legs. Below the two's notice, their swimsuits changed. Eiran's became a darker shade of blue as the design became a bit more simple, while Gagye's stretched-out trunks were conforming to his new proportions as the color was fading away, starting to become white, with some pink lines also appearing.</span></div></div>",

On the way, they admired the decor, reminding them of a luxury hotel they saw in the movies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This place looks really neat.\", said Mires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! It really is awesome!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks so cool! And it is all for us! This is a great trip!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, of course it is. The wish made it tailored for our needs. It really is great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMires once again stood in a bit of confusion, seeing the behavior of his friends. It wasn't Thacy's slightly sassy reply or her unusual calmness that worried him much, but the boys' childish tendencies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up those two? I know this place is new and all, and it looks really nice, but they don't need to act so giddy... If you are curious about it, it's fine but be like you are visiting a candy store... I wonder what makes them be this way...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMires was too busy thinking to see their legs changing further. Their thighs became sleeker and more toned, with Mires gaining a bit more height than his friends out of it. Also, Thacy's swimsuit suddenly split into two pieces and started to turn black. But nobody noticed anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, they reached the spa, and after knocking the door, they were welcomed by two women in their mid-twenties wearing white uniforms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning! Are you here for a massage? Or a foot bath? Or for one of the new curative therapies that we have in our selection?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... What do you suggest we should try Thacy?\", asked Tirri.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I say we should do as much as we can, since it is all free. So let's make a full course session!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay! We shall start with a foot bath then. Please take a seat and we will come back right way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone sat on the specially made chairs that held a small foot bath at the bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! It looks like a small jacuzzi!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Doesn't it look cool Mires?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah... It does...\", said Mires with a bit of nervousness in his voice that was unnoticed by the others. \"There they go again! What is it with them today?... I should try and relax. If it is so calm ourselves, then I should just follow Thacy's example and ignore the weirdness. Maybe that will calm me down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to Mires, Thacy wasn't actually ignoring the boys' weird behavior because she thought it was normal. Also, as they waited their hair grew once again, with Thacy's now becoming the longest and reaching her upper back as the color continued to turn blond. Mires' hair started to turn a light-brown color as Zane' was beginning to turn darker shade of brown. But Terri's was the most drastic change as not only the color continued to lighten but some strands were starting to turn pink.</span></div></div>",

Please put your feet inside and enjoy the bath for a few minutes before we take care of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone did as they were told and as soon as they dipped their feet n the water, they gave a blissful sigh as the jacuzzi tingled and massaged their feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... This feels really good...\", said Mires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. It feels amazing... Do you think so too Zinei?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... It feels so good...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four closed their eyes and let the bath do the magic. As they rested, the two women pulled their feet after a couple of minutes and did their pedicure as they all relished the feeling. With their minds preoccupied, they didn't notice that they aged up once again. Mires went up to 14 years as Zinei and Tirri went to 13. Their thighs became strong and shapely, with a really good muscle to fat proportion as their hips also started to grow, straining their swimwear a bit. Thacy aged only one year, to 12 years old, but her figure was starting to develop quite a lot as puberty seemed to accelerate in her case, her breasts already being at B-cups at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the women were taking care of their feet, one of them asked them: \"What were your names? I am sorry but we completely forgot to ask.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! That's right. Please forgive us. I am Madoka and this is my sister Nagisa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two introduced themselves, the four noticed that indeed the two looked quite similar, as they had the same facial structure, brown eyes and dark-brown hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Hirri and this is my friend Zidei.\",, said Hirri with a big smile on his face as Zidei happily waved at the two women. \"And they are Thici and Maresa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Thici also waved at the two, Maresa was a bit confused at what he just heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"something is not wright...Did Hirri say his name wrong?... Wait. Did he?... I think I heard it wrong... I sure need to relax a bit more... Also, the way he and Zinei act so cheerily... is a bit adorable...\", thought Maresa as he closed his eyes again. Gradually, he was starting to forget not just the wish, but the situation at hand as well. The others were in the same boat as him, as they seemed to enjoy the treatment, not realizing that they are forgetting about their pasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they were being pampered, their swimsuits started to change. Thici's was starting to turn mostly black as some section were turning white. Also, it began to shrink on her, starting to reveal her growing figure. The trunks the boys were wearing grew a bit tighter on them as they were fitting their proportions. Their color also began to change as Maresa's was turning a hot-pink color, with Hirri's a more faded pink and Zinei's were turning orange with some yellow lines forming as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more minutes, after finishing up their pedicures, Nagisa told the group: \"All right guys, it's time now for a massage.\"  </span></div></div>",

Jayake had some problems talking to Cyory due to him acting reserved and a bit distant towards him. Before, it wasn't too much of a bother to him, and usually he just accepted his reluctance to talk to him, but right now he was starting to feel a bit frustrated. Before he could snap however, Cyory asked him:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it okay if we look around a bit? I want to see what this place has.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure... Why not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJyake wasn't exactly sure that this could take too long since he didn't expect what exactly would be at the resort other than what Mira told them about, but was eager to try and have Cyory try being a bit more happy so that he could talk with him normally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting up, they headed back inside the building and began touring the corridors. As they were walking, their legs grew more shapely but also stronger as their thighs gained some more mass. What was interesting was that Cyory's legs seemed to develop a bit more than Jyake's however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of looking around, they found a game room, a small movie theater and a conference hall. From time to time, they spotted some girls which seemed to be working at the resort, all clad in a very simple-looking uniform that waved them whenever they passed them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you think it's weird that there are only girls around here?\", asked Cyory<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is a bit strange, but who knows... Maybe the guys have a day off or something...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're probably right... And why is nobody saying it is weird for us to walk in our swimsuits?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... Maybe because it is a beach resort, it is common to walk in your swimsuit? I mean, you don't usually see people fully dressed in a place like this unless you want to go eat somewhere or something like that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you're right.... Although being seen almost naked makes you feel a lot more free, right? Hehe...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJyake was confused by his friend's comment and also because of the somewhat giddy behavior he suddenly gained. He was so distracted that he missed that his black hair lightened once more towards a brownish color or that it grew to his shoulders. Also, while Cyory's hair color didn't change his blond hair grew to his chin as some bangs became more unruly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that? I guess you sort of feel free when waring swimsuits, but why did he say it like that?\", thought a bewildered Jyake. </span></div></div>",

Let's check it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two were walking, they aged up again to 13 years old. Their legs became long, shapely and strong as their hips also flared out a bit, putting a bit of strain on their trunks. When they reached the building and opened the door they were greeted by a young woman with her raven hair in a small bun in a white uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning! My name is Hikaru and welcome to the store! Are you the guests that came this morning?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... I am Jyabe and this is Cyony. We were wondering what were you selling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We sell everything here from clothes to accessories to even magazines. Is there something you wish to look for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, we just want to look around a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, sure. But I must inform you that you actually have to pay here. I know you are guests but you have to buy if you want to take something with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, okay...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two were a bit sad of the prospect but they accepted the situation, since they came here to look around anyway. As they were looking around, Jyabe noticed something weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it just me, or the things here are mostly for girls?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, there were a lot of articles for girls like dresses, ribbons, bracelets and so on. There were some unisex articles such as shirts, pants or watches, but there was nothing for boys strangely enough. While looking at the items, their swimsuits started to change. Firstly, they conformed to their bigger proportions and then the color started to change. Jyabe's were starting to whiten as Cyony's were gaining some blotches of green around it. As Jyabe was about to point out the weird fact, Cyony exclaimed:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They all look so good! Don't you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?! What do you mean?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean it looks really good for girls! Don't they look amazing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.... Well, yes they do....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It kind of wants us to be girls to wear them as well, don't you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop saying stupid things. Just look around and be quiet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJyabe was a bit surprised at himself actually losing his temper for second. So much so that he didn't notice the somewhat perky way Cyony was acting. Speaking of him, when Jyabe told him off, he actually felt... kind of happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This keeps getting weirder and weirder....Ugh... This is such a pain...\", thought Jyabe.</span></div></div>",

They put a white towel on each of the tables and prepared a few mineral oils to rub on them as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay everybody, now please lay down and let us do our magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group nodded, with Hirri and Zidei in particular being quite excited for the massage, while Thici and Maresa, while not as expressive of their feelings, they were also quite eager as well. After laying down on their bellies, the two women put some oils on their hands and then started to rub Hirri's and Thici's legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah... This feels great...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... It does...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two were experiencing bliss right now feeling the gentle hands on their legs. In the meantime, Thici's figure continued to develop, her hips and ass becoming wider and her waist more toned and slim as her breasts grew into C-cups. Hirri's hips finished growing as well as his butt began to inflate, turning more firm and soft in the process. After finishing their legs, Madoka and Nagisa moved onto Zidei's and Maresa's legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm... This is amazing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes it is... It is really relaxing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like Hirri, their hips ended their growth as their rears became a bit bigger, with Maresa's being a bit more developed. By now, Maresa was starting to forget his previous worry about the situation and accepted his friend's behavior as being normal. But there was something which started to trouble Hirri now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I wonder where bro is. He is missing a lot with this... Huh...? Is Gagye my brother...? I can't... recall. I do have a brother... Actually I have a few brothers and sisters.... But is Gagye my brother...? Weird... I should ask Zidei...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the moment, he decided to keep quiet so that he wouldn't ruin the massage, but kept in mind to ask about the weird thoughts later. As the massage went to their rear region, they all let out some pleased groans. No one noticed that their swimsuits changed once more however. Thici's became a lot more tighter and more revealing as the color became almost black, safe for some white regions on the side of her hips and the middle of her chest. In the meantime, the boys' trunks became even tighter on them as they started to shrink, revealing a lot more of their legs and hips as the color continued to change. What was really odd however was that the boys' towels were starting to stick on their chests and started shrink as well. The material also became stretchier and less rough as the color was starting to resemble that of their trunks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The towels from underneath the boys continued to shrink as the texture became a lot more softer and elastic as a few strings started to grow and wrap around the boys' shoulders and backs. After a couple more minutes, Nagisa told the group:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right everyone please now rest on your backs as we move to the front.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four did as they were told as they now sat on their backs, ready to be massaged on the front as well., with no one noticing the stuck towels on the boys' chests. As Madoka and Nagisa were getting ready, Hirri once again was trying to clear up the fog in his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something is weird... Why did I think that Gagye is not my brother...? After all, we've been together a lot of time... So why shouldn't I consider him that?... \"Consider\"...? So he isn't my brother...? I... don't understand anymore.... I have to ask someone...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he had the chance however, the massage continued as he and the others once again were entranced by the amazing feeling. As the massage took place, they all aged up again. Thici aged up to 14 years old and her figure grew much more womanly, now having a large set of hips and butt and D-cups breasts, while maintaining her athletic figure. Hirri and Zidei aged to 15 years old and Maresa went up to 17. The boys' figures went through a similar change as her butts became all bubble-shaped, with Maresa's now being the largest and their waists started to slim down. Thici's swimsuit shrunk even further as her bottom part became a bikini that completely showed her hips and rear and only covered her groin as her top became really tight on her as her breasts continued to grow. The boys' trunks also became bikini bottoms as they became pink for Maresa, orange with yellow lines for Zidei and light pink for Hirri. Also the latter's gained some pink dots over his bikini that were a darker shade as two rows of frills formed on the top section as well as they partially covered the swimsuit. Meanwhile, the towels shrank even further, to just around their pectoral region as the color and material was starting to resemble the bikinis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile opening his eyes for a second as the massage was nearly done, Zidei saw that Hirri had a worried expression on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something wrong Hirari-chan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... No. I am fine Zideri-chan. Don't worry about me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure everything is fine? You seemed lost in thought there for a while.\", interrupted Maresa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, everything is fine Mareka-san.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither Zideri or Mareka were buying Hirari's words but they decided to ask what was wrong when they were alone. Thici also a bit concerned asked Zidari in a whisper: \"Is everything all right with him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He says that nothing's wrong...

Eiran is right regarding the whole danger thing.... but why do I feel like something is wrong...? Or is it just regarding Hirri?... I will find out the answer once we reach the rooms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Eiran was getting more frustrated with Gagye's behavior. \"What is up with him? First he worries over nothing, then asks that really weird question about safety and now he just sprints to his room just like that without telling me why. I really can't understand what goes in that head of his...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two were walking, Gagye's butt grew bigger and softer, even more so than Eiran. Also, due to his increased height, his waist was more visible getting narrower. His swimsuit also changed further as in addition to to turning almost white, some pink stripes were starting to form, giving his trunks a checkered design. Eiran's swimsuit remained mostly the same color, but became tighter as her chest budded out a bit more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing in the back, for a split second Eiran saw Gagye's swimsuit change. \"Huh? What was that? Did his trunks changed?... I could swear there was no pink on them a second ago. And... is his waist smaller?... What is going on...? There is no way this came from the wish. I mean, he never said anything about.... Huh? A wish? How can that has anything to do with him worrying over Hirri way too much again? I mean, if I could wish to have him start listening to me a bit more, that would be really helpful... Wait... Where did he go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEiran was so preoccupied that he didn't notice herself passing their floor, with Gagye already being on their rooms' corridor. In a hurry, she turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Argh! I don't know if I should be upset at myself for not paying attention or him for not telling me to stop!\", groaned Eiran. As she was running, she grew up to 15 years old, but she didn't grew to much out of the change. In fact, she was still smaller than Gagye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack with Gagye, he walked along the corridor until he found the designated room. Once he put on the password on the door lock, he then proceeded to open the door.</span></div></div>",

What exactly was I wanting to find? Is it about the paper?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Gagye went straight for the table which had the registration papers for him and Hirri. When he looked at them, he initially didn't see anything out of the ordinary, but upon a closer inspection he saw that his brother's name was written as \"Hirari\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\"Hirari\"? What does this mean...? That's not- Ah.... My head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden dizziness overcame him as he aged up to 15 years old, growing much more in size than Eiran, but still a bit short for a boy of his age. His butt became a really nice bubble-shape as his hips also reached their final size. His trunks became white as pink lines delimited the white into squares, as two rows of frills formed from the top and covered the upper portion of the swimsuit as two white knots appeared on each side of his hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis session of changes wasn't restricted to just the physical ones. New memories were starting to enter his head, replacing the old ones. Hirari wasn't his sibling anymore, but for him, he still was really dear to him and considered him as such. Instead, a new, smaller figure came to mind, which seemed to resemble a girl with brown hair, but the rest of image was quite blurry at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah... Hah... Don't walk so fast Yagye! And tell me when you see that I am.... Are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEiran just entered the room, running a bit to catch up with her friend. As she was catching her breath, he saw him holding a hand over his forehead, which worried her a bit. Noticing her presence after the dizzyness went out, Yagye said: \"I am alright Eirai. I just felt lightheaded for a second.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lightheaded? Is it because you couldn't sleep on our way here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard you moving all night. Honestly, we shared the room one night and you still can't sleep without having Hirari next to you huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am just worried about him...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About what? Is it about Mareka-san? He like to tease him a lot, and I am not gonna lie, he does have a strange way to show his affection, but we both know that nothing is going to happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know... But...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir memories were changing quite a lot, as they already forgot about the wish and their predicament as the memories from their home, which were slowly fading away, were the only indicators that something was still off. Suddenly, Yagye realized something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no! I... There is no way that I forgot about it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My eye-patch! Where is it?! You have to help me find it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Sure. Of course I will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEirai didn't question the fact that he needed an eyepatch despite not having any problems with any of his eyes. That was because she knew that it had a very deep meaning to him. As she was contemplating, a black square eye-patch with red markings appeared over her left eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Things like those.... are something that everyone must hold dear to overcome the past... And I know the feeling better than anyone.\", thought Eirai</span></div></div>",

While initially looking only to see if there was at least something boyish for them, now they seemed to look for things for somebody else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Jyabe how does this look?\", asked Cyony holding a red jacket with a few black accents. \"Doesn't this look perfect for Miyabi?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I guess it would work on her, it's just that I think she would like it more if it was mostly black. She isn't really into girly things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... That's such a shame though... Because of her obsession with looking masculine, she neglects her fortes. It's a good thing we don't do that right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJyabe was about to comment on that, but instead he just let out a sigh, as new feelings were starting to emerge from him. Without them noticing, their hips grew one more time, stretching their trunks further as their waists began to compress as well. Their swimsuits shrank to the point where most of their legs were being shown as their color changed completely: white for Jyabe and green for Cyony. But their design wasn't finished as some grew squares for the former and white dots for the latter were appearing all over the swimsuits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's not talk about that, all right? Let's just find something for us and then we will focus on the others. Or at least, find something for Murasaki.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Why her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because her gloomy attitude is really getting on my nerves. I don't even know how Imu deals with her all the time without losing her cool. Honestly, just being sad non-stop for no real reason is infuriating! It makes me so mad at times that I want to punch a wall!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can be be punched as well...\", said Cyony with a smile and a somewhat pleading voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be quiet you masochist... People are not supposed to be happy if they are to be punched.... Unless you are some kind of battle maniac that loves doing this stuff.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am just happy being me. Don't you like how I am?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you could say I grew used to you... But stop with that smiling face!.... Just... Just look around and tell me if you find anything interesting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dynamic between the two was getting quite interesting. They were no longer awkward with each other, but their relationship was getting a bit strange giving their circumstances. Jyabe, who was once really calm was starting to exhibit a few outbursts as he became more vocal, as Cyony was not only not commenting on the outbursts, he now seemed to be the target of them... And not to mention that despite their different personalities, they began to fell a deeper bond between them.... almost a familial one.</span></div></div>",

Come over I found something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is no reason to yell like that. You could've just waved me.\", said Jyabe as made his way to his friend. \"So? What did you find?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at these!\", said Cyony as he showed him two pairs of bikini tops: one white with gray checkers and a green one with white dots, both having a layer of frills on the edges. \"Don't they look really nice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They do... But I don't think Murasaki would like the color. If it isn't black or purple she might turn it down. And I can't picture Miyabi or Imu wearing this... Are you planing to give them to someone from Homura's group?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, silly. I meant to buy them for ourselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... What?! What do you mean?!\", exclaimed a shocked Jyabe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They would look perfect on us. And you said they look nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, let's wear them a bit. I am sure nobody would mind. Please...! Pretty please...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay! Okay! Just stop making that puppy face! Jeez... You at times can be really persuasive when you want to. Too bad I can't use that to have you stop being a masochist all the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you have an insult for me as well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".... And here's the proof... Let's just get this over with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJyabe was ready to have him throw some comments to Cyony's behavior, but since he was in a good mood today, he decided to just go with the flow without complaining. It didn't seem weird to them that they were ready to put on a pair of bikinis or that they were talking about people they shouldn't know... But for them, everything was normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment they put the tops on, their butts suddenly grew bigger. They also aged up a bit more to 15 years old, which accelerated the change of their rears until they both had a really nice heart-shape, with Cyona's being a bit bigger. Their bottoms completed their change as they became perfect matches of their tops, completed with a line of frills on the top. Speaking of the tops, their price tags suddenly vanished, as new memories entered their heads. Just then, another pair identical to their own appeared on the rack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See Jyabi? I told you that they look like ours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... It is stange that there is a model that looks identical to ours. I wonder where did they find these. We didn't quite bought ours from a regular store.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe they have really good supplier...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Possibly... Hey how much time has it been since we came?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About 15 minutes.... Don't tell me you really want to leave already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are supposed to meet Miyabi in about an hour. I think we should head back to our rooms and unpack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can do that after we meet her. Let's look around a bit more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't know you were a shopaholic like Thiki.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not. I just want to see if I find something interesting here. Can we stay here a bit more? Please...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, fine... I guess we can look a bit more. But seriously.... Stop with the puppy face! Do you want to be treated like a dog?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't mind it.... Hehehe...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez... What am I going to do with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd thus, the two continued to look around.</span></div></div>",

After getting off the massage tables, Nagisa addressed them:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right guys, lastly we will give you our special mineral bath treatment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mineral bath? Isn't that the one we heard about on the ship?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes it is. We heard that you didn't use it on your way here, so we thought we could let this as the finishing touch of your treatment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks! I was really curious how it would be.\", said Thiki in a slightly ditzy tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two escorted the group to a room with a large bath, almost as big as a small pool, as the hot steam was filling the air. The towels that were stuck to the boys' chests remained in place as no one commented on the fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, now you can sit here and enjoy the bath. The  recommended time for bathing is about 10-15 minutes. When you're done please come back to the salon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group nodded at Madoka's words as she and Nagisa left. The group slowly walked in the water until it was up to their necks as the warm and pleasant feeling made their minds wander off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This feels so good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, right? Don't you think as well Thiki-chan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, duh. This is really something you don't enjoy every day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed... It really is something unique...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the four enjoyed the bath, their changes continued. The boys' arms and hands slimmed down and feminized as muscle was formed in all of the right places, giving them quite the arm strength. The same happened to Thiki as her own arms became a bit more muscular. Their waists slimmed down a lot, as in the end, each of them now had a gorgeous hourglass figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir hair also grew, with Thiki's and Zideri's being down to their mid backs as the color fully become dirty blond and chestnut brown respectively. Hirari's and Mareka's grew only do their shoulders as their hair color became a light brown and bubblegum pink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the initial relaxation, Mareka kept looking at Hirari still a bit concerned about earlier. It wasn't like him to just brush off a problem without telling anyone. Zideri also noticed that as he looked a bit dejected, not knowing what is up with his friend. Deciding to act, Mareka turned to Hirari and asked him:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hirari, I know you said that there is nothing wrong earlier, but I think you should tell us what's going on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Huh? I don't know what you're saying...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't fool me. I've known you for long enough to know when you're hiding something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right Hirari-chan! I knew something was wrong when you just brushed off our question earlier!\", exclaimed Zideri as Thiki was also looking at him worriedly as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If there is anything wrong, you can tell us.\", said Mareka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\"</span></div></div>",

But it wasn't the new ones that worried him, but his fading old ones... He knew he couldn't deceive his friends, so he needed to tell them the truth. But he had to find a way to phrase the issue without sounding like he was losing his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... am... very unsure of my relationship with Yagye-chan...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unsure? How?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I don't know if I should consider him family or not...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis friends looked at each other a bit before Thiki gave out a sigh and replied to him:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is with how overprotective he is with you, right? He gets quite overbearing at times, I know, but it is because he cares a lot about you. As for considering him family... Well, you two got so well together because of how caring he was with you, from what I understood. But I can tell it is much more then that... After the whole thing that happened to his sister and all... He sees her in you, in quite a few ways... That is why he cares about you like a sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHirari was getting really confused by what he had heard, especially about the whole sister situation. But the details he just heard matched with the new memories that were forming in his head, which made his mind become a bit fuzzy as he continued to listen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, the boys' faces feminized as their noses became smaller and their cheekbones higher, which now more or less matched Thiki's face. Their eyes also changed color as Thiki's green became burgundy, Mareka's brown turned green and Zideri's blue became a bit darker. Hirari's remained the same blue, but in the middle of his eyes, a pink cross formed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys' necks also slimmed down as their Adam's apples vanished as they felt their throats sore for a split second. Their backs curved as well as their shoulders became round and small. Lastly, Thiki's breasts grew one last time, becoming a pair of small and healthy F-cups. But despite the size of her bust, she seemed to have little problems with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thiki is right.\", continued Mareka with a serious look in his eyes. \"When we were still enemies, he came to save you not caring about the danger or repercussions... I can tell that he cares for you like a sister, or maybe even a bit more, after I saw how attached to you he is... But you don't know how to respond to that, do you? You said that you really like him as a person, but you feel like he is treating you like a kid, didn't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHirari's mind was slowly accepting the words he heard as being true since at the moment, he was hardly remembering his original life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes... Sometimes I feel like he just sees me just as someone that needs to be protected, just because I am not on par with him or the others... It makes me frustrated... like I am being weak...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\"But that's not true!\"\", exclaimed both Zideri and Thiki in unison.</span></div></div>",

He knew about Yagye's past and understood why he was always jumping in front of him, but he couldn't understand his constant need to do so, even if it was against Hirari's wishes. As he was thinking, the towels finished changing into bikini tops. Zideri's orange and yellow one became a perfect match of his lower half as did Hirari's light pink one with a red flower formed on the left side of it. Mareka's became hot-pink as a tip formed in the middle of the top, until it became a big rectangle that showed a considerable amount of his chest. Thiki's top also finished its transformation as a white section appeared in the lower middle part of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right.\", said Zideri as he clung onto Thiki, which surprised her. \"I also fight for the sake of my friends, not only because of the promise I made to grandpa Kurogane. And just like Yagye, we do not consider each other just friends. We are almost like sisters given how much time we spent together so far. In fact, we might be even a bit more than that, right Thinki-chan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite his innocent claim, there was a deep meaning behind his words, which made Thiki smile as he embraced Zideri back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... That's right. We are even closer than siblings., since we spend our every day together., something that applies to Yumi-chin and the others as well. And I am sure it applies to you and Yagye too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, they all grew to their final ages. Zideri and Hirari grew to 16 years old as Mareka went to 18 years old, which made him much taller than the rest. Their hair also styled up as out of nowhere some hair ornaments appeared: three black ribbons for Hirari, two of which held his hair in small pigtails while the third rested atop the front bang; two green ringlets that held his hair in pigtails and a white headband for Zideri and a large pink bow for Mareka as the ends of his hair also curled up. While the boys still had a few more changes to go, Thiki who became 15, finished her transformation as a new identity was made for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does this mean we are really really close Shiki-chan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course we are.\", said Shiki back as the two embraced each other tighter, just two siblings would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile looking at the endearing view before them, Mareka turned to Hirari and said: \"Now see Hibrari? Just as Shiki and Zidori are close despite not being blood-related, the thing should apply to you. You surely understand, since you also had problems with your family. Just open your heart to him a bit more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment of silence, Hibrari smiled and replied back: \"Thanks Hareka-san. You and the others were really helpful today... And as for opening my heart more... maybe I will do that to you as well... Hehe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHareka was stunned about his reply for a second as he said back, with a faint blush on his cheeks, trying to sound as composed as possible:\"My... You say quite the bold things now... Then please, whenever you need me for anything, just say it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe...I will.\"</span></div></div>",

They looked in the bags and in closet, but they couldn't find it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is it?! It has to be here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEiran looked a bit concerned at Yagye as he began to get slightly frantic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Normally, I would say to just let it go... But given it is his eye-patch we are talking about, I can completely understand why he wants to find it so badly... Where could it have gone though? We just got here this morning...\", thought Eiran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two continued searching, Yagye's waist slimmed down considerably as it also became a bit toned as his arms gained some muscle as well while remaining slim. their hair also changed as Eirai's was now pitch-black that was now straight and down to her mid-back as Yagye's white strands of hair started to spread as the silver locks that remained started to turn white as well as his hair was now much wavier as it reached his lower back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they checked the nightstands and underneath their beds, Yagye was about to panic after finding nothing. But then, Eirai thought of something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Yagye, do you remember why did you take it off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I had to wash my face. I was still groggy after the boat ride so I went to the bathroom...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your bathroom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... No. I used the... public bathroom that is on this floor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then there it is. Let's go there... But before that... I think you should put on your swimsuit top...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYagye looked down and was a bit surprised and embarrassed that he forgot to put his top on. After looking through the bags, he found a matching piece to his bottom part: white with pink lines that formed a checkered pattern with frills that rested on the upper section of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two left the room, with Yagye making sure the door was locked before heading to the restroom. On their way, they passed a couch and a few chairs that were left on the corridor to have people watch the view of the island through the window next to them. When they reached the restroom, just as Eiran expected, the eye-patch was right on the sink, next to the towels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There it is.\", said Eirai with a small smirk on her face.</span></div></div>",

Despite the somewhat simple design, consisting only of some scraps of material, it held an immense amount of relevance to Yagye, especially the ribbon. After he put it over his right eye, he finally regained his composure and turned to Eirai to thank her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am really grateful for your help. Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No big deal... But you can say it with a bit more enthusiasm, you know? I swear, sometimes you are almost like Hikage. You must show a lot more emotion, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do show emotion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, only when Hirari is involved.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But do I really need to be more expressive otherwise? Or do want me to be like Katsuaragi or Homura?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's stretching it a little...\", said Eirai a bit amused of the remark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh... Maybe.\", continued Yagye with a small smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two then left the bathroom and decided to return to their rooms. As they were walking, Yagye's face became rounder and softer, free of any blemishes that he before. His eyelashes became a bit longer and his nose and ears became smaller as his face now resembled that of a beautiful girl. On the way however, Eirai stopped the small lounge area along the corridor and gestured to Yagye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we sit here and talk for a bit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? Shouldn't we prepare for when we are supposed to meet the others?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's... a bit personal. And I think you would be interested in talking about this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was a bit confused as to what she wanted to discuss, but since there was quite a good amount of time left until the meeting, he complied as they both sit on two opposing chairs. But before the conversation started, Yagye felt some discomfort along his back, which made him try to rub the sore area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something the matter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By back feels a little stiff. Please wait a second.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he rubbed the back, the pain seemed to fade away as it formed now a permanent arch as his shoulders also became rounded and delicate. He also winced a bit as the soreness moved to his throat which prompted him to rub his neck. The more he rubbed, the smaller the bulge in that area shrunk until it completely vanished. In turn, this made his vocal chords tighter as his voice became higher-pitched. Lastly, both his and Eirai's eyes tingled a bit as their blue eyes became red. After the soreness faded away, he turned his attention back to Eirai.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feeling better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I don't know where that soreness came from but it seems it is now gone. So, what did you want to talk about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... Remember when I said before that you worry too much about Hirari? I've been thinking for a while... While I think that you obviously go overboard sometimes, I think now that you actions are justified.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your eye-patch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it is time... for a little story about our eye-patches.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I guess you could say.... it is to not just know each other, but also to understand our actions... And I think that sharing it with somebody else is the best way to do it.\"</span></div></div>",

I go first.\", said Eirai as she gave a sigh and started talking. \"As you know, I decided to wear this eye-patch because of the endless bullying I received when I was younger. I wanted to stop felling inferior and childish, and then I came up with the idea of wearing an eye-patch. It was as a method to take away my worries and try to enjoy my everyday life as good as I could... but even after joining Hebijo, I still had a very big fear that people will mock me, either because of my size or my outbursts... I want people to see me as an adult, not a little girl, and Homura and the others were the first ones to accept me without once complaining about anything. Even Hareka-sama, who often teases me did that without pause. I know I still act like a kid at times... and I know that I don't have that deep of a reason to join Hebijo like the others did... But I decided to do my best at being a shinobi and keep looking forward. As painful as the past was, I want to leave it behind and look at what awaits me next...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYagye listened carefully to Eirai as he fidgeted. She also had a difficult past, even if she said it wasn't so bad... But she persevered and now lives her life without thinking much of the past... While he...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the story, Yagye's hair turned completely white as it became quite wavy as two longer bangs framed his now feminine face. Eirai's completely black hair straightened out instead as her swimsuit became a black school swimsuit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now's your turn...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing his reluctance to speak, Eirai gave a sad sigh before trying to help him with talking about the eye-patch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... already know why you wanted to year it... To not forget your sister, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... The eye-patch is made from Nozomi's ribbon that she had always wore before... the accident...\" His voice started to tremble a bit, but he tried to keep his composure and continued talking. \" After that, I cried for days without going out... but soon I realized that slowly my memory of her would soon fade as she was no longer present in my life. I was mortified then... To forget about your own sister... is something I could never forgive myself for doing... So I made this eye-patch to try and remember her... I then slowly went back to try living my life... But when I enrolled at the academy, I found Nozomi's splitting image.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hirari...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything, from her personality to her face resembled her to a tee... So I then decided to try and treat her as the way I treated Nozomi...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But he wasn't your real sibling...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know... He said that, Asuka said that, Mareka said that... But I wanted to try and live the lie as much as I could, as he kept getting stronger any day, and soon he wouldn't need me anymore...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was talking, both of them reached their final ages: 16 years old. Yagye's long white hair then styled itself into two pigtails as two shuriken formed to support them, as he became a bit taller as well. Meanwhile, Eirai's breasts grew to A-cups as her new identity was formed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do realize that Hibrari won't leave you behind, right Yagyue? Not unless you keep considering him your sibling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hareka-sama once told me that he wants to get stronger to grow in your eyes. You always look at him like he is a kid, and that upsets him a lot. Besides... why would you only consider him somebody else? Wasn't he already your spiritual sibling or something? You know, like how Yumi and her group is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that time, Yagyue had an epiphany as he stood there shocked for a second. Then , he slowly closed his eyes and with a rare smile told his friend:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... You're right... Heheh... I wonder what is it with you Mirai that you lately know exactly what to say to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh... Well, we've been hanging out lately... With no war, or battles or anything like that, we just- Oh no...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We lost track of time! We have to go downstairs to meet the others.\", said Mirai as she grabbed Yagyue's hand and rushed to the stairs. While initially surprised, Yagyue smiled again a bit as he let his friend lead the way.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Jyabi was still looking to see if they would find something for Murasaki. He didn't understand why he would do that, because other than the fact of her annoying him with her constant pessimistic attitude and passive behavior, he didn't had that much of a good impression of her. But deep down, he knew that she was his friend, and that despite not admitting it, he didn't like her to be upset most of the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, their hair finished changing. Jyabi's became a chestnut brown as it cascaded down his back as he looked around. I the end it reached her lower back as the strand of hair sprouted from the middle of his head that fell forward. Cyona's finished turning honey blond as it didn't go past his shoulders. His hair became a bit messy as some curls stood up from his mane. Also, their arms slimmed down as they became a little toned as their shoulders rounded out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a bit more searching, the two reached the accessories section of the shop. There were bracelets, head bands, necklaces and much more, all in a variety of colors and designs. After looking around a bit, Cyona signaled Jyabi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jyabi-chan! Come over, I think I found something cute!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ta-da!\", he exclaimed with a big smile on his face as he took out a plain red head band.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this for Murasaki? She isn't against red, but I think she would rather like something darker.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is for you silly. It would really cute on you! Here! Try it on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know how cute you think is going to look, but whatever...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he put the head band on, just like the swimsuits from before, the price tag vanished as a new head band appeared on the place Cyona picked the former up. Their memories changed again to adapt to the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't it look cute? I think I should take one too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cyona, in case you haven't noticed is the same as my head band... And if you are looking for something cute, go look for something Hibrari or Zidori would wear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you wanted us to have similar accessories. And I think it fits me a great deal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... First of all, it doesn't fit your hear, or personality. I mean, seriously, you are like a combination of those two kids and Katsuaragi, but more masochistic.... And second of all, I told you that matching clothes are not my thing! I mean, you don't see Imu or Murasaki wear identical clothes, now don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon Cyona! We can't stay here much longer. Miyabi and the others are supposed to come soon. Let's just find something nice for Murasaki and leave already! If you want to wander off here, then do it tomorrow. We are staying here a week after all, we have plenty of time.\", said Jyabi in a serious and somewhat stern tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCyona gave out a sad nod as he followed behind him. Their relationship was without a doubt complicated, but there was something that emerged from it as well. The reason why Jyabi compared the matching clothes situation to Imu and Murasaki was that just like them.... they were now siblings.</span></div></div>",

While looking around, their faces feminized as their eyes went through a much more interesting change. Jyabi's left green eye became blue as the opposite happened to Cyony's right green eye, making them both having heterochromatic eyes. In the end, both had beautiful faces which would attract the attention of any boys. Also, their necks slimmed down as the bulge in the area vanished soon as well, now both having very feminine voices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he continued looking, an idea popped in Jyabi's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Cyony! Didn't Murasaki say she likes playing video games?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Huh? Yeah, she does...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect! I think I know what to get her.\", said Jyabi with a smirk on his face. \"Now, what type should I look for? I think she said she likes RPGs...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCyony looked a bit dejected as his brother seemed more exited picking a gift for Murasaki rather than talking with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I said I like punishments... But the silent treatment definitely not my favorite... Does he like Murasaki that much...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was in deep thought, Jyabi looked around and finally he found something good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I think this would be great for her. It is about controlling and fighting gods or something like that... I am not going to lie, the guy on the cover kind of gives me the creeps, but then again, it is Murasaki we are talking about. Anything gloomy or dark doesn't faze her too much and given how this thing looks it would be great for her, the whole dark story and all... Kind of sucks that I didn't took my wallet with me so I could buy this right now, but I am sure Hikaru will keep at least a copy of the game for later. After all, how are we supposed to take our wallets if we are in our swimsuits, right?\", said Jyabi with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What's wrong? Weren't you excited to look around a second ago? Are you not a fan of video games or what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's just... Nevermind, let's just leave. It is time we head back to meet Miyabi-chan and the others anyways...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJyabi was looking a bit dubious at his brother, not understanding what was up with him all of a sudden as he followed him back to the entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what's up... Did I say something wrong? Then again, he asks for it most of time and doesn't give a damn about it anyways, in fact he is actually into insults and punishments...

Do you like Murasaki so much Jyobi-san?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...?\", was all that a confused Jyobi could say at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You talk about her a great deal lately and you seem to want to please her more than usual...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hold on Cryona... I think that you got something wrong...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I really? I saw you get into her room a lot in the past few weeks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You saw me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get that I can annoy you at times, but I do it because that is how I show how much I care about you... But if you want want Murasaki to do that instead... I guess I understand, I mean she likes games a lot, seems more relaxed around you lately and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't put words into my mouth you moron!\", yelled Jyobi. \"Just because I spend a lot of time with her that doesn't mean I replaced you with her! I only wanted to pick a gift to make her happier... I mean do you think I would like to stay all the time with somebody who almost never leaves their room?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why did you keep going to her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Well...\" Jyobi was gaining a faint blush on his cheeks as he didn't know how to phrase his idea. \"I-I thought that since Murasaki also had a sister, I thought she could give me some tips over how to act with you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCryona was dumbstruck by what he just heard and wanted to say anything but decided to listen further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She and Imu... lately got on really good terms and I went to her one day to try and tell me how to improve our relationship. At the beginning, she always tried to deny everything, but slowly she began talking. It needed me to play some games with her on the computer, some of which actually being quite good, and also having me giving her tips over how to be more confident... or assertive... I didn't actually understand what she wanted in the end. But what caught me off guard was that their relationship kind of resembled ours... It seems like we already have a great bond, at least by her standards. Well, I guess I can take you to an amusement park or something like they did or go on a picnic or visiting a museum or- W-Why are you looking at me like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCryony's face was a mixture of shock, happiness and a bit of sadness as he quickly wiped off the small tears in his eyes as he hugged his brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you! Thank you Jyobi-chan! I knew I shouldn't have doubted you! I knew you cared about me more than anyone! I love you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah! D-Don't say that out loud you idiot! It's already bad enough that others see me as a sadist. The last thing I need is that anyone to think I am in love with my sister! Don't you imagine Yozakura scolding us for a few days for even bringing this up? And let go of me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... But I wanted to hug you more...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you just sound like Midori! Cut it out with the childish act, it looks stupid on you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe... And there come the insults I love...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just stop it with your masochist act and your fantasies!... Let's just get back, okay...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCryony was now practically running a bit, pulling Jyobi along with him by his arm, with a big smile on his face. As much as he disliked the whole situation though, Jyobi couldn't help but let out a small smile seeing his brother happy again.</span></div></div>",

Their memories changed so that instead of checking the rooms, they went upstairs to look after Yagyue's eye-patch. Also since Mirai finished her changes, she already became a ninja, or shinobi if anyone would prefer a more traditional way of saying it, and such her new memories and life was already finished. In the meantime, Yagyue was also mostly done with his changes as well, but there were a couple more things to alter before he could be called a real shinobi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of minutes later, Hibrari and his group came up to them, having finished their treatment. After they ended their bath together and dried themselves, they told Madoka and Nagisa that they needed to go and meet the others, and such they postponed the rest of the treatment for later, most likely to enjoy it with the rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys! Hope we didn't let you wait for us for too long.\", said Shiki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem. We just got here ourselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike Mirai, Shiki already became a shinobi with her own set of memories already done changing. All that was left were the boys. As they started talking about random things they saw around the resort, the boys' skins finished tanning, giving each of then a more exotic, Asian appeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Hareka gave Hibrari a nudge and pointed him to Yagyue. Taking a big gulp of air he came closer to him and whispered:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we talk about something in private?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two walked a bit, with the others giving small smiles as they looked at the two before returning to their own talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So? What did you want to talk about?\", asked Yagyue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... It is about our relationship.\", said Hibrari slightly worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYagyue became very surprised and suddenly became a bit nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, they felt a small itch on their chests but decided to ignore it because their conversation was a lot more important. Underneath their bikinis, their nipples became pink and sensitive as they grew in size. Fat also started to accumulate on their chests as small A-cup breasts formed which continued to grow. Also in their private area, their young boyhoods were shrinking, but this change was much more subtle, thus it was unnoticed by the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... wanted to apologize.\", said Hibrari.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F-For what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before I told you that I wanted you to leave me alone as I felt that you were not letting me what I wanted. I thought you just saw me as a kid, since I am nowhere near as good as you or the others, or that you just thought of me as incompetent.... It wasn't until I figured out that you thought of me as your sister that I realized that you feared losing me... I understand what you meant when you always jumped in front of me whenever we were in trouble... I didn't knew I was so much like your sister-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please stop. I need to say something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is true... Everything you said is true... I initially just saw you as Nozomi's replacement and I tried my best to protect you like an older sister would... But eventually, you became strong on your own, and I started to see myslef as unneeded but I continued to act as always, in hope that would still a need to be next to you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yagyue-chan...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... But you said I was overbearing and that I don't let you be free. I denied that this was true... But after the battle royale and all the other battles up until this point, I saw how much you have grown. I then started to understand that what you said was true... I always make you cling to me like you are Nozomi, but are someone else entirely. So please, forgive me for having you think as a mere-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wanted to continue, but just then Hibrari hugged him, which made him froze in the middle of the sentence. Also, right now, their breasts were large B-cups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I don't mind being compared to your sister. In fact, I am honored. To be considered by you someone so close to your heart makes me very happy. And when I said \"angry\" before, it was merely an exaggeration. How can I be angry at one of the people who speak to me truthfully, without my Kagan influencing you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hibrari...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you are right about one thing. I am not your sister. I am somebody else. But that doesn't mean we can't be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYagyue was confused as to what Hibrari wanted to say. While it is true that they shared a strong bond, that didn't make them siblings. And yet, there seemed to be a different meaning to his words...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this moment, their breasts became healthy and gorgeous D-cups, with Yagyue's being slightly larger, being nicely shown by their bikinis. Inside the bottoms, their boyhoods became just tiny nubs, ready to be pulled in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know how Zidori-chan, Yumi-chan and the others consider themselves siblings despite not being related? I was thinking we should do the same.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's make a vow to be together like siblings! I know I can't replace your sister, but I hope that we would be able to act like family, or even more if you would let me. So what do you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYagyue was left speechless and for a second was frozen in place. Then, small tears formed in his eyes as he tightly hugged Hibrari, which greatly surprised him. Just then, their boyhoods went up inside them and became young womanhoods that signaled the new beginning of their lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! I want us to be sisters Hibari!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-Not so tight Yagyu-chan!... And we are \"soul sisters\". I just told you we can be friends and sisters at the same time now, without actually being related. I hope now you will let me show that I am as capable as you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha.... Of course I will let you show me your potential. It is my duty as \"big sister\" to do so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two gave out a small laugh as they started to walk back to the others, hand in hand. Both of them were happy beyond belief at the moment, now that their confusions about each other have been cleared. Still... There was a small flame that ignited in them today... One that depending on their actions with each other, might burn brighter... </span></div></div>",

I understand he also had quite a troubled past with the whole shinobi duty and his ability. So it kind of makes sense to try and avoid the subject not only because it is a personal matter but it also is a uncomfortable for him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not worried.\", replied Hareka with a somewhat proud look in his eyes. \"He has grown a lot these past few months. I am sure he knows what do to. After all, he and Yagyue have been together ever since the beginning. They both know what to say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others nodded to Hareka's answer, feeling that the fact that the two were inseparable ever since they started the academy, it was a major factor for them to know each other better than anyone. Just then, Hareka's and Zidori's nipples tingled a bit as they grew larger, pinker, and more sensitive. Also, Zidori's chest also started to develop small breasts, currently being at around AA-cups. Just then , Zideri once again jumped at Shiki and and hugged her arm tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am sure Hibrari will get be okay. After all, he can become siblings like we are, right Shiki-chan? I am really happy you are my sister!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Z-Zidori-chin... D-Don't say it like that! You know I am not good at acting at things like these like Yozakura-chin.\", said a flustered Shiki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it is true, right? Aren't you happy we are a family?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I can't deny that... Spending time with you and the others surely filled my heart all these years. It sure was something I will never forget... Like... irreplaceable...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay! I am so happy to hear you say that Shiki-chan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zidori-chin...! Not so tight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the two interact put a little smile on Hareka and Minori's faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kind of makes us wish we also were like that in the beginning Hareka-sama... We only thought about ourselves back then and how to not disappoint Hebijo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... We have to thank Homura for pulling us together after everything that happened and making us a close as we are right now... And we should thank the girls from Hanzo's academy as well for pulling the wool that was over our eyes...\", said Hareka solemnly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two were talking, Hareka's chest expanded a bit as A-cup breasts formed from it. Zidori's grew to large B-cups as he continued to hug Shiki. Also, his boyhood started to shrink as it started to be pulled inside his groin.</span></div></div>",

I know that only Yumi was Kurogane's relative out of all of you. You did grow together and achieved a sense of unity I doubt most us have, but... Where exactly did the whole \"family\" matter come from? Is it a sense of familiarity, or you just considered yourselves to be a family ever since Kurogane took you in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question was quite surprising as no one expected such a serious matter to be asked out of the blue. But Hareka had his motives. He was always made the perfect child, exactly as his mother wanted him to become, to the point where he was nothing more than a mannequin for her. No one asked for his opinion of what to do with his life for a long time, and even after he joined Hebijo, he still hadn't found anyone to actually talk to. It wasn't until Hibrari came, when he actually wanted to listen and know his torment without wanting anything in return. After fighting him for the second time, he realized that he neither had the freedom to pursue his life how he wanted, and soon grew closer to him. Ever since then, he became almost a mother-figure to the rest of the Crimson Squad, always acting as Homura's second in command to ensure everyone was satisfied with their way of living. But he was having a difficult time actually understanding what a \"family\" actually was since he was mostly seen as a doll or a soldier for a long time, and seeing how united the Gessen girls are, made him interested in the family-like bond they shared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, his breasts grew to B-cups as Zidori's grew quite a lot, after hearing the question, making them into large and perky DD-cups as only a small nub was left between his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprising enough, Zidori closed his eyes and calmly told Hareka with a toothy grin:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It didn't happen because of anything like that... We became the way we are after understanding each other. Our pain, our secrets, our nightmares, we shared them with each other and got closer because of that... We all lost a lot, but began to enjoy what we have left. Even after grandpa died, we still had each other. We became a \"family\" to fill the holes the past caused us to appear in us. We are not bound by blood, but that doesn't mean we are not close. And right now, I can say.... that I grew over the past, thanks to my \"sisters\".\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone stood still, listening to Zidori heartfelt thoughts. He was one of the youngest and childish of all, but he knew how to keep his heart and thoughts in check. He was quite bright despite his infamous sweet tooth. Just after he finished, Shiki came closer and much to his surprise, she tightly hugged him, just as his new womanhood blossomed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Minori-chin... That really means a lot to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Why are you hugging me to tightly...? And why are you crying? I just said my thoughts, nothing more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know... I am just proud of my older sister...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-Don't say it like I am mature or anything.... Jeez... And you call me weird at times...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinori didn't break the hug as enjoyed having Shiki hold her close, but was a bit embarrassed by the whole scene right now. Looking at the two, the others were having each a small smile on their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you happy with the answer Hareka-sama?\", asked Mirai<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you could say that...\", said Hareka with a small grin on his face. \"I think I get it now...\"</span></div></div>",

On their way there, their nipples enlarged and pinkened as their breasts started to grow in. But while Cryona's grew to B-cups by the time they neared the lobby, Jyobi's already finished their growth at AA-cups. While not letting to be shown, at least not yet, a ping of jealousy was forming in him as he looked at Cryona's breasts. Also, with his chest already finishing its change, his boyhood began shrinking at a faster pace than the others had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, they reached the lobby, and upon seeing Hareka, Cryona almost ran in his direction if Ryobi wouldn't pull on him to slow down a bit. Just then, Yagyu and Hibari returned to the group as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys! Sorry for taking so long!\", exclaimed Cryona as the others looked in his direction,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a problem.

You gotta take us there Jyobi-chan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! I want to check all the clothes they have so I can impress my friends back home!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! Hold your horses! I never said I will take you there! You can go by yourselves anyways!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you don't want to go and spend time together Jyobi-chin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" He took a glance at Cryona and after he looked at him a bit puzzled he replied back to Midori and Shiki: \"Okay fine! But only if Cryona comes as well. He found out a lot of things you two might like and he would have a lot more patience with you two anyways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't mind. In fact, the more the merrier, right Shiki-chan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well of course. We would be happy to have Cryona join us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCryona had now a big smile on his face as Jyobi was  a bit embarrassed of what he just suggested, he he couldn't help but feel a bit prideful of saying that as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You suggested that because Cryona-chin is your brother and you care about him a lot right?\", asked Shiki in a whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Well...\" As Jyobi was trying to muster up his courage to reply, his manhood shrunk completely as he became a woman. \"Y-Yes, of course... I mean, why wouldn't I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heheh...I knew you like Cryona a lot Ryobi-chin!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just be quiet before he hears you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As the rest went to their usual talk, Hareka beckoned Hibari and Cryona to talk with him a bit in private. As they walked away, Hareka and Cryona's breasts started to accelerate their growth, now reaching D-cups as their testes burrowed their way inside of them. Looking at them make a bit of space, Yagyu pointed out to Mirai:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope Hareka doesn't plan anything again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, it's Hareka-sama we are talking about. As playful as he is, he wouldn't dare to try anything funny... in broad daylight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you are right.\"</span></div></div>",

It has to do with my position in my team... and as a role model...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHibari and Cryona were a bit confused by what he actually meant with his statement, but remained silent to hear the whole story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... For a while now, Mirai has said that she wants herself to be like me, in regards to maturity, knowledge and kindness. Due to her... less than pleasant past, she never had somebody to model herself after and she began to idolize me for quite some time... I also started to think myself as a mature person within my group... After our previous encounters with each other and how much you and Minori said you enjoyed my company being in contrast with your childlessness, I started to consider acting like an older sister.... But I don't think I am up to either of those things...\", said Hareka, with a sad expression on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, his and Cryona's breasts grew and grew up to large and perky F-cups. They were still smaller than Murasaki's but they nonetheless were having two of the biggest busts in the group. Their boyhoods also shrank further as a cavity was forming in their abdomen. If they were asked right now, they couldn't say if they were boys or girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am nowhere near a good older sister-type. I couldn't rival the closeness Imu has with Murasaki, nor I am as down-to-earth like Ikaruga or Yozakura in terms of daily routines... And given my... tendencies, I don't believe I am that good of a role model either. Mirai should take more from Yomi than me. She is kind, good-mannered, and other than her addiction to bean sprouts, there really aren't flaws with her. She always have been free, despite her poverty and always remained herself... Meanwhile I had to be a puppet to my mother and be exactly as she told me to... How can somebody like me, who once even became an empty shell be a role model for anyone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a heavy silence for a few seconds until Hibari and Cryona, after exchanging glances and nodding to each other, each took one of Hareka's hands and firmly grasped them. Hareka looked at the two with surprise, before Hibari started talking:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is no need to look down on yourself Hareka-san. You are truly a role model. Even I consider you that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just like you said, you are somebody who understands the world better than anyone given that you are among the oldest of us... but that doesn't mean to be stiff so that you can look \"mature\". Ikaruga-san and Yozakura-san have their own views, standards and way of seeing things. You shouldn't compare yourself to others just to think you should act your age. Me and Minori-san are both 16 and we both still eat ice-cream for dinner and play in the water like we did 10 years ago. It doesn't mean to sacrifice your pleasures just because you don't think you're acting properly. If no one tells you that, then there aren't any problems. I respect you a lot Hareka-san the way you are. And I wouldn't sacrifice the current you for anything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHareka was left speechless by Hibari's encouraging words. This reminded him why he loved her company so much. Then Cryona started talking:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not only that! You are already like an older sister. While it's true that Yomi acts more like one-san did, she still considers herself to be a teen. Me and Ryobi-chan talked to her before and she said that you are truly the most mature out of everyone she knows. And unlike Miyabi-chan, you managed to keep your smile, something she doesn't show too much.  You are an\" older sister\" that managed to remain \"young\". And I like you very much for that! I am sure that if one-chan was still around, she would say the same thing! So thank you for indulging me in my punishments and telling me when to stop if need be!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the boys' last traces of their previous identities vanished as new flowers bloomed in this new world. After releasing her hands, Hareka wiped some small tears before replying back to the two:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Hibari, Ryona. I will try to be the role model for Mirai, like she wanted, and I will attempt to become an \"older sister\" that watches over the others as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\"Glad we could help!\"\" said the two girls with a goofy smile on their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, almost as if it was fate, Mirai ran up to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something wrong Haruka-sama? I saw you cry for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, everything is fine Mirai. I just thought of ways as to how to make you a proper fine, mature young lady. We will start the teaching once we get back from the vacation if you like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, please! I want to know everything!\", said Mirai excitingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then it's a deal.\", said Haruka while stroking her her and returning with the others to the group. Behind her, Hibari and Ryona smiled happily seeing Haruka back to her usual self.</span></div></div>",

We were wondering where you were!\", exclaimed Asuka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where have you been?\", asked Yumi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We just finished looking around. Sorry we couldn't come with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, Haruka. We just arrived as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. And we just talked on the way here. Nothing eventful happened. I am curious what you have seen here though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen everyone gathered together and started their own conversations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-So you found a game f-for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. It was an RPG with something about fighting gods, neutrality and such and there was this super creepy skull-faced dude on the cover that seemed to be the protagonist's... advisor or something like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-That sounds like a great game. Nee-san, can we take it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about buying it. Ryobi-chan said she will buy it for you so that you can smile more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't say it like that you moron! It sounds like I am asking something out of her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I don't mind it. Thank you. If you may, can we play it together nee-san?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. It does sound interesting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said anything about a game?\", asked Katsuragi. \"Me, Hikage and Yozakura found this awesome game where you are an ancient warrior fighting an army with your allies, completing missons and also having these hidden tasks that you must complete to get a better ending.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! That sounds awesome! I want to play it too with Yozakura-chan and Shiki-chan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm game for it Minori! Though I am surprised you actually played a video game like that Yozakura-chin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Well I thought we could use some of the tactics used there for us as well and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's lying. She liked it a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I knew it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What are ya sayin'?! I just played it cause it was a good way to advance our training! Don't put lies in my mouth Hikage-san!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are not very convincing with your accent slipping like that. And you are way too stiff. You must relax and enjoy one of these awesome mineral baths they have here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are those here as well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Ikaruga-san. Me, Yagyu-chan, Minori-chan Shiki-chan and Haruka-san enjoyed our bath here. The feeling in there is amazing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But does that mean you already had one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. We went at the baths from the ship and we relaxed in there. We talked with some members of the crew. Apparently, it has a lot of benefits for your body.\", said Yomi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't say... That explains why my skin feels so soft it glistens!\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"I think that is an exaggeration Haruka-sama.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, if it really has rejuvenating properties, I say we should all go in there tomorrow. The bath is big enough for all of us I believe. It even looked like an Olympic pool in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to go there with Ryobi-chan there right now! Can we go now please...?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! It's the middle of the day almost and I don't want to just stay inside on a sunny day. Besides, I think we should all go and pick some clothes. I know that the manager said it is okay to be in our swimsuits, but it feels kind of bare now. We must've been like this since morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of letting things bare, after I talked with Yomi and Ikaruga...\" Murakumo stopped talking to remove her mask which revealed her nervous but still determined face to everyone. \"... I-I decided to not wear the mask that often...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh?! Really Murakumo-chan?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes... I-I want to talk with the others freely like you all do... I-I want to be closer to you all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am happy... Finally someone I can relate to...\", said Murakumo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am happy for you Mura- Kyaaah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While on the subject of being a bit more bold, what about some little fun right now Ikaruga?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K-Katsuragi-san! Let go of my chest this instant!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the other talking and having fun, Asuka, Yumi, Miyabi and Homura looked with smiling faces at the rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like all the differences from before are still there, but they seem to finally get along, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Miyabi-san. I am happy that we manged to bury the animosity between us and moved forward together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it was bound to happen. I mean, after everything we've been through lately, we had to get drawn to each other eventually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nListening to their friends, Asuka jumped in front of them and declared:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are a shinobi family after all, aren't we? After all, this \"family\" exists based on the bonds between us, right? Then it's obvious that we are inseparable right now, right? As a \"family\" I mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three replied back with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Obviously.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four then returned to the rest, ready for the feast Hanzo made for them tonight, celebrating their friendship and bonds along with the others. As if on instinct, Asuka held Homura's hand without even noticing, which caused Homura to blush on the way back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe papers made the the wishes come true, despite not actually being what was originally intended. Still, The essence of the dreams was made reality, and everything was to the girls exactly as it should be... On the side note, Hanzo didn't know what the wishes did, nor did the fact that they were even made. For him, it was merely a day made for his granddaughter and her friends.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I want to know what the game Jessie plays is all about!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwins Brandon and Aaron Thomas were currently in their house, alone, waiting for their parents to come home to go together to the park and play. Both had blond hair and blue eyes and were both 6 years old. They were currently dressed in black T-shirts with a  white jacket to go on top of them and they wore dark-blue jeans on. Since today was a little cold, they had to wear something that would make sure they wouldn't get cold. Still, this wasn't enough to break their enthusiasm, as they already wore their white sneakers, already prepared to get outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was something that bothered the two boys. Their older cousin Jessie, who was an avid gamer, bought game that drew the two's attention. It seemed to be called Persona 4 Golden according to him, and it was about a group of teenagers solving a mystery and fighting supernatural monsters, while the protagonist, a transfer student, gets to know his new friends, his caretakers and himself better, making close bonds with all of them. This intrigued the two boys, as most other games Jessie played were either fighting, hack and slash or strategy games, and they didn't appeal to them as much as this one. They wanted to play it themselves, but having an age restriction, their parents wouldn't let them, much to their disappointment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Jessie gave them a new ray of hope, as they revealed the series also had an animated series, which was airing on TV. However, since the show was after their sleeping time, and since their parents wouldn't let them watch on the computer, they had no choice but to try and get more information from Jessie. He told him a bit more about the story, as well as that the protagonist's name in the show was Yu Narukami, but he didn't want to get himself into trouble by disclosing too much about the game's darker themes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't he tell us more? I mean, I know the story is a bit scary, but still, a bit more info wouldn't have been a problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He must be afraid mom and dad will get mad at him for telling us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably. But we didn't ask him for all the details.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's true as well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins had similar hobbies and personalities, making it hard at times to say who is who. Both liked to do sport, but weren't actually too open with the other kids either, as they preferred spending time with their family. They made a few friends at the kindergarten, but only a handful so far. They just liked spending time more with each other, but they still wanted to somehow make more friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what should we do? Can we ask Jessie to let us see an episode when we visit him next time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think he would want to. And I don't want to get him in trouble because of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me neither...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two were a bit at a loss here with their dilemma. They wanted to know more about the characters and the story, but on the same token, they didn't know how... And besides Yu, Chie and Yukiko, another two characters from the game drew their interest a bit. According to Jessie, they were best of friends and would do anything together, their relationship somehow mimicking theirs in a sense, almost wishing they would meet them in person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't want to use this... But I am too curious.\", said Aaron as he picked up a coin from his pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't that the coin the old lady who we helped cross the street gave to us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is. Remember what she said? That if we wish for something, this coin will fulfill it, but just once or twice. Maybe we should wish to meet the characters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know... It seems a bit of a waste.\", said Brandon. \"Shouldn't we wait for another idea to come to us? Maybe we could wish for something else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we wait more, we might forget about the coin, or mom could take by accident, or who knows what other thing might happen... Besides, didn't you say you wanted to meet Chie? You said you liked her personality.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True... But what exactly should we wish then? For us to be in their world alone? It could be dangerous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron took a second to ponder before figuring out an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got this.\", he said, with Brandon looking at him expectantly as he grasped the coin tight. \"We wish we could be in the Persona 4 world, spending time with the group, as much as Chie and Yukiko would.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two were a bit skeptical of the whole wish thing, as it seemed weird an old lady to give them a magic coin just like that, but much to their surprise, the coin shined brightly, the light enveloping both of them. Once the light faded away, the two were gone.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As soon as the light came, it faded away just as quick. The two boys closed their eyes in case the radiance returned for about 30 more seconds before opening their eyes. They needed a bit to adjust their eyes after the light, but as soon as their sight returned, they were stunned by what they saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What.. the...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were no longer in their living room. Instead they appeared to be on a street, but nowhere near their home town. They were on a small road which seemed to be in the countryside, with a few houses on their left and some crop fields to their right. The sky was slightly cloudy, and judging by the temperature, it seemed to be morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't the setting or the different hour that surprised the two boys, but rather a sign which was at a fork in the road. The writing on it seemed to be in a different language, and none of the letters seemed to look even remotely like the English alphabet they knew. But there was something about that seemed familiar to them when it came down to the letters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that...Japanese?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right! It looks just like the writing that was in some of Jesse's games! Does this mean... We're in Japan?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's... awesome! The wish worked! And how doubtful you were about the wish!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you were as well!\", said Brandon with a pout. \"So... This is the town the game takes place right? Yasoinaba... or something like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I think that's the name of the place... You know, it's not that bad. It kind of looks like the places in the countryside we saw on vacation.\", said Aaron, as he looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True... Maybe Jesse was exaggerating a bit with how remote this place is. I mean, there aren't any farms or anything like that... This just looks like the suburbs to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two continued looking around, until they heard some footsteps coming their way. When they looked at the direction of the steps, they saw a boy wearing what appeared to be a high school uniform. He was carrying a fishing rod and a box, which they assumed it was for the bait and hooks, and judging by the size, even for the fish he would catch. But what surprised them was his appearance. His bowl-shaped silver hair and matching eyes were enough to recognize as the protagonist of the Persona game, Yu Narukami. When he noticed the two boys, he looked a bit confused and walked up to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi there... Haven't seen you two before... Are you here to take a stroll?\", asked Yu, who much to their surprise, they were able to understand him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... In a way...\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Where are your parents?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two kids looked at each other, as they began whispering with their backs turned to Yu, who could only watch in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do we do? Should we tell him about the wish?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! He will not believe us regardless of how we try to say it. A magic coin? No regular person would believe it's real. And if we show it to him and he would want to try it, we won't have our way home anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... What should we do then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have an idea...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron was a bit surprised upon hearing Brandon's plan, but thought it would still be better than nothing. After discussing a bit more, they turned to Yu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually... We aren't from here. We got a bit lost. We were with a group and we got separated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Lost? You mean you are tourists?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYu pondered a bit as he looked the children in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What should I do? My uncle is busy today and he told me he will not be free until the afternoon. I could take them to the police station, but I don't want to make them feel uncomfortable. They look like foreigners, so they couldn't know the policies and rules... I could leave them at home, but that would make Nanako uncomfortable, and maybe them as well... I could let them stay at the Amagi Inn until my uncle is free. Maybe there could actually have a place for them to stay until them... I hope Yukiko will not mind it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he told the boys: \"Don't worry. I will take you somewhere to stay, until your situation could be solved. Do you mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not at all..\", said Brandon, both he and Aaron, surprised and happy Yu bought their lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Can you come with me then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys nodded as they followed him. But then Yu noticed something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I almost forgot to introduce myself. I am Yu Narukami.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two smiled a little, as they were now sure who he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Brandon Thomas, and this is my brother Aaron.\", smiled the two boys, as they followed Yu.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As they walked, there was an awkward silence among the three. Brandon and Aaron were a bit confused as to how they could understand Yu, as he was speaking English instead of Japanese. It was a bit strange how he managed to to speak their language so well, as they knew the English voices in the game were an option, not a necessity. But there was also the thing with the mystery Yu and his friends were trying to solve. The two wanted to ask him, as Jesse didn't gave them too many details regarding the whole story, but they couldn't just ask him out of the blue something like that without drawing suspicion that they know more than they seem. The problem was, they weren't exactly sure how to have a good conversation with him, as they didn't know too many things about him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYu was in a similar position. While he worked as a caretaker before, and the two boys looked a lot more polite than some of the kids he took care of, he didn't know what to talk about. The fact that they were foreigners made him a bit nervous, as he never talked with someone outside Japan before. Rise had a few meetings with people from abroad, and according to her, he just had to act natural, as any tourists would like people to not seem nervous or on edge. He knew he couldn't ask them about how they got lost or where their parents are, as they already seemed to be a bit flustered already when he talked about how they got lost. There also was something else that made him curious about the two, but for the moment, he decided to have a normal conversation with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you think of Yasoinaba? Do you like it here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\", said Brandon. \"It's looks great in our opinion. It is a pretty big town actually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We heard it was just a rural place in the boonies, but it looks more like the suburbs of a city.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's true... I guess people who come from the big cities think it's too quiet here. It's also a bit hard to get here. Only the train, and a few roads, one that leads to the highway pass through here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It still looks nice. I kind of like it here.\" Aaron's response put a small smile on Yu's face as he then asked: \"By the way, is there a tourist attraction here or something like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tourist attraction?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYu began thinking of places that might be popular they continued walking. However, without anyone's notice, something was happening to the two boys. They felt a bit of discomfort as their sneakers seemed to be getting tighter to their feet. They merely brushed it off, but in reality, the shoes compressed down, as their laces vanished without a trace. Their feet also were a bit cramped in the tighter footwear, but then, both the sneakers and the feet started to slowly grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Well we have a shrine. And on the hills, there is a popular picnic spot... But there aren't really any attractions here. But I guess a lot of people from the area come to Junes or the Amagi Inn quite often.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Amagi Inn?\", asked Brandon as both he and his brother recognized Yukiko's family name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it is an local inn which offers quite a lot of amenities. Politicians, actors or artists sometimes go there to relax, as it is considered a good place for those who want to stay somewhere quiet. And that's where you two will stay until I can get some help for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? We aren't coming with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am sorry, but I need to go to school and help with the school festival. That's why I am also wearing my uniform.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I thought you went fishing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did. I just finished. I am wearing my uniform in case I would run late. I know it's early in the morning, but it's a hobby of mine. I even caught a few fishes... But I must decide whether I should cook them or sell them...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys were a bit impressed by Yu. He seemed like a polite, caring young man who also had a thing for fishing. They learned more from a few minutes of talking with him than what Jesse's generic description gave. They were still a bit sad that he would part ways with him, but they brightened up once they remembered that if they go to the inn, they might meet Yukiko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, their feet finished growing, becoming a bit larger than they were before. But what was curious was that they seemed more petite than how a boy's foot would look like, as their nails also seemed to have gained a pedicure. As for their sneakers, they began to darken, the white making way for a brownish color while the material began to change, starting to look more like leather.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Do you like it here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To be honest, I really do\", answered Yu to Aaron's question. \"At the beginning, I was really uncaring of the setting. For me life would go on without much concern of what's around me. I really didn't care much, as I would be staying here for just a year and then return home... But many things have happened ever since my arrival here. And as time passed, I gained many friends here. I am still trying to discover, not just my friends, but myself as well. I feel like I couldn't be who I am right now if it wasn't for them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two were a bit impressed by Yu's perspective. They already knew from Jesse that Yu was in the game, starts off as someone without a real personality, but he develops himself as a person after interacting with many people from the town. And according to him, the show pretty much confirms his evolution, While he was just a fictional character, currently, he was as real as they were, and the brothers had to admit Yu was indeed a really nice person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring Yu's monologue, their hair began to grow a little. But while Aaron's hair grew only to the point it touched his ears, Brandon's were already almost covered, as his hair seemed to grow a bit faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sounds like you really care about your friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do.\", said Yu with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you tell us about them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. If you would like to, I would be happy to tell you a bit about them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys nodded as Yu began describing his friends. He talked about Yosuke and how he was the son of Junes's manager, as well how great they understand each other, calling themselves \"partners\" at time. He then told them about Rise and their career as idol before coming to Inaba, admiring her bright personality, an that despite being a year younger than him, she would usually be the one who would bring the group's morale up. He then talked about the rest of his friends, about Kanji's hobby to knit and how caring he could be at times despite his appearance, about Naoto's work as a detective and how much he respected her knowledge over a lot things and about Teddie's memory loss and his comedic antics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then came the highlights for the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then there is Yukiko. I kept her and Chie last as we are now going to Yukiko's place and the two would often be together most of the times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The two are best friends then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very much so. Even of they have such different personalities, they get along perfectly. This is the result of a friendship that developed over the years. It is safe to say the two know each other inside out by this point.\", said Yu as a joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then told them about the two. Chie's was a complete tomboy who loved eating meat, kung-fu movies and doing any sort of physical activity. She would usually speak her mind openly and would be the first most of the times to voice her opinion.She would often go to the Samegawa Flood Plain to train and would invite Yu at times to spar together. Yukiko was pretty much her opposite. She was refined, usually calm and was quite smart as well. She is next to inherit the local inn, thus she would often help the employees from time to time as well. There was also a slightly weird side of her, as she would break into random laughing fits at times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two listened intently, wanting to know as much as possible about their favorite characters. But there was something that was budding inside them. Brandon was starting to have a small desire to be more like Chie in a way, as he would want to be as strong both mentally as well as physically as her, while Aaron started to admire Yukiko's more polite behavior as well as her drive to help others out, even it would be time consuming, rather than focusing only on personal development.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, their calves began to vibrate a little as their muscles began altering. They seemed to change into a more shapely form, as they got more flexible as well. But while Brandon's gained a bit more muscle, Aaron's were actually started to get more toned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So is any of the girls your girlfriend?\", asked Brandon, which caught Yu off-guard.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Huh? No, I am not in a relationship with anyone yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? I mean, you sound really close to the girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am, but I would rather have more time before deciding on someone. It's complicated, but you two will understand when you become older.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two were a bit surprised, as in the game, he had quite a few options to choose from. And the fact that he knew Chie and Yukiko for this long without being in a relationship with neither them or anyone else was actually hard to believe. They accepted Yu's answer, but wondered who would become Yu's girlfriend if he was to choose someone.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Eventually the three arrived at the inn, and the two younger boys were surprised to see how traditional it looked. They only caught a few glimpses of some screenshots of the interior, but the outside truly looked like a place you would put on a postcard. They certainly didn't mind staying there for a few days if they could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside, they saw a few people walking around before going straight for the reception desk. There was a woman in her twenties with black hair tied in a bun and wearing blue kimono with a red sash holding it. She was ready to welcome them when she recognized Yu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Narukami-san! I didn't expect you to come here so early. If you came to go with Yukiko-san to school for the festival, she already left with Satonaka-san.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She already left to the school?\", asked Yu as the two other boys seemed a bit disappointed that they wouldn't see Yukiko anytime soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, they actually went to Junes. They said they wanted to go and look around at a few things before going to school. They told me that if you come here or call for them to pass this message to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. Thanks for telling me Kasai-san.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way, who are they?\", asked the lady. \"Are they friends of Nanako-san?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, actually it is a bit complicated...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYu then told Sakai about how the two boys got separated from the group they were, with Brandon or Aaron adding a few more details to make the story more believable. It was a bit of a stretch to say they were with a group to tourists that passed the town and forgot them here, but somehow Yu and Sakai somehow managed to swallow the whole explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's terrible... I am sorry for your troubles. Did you call the police?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I don't want to overcomplicate things. They are a bit uncomfortable with the whole situation, and I don't want to cause a commotion with this. I will just talk with my uncle about this and tell him to look for their guardians. Besides, I am sure others must have noticed they were missing by now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. And you brought them here to stay until someone came for them. That's really good thinking Narukami-san. If the police or anyone else calls here I will tell them that the boys are safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right. And sorry if it's that much of a request.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be. I am sure here they will feel perfectly comfortable until someone arrives to pick them up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe siblings were a bit nervous now, as they watched the exchange. They thought they will spend time with Yu or Yukiko, but the current situation wasn't advantageous at all for them. They knew that going to school with Yu was a bit of a stretch, but they expected to be in a situation where they wouldn't be put on the spot, as they now even regretted coming up with the whole story they came up with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two were playing a bit with their hands, to try to calm themselves down a bit. As they did, their fingers started to thin down and become a bit longer as the whole hand started to turn a bit slimmer as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYu then talked a few other things with Sakai, including briefing Yukiko and Chie in case they were to return about the situation, before getting ready to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, please stay here with Nakai-san and please listen to her until someone comes to take you back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you come back?\", asked Aaron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe. If I can, I would like to see you leave safely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\"Okay...\"\", replied the two boys a bit dejected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now don't be sad. I am sure we will meet again if possible. After all, as long as you believe in the possibility, anything is possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys smiled a little at that comment, as Yu waved then and Sakai goodbye before leaving. As he left, their calves, continued morphing as they took a more shapely, and in Aaron's case, also more toned. But it didn't stop there. Their legs than grew a bit longer, as they started to age up. Their changed feet and hands also grew with them, despite looking a bit weird on their now 9 year old bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Yu left, Sakai turned to the boys and told them follow her, as she would take them to an empty room for them to stay. The two nodded, with no one noticing their increased height.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sakai led the two boys along the corridor, up until they reached an empty room. Once she opened it, they saw the room was decorated with traditional Japanese ornaments and contained a kotatsu, a couple of futons and a bit surprisingly, a wide-screen TV, giving the room a little modern feel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, now please wait here until I finish some work I have to do. You can watch TV if you like and later if you would like, I could ask the chef to make something for you. Until then, please stay here and if you would, please take out your shoes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys complied, taking out their footwear as they became fully brown as their material changed completely into leather. They also started to grow a small heel in the back as the bottom portion became dark-gray. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, before I left, I didn't ask for your names. Can you give them to me to know what should I say in case someone calls for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing. I am Randon Tomas, and this is my brother Aaren Shomas.\", said Randon, with Sakai nodding in acknowledgment. Neither boy thought their names sounded strange at all, as Aaren raised his eyebrow for a second before shaking his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakai then left the boys to their own devices as she went back to the front desk, telling the boys one last time to behave themselves. On the way back however, there was something that made her curious about the boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That strange... For someone who is from another country, they seem to speak Japanese really well, especially for their age. Maybe they came to Japan before... Or maybe they took some classes. I wonder if Narukami-san found it odd too...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reason why the boys understood Yu so perfectly from the start, wasn't because he was speaking English, but rather they could understand and speak Japanese, with the boys not even noticing. Yu also found it weird that they knew Japanese so well, but like Sakai , didn't think too much and simply believed they were just knowledgeable in terms of their language, despite their age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack with the two, they were siting on the tatami mat, as they analyzed the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This sucks. I thought we were going to spend our time here with Yu's group, not to be stuck here.\", said Aaren a bit frustrated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree. This place looks nice, and it's Yukiko's house, but it's not too fun without anyone here....\", continued Randon. \"But I am more concerned what should we do with our lie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's pretty simple. We just wish to go back home and we leave a note that we remembered a meeting spot for our group to meet in case we got lost. Pretty simple, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I doubt it will be so easy. It is not as though they wouldn't panic if we were to go missing. And also, I am pretty sure if that light is to appear again, it will draw attention to this room, and how to people just vanished.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's... true...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir speech patterns were now developing as their vocabulary increased. And while Aaren spoke pretty much like he would usually do, except maybe a tad louder, Randen seemed to speak in a more calm and polite manner. As they talked, their skin started to tan a little, deviating form their original color, with Aaren's skin tanning a bit more than Randen. Lastly, their white socks also started to change. Firstly, they became less ill-fitted for their bigger feet before clinging to them better, and then they started to get longer, now covering their ankles, while Randen's also started to darken a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you know what... This place is pretty neat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean Randen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, don't you want to explore this place a little? I haven't been at an inn before, and this one looks great. Plus, isn't the atmosphere inviting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess it is... But weren't we told to stay here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's true... Maybe we could ask someone to give us a tour maybe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the conversation could continue, they heard some footsteps, before the someone slided the door open.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While they expected Sakai to return, they were a bit surprised to see another woman coming in, also wearing a kimono, who was equally surprised to see the two boys in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, are you the two boys Sakai-san talked about? The ones that got lost?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Indeed, that's us. Did she tell you about us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, she told me and a few others about you just a couple of minutes ago. I am so sorry for interrupting you. I came here to take the sheets and the pillow cases to the laundry room, I didn't know you were here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its no problem really.\", assured Aaren as she bowed a little in thanking him before she went to the futons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was collecting the things that needed to be washed, Randon had an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you mind if we help you take these to the laundry room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't mind it, but are you sure? You are supposed to be staying here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll have you watch over us and we'll follow your instructions. And we kind of wanted to check this place a bit if it isn't a problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... I guess I could have you join me. Just wait until I'm finished here so that you two could help me carrying the cloths.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\", beamed Randon as the lady smiled a bit at his enthusiasm. Meanwhile, Aaren, who listened to the conversation really confused at his brother's request, came closer to him to ask him about the request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing? Didn't we agree to find a way to leave this place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you want to see this place first? It's our only time when we are going to be here. Aren't you even a bit curious to see Yukiko's home a bit more?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I wouldn't mind it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides, I am pretty sure that Sakai lady would be happy if we could help the employees if we can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Okay, we'll do it.\", sighed Aaren in defeat, as he also wanted to look around a little. \"But put the coin somewhere in here. We don't want to somehow lose it and then search the inn like crazy for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they talked, their hands slimmed down considerably, having now a more dainty appearance, but in Aaren's case, they also seemed to get stronger, having now a much better grip strength than before. Their nails also got a bit longer and got trimmed as well, with Randon's also gaining a manicure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you please help me a little with the folding if you would want?\", asked the lady, with the two boys just finishing their discussion. Randon put the coin from his pocket next to the TV, so that it wouldn't be visible if someone else would come to the room before he and his brother went to help out with the folding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Aaren was almost as clumsy with he always was, his new age, making him slightly better at folding, Randon was doing it almost as good as the lady. Their memories were now starting to warp as well as new thoughts were starting to form. While they still saw each other like before, the sceneries in their memories where they were playing now slowly changing, the parks now looking a lot bigger and the tall buildings around them were now vanishing. They also got a memory of themselves at the inn and with Randon spending quite a bit more time there, as weird as it would be, as they never went there ever before. But they didn't question it as they continued their job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, while their hair didn't grow at the moment, apart from making their manes a bit thicker, their usual blond color was now changing as well. While Aaren's only got a shade or two darker, Randon already was starting to become a dirty blond color, as the darkening stopped for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they finished, they then started carrying the cloths, with the woman carrying a bed set, Aaren carrying the sheet of a bed and Randon the pillow cases and a cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you. I forgot to bring the laundry basket with me and I was concerned I wouldn't wrinkle them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we are happy to help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd another thanks from the lady, the three then left the room for the laundry room.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>On the way, the three conversed a little, with the two boys learning that the lady's name was Mitsuki as well as learning a few details about the inn and a bit about the staff as well. but for some odd reason the two seemed to already know more and more things about the inn ahead of Mitsuki's explanation. This was reflected in how detailed her description was becoming, revealing a few things that normally children their age wouldn't be interested in, such as the wages or schedules, but the two didn't look bothered to know these things, but for Randon, even the more specific details Mitsuki gave seemed to be familiar to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile walking, their socks became once again longer, as they now completely covered their ankles and were now climbing up their calves. But while Aaren's retained their white color and cotton texture, Randon's were actually growing thinner and darker, hugging his legs more than his brother's. Also, they appeared to be lengthening much faster, as they were already at the middle of his calves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the trio reached the laundry room. There were already two washing machines that were already on, so they dropped the sheets in a hamper next to a third one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for helping me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't such a big deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now please return to your room until Sakai-san returns.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two were ready to accept, but there seemed to be a sense of responsibility growing within Randon that made him speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it's not a problem, do you mind if we help you? We could bring the bedclothes to the washing room to spare you some time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe suggestion surprised Mitsuki and Aaren, as the former inquired: \"Are you sure you want to do this? I don't think we should let someone as young as you do something like this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please. We want to help as much as possible if we can. Besides, we already are familiar with the layout of the place. Can we?\", asked Randon in a very respectful tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I guess I can let you two help. Not everyone is here yet, so we might need a little help. But only if both of you agree.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaren was ready to refuse, as he didn't want to waste too much time wandering around, his curiosity about the place not swaying him enough at the moment for him to accept. But with Randon looking at him pleadingly, he started to consider it a bit. Normally, he wouldn't be eager to do things he didn't find too interesting or didn't consider important enough. But right now, he is a lot more willing to help, especially if it was something his brother would ask. Together with the fact, that they still have enough time on their hands and that helping around might help time move faster, he gave out a sigh of resignation before answering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we'll do it then... It's not like is any reason not to help.\" The answer put a smile on Randon's face, as Aaren couldn't help but smile a little as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the conversation, the changes that affected their hands started to now affect their arms as well as the muscles got more slender and a tad more flexible. Also, their pants seemed to hug their legs a bit more now, but without causing any discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well then I guess it's settled then. Thank you very much for your help, I really appreciate it.\", said Mitsuki with a sigh while giving out a small smile. I'll tell you which rooms should you go in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for accepting. We promise it will not take long.\", said Randon, with Aaren nodding in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a bit strange as they didn't seem more panicked given their circumstances. It was true that they were only 6 years old when the whole thing started, but even then, their sense or urgency should have kicked in once the whole situation with their lie came up. But currently, the two weren't as bothered about the situation, as they even started to think it wasn't as alarming as to make them panic, with Randon even starting to like the inn a bit more than before.</span></div></div>",

Each of you take a basket and fold the bedclothes carefully. Once you've finished, return here. Even if I am not in the laundry room when you come back, please go back to your room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys nodded, and after each of them took a basked and were told which rooms to go, they promised Mitsuki  they will do a good job before they left for the three rooms they had to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first one was near the end of the corridor, and so the boys decided to talk a bit on their way there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms Mitsuki is really nice, isn't she?\", asked Randon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is. I am surprised how she and Kasai are so accepting with the story we came up with. Heck, Yu even helped us make half the story without him knowing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True... But you know, I feel kind of bad lying to them. I mean, as harmless as the lie is, they still worry about us. It makes you feel like you betrayed them I a way...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't say betrayal.... But I guess you're right. Lying like this really isn't my thing as well...\", said Aaren also feeling slightly apologetic. \"But anyway, why are we doing this right now? I mean, we are going to leave soon. I don't see why would you want to do some chores instead of thinking of a way out of this. If we would go and visit the town... and maybe go to a restaurant... maybe I would consider staying here a bit more...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before we continue... What did you mean by \"going to a restaurant\"? Are you hungry? I know it was the afternoon when we left, but our dinner time would be later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but I crave a little for some food, especially meat. I don't know why, but a steak or something like that sounds good to me right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is room service here. Perhaps they can give is something to eat later... But let's try not to eat expensive food, okay? I don't want to make it like we are robbing the people here just because we are lost.\", said Randon, with his brother smiling a bit sheepishly as he nodded in conformation, neither wanting to look like rich people that like eating steak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked, their already tighter pants began to slowly crawl upwards, revealing a bit of their calves, however that space was slowly covered by their socks. But while Aaren's were starting to slow down with their lengthening, the more they got to the middle of his calves, Randon's socks continued their growth, becoming thinner and a tad more elastic as they progressed further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As for the reason I wanted to look around the inn  is because I don't know if I will have another opportunity to see a place like this. The rustic feel almost makes you think of a historical place, doesn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I admit it is nice, but I think you are a bit overexcited. I mean, I know Yukiko is your favourite character and I know you wish to explore this place more, but there isn't anyone from the main cast even here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but still... I feel a bit nostalgic to be here. I don't know why, but I want to see this place more if possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaren would usually raise a brow at a statement like that, but this time he just gave out a sigh before smiling to Aaren. \"I admit that I know how much you like this place. It can't be helped if you wish to be here a bit more. Let's just get our job done to think about our next move later, okay?\" His brother gave a small nod as he couldn't help but thank him a bit for his words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was slowly a new level of understatement forming between the two. While they were brothers, they really didn't ponder too much on their relationship as they knew they were close, given their former age. But currently, the two seemed like they would want to know each other a bit more than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, they felt a small irritation in their throats as they rubbed their necks a bit and swallowed a few times. Much to their surprise, the pain went away as quickly as it came, the two wondering if this was a sign of a cold, but didn't ponder too much on it at the moment. However it was to be noted that based on their breaths, their voices were sounding a bit higher.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The two soon arrived to the first room, and when they opened the door, they weren't surprised to see, that aside from having an extra futon and a bit more space, it looked very similar to the one they stood in before, with only a few changes to the d\u00e9cor and an extra bookcase being the only differences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two then headed towards the futons and began to take out the sheets as they sat next to the futons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way...\", started Randon. \"Why exactly did you crave for steak specifically? I know how like eating barbecue and sometimes burgers, but it wasn't as if this would be the first thing you would look on a menu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, maybe my tastes are changing. And maybe I need a bit more protein in my diet. What about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... I personally would like eating some meat, but I think I prefer something a little less heavy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? Scared you are going to get a stomach ache?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really. But I don't do as much exercise as you do, and I need to keep myself more fit if possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but you are a pretty good runner. A little red meat wouldn't hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you don't run a lot? You say it's not bad because you actually run a lot more than me. And faster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh. Point taken I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two were too busy with their conversation to notice that they once grew a bit more in height as they aged another year, making them both ten at the moment. However they were certainly a little below the average height of a boy their age, with Randon now being half an inch taller than Aaren. But except for a slight change in posture, the two didn't notice their growth at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Rakdon, do you have other plans for after we finish here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean Caren?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well since you seem to enjoy being here so much maybe a little more time here wouldn't be so bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure? You looked pretty eager to try and leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still do, but... Maybe you're right. There's no rush and I don't know if we would have another opportunity like this. And it would be a shame to leave like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Thanks Caren.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two smiled at each other as they continued folding, first the sheets, then the blankets, and then the pillow cases, with Rakdon once again being an expert at folding as his brother had a few issues. Also, their jackets were beginning to change as well, as their white began to gain a greenish tint for Rakdon and a reddish one for Caren.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were unaware that along with their minds and the reality itself, the presence the two had in the world was slowly changing as well. They started out as children who arrived in Inaba with the magic coin, but they were slowly starting to integrate in the new setting, as slowly, their memories of their home were starting to fade away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut they didn't seem concerned by this. Since they didn't notice their different names, their developed vocabulary or how they seemed perfectly able to do chores on their own, without being watched by an adult, they simply enjoyed their time together, only feeling a bit confused of some things they didn't seem to remember properly before shaking their head, and accepting the new information that was given to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever there was something that was different at the moment. With their new age, they now believed their names were Rakdon Tamas and Caren Shanas. Despite their really close bond, their family name didn't match anymore with each other, even if they were still brothers. This didn't seem to bother the boys in the slightest though, as they still viewed each other as a very important person in their lives.</span></div></div>",

If it was me I would've dumped everything in one basket until it was full and then put in the other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if you are doing it only for a futon or two, there isn't any problems. But if we are going to collect the bedclothes from several rooms, we might need to sort it better. We don't want the workers to have a hard time organizing as well... Also thank you again for doing this. I know it was kind of sudden with the request and the rest...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't sweat it. I am glad I can help. And we have enough time as well. It's not like there is something urgent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf this was the usual Caren, he would try to hurry things up a lot quicker, but not only does he doesn't mind letting Rakdon have some fun, he also feels quite peaceful right now. He was still worried about how to leave the inn, but somehow spending a bit more time with his brother made him a bit more relaxed. Rakdon was also acting a bit different. Other than his now more polite way of talking, he also acted a bit more graceful. He didn't raise his voice as much as Caren, and he now seems to be enjoying helping around, even if initially he wouldn't be too joyful when it came down to doing chores. And like his brother, it felt almost relaxing doing this with him, in the sense that it was a bit more fun if he would do this on his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterward, the two left the room and were now heading for the next. While it was a bit confusing at first, as Mitsuki didn't gave them too many details regarding where the rooms are, Rakdon seemed to know exactly where it was, knowing now almost the entire layout of the place while Caren also started to gain a slight familiarity with the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey slowly walked to their destination, their walking also starting to change as they began to close the space between their steps, placing a foot in front of each other, especially in Rakdon's case. As they walked, their thighs began to gain a little bit of mass, as they became a little thicker. But while Rakdon's muscles didn't change much, Caren's started to tone themselves a bit, making them a little bit stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two navigated a bit more until they reached the room the room they were supposed to go in. The room was a bit smaller than the one from before, but had some additional storing space to cover for that. Once again, they went to the futons to collect the bedclothes, chatting a bit in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These rooms look really nice. I wonder if we could stay here for a night if we could.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am sure I can talk Sakai-san into allowing us to stay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?... Wait. Why did you say \"san\" at the end there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? It's just the formal way to address people. I know I called her \"Ms Sakai\" before but it seems a bit forced to say it in English when we can just call her this way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you're right... I mean we know enough Japanese to know how to address people. Maybe we should indeed call then with Japanese honorifics instead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should. It sounds a bit more polite as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not to mention it sounds more natural as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to them, they were now starting to develop quite a developed Japanese vocabulary. While they began talking the language ever since they arrived in the world, they didn't know all that many words other than the ones they knew initially. But with their vocabulary expanding, so did their knowledge of Japanese pronouns and such. On the other hand, their knowledge of English was now stripped away, not knowing how to speak their original language. But slowly, some basic words were starting to reappear, although they weren't as many as they once knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring their talk, their jackets changed a bit more, with Caren's, besides gaining a greenish hue to it, a yellow one was appearing as well on the sides of the front. As for Rakdon's the material seemed to get a bit thicker as it continued to slowly redden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So can we really stay here if we could?\", asked Caren.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. I'm sure no one would mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What makes you so sure?\"</span></div></div>",

But do you think it's okay? I mean... I personally don't have enough money to stay here half a day if I could...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. I am sure she would understand. And she likes you a lot. But then again, most of the staff likes you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you're just flattering me...\", said Caren as he blushed a little. \"But if you think there won't be any issues... Maybe if we have an opportunity, I may accept.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the spirit! Now let's finish up to talk with Sakai-san after we're done here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, the initial worry about getting home that they had was evaporating. As for meeting the characters of the game, their excitement was also dwindling, no longer finding it that important, thinking they have plenty of time for that. Yu however was exception, as they still longed to see him once more. But there was something else about meeting him again that felt different to them, as something else other than excitement was starting to form, as Yu was starting to pop up in few of their memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they continued their jobs, both felt their arms feeling a bit stiff, with their shoulders also hurting a bit. The two were slightly confused by why this was happening, especially Caren, but didn't voice their issue out loud, deciding that rubbing their limbs a little would help. And it sure did, as the changes progressed further. The muscles were redistributed, as their shape changed, becoming smaller, but also felt a bit stronger, noting that Rakdon again fell a bit behind when it came down to overall strength and muscle development. Their shoulders also became rounder and less broad to compliment the slimmer arms. They weren't done changing yet, but already, they didn't had the aspects of a normal boy's arms anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the two finished and like before, left the room quietly as they headed for the final room, chatting along the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way, how much has it passed since we got here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For almost an hour. Why do you ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Call me crazy Rakdon, but shouldn't we be in a hurry or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it's about going home. I feel like we should finish this as quickly as possible and then think of a plan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRakdon looked at Caren a bit confused as he replied: \"Do we need to hurry? I feel like we have plenty of time. And it's not like there is a time limit or anything. We can think of the details later if we need to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you're right... But I still feel like we must do something important though...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually... I do believe you're right... I also feel like we are supposed to do something after we finish our job here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two began to ponder on what reason were they in a hurry, as thinking of how to get home didn't seem as important for them as much as it did before. While thinking, their T-shirts started to feel somewhat softer as along with their pants, got a bit tighter on them. On top of that, they started to slowly crawl on their necks, feeling a little discomfort in the process, but they mostly ignored the feeling.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Deciding on focusing on the task at hand, the two brothers went to the final room they had to go. This one was a bit further than the ones from before, but Rakdon had no issues finding it as he and Caren inside. Just like before, it was a really nice combination of old and new Japanese d\u00e9cor, this chamber looking roughly the same size as the one they stood in before. But before they could begin, Caren thought of something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say Rakdon... I've been thinking. What should we do about lunch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... It is almost noon by the looks of things.\", said Rakdon as he looked at the clock on the wall. \"It is still a bit early, but maybe we could ask the chef to whip us something for us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat here?... Uh, I think we've troubled them enough by now. I say we should try and go somewhere in town to eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have a place in mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we can go to Aiya and eat some really good pork ramen. Or maybe we can go to Souzai Daigaku and eat some steak skewers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Caren, don't you think you should change your diet a bit? You seem to be eating a bit too much meat lately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't sweat it. I also eat a lot of veggies and fruits and even fish every now and then. It's not like I am a lion that eats only meat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally that remark would only gain a little smile from Rakdon, but for some reason, this time he actually started to snicker quite a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... what's so funny?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... a lion... Just imagine yourself... in a costume... with that giant mane... Hahaha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, the little snicker turned into an all-out laugh, which prompted Caren to furrow his brow a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, first of all only male lions have those manes, not the females. Second of all, how did you get to a costume? I am not like Teddie, wearing something as silly as that like it's nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha... Teddie... as a lion...Hahahaha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, this made Rakdon to laugh even more heartily as Caren could only sigh at his brother's laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the conversation, their hips started to spread out a little as their pelvises grew a bit wider, which in turn put a little strain on their pants. Speaking of them, they receded a bit more, now getting a lot closer to their knees as the color as the blue was starting to darken and the fabric was also starting to become something softer in the meantime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we just please start already? I don't know where to go with this talk now anymore.\", said Caren as Rakdon stopped laughing and nodded, as the two went to the futons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two then folded the bedclothes as Caren made sure not to make another comparison or pun as he didn't want his brother go into another laughing fit. After they silently finished their task, with Caren getting a bit better at folding this time after he did the same thing twice before. Before they could leave however, Rakdon began speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But in all seriousness Caren, it really is okay if you want to eat here. I am sure neither Sakai-san or the cooks would mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure? I mean, we are eating the food that is supposed to be for the guests. And I don't think I have enough money to pay for a full meal here. I can pay my share at another restaurant so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, it's fine. We always cook a bit for ourselves if we have any spare food and I know they have bought a bit more than they usually do, so they should have ingredients for another portion or two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll think about it...\", replied Caren as his brother nodded in understanding before the two started to go back to the laundry room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked, their hair once again got longer, with Caren's now covering his ears as his mane got a bit thicker and the color got another shade darker. In the meantime, Rakdon's hair was now touching his nape as its color once again shifted form the dirty-blond he currently had to near-brownish shade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir memories once again were slowly changing. Details such as knowing Teddie, the restaurants in town or the extra food the inn had were just the start. One would think that they know Teddie from the artwork they were shown before of him, but casually talking about him like they know each other was surely something a mere fan of the game wouldn't know. And along with all this knowledge, their selves were also gradually changing as somewhere in their souls, a mysterious blue flame was starting to ignite...</span></div></div>",

Were you waiting for us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not for very long. And there is no need to apologize for coming in late, I was just ready to turn on the washing machines. I already talked with Mitsuki-san and told me about your decision to help around. She was needed somewhere else, so I substitute for her right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was there a problem with us leaving our room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course there wasn't. I am quite thankful for your aid actually. I know I told you to say in your room, but I suppose you might've gotten a bit bored on your own... Do you want to help me as well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely.\", answered Rakdon while Caren nodded as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the three were readying the machines, the boys once again aged up, by another two years. Their hips and thighs continued to expand as they became older, looking a little to big for a pair of 12 year old boys. Rakdon once again gained a little more height than his brother, the difference between them becoming once again slightly bigger. Also, their waists didn't seem to grow along with their frames, instead they seemed to become slightly smaller than they were in the beginning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this change, a few mental and reality shifts happened. Rakdon wasn't now just someone who knew Sakai, he now knew the whole staff, as he was now a regular at the inn, sometimes helping around when he would have free time. Caren on the other hand, now knew a few more kung-fu movies, and was now in his spare time training to learn how to perform them. All this came in exchange of their memories from home fading a bit more, the landscape of their home city being replaced with a more rural one inside their thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, thank you for your help once again Rakion-san and Charen-san.\", said Sakai after they put detergent into the washing machines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mention it. We were happy we could help.\", said Rakion with a smile as neither he nor Charen noticed their different names, before he asked her: \"Say, can we eat here if we can? It is a bit early, but I was wondering if could have lunch right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certainly. I don't see why it would be a problem. And this is also thanks for helping with the bedclothes as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\", smiled Rakion as Charen got a bit surprised and sheepishly thanked her as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Thanks a bunch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a problem. Now I will finish the job here. You two can go to the kitchen and talk with the chef with what we have in the menu for today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys bowed a little, not even noticing how compelled were they to do it, as there wasn't any resistance in questioning the gesture as they left. Sakai grinned a little seeing the two off as she continued her work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those two really are best of friends. Regardless of family, very rarely you see someone who gets that well with another... And speaking of bonds, I wonder how they are faring with him...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys slowly made their way to the kitchen, with Charen thanking Rakion for the meal they just got. Along the way, their socks changed further, as they climbed further up their legs. But while Charen's not only remained white as the material became just a tad more elastic, they didn't grew much further, stopping around the middle of his stronger calves, Rakion's were now pure black as they hugged his legs much more than before. The material became thinner, but they remained opaque, as they now covered his knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know what they have on the menu Rakion?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... If I recall, they mentioned preparing a chicken meatball hotpot as today's special.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chicken?... Uh, don't they have anything a bit more hardy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can ask if they have. Like I said, they bought a bit more than usual this time, so they must have at least some beef as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fingers crossed then.\", joked Charen as his brother gave out a small giggle, happy that it wasn't another \"laugh attack\" he had to deal with due to a simple topic this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey didn't question the new names they heard, even if for a slight second, they felt something wrong. However, as reality changed further, Rakion Tamais and Charen Shatoas, simply continued their day, as even the memories of their wishing coin were starting to fade away.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There should be one not far from the reception desk, next to the vending machines.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey headed towards the restroom, but neither noticed that they entered the women's restroom without knowing. But the absence of the urinals didn't faze them as they both went into a stall. Just like the time they bowed, the brothers felt another strange urge, this time to sit on the toilet. While it was unnecessary, the two complied and sat down without pondering on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they did their business, they noticed they really didn't need to use the restroom, as there wasn't too much to come out, yet the diminishing pressure they felt was enough to make them not question the situation any further. While sitting down, their waists began to shrink down even more, looking now quite small in comparison to their larger hips, with Charen's waist also seemed to tone itself a bit as well. Also, they felt like their seats were getting a bit cushier than in the beginning, but believed to be just their imagination. In reality, their butts were also expanding, starting to catch up with the hips and the thighs, which slowly continued growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two were however distracted by their thoughts a little, as along with all the changes to their minds that came up until this point, their heads got a little foggy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh... I don't know why but I feel a bit lightheaded right now. I know I slept enough last night... It's true that I stood up a little late since I couldn't miss a \"Trial of the Dragon\" movie, but that shouldn't make me forget what I did this morning... I know I've talked with Rakion... Was it something about a magic coin and wishes? Well, I know I would wish for all the meat in the world that I can eat, without ever gaining weight if that would be the case. Heheh... But still, I feel like there was something else too... Whatever, I can ask Rakion about that stuff later, maybe after lunch...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know why my mind feels so muddled right now. I doubt it's from lack of sleep, but I can't deny I felt pretty tired when I went to bed... What did I did yesterday...? Oh, yes. I helped around the inn with cleaning and serving food, as it got a bit crowded last night... But why am I having issues remembering what I did this morning?.. I talked with Charen about wishes and... a video game? I don't have prior knowledge of playing something on a console... I did play a few online games on my computer recently but... I may be missing a few details, but I don't believe it's that important. Maybe the subject popped up. As for the wish part... I think may need to talk with Charon after we eat...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring their monologues, their underwear also began changing. The material seemed to get softer, especially in Rakion's case as both began to have their legs receding a little. When they finished and pulled them up along with their pants, the two couldn't deny that they liked the feeling their underwear had on their growing curves. Afterward, the two walked towards the sink and began washing their hands.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the two were washing their hands, they both looked in the mirror a few times, and there was something off about their appearance that was worrying them a little. For a split second, they believed it was their longer hair, but they shook it off fairly quickly, thinking they simply forgot to cut their recently, before deciding that they actually looked better now, and thus didn't ponder more on it. Still, there was something that looked different, and that made them wonder what exactly that was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say Charen, do you also think something about the way we look is a bit off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I do. But I can't put my finger on what it was. I thought it was our hair, but I doubt it's that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I also thought of that. But I personally don't see anything wrong with our haircuts...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile checking their appearance in the mirror, they didn't notice how their faces were starting to become a bit rounder or that their eyes were becoming almond-shaped as the color of their irises was changing as well, as the blue was starting to darken a bit, gaining a brownish tint to them, with Rakion's becoming a few shades darker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut this went unnoticed by the two, and instead, they attributed the feeling with their memory lapse from before, worrying them that they were a bit sick. They believed that tiredness or stress to be the cause, as no matter how much they looked at their reflections, they didn't see anything wrong, and yet something was telling them the exact opposite. Suddenly, however, Charen noticed something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Rakion, I think we forgot to zip up our jackets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Oh! You're right. I am surprised we didn't notice that.\", said Rakion as he zipped up his jacket, with Charen doing the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me neither. I was wondering a little why it felt a little cold. I think we got caught up with our task, and we unzipped our jackets when he felt a little hot or something...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds plausible... I am guessing that what we felt something was off was our opened jackets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe. But I am surprised it took that long for us to notice though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we were most likely with our minds somewhere else... Anyway, I am happy it was that and nothing else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too. Boy, we need to be a lot more aware of things like these. I don't need Yosuke or Rise-chan to tease us with this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it wouldn't be nice...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith their little dilemma solved, the two dried off their hands with some paper towels as they then left. The two began feeling a little too warm with their jackets on, but soon said feeling began to dissipate as they continued walking. Their T-shirts became that tight on them, the material split in the middle, without them noticing beneath their jackets. Then they quickly patched themselves up as buttons formed to close off the rips, with the collars of their new shirts also being now complete. The material also began to soften, the polyester gradually being replaced with cotton, while the color started to fade off from the shirts, the dark blue starting to lighten up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys however believed they were wearing shirts the entire time and weren't at all bothered by the different feel the material had on their skin. They were however still pondering about their actions prior to arriving at the inn, the memories about the coin and their wish continuing fading out. But there was something that was starting to differ. While up until now, their memories had them together up until now, with one not being seen with the other, things were starting to change, as they started to think they live separately, with Rakion actually living at the inn. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Deciding to focus on their meal and ask about their confusions later, the two continued heading to the kitchen. They soon arrived at the dining area, which was a combination between western and Japanese d\u00e9cor, as both mats as well as chairs were placed around different tables that suited the height of the sitting person. Even if they weren't told, the boys thought that Sakai mentioned something about a group of tourists from abroad were supposed to arrive tonight, thus they had to have an easier way for them to eat comfortably if they weren't accustomed to the sitting position yet. They then entered the kitchen and saw a few chefs prepping the food. Once they noticed them, one of them greeted the brothers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Rakion-san, Charen-san.\", said the man politely as the others followed suit. \"Is there something we can do for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were wondering if it is a problem if we could eat here. It is a bit early, but I thought we could have lunch, if it isn't too much to ask for, as I know you are busy prepping.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course there's no problem. We have some extra produce, so we don't mind at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you very much. What can you do for us right now that doesn't take much time...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... I guess we could make some curry with a pork cutlet. How does that sound?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds great! We take that!\", said Charen a bit excited to eat some meat, to which Rakion and the chef could only laugh a little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will take a few minutes to make. Please wait in the dining room until we finish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys nodded and headed for the closest table, leaving the chefs cook their lunch. The two then began talking with each other as more changes happened to them. They both felt a little discomfort as they sat down, feeling the need to push their backs forward to alleviate the pain. Somehow this worked perfectly, as their backs were now in a permanent arch, without even noticing. Their arms also changes further, with Rakion's limbs looking slimmer and more delicate than Charen's as he gained quite a little more arm muscle then he had before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take back all that I said about eating here. The chef is really nice and offered us a hardy meal right off the bat! I forget sometimes how kind the staff here really is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are always nice to people.\", replied Rakion with a small giggle. \"They trained to act friendly to customers, but to those who come here often or know the staff personally, they talk to others as if they are members of the family. That's why they have no problem with us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean with me. You basically live here with all the times you come to the inn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a bit of a stretch... But I suppose you are right. I do like this place a lot... In the beginning, I tried to think that being here all the time would narrow my possibilities... but it's not like I hate being here. After all, the people here are like family... And so are you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-Now you making me blush...\", said Charen a bit embarrassed. \"But thanks. It really means a lot to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat comment would seem odd normally, but in reality, the two boys started to view each other not as siblings, but as friends. This was of course just a small part of them that actually believed that. But soon, it wouldn't be just the belief that they are not brothers...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they continued talking, the shirts underneath their jackets, which continued to be recolored, the green and yellow for Charen and red for Rakion becoming more dominant, their sleeves started to grow, currently reaching their elbows as they kept whitening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You are lucky you came before the usual lunch period\", said the chef that brought them the food cheerily. \"Please enjoy, and tell us your impression on it in case there is something to change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will, don't worry.\", said Charen as he was ready to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the chef left, the two gazed at the meal expectantly, as both were impressed by how appetizing it looked. Charen was basically drooling at the sight of the breaded pork cutlet, before he and Rakion began eating. While it wasn't a very extravagant dish, the two were almost instantly charmed by the flavors. The rustic, yet comforting taste reminded them a bit of how their mother would cook for their child. It was a bit spicier than they predicted, knowing that it would be better suited for Rise to eat, but they didn't mind the spiciness to much as they continued to enjoy their meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they were eating, the brothers aged up once again to 13 years old. They didn't grow in height as much as they did before, as they were slightly smaller than a boy their age should be as the difference in height between the two becoming more noticeable. Their butts also got a little bigger from all the eating, but the main focal point this time were the thighs. They both gained more mass, as they finally finished growing. Charen's legs not looked very toned as the muscles gave the impression of a good runner, while Rakion's didn't develop too much muscle, as they now looked more alluring than sporty, the small, soft layer of fat on top complimenting them perfectly. Their pants continued to recede further up their legs, as they now finally reached the middle of their thighs. The changes didn't stop there however, as the material darkened further as they lost their pockets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdditionally, they both felt their throats sting a little as they ate. They both attributed it to the spiciness of the food, thus they both ignored the feeling, as their vocal chords began to tighten, while their Adam's apple continued to shrink down, as their voices rose in octave once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, this tastes amazing!\", exclaimed Charen as he continued to stuff his mouth, his food meal being 80 percent done by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree. This really tastes great Chaen.\", said Rakion as he was eating his food slower, as he still had quite a bit to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way Rukion... Think we will be able to make a curry like this? It would wow the guys without a doubt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be great. But I think we will need to ask the chef for the recipe. I personally don't know the bends he uses when cooking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to only know how to prepare the pork correctly, and maybe some things about the breading. As for the rest, I am sure we can improvise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right. We just have to think of some good combinations for the flavors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idea of cooking something themselves didn't appeal to the two too much initially, but right now they were willing to actually try and cook... in order to redeem themselves for some disastrous results that they now remembered. Also strangely enough, they seemed compelled to cook more for Narukami rather than for the rest of the boys, as new thoughts about him were slowly entering their minds. Also, more changes happened to the reality, as their names changed further to Chaen Satoasa and Rukion Tamasi.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Chaen in particular felt quite hungry before the meal, even though he wasn't too much when he arrived at the inn, but that didn't seem to matter anymore. After finishing their plates, the two then went back to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you enjoyed it thoroughly by the looks of it.\", said the chef who brought them the food as he prepping alongside his co-workers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We sure did! Man I have to come here more often just for this!... But I promise I will bring my wallet next time I come here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, don't sweat it Satoasa-san. You are technically part of the family here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Thanks... \", said Chaen sheepishly and a bit flattered by the comment before continuing. \"By the way, was the recipe for curry difficult?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not exactly. We used the regular recipe for it, but we did in fact add a few more spices to it like garam masala, that we thought of adding after experimenting a bit. We also went to buy fresh peas from the market instead of frozen like we usually do from Junes. But why are you asking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me and Chaen want to try making curry ourselves and we were wondering if we could use the kitchen tonight.\", replied Rukion, which made the chefs sweat a little at that answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile they were talking, their pant legs were gradually fusing together into one, closing the gap between their legs. However, as soon as they fused and became skirts, they became less tighter on them as the skirts were now slowly getting pleated as they kept darkening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... Rukion-san... We admire that you want to cook something based on our recipe... but I don't know if it is a great idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... Your last attempt to make a boxed lunch wasn't as... desirable as you wanted. And based on your past with making curry, I do believe that if you or Satoasa-san want to make it, I suggest you practice with something easier before trying to make curry... I am not saying you haven't improved. But I think... you might need to wait a little bit longer...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two weren't dumb to not understand the chef's words: That they were horrible at cooking. And as much as they hated to admit, they weren't wrong. Starting from their curry at the camp, which Youske named it \"Mystery Food X\", the two really tried to remedy their cooking skills. But most of the times, the two didn't succeed with their plans. Most often than not, the food ended tasting either bland, overcooked or undercooked, as the rest of the times, it ended with a large mess that not even if they would pay somebody, they wouldn't eat it. And after the reaction they got from the boys when they ate the curry, the two didn't try to taste test it as much as they would want to, as even they grew a bit worried of might happen should they try to eat it. It was true that they found a little bit of solace knowing Rise wasn't better than them in the cooking department as her overuse of spicy ingredients would make anyone drink a gallon of water afterword if they didn't pass out from the heat...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut still, it wasn't nowhere near satisfactory for the two, as they tried really hard to develop their cooking abilities, believing that their skills were just underdeveloped. And they weren't doing it just to prove to the guys that they can cook, or to simply get better in the kitchen for themselves, but to impress a certain someone, who still sometimes, would test out their food to see if there was an improvement in their abilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two began thinking of said person, and as they did, their hair changed further. Chaen's hair stopped growing after covering his ears, as it smoothed itself out, as it settled for a bowl-shaped haircut, losing all of its spikiness in the process. Meanwhile, Rukion's hair became a lot straighter, all the wild bangs he had being completely flattened, as his mane now reached just below his shoulder blades. They gained a look of determination in their eyes as they remembered why exactly they were asking for a shot at making curry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, we won't make any blunders this time. We will consult a cook book this time... I know you are worried, but we would like to leave our image in the food we are making.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We won't go crazy with the ingredients, we promise. We will just put normal stuff in the food this time, we promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chefs exchanged a few looks among themselves before the head chef sighed and responded: \"Okay. We will let you use the kitchen tonight, and we will give few a few hints about how to make it, as you said that you want your dishes to say they represent you, and we will let you cook on your own. But promise you will clean up everything once you are done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\"We promise!\"\", said the to in unison, happy at the chance they have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This will surely make him happy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope this time he will like it...\", were the thoughts of the two boys.</span></div></div>",

Aren't you two supposed to leave soon? Do you still have time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were confused at first about the question, as they believed they were waiting instead of needing to go somewhere... However with the memories of the wish being almost gone, the two felt their heads fog up for a second before something clicked in their minds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, we almost forgot. Thank you for telling us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we got a bit preoccupied with the lunch that we didn't look at the time...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a problem? But aren't you two going to be late?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's still a little time left. We will pick up our things and then we will leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok. I heard you were going to be busy today, so I wish you both a great day then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\"Thank you!\"\", said the two boys in quick succession as they said their goodbyes to the chefs and thanked them again for the lunch before they left back to their room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way, their new skirts continued to darken until they became fully black, but it didn't stop there., as the skirts became pleated and gained a checkered design, together with some lighter colored, gray squares. On top of that, their underwear also started to change color, as their simple white boxers began darkening, with a slight greenish hue appearing at the top of Chaen's boxers while Rukion's started to redden on the sides and at the front. The boys did feel a little bit of draft with the skirts, but they simply shrugged it off as they were busy trying to solve the questions they had for themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Rukion... I know this might sound weird but... Do you remember what we did exactly this morning? I am having a little brain fart right now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You too? I thought I was the only one...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Well, what do you think was the cause for this? I mean, it's kind of hard to believe two people don't remember...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... It might be because of a lack of sleep...? I think I read somewhere that other than these periods of lethargy during the day and lack of focus, people can also have short time memory loss... And if I recall, you said you were quite tired after last night, and I am a bit too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think? I am not feeling sleepy or anything... But I guess it's possible...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two weren't entirely convinced by the argument, but they couldn't think of any other possibility, as neither of them were sick or felt lightheaded, thus deciding that tiredness was the reason. They, at one point felt their waists feel a little tight, but simply dismissed as a slight stomach ache from eating the slightly spicy food they had, unaware that their waists were actually starting to get slimmer, trimming down any trace of fat they had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... Do you recall something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing in particular, but there was this thing about wishes and a magic coin I believe...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A magic coin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know it sounds dumb. I don't know why I remembered something like that. Maybe we talked about our wishes and one of us may have brought up the subject with the coin...I don't know, I am as confused as you are about this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I also remember something about wishes... but there was no coin brought up. Instead it was something about a video game\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A video game? I never thought you were the gamer type of sorts Rukion. Do you plan to buy a console?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really... I don't know why this was brought up either...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Let's just forget about it for now. We may remember the details later.\", said Chaen as he thought he needed more time to ponder, something Rukion agreed with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right. We have to get our stuff to leave anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two then continued walking back to their room, but they didn't notice that they started to veer off course, as they took a different turn than the one they should.</span></div></div>",

Although one might think they simply were too engrossed with their talk to notice, in reality, the two believed that they were walking to the correct way, as their memories further changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile their memories about what they did before arriving at the inn were still blurry, the two remembered coming from a different room instead of the one they were placed in by Sakai. But there was more than just this that changed within their minds. The memories of their home were now almost half-way gone as the familiarity with the big city they lived in were gradually replaced, with not just a more rural scenery, but with Inaba of all places. Despite being a fictional place, or at least it was so in the world they came from, they two genuinely remember now the times they spend with each other in the small town, not just playing with each other, but also going to school together. Even if they were originally too young to go to school, their current age and memories easily made it so there won't be any issues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way, Rukion's socks continued to climb further and further up his legs, as while the material became somewhat thinner that it was in the beginning, they weren't see-through at all, currently being at the middle of his thighs, as they continued darkening, being almost black right now. As for Chaen, while his socks didn't change ever since they got to their final length, also started to feel a slightly creeping feeling around his thighs, as a black substance was starting to ooze from his skirt, something that didn't happen in Rukion's case. The substance adhered to his legs, slowly encasing them, however the sensation went completely unnoticed as he continued walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, they reached the room they needed to go in, and once inside, they saw that the room was quite different than the ones from before. It was slightly smaller than the one they originally were placed in, but it had a couple of big closets, much bigger than the ones they saw before, a desk with a bookcase next to it, a small vanity in the corner, a wall mirror, a regular bed and a spare futon in the corner of the room, alongside several other decorations around the room. What was special about this place was that this was in fact, Rukion's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, your room is a lot cleaner than mine is Rukion. Other than some magazines around, it looks great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. But I thought your room was fairly clean too Chaen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think? I kind of let my clothes out of the closet sometimes and I don't clean it too often.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True... But it still looks better than Yosuke's. Remember how it was last time we visited him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha. Yeah, it was a mess... It's true that Teddie might have been a cause of how it looked like as only he would do something such as throwing things on top of a closet... Although he really needs to put his magazines somewhere else, if that pervy bear is going to search for them again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, what magazines are you talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Nevermind. Let's just get ready.\", said Chaen as he didn't want Rukion knowing what type of magazines he was talking about, as he raised an eyebrow before going to mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither felt the need to put on any make-up, so they decided for the moment to just fix up their hair. As they brushed their mane, Chaen's hair became a sandy blond as the color almost became brown, while Rukion's was now on the verge of turning pure black, as he put on a red headband that was on the vanity on top of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both then took another glance at the mirror to check their appearance. The feeling that something was off about their look still persisted, but it wasn't as strong as it was in the beginning. Still, they once again wondered if there was indeed something different, or it was something superficial again.</span></div></div>",

We were told that they were planning on cleaning the floor, so we were asked not to go in with our shoes on to not dirty the floor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you're right. I don't know why I thought we left them here... Besides, Sakai-san said she'll watch for them anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly. Now let's go. I don't want to be late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two then went back for the entrance. On the way, the two didn't notice that underneath their tops, their shirts continued to lighten, the color fading more and more, almost turning white in the process, as the sleeves continued to lengthen, currently being halfway down their forearms. Also, Rukion's socks fully encased his thighs, and were now ready to move up to his hips, while the black substance that covered Chaen's thighs stopped dripping off the skirt, as it started to conform to his legs as the material it was forming was starting to become stretchier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the two got fairly quickly to the entrance, with Sakai still at the front desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you leaving now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. We would've stood a bit more, but we are a bit busy now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And please say thanks a again to the chef. That curry really was delicious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe. Thanks you Chaen-san. I will make sure to tell him later. By the way, since tonight we will be a bit busy, can I rely on your help Rukion-san? I know you are busy this week, but I would really appreciate it if you could lend us a hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. But only if you are going to let me work a bit in the kitchen after dinner. I need to polish my skills... Oh, and Chaen might join me as well. If you don't mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rukion-san, you know you are free to try and better yourself at cooking. And if Chaen-san can also improve his skills as well, then even better... Just make sure you don't... use things with strong smells...\", said Sakai, with the last part coming out a bit awkwardly, something the boys picked on, but decided not to press the subject anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter saying their goodbyes, the boys opened the door, but just before they could stop outside, they both felt a gust of cold air hitting them. They shielded their faces from it and closed their eyes in response as well. When the breeze stopped, and the two opened their eyes again, their eyes changed color from the usual blue, with Chaen's now being brown while Rukion's now being a few shades darker than his brother's. Afterward, the two went out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those two sure are close.\", said Sakai to herself seeing them leave. \"Their cooking really need a lot of polishing, but I know why they want to get better so desperately. I can't blame them. Making delicious food for the person you like is really a must these days... Not to mention, it also is a sign of maturity. I just hope that by the time Rukion-san will inherit the inn, he will get better...\", mused the women as she went back to her work. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They expected Yu or someone else to join them and show them around, thinking that the idea of pretending to be tourists to be the perfect excuse to do so. But despite being Saturday, according to the people at the inn, Yu still needed to go to school for some reason, thus the two were stranded at the inn for a while. They were willing to wait a little to see if Yu or Yukiko would come to the inn... But at the moment they were getting very familiar with the town that they didn't need a guide anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat started with some simple flashes of the town began to turn into actual memories of them spending time in Inaba. The growing familiarity with the place made the boys a lot less concerned about how to find an excuse to go back home, as the whole thing with the magic coin was practically erased from their minds. But it wasn't just the wishes and the coin that vanished, as their memories of their home were gradually being replaced with them living in Inaba instead. However there was one big difference that more or less was changing the whole relationship the two had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, while they saw each other a lot in their memories, they didn't seem to spend most of their time together at home. Then the two remembered that they don't live in the same house anymore, with Rukion living at the inn while Chaen was staying at a local house, not too far from the inn. Together with the fact that their personalities were also shifting, with Chaen staying more or less the same if not getting a bit more expressive than he was before, while Rukion was acting more polite and refined, quite evident in his behavior and manner of speech. The two still considered each other siblings... but that feeling was also slowly fading away, as physically they were already quite different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two made their way to the main street fairly quickly, chatting about curry recipes on the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you are thinking about doing a seafood curry?\", asked Rukion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I know it is slightly harder than the normal one the cooks make, but I want to test myself... But I've already decided not to add any weird ingredients this time, so sea cucumbers and clam juice are out. I may need to check the Internet later to see what exactly to put in. Maybe scallops, shrimps and maybe some crab... or maybe  something a little more out there... I heard people put uni in risotto, so maybe that would work...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sounds interesting... But I think I will settle for a beef curry. I must think which cut of meat to choose though since I heard different cuts have different taste and cooking method for things like curry or ramen... I also need to think about spices. Don't worry, I won't go overboard with the spices like Rise-chan, but I may need to check the list of peppers at Junes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two were thinking about their recipes, they once again aged up, this time to 15 years old. They barely grew in height this time, but once again, the subtle increase in height made Rukion look taller than before in comparison to Chaen, even if he was actually a little smaller than a boy his age. Their waists also pulled in quite a bit, with Chaen also getting his abdomen a bit more toned than Rukion. They also felt a bit uncomfortable between their legs as Rukion's socks completed their transformation after reaching his hips and fusing together and darkening further as they became a pair of black opaque pantyhose, while the substance on Chaen's legs turned into a pair of black compression shorts. It felt awkward and a tad uncomfortable for a split second, but almost immediately they brushed off the feeling and continued talking about recipes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way, what time is it Chaien? I forgot to check the time before we left?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... I think we still have about 20 minutes or so before we have to meet the guys at school. Still, getting there a bit early isn't an issue, so let's just wait for them there in case we get to the school before them.\", said Chaien, as his brother nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if the two didn't had any particular reason to go the local school, their minds shifted further along with the reality, as Rukio Amasi and Chaien Satonasa headed to help their friends for the upcoming school festival.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the two continued walking, they discussed their curry recipes with each other. While they were asking one another about putting a few ingredients like squid ink or barbecue sauce to the list of ingredients, since neither knew how they tasted in a curry or wanted to create an abomination like the \"Mystery Food X\" they made before, the two agreed on picking more \"tame\" ingredients this time. They wanted to add a little diversity to their recipe, but still wanted to be edible in the end as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we kind of settled on what to make. But man, all that talk about food made me a bit hungry. I feel like I could eat that huge bowl they serve at Aiya's right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we just ate Chaien. You even said you were feeling full after we finished eating. I know you run a lot to compensate, but you could risk getting a stomach ache. Sometimes you eat as much as Yukimura.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I was just saying. It's not that I- Hold on... Who are you talking about?... I don't know any Yukimura. Is he supposed to be some guy on TV?\", asked Chaien utterly confused, as he couldn't imagine who Rukio was talking about. Hearing that, the latter suddenly started giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe... That's your dog Chaien. Do you think your dog is some sort of celebrity on TV? Hehehe....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My... Hold on, that's not his name! Where did you even get to that name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... What other name could he have other than Nobunaga?... Hehe\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did it again! Last week you said his name was Chosokabe or Mitsunari or something else...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha! Why would I call him that?\", asked Rukio, now laughing openly, amused by the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop laughing! I swear you are picking the name of a Japanese warlord or general and give it to him every time we are talking about him. His name is Muku!... And why are always calling him differently too? You just called him two different ways just now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two were having the exchange, their skin, besides turning silky smooth, also finished their tanning. Chaien's was a bit more pronounced, gaining an olive tint, as Rukio's while also gaining the slight yellowish hue, wasn't as tanned, indicating that he wasn't much of an outdoor person anymore. On top of that, their skirts finished changing as well, as the now pleated material covered their legs without restraining them, as the checkered design completed their look, looking strikingly familiar to the uniform a certain school would have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a little while, after Rukio finally stopped laughing, Chaien sighed a little in frustration, before regaining his composure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you finished?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... Sorry if it took too long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just remember his name is Muku, okay? I don't get it how you always seem to forget... But the way, you know what I heard at Aiya's last time I went there? It looks like Yu-kun completed the Rainy Day Mega Beef Bowl Challenge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! Really?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I was as shocked as you are right now. Apparently he did it last time it rained too...Not even now I know how he did it. He just said something about \"raising his stats\" or something like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... What does that mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No idea. Sometimes it's hard to know how he manages to do some of the things he does. Like catching all those bugs or catching that many fish in one night... It makes me wonder what kind of training he does for of these things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree... Sometimes, he really is like an enigma...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir thoughts regarding Yu were also changing. While it was just respect in the beginning, as the two changed further, their memories about him also did. They currently remember quite a lot about him and how much he has grown ever since arriving in Inaba, and how much he did for them as well. But the respect and admiration started to develop into something else as well. It was a feeling the two boys didn't knew about initially, but it was slowly dawning on them what said feeling might be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, the two continued walking, and soon the Yasoinaba Highschool came into view. They still had a number of things they needed to clear out, but at the moment, they just wanted to not get late for their meeting with the gang.</span></div></div>",

Are we the first ones here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like it. Are you sure we didn't come to early?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so... Maybe they are late but.... I kind of get why Yosuke would be gate, as he needs to make sure Teddie works his shift at Junes while we're here and Naoto-kun might be a bit busy with work... I wonder why the others are late though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe Rise-chan and Kanji-kun are working at the shop... Should I call them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no need to. They could have arrived and are inside. We should take a look to check if they aren't already in class. If we don't find them, we could just return to the entrance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... Besides, I am pretty sure Naoto-kun would be here. She is usually very punctual, so she should have come by now if we didn't get a text from her...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two then entered the high school, not even noticing they now had cell phones in their pockets. As they walked around, their shirts, that were now a pure white continued changing as their sleeves now reached their wrists and their collars loosened a little as they suddenly started to darken along with their cuffs as a yellow line formed around their edges. Of course, this went beneath their jackets, so they wouldn't know of the changes, but even the jackets kept changing. Chaien's was now a very light green, but the color darkened further except for the front of his chest while the thin yellow stripes from before became wider as they were starting to cover a good portion of the front area, along with the zipper as well as on the arms. As for Rukio's the red became more pronounced as the material resembled more cotton at this point, as he started to feel slightly warmer than Chaien due to the slightly different texture of the jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they were strolling around, they saw several groups of students setting up their stands. Food stores, different game stands, exhibits and more were being built by the students, while others set up their classes for different events. There was also what appeared to be a fortune-telling stand in the hallway, even if it seemed like no one was attending to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, this place sure is busy. I wouldn't have expected so may people to come here on a Saturday, but they all look determined to leave a good impression.\", said Rukio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Totally. It will sure be a lot of different themes this year. Makes me wonder a bit how the school afforded all of this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, they do save up quite a bit of money during the year. So I am not too surprised.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore memories entered their heads the more they looked around. Memories of past festivals at Yasogami... as well as their school life. They recalled the times they studied together, their highs and lows... and most importantly, the events that happened not just at school but in Inaba during the past year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, their figures were pretty much done, save for a little more growth later on. Chaien now had a pretty well toned body, with little to no fat on him whatsoever. Rukio on the other hand, didn't had such an athletic physique, but he was far from being overweight, as the fat he had perfectly complimented his bigger hips and butt. And speaking of their rears, Rukio now had one of quite an impressive size, his heart-shaped behind drawing the attention of a few male students, while Chaien's, although not as large as Rukio's, also looked really good, fitting perfectly with his toned legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way... What exactly do we do for the Group Date Caf\u00e9 we have?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... I am not sure to be honest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? This could be bad... I don't have any experience in this sort of thing either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would normally blame Yosuke for suggesting this, but given how most of our classmates voted for the caf\u00e9, it makes me wonder if any of them have an idea... We should've done the video room instead...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it will be fun. I am sure they didn't vote for it if they weren't curious at the very least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True... Hey, do you think the others are in the classroom? Yu-kun and Yosuke might be there, working for the d\u00e9cor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They could be. I wouldn't be surprised if they went there to have a head start... Let's go and meet them there.\"</span></div></div>",

Well, I am sure there is no problem if we get to class a few minutes later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey went to the nearest restroom, and ignoring the fact they entered the women's bathroom, they both went into a stall, and sat down without even pondering if they should. With their skirts down, their underwear changed further as the legs almost completely vanished as the green on Chaien's boxers forming a line on the top portion as the rest blackened, while Rukio's white was already gone, the black completely replacing it as the red color started to spread a little further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile sitting down, they both tried to once again recall the events of this morning. However, much to their surprise, they actually remembered. Chaien came early at the inn to help Rukio with the chores he had to do. At around the same time, Yu dropped at the inn after he finished fishing and talked about the plan for the festival before he left, as the two went to Rukio's room to chat a little before starting to work. The rest went exactly as they remembered from the point they helped at the laundry to gathering the sheets from different rooms and then eating before going to school. There still was the weird thoughts about a video game and some magic coin, but they now dismissed these things as a topic they talked about that they forgot about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... So in the end it was nothing... Maybe it was just us getting tired. Oh well, as long as it's nothing serious, I am not complaining.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am happy it was just a little lightheadedness and nothing too severe... I wonder if it was because of a lack of sleep though. Well, as long as it doesn't persist it shouldn't be an issue anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the two finally letting go of their previous worries, they now decide to relax and enjoy their day, which now both had a feeling it would be a lot better if Yu would be around. As things stood up right now, they both forgot almost entirely about their original world, save for a few images of skyscrapers, and even those seemed to fall into a fog, with them actually being from Tokyo instead. They also stopped thinking they are siblings. Although it was quite apparent as their look and family names continued changing, they still had a strong feeling they are close as siblings. Even if there are no longer any blood ties between the two, there still is a fraternal bond between them that transcends mere friendship. This was perfectly shown in their memories, as they were almost never seen without the other, being almost inseparable. And whatever doubts they had about each other disappeared since this spring, with the help of a certain boy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they finished their business, they both headed to the sink to wash their hands, while occasionally glancing at the mirror in front of them. Their hair finally finished changing, with Chaien now being in possession of a light-brown bowl-cut while Rukio has long black straight hair that reaches to his mid-back, with him neatly sweeping his longer bangs behind his ears. When they were done washing their hands, they exited the stall and headed for their classroom.</span></div></div>",

Even if they didn't know they were late or not, that didn't mean they couldn't stroll a bit on their way. As they walked, they finally grew up to their last age: 16 years old. There was now a 3 inch difference between the two, but they were quite short in comparison to other guys, being around the same height as some of the girls they passed, with Rukio being actually slightly taller in most cases. Their curves also finished growing, with Rukio having bigger proportions than Chaien, but the latter had quite a bit more muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, in their pockets, they both got a driving license for scooters and motorcycles, as they were now both the legal age to drive them, as their names were listed on the licenses: Chaie Satonaka and Rukiko Amagi. Lastly, the mysterious blue flame that appeared within their souls got stronger, as two tarot cards appeared in them. They were still blank, but they wouldn't be for much longer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as they were ready to go up the stairs, they meet a boy with a slightly unkempt fawn colored hair that they immediately recognize. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Yosuke!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey Chaie, Rukiko-san. You came huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're sorry if we got a bit later...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you actually came a little earlier than I anticipated. I was just going down to check if anybody came.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you were here for a while?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe for about half an hour or such. I managed to convince Teddie to go to his shift and not goof around today in exchange for some pocket money to buy something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What does he want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no clue. But knowing him, it will be something only he finds interesting but is useless in reality or something for Nanako-chan. Me and Yu were working on getting stuff ready since we came earlier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe faces of the two boys brightened when they heard Yu was here, but before they could say anything, they both started to cough a little. It seemed quite random, but when their Adam's apples completely vanished, their coughing stopped, as their voices became higher once again, as they now had the same voices as two particular individuals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... Are you okay?\", asked Yosuke a bit worried. \"Do you need some water or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, we're fine Yosuke-kun. We don't know where that came from.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we sure had a fair share of things happening to us, including some sort of short-term amnesia or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? And you're feeling better now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, we're okay. We thought it was due to lack of sleep, but we aren't too sure. Still, we're fine now, so there's not a problem right now.\", said Chaie as Rukiko nodded in confirmation as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say so. You can go upstairs and help Yu with the d\u00e9cor. I'll go to the entrance to pick up whoever came.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys nodded and then left for their classroom while Yosuke went to look for the others outside. The thought of seeing Yu again brought a certain kind of excitement from the two, as it wasn't because of simply asking him things, but to enjoy their time with him. They were that preoccupied to notice a certain constriction that appeared on their chests as a set of bras formed on them. Chaie's was a sports bra that was mostly black with a green outline while Rukiko's was red with black areas to the side, along with the straps and had a lacy design as well.</span></div></div>",

The doubts about their appearances were long gone, their memories about their home and the coin also vanished and the current memories and the knowledge of their identity were clear to them as of this moment. There was still a small inconsistency, but they weren't bothered by it, as their thoughts went to Yu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInitially it was just respect and admiration based on what was told about him. Then it was a growing affection and care as new memories poured in their heads, remembering all the things he did for them. And now those feelings finally bloomed into love. And it wasn't the same kind of fraternal love Chaie and Rukiko had for each other. While Chaie was still a little unsure about about his feelings, Rukiko was without a doubt genuinely in love with him. They knew Rise had a head start with her constant flirting, and they weren't sure if Naoto saw Yu in a romantic light. This made the two want to try harder in their attempts to win him over. However, they were still unaware that they both had feelings for him, and it wasn't helping that they kept quiet about it either. Still, they were determined to become a couple with Yu, and thus, they decided not to back down, whether it was Rise or anyone else who would want to get in front of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, their underwear continued changing, and after several minutes of walking and going up the stairs, they both were in possession of a pair of panties that matched the design of their bras perfectly. Additionally, their jackets also finished changing. Except for the lime-green line in the front of his torso, the rest of Chaie's jacket became a dark green with yellow lines on his arms and on the areas on each side of his zipper, which was also now yellow. On the left side of his chest, three decorative pins as the collar grew as well, leaving him with high collared athletic jacket. As for Rukiko, the zipper completely vanished, before being replaced by several buttons as a deep crimson color adorned the garment. As for the material, it completely turned to wool, effectively becoming a red sweater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir faces did their finishing touches as well. Together with the higher cheekbones, smaller noses and ears, longer eyelashes and plumper lips, they now both possessed very gorgeous, feminine faces. Paired up with the different colored eyes, there was no longer any sign of their original look, as they were nearly integrated in the world they were in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey finally reach their classroom, and once inside, they see Yu moving some desks closer to each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Yu-kun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Narukami-kun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm? Oh Chaie, Rukiko, you've come!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course we did. You really didn't expect us to come, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's just I was wondering when will you arrive. You said there was some things to do at the inn and I believed you would come later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We actually finished a bit earlier than anticipated. But we're sorry if we were indeed late. Especially after you came this morning at the inn as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's really not a problem. You actually came 10 minutes earlier. Yosuke went down to see if there was anyone down waiting for us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way, how did Yosuke manage to finish his shift so quickly. I would've thought he would be there a while longer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dropped by at Junes for some groceries and I found Yosuke a bit behind with his work, so I decided to help him. Teddie remained behind, as he couldn't come to school after he didn't finish his last shift.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, serves him right for slacking off.\", said Chaie with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But do you still have energy? After going fishing so early in the morning and then working at the shop...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It isn't really that much trouble. If I can be helpful to my friends, I am glad I could do something. Besides, it wasn't as if I couldn't kill some time until we had to come to school.\", said Yu while smirking a bit, as the boys couldn't help but giggle a little from the transition from a touching sentence to a little sarcasm, as they were nonetheless touched a little at his display of devotion. \"Now let's get started. Me and Yosuke just began getting this place ready.\" The two nodded as they began helping Yu.</span></div></div>",

I am not going to lie, it sounded a bit tempting at first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I got a bit curious as to how it will work. I haven't been in a group date at all so far, and I wasn't sure how it would work out, so you could say it piqued my interest. But in the end I didn't vote for it as it seemed a bit too far fetched. But it seems that for the others, their curiosity got the best of them by the looks of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other two could only sigh at that statement. Yu didn't vote for the caf\u00e9, but if even he was interested in it, there's no wonder the rest of the class voted for it. Yosuke did say he put down that option as a joke, but they were sure not even he could predict the result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Why did Yosuke put down that suggestion? Now we are stuck doing this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lighten up Chaie, it may not be so bad.\", said Yu. \"Who knows, maybe it won't be so bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess we will find our answer if this was a good idea or not during the first day of the festival .\", said Rukiko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most likely. I just hope the students that voted for it to come.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey then continued hanging the garlands, as they continued chatting while doing so. Rukiko and Chaie had a great time talking with Yu, despite their initial reluctance to come to help for the caf\u00e9, enjoying his company as they kept working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sure will give Yosuke a piece of my mind later, writing down things like these as a joke, while everyone else takes it seriously. It almost sounds like something Teddie would come up with... Still, if Narukami-kun thinks it is also too out-there, then it means he isn't like those two. It makes me wonder how the whole date thing would go... I personally would want to know how will it be... No, wait! Pull yourself together Chaie! It's not even a real date and Rukiko is going to be there too... I need to calm down and get that thought out of my head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I thought I would help with the school festival, I surely didn't think I will do this... What is a group date caf\u00e9 even? Not even Yosuke-kun seemed to know exactly. Does Rise-chan and the others know about this?... Jeez, somehow by the name of it only, it seems like a bad idea. Just a simple caf\u00e9 would've been enough... And how does a group date even work? If I would go with Yu-kun it would've been just the two of us... W-What am I saying?! No, bad Rukiko! Now is not the time to think about dating Yu-kun and... I-I did it again. I need to think of something else quick before Chaie notices I am acting strange.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a miracle how the two managed to suppress their blush, as Yu didn't notice it when he looked at them, but found it a bit strange how they seemed to steal glances of him at times before averting their eyes when he looked at them. In the meantime, Rukiko's and Chaie's nipples started to grow wider and more sensitive as they became a soft pink color. In addition, the former also started to develop small breasts already, as the small mounds started to press on his bra.</span></div></div>",

I knew Naoto or Rise may arrive a little bit late, but it's a little strange if not even Kanji arrived.\", continued Yu, also wondering where Yosuke and the rest of his friends were. \"Did anyone say they wouldn't make it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so. We weren't told anything yet... Maybe we should check our messages of we got a new one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. Maybe we got one and we don't know about yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three pulled out their cell phones, with Chaie and Rukiko not even questioning where they got theirs. Still, deep down, despite feeling a bit guilty about it, they both wanted the rest of their friends, especially Rise, to not arrive yet. The prospect of spending a bit more quality time with Yu was very appealing to them, as they also wished Yosuke to stay out a little longer, still waiting. They knew they couldn't talk more personal things since they weren't alone with Yu and didn't want make each other feel like a third wheel in the conversation, but decided to settle up for this for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile thinking, Chaie's chest also started to rise up, small breasts forming into A-cups while Rukiko's continued their growth, bordering B-cups at the moment. Also, inside their panties, their boyhoods, which didn't grow at all ever since the changes started, began to shrink, their small testes already beginning to borrow into their abdomen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter searching the message list, the three gave out a sigh, with Chaie and Rukiko seeming slightly relieved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I forgot that Kanji-kun said his mother needed him today at the shop to help around sell a few things.. But I wouldn't have guessed Rise-chan to be busy selling tofu as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it's because of that group of tourists that you said would come to the inn. Sakai-san said hey would visit the town a little before checking in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's right. Maybe they went to buy some tofu and some might have recognized Rise-chan, and now be asking for autographs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that's the case... I already know Rise will not be in the mood to help But it's not really like she can just deny a bunch of tourists like that if they don't know about the hiatus...\", said Yu a bit dejected by the situation as the other boys looked at him a bit annoyed without him noticing. \"As for Naoto... I should've guesses she would be busy today as well. Her workload seems to have increased lately by the looks of it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're also here, right? We can still help.\", said Chaie, a bit more gravely that Yu anticipated, but he remained unfazed as he replied back with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. I didn't say you aren't helpful or that your aid isn't necessary. I am actually glad that you came. And I am not just saying this because we're classmates and it is our duty to finish readying this place up. You two should know by now that I always thank others when they help me... especially after you saved me quite a number of times before as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two felt their cheeks warm up slightly as they heard Yu's words, feeling their their hearts skipped up a beat for a second or two. Meanwhile, their testes fully went inside of them as they changed function, producing a lot of estrogen to quicken a little the remaining changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-There's no need to thank us like that. H-Honestly, we did that what was natural to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah... Any of us would've jumped to y-your rescue Narukami-kun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYu smiled a little seeing the two fidget a little. He didn't knew exactly why they were blushing the way they were, but he was happy to see them not upset anymore. He had a gut feeling as to why they were acting like this, but he decided it would be something to ponder for later.</span></div></div>",

I've waited for about 15 minutes and there is no sign of them coming...\", he groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't you receive the text? They aren't coming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Really?\" Yosuke proceeded to take his phone out, but when he put his hand in his pocket, he found it empty. \"W-Where my cell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Did you lost it?\", asked Chaie surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I had it with me when I told dad I'll be leaving... Wait a second... That damn bear! He must've took it when I had my jacket off... Great, now he's going to use all of my battery chatting with Nanako-chan on the phone...\", said Yosuke with an annoyed tone, while the other three could only laugh a little at his misfortune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYosuke calmed down after a few encouraging words form Yu and then was told about the reasons their friends couldn't come back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh. That kind of makes sense. But geez, they sure have the worst timing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On the bright side, they won't know about your idea, so they won't find it embarrassing to come here knowing why we called him here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, it wasn't only my fault Chaie! I only wrote that thing down as a joke, I couldn't have known what the others would choose. You want to blame me, then blame the whole class, okay? It's not like I told anyone to pick it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it was still your idea for the caf\u00e9 though Yosuke-kun...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you should man up too, you know? You started this mess Yosuke.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I admit I was a bit curious about it at first as well, but I now feel like it wasn't a good idea to write it down. You should've just written \"caf\u00e9\" down instead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBombarded by the others' words, Yosuke gave a sigh of defeat. \"Okay, I get it, geez... What's done is done anyway... By the way Chaie, can you help me pick up some boxes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because Yu is still going to need to put the decorations up, a she is the tallest, and Rukiko-san can hold the ladder while we're away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay fine... Just promise they aren't too heavy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's props for the caf\u00e9, it can't be that heavy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring their talk, the boys' manhoods started to shrink down as their chests continued growing, with Chaie's reaching B-cups, while Rukiko's just entered the C-sups range. It was increasingly difficult for the them not to think of themselves as girls at this point, but the two remained perfectly calm about it, concentrating more on their feelings towards Yu than anything else, their inner turmoils being just a distant memory at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYosuke and Chaie left, leaving Yu and Rukiko alone for a several minutes. As Yu was hanging up a few origami roses, Rukiko couldn't help but blush a little, realizing that they were now finally alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What should I do? I didn't expect to actually be alone with Narukami-kun so soon... Should I... confess? No, it's not the time or place for that!  He will most likely tell the others the moment they come back as well... But this could be my chance. I don't know if I will get another opportunity like this... But the setting is all wrong! Saying \"I love you\" while preparing the class for the group date caf\u00e9 will be incredibly awkward! Not to mention there is nothing romantic going on right now and I have no idea how to change the mood either... I know I am thinking a little too hard about this, but... Should I just tell him and hope for the best?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRukiko's mind was racing, unsure of what exactly to do, as his breasts became large C-cups and a new cavity formed inside his abdomen. On his license, the \"R\" in his name started to break apart, as the legs fused into one and the top were reattaching in a different manner to the leg. Noticing his friend in deep thought, Yu asked him as he climbed off the ladder:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rukiko, are you alright? You seem in deep thought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? W-What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You looked like you were thinking about something really hard. Did something happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He can read me so easily... If only he could also read my mind...\", thought  Rukiko. \"... I would be a fool not to tell my feelings at this moment. But it feels wrong to say it like this. There is no atmosphere and the others could return any moment... I also made him worried about me... I must choose my words carefully.\"</span></div></div>",

I should've said something else\", said Rukiko to himself. \"I... couldn't tell my feelings properly. Right now isn't the time after all... But what came out was more like a plea than a confession. I hope he doesn't think I am overly dependent on him or that that I want him to give me company like he does with Nanako-chan... I should've worded my thoughts better... He's waiting for an answer too... Should I outright tell him? Or should I come up with something else?... Why is it so hard for me to say that I love Narukami-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, he started feeling dizzy for a second. His small boyhood, which never grew all this time suddenly was being pulled inside of him. Inside his soul, the blank tarot card now had the image and number of The Priestess on it. As the last vestiges of his previous identity completely vanished and a new one one created, a virgin flower now resting between hes legs, the name on the license became \"Yukiko Amagi\", completing the changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYu quickly took notice of Yukiko's lightheadedness and grabbed her shoulders before she could fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Sorry for that. I felt quite a bit lightheaded today for some reason. But now I'm feeling better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad to hear. For a second I thought I need to take you to the nurse's office.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are very sweet. But thank you nonetheless.\", she replied with a faint blush before realizing she still didn't have an answer for him. \"W-Well, a-as for what I meant earlier...\", she started to stammer out before Yu interrupted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanted me to spend some quality time at the Amagi Inn, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I visited you this morning Sakai-san said you wanted to spend an afternoon together. I would be happy if we could have some quality time if wish for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blush from Yukiko's cheeks deepened a little, as she tried her best to not let him see it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is Sakai-san doing?! She must have planned for this! But I never said anything of the sort to her! She... did this for me then? I know she isn't the type to pull out pranks like these... As much as I appreciate your help Sakai-san, please tell me beforehand what you intend to do... I don't know if I should thank her or not for this...\",she thought before giving her reply in the least flustered tone she mustered. \"Y-Yes. That is correct. If possible, I would like to spend a day with me if you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. I don't mind. I also can get a little more familiar with the inn as well. Especially since I'll have you to lead me around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukiko couldn't help but smile a little at his response. \"Thank you. I'll call you for a day in which I am not busy with helping around. I'll tell you when to come.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anytime you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded to him before the two took a some curtains from a box to hang them. She gave a small, inaudible sigh as she held the ladder in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is pretty much clueless at how things are at this point... And yet I feel that it doesn't mean it's over if he gladly accepted the invitation... He may like me, but he would mean he is still unaware. I wouldn't be too surprised if that would be the case...  Rise-chan may be a lot more bold than I am, but I still have a chance... Should I tell him about my curry recipe I thought of? No, I better keep the surprise. I just need to make sure it tastes great.\", she thought as she happily helped him with the curtains.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Are we going to serve people?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just some water, juice, maybe some tea or even coffee, I don't know. It's pretty hard to sit at a table and talk without having your mouth dried up. And we need to serve the people some snacks or something to it a little less tense. Seriously, it would be more like a meeting than a date otherwise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad told me a few times. When he hosted a party or something like that, he needed some snacks to have people not feel bored of just standing in the room... Or something like that. He has experience at this, so I trust him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say so. But why do you need me? None of these are heavy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are if you carry them on your own. And I didn't want to disturb Yu with his work, and Yukiko-san isn't that good at carrying too many things, so that's why I called you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, I guess I'll help. But I'll say it again. I don't really see why you needed me for this. You could've just carry these yourself and make another trip or two here for the rest that you couldn't carry the first time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYosuke stood silent for a second, almost seeming like he contemplates what he should say next, while scratching the back oh his head. Chaie was curious why he was acting he way he did, as knew that he wouldn't call him just for manual labor. As he waited for Yosuke to say anything, his breasts grew to medium B-cups and stopped there, while his testes already found their way in his abdomen, and his boyhood was already starting to get smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter giving out a small sigh, Yosuke asked: \"Sorry if this sounds a bit strange, but... Do you like Yu?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What's that supposed to mean? Of course I do! What isn't to like-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't mean the way you like Rukiko-san, but the way Rise-san likes Yu.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChaie's face started to redden as he answered back in a really flustered manner: \"D-Don't be stupid! I-I-I don't like him like that! And besides, I am not interested in a boyfriend or anything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chaie, if you want to deny that, you shouldn't look so panicked when you say that...\", he said as the other tried to regain his composure. \"And besides, you were going to say that there is nothing that would make him a person you don't want to be around, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChaie was at a loss for words. Yosuke really cornered him this time, and he really didn't know how to get out of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What makes you think I like him? You don't see me acting all giddy around him like Rise-chan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To be honest, I had my doubts at the start, but... I don't know if you really noticed yourself but the more we dived in the TV world, the more attached to him you seemed to get. You really seemed to like being in his company as much as Rukiko-san, who is a bit more open after we rescued him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So? Is that such a bad thing? Liking someone's company doesn't mean any romance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, but you aren't the type to wish to spend too much time with others when Yukiko-san is available. Normally you two would just be together most of the time. I can get why he would wish to know him better after finally becoming less introvert, but I really didn't expect you spending some alone time with Yu. And you seemed quite happy after talking with him, more so than usual... And after Rise-san joined the group, the way you always try to cut her out every time she gets a bit too close to Yu really made me thinking. A simple friend, wouldn't try so hard to have a girl back off the way you do... It's just speculation, but this is what I believe. Am I wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChaie was really stuck. He didn't want Yosuke to know, but knowing him, he will pester her until he's convinced, especially since he doesn't have any arguments to counter him and the the redness on his face still hasn't subsided right now. He could lie since Yosuke didn't had anything solid either, but... That would mean in a way he would betray himself as well...</span></div></div>",

After all, you are so not the type of person to give up on something after you put your mind into it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChaie was speechless. He expected Yosuke to tease him, goad that he knew Chaie would have feelings for Yu or straight up tell him to give up, given that Rise is his competition., but instead, he was actually encouraging him. He didn't feel as his boyhood continued to be pulled inside of him as a small slit formed at his groin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... Why are you telling me this now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I kind of figured out we wouldn't have another occasion where Rukiko-san wouldn't be around or Rise-san or Teddie to spy on us so I thought this will be a good moment to get out the truth out of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just to know. If I didn't knew how you were feeling and someone else snatched Yu, without anyone giving you a little morale boost, you would feel extremely down. But since Yu wasn't claimed by anyone yet, I guess there is still time you for you to try and get him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow... You actually sound really considerate right now.

You aren't, but that doesn't mean you don't let your mouth speak before you actually think sometimes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now look who's teasing me... Rise-san is already enough...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small giggle escaped Chaie's lips as he regained his vigor. He had felt inferior to not just Rise but to other girls as well due to his appearance, but it felt good to be told he still has a chance in the running for Yu's affection, especially after telling himself he shouldn't give up on just that. Not to mention that it wasn't clear what Yu's preferences were. One thing was certain though: He will not back down from pursuing his love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, a small yelp escaped his lips as the changes finalized as his new identity was complete, proven the pure flower she had between her legs. Yosuke, who noticed her grimacing a little asked her with a little concern in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, are you okay Chie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am fine, don't worry, I just felt a little weird there for a second, that's all... But thanks for telling me not to give up... In fact, I thought of a way already to start my pursuit.\", said Chie with a big grin on her face while Yosuke could only worry a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know if I should tell her that there's a chance Yukiko-san and even Naoto-kun to have feelings for Yu... I don't think I should. Things will get really messy if I spill the beans, especially since Christmas is not that far away... I think Chie will notice at the very least that Yukiko-san has a thing for him eventually... I hope.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided to not say anything for the moment and simply picked up a couple of boxes as Chie helped him with the rest, as they began to head back to the classroom.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We had some issues finding these.\", said Chie, while Yosuke smirked to himself at how the girl managed to somehow pull off the lie without any problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not a problem.\", assured Yu. \"But did you find what you needed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we just need to set these things up. Let's start with the tablecloths for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me help Yosuke-kun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Yukiko-san. Hey partner, do you mind tag teaming with Chie for this one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two groups then started putting the cloths on the improvised tables as they did some small talk while doing so. At one point, after a slight moment of hesitation, Chie mustered enough courage to start ask Yu:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way, do you mind if we hang out at the movies next week?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. But is there a specific reason why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A new \"Trail of The Dragon\" movie came out not that long ago and it should come to the cinemas next week. And I was wondering if we could go together...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. I don't mind it at all. We haven't been to a movie together for a while, so I would be more than happy to join you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChie started to blush a little as she continued: \"Thanks... And maybe we could train a little later as well, near the flood plain. Like we did not that long ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean preparing next time we dive into the TV world? Sure thing. Training with you is always enjoyable. It feels great to be able to do some exercising outside the basketball practice at school with someone as motivated as you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Chariot Arcana within her gave out a small gleam as their bond seemed to deepen a bit more. This was perfectly demonstrated by the big, yet embarrassed smile Chie had right now. She managed to hide her blush however and firmly replied back: \"Then it's settled. We'll talk more about it when the festival is over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYu nodded with a smile as they continued laying down the tablecloths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I might make a little snack for us for after the movie. I will tell him about the curry I will make. Hope he will like my ideas for the dish... Just focus on the cook book and nothing else. That seems like the winning strategy for this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Chie was having her monologue, Yu also started to think about something he noticed about Chie and Yukiko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They both are starting to act a little different than before. Ever since that concert at Junes, they seem a lot more eager to spend time with me. I wonder why though. Nothing major happened after rescuing Naoto... Could it be...? They are a little more bashful than Rise is, but... No, I may be overreacting. There is no real proof here. Besides, I need to discern if Rise's feelings are true or not... I really doubt she is acting... but if it's true than maybe they too are...Now's not the time for this. Right now, I should focus on the festival. I will think about this later... But I may need to ask uncle Dojima what he thinks about the situation later just to be sure... And also to find a day when her and Yukiko's schedules don't overlap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the side, Yukiko and Yosuke were silently watching from the side the interaction between their friends, and while they couldn't hear what they were saying, they saw Chie's mood improve suddenly before they went back to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sure looks like Chie's morale suddenly increased.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you guess why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really. Maybe Narukami-kun told her a good joke or maybe Chie told her about her new favorite movie that came out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Don't you think that Chie might have another reason for getting happy all of a sudden.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really, no. There are still a lot of ways to brighten her up like this, so who knows. Also, I will be busy next week. Narukami-kun wants to visit the inn to better know the staff. So sorry if one of these days I won't be able to meet up with you guys. And please don't tell Rise-chan about this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I won't\", said Yosuke as the two put another cloth on a table. \"...They aren't even aware that they both have a thing for Yu. And how does he manage to get so well with so many girls all at once?... I guess there are questions I won't find the answer yet... I just hope my partner will still be in one piece if they do find out... Although knowing the two... you never know how things will play out. Heck, even Rise might overlook this... Guess it's a waiting game then. I am not dumb enough to involve myself in a love war between girls...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, at the Amagi Inn, Sakai was cleaning a particular room when she noticed something next to the TV set.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm? Is this a foreign coin?\", she pondered as she picked the coin up. \"I wonder if someone lost it here. It doesn't seem to be Japanese by the markings it has... It may belong to one of the previous customers, but this room was occupied two days ago and there is nothing about someone losing something this valuable... I guess I will look into it at a later date.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then recalled the events of the morning as she continued to hold onto the coin. \"Yukiko-san did come in here for a little while... I wonder if she noticed it... But then again, she and Chie-san were surely distracted by Narukami-san's visit... Love can be such a beautiful thing when you're young... I heard they are against Kujikawa-san, but I am sure one of them will win over his heart... Still, I wish both of them had the same chances of winning him as any other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe coin grew warm for a second in her hand, but the she didn't notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, I would be a little unfair if I wouldn't support Yukiki-san, but Chie-san deserves a chance as well... I guess only time will tell who will become the lucky winner.\", she giggled to herself as she pocketed the coin and continued cleaning the room.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"All right! Let's have some fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon Thomas couldn't be any happier. He just celebrated his 12th birthday less than a month ago and he was now at last at the appropriate age to play Persona 5. He heard so many good things about the game recently and from his brief experience he got from Persona 4 Golden, after playing it a little with his older friends, he was thrilled he could play the newest installment in the series on his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, his family didn't buy him the game for the birthday despite asking for it, with his parents suggesting he should play something more tame first. But he was having none of it. He searched for places where he could buy the game cheaper, but he didn't find any site or store that would sell it so that his allowance would be enough to buy it. One day however, he found an old man at a little store in the market, selling different types of goods at much cheaper prices than someone would expect, one of them being the Persona 5 game. The man happily gave him the game, as he said he needed some income for his newly opened store, this lowering the prices enough for most people to buy them. But there was something that the man said that caught his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you like doctors little guy. Playing this game will surely make you understand the life of one, with both good and bad things that could happen...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon was confused by the man's words, but he paid little attention to them as he went home to play the game. From the moment he started playing, he was charmed by the visuals and gameplay and combat system, and was touched by the protagonist's story. After a fairly long prologue, and some awesome cutscenes, he finally got some gameplay, which he admitted was downright amazing. While he wanted to beat down Kamoshida immediately after learning of his true nature, he was intrigued by the Confidant mechanic, which allowed him to form bonds with others to strengthen your abilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was one thing that surprised him. Not too long into the game, there indeed was a doctor, Tae Takemi, just like the man said. Truth be told, she didn't look like one at first, given her attire and attitude, but he digressed, as he was curious about her character. What threw him off however was that somehow the old man knew about this character. He seriously doubted he would play a game like this at his age, and he surely didn't play his copy of it given it was unopened when he bought it. He was confused by this, but he let it slide eventually, as he continued playing the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday was no different. After finishing up school, he rushed into the house and went straight into his room, not even taking off his white tennis shoes. He currently wore a white dress shirt and a pair of dark-blue jeans but no jacket, since it was still warm outside despite being November.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then turned on his game, wishing to play at the very least until his parents got home. After loading it to just after making Sojiro's Confidant, he started to roam outside to look around. When he had to visit the doctor's clinic, he was curious to see how it would play out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, now let's see how she is. She seemed pretty chill and cool in my opinion. I wouldn't expect that from a doctor though. They all seem pretty serious all the time. I wonder when we will get to her backstory.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter going in the clinic, and talking with her a bit, he found out Tae was working on an experimental drug and asked the protagonist to sample it out, which ended with him passing out. Afterward, she asked him to help her with her experiments with the drug and in return she would supply him with some of her medicine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yikes... It makes me wonder if she will continue all these tests like this. She seems pretty shady and is a bit of a troll, but I guess she's likeable. I kind of like her playfulness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe way things played out, it seemed like Tae would indeed become a new Confidant, but the game suddenly started to glitch and the screen froze for a few seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the... Is this thing busted? I don't-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Brandon could wonder what was going on, a bright flash came out of the TV and engulfed him. When the light faded out, he was gone.</span></div></div>",

Instead, he found himself on a very busy street, with lots of stores on both sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What happened? Where am I?... Wait a second...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took another glance at the street. He could clearly see that the people around him were of Asian descent, given their features, and the different signs around the place, despite not clearly understanding them, he remembered the letters from games and TV shows as kanji, the Japanese alphabet. But that wasn't all. The layout of the place, and the several stores around looked really familiar. It took him only a second to realize where he was exactly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-This is... This is the street from the game! This is where the protagonist lives!... How did this happen?! Did the game do this?... But why? Everything was perfectly fine until that one scene with the doctor... Was the thing cursed or something? That old man sure didn't seem like a magician or anything like that... I need to find help. At the very least, I must find someone who can help me around. That game had the English settings on, so I can't understand a word these signs are saying...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slowly walked around the street, in search of someone kind enough to aid him. He knew he couldn't just ask an adult, as it would not only be a little embarrassing, but he wasn't sure someone with a job or a place he needed to go would just help him around. He decided thus to ask maybe a teenager as they might make some time for him... only if it wasn't a school day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked around the street, inching closer to where Caf\u00e9 LeBlanc was in the game. He thought he could ask Sojiro for help, since he was most of the time inside the establishment, but since he didn't knew a dime of Japanese, he knew he would have trouble trying to talk with him.  However, Brandon soon bumped into a young man. He was almost knocked over, but managed to keep his footing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I am sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon was shocked. While he was surprised the person he bumped into spoke English, he was distracted by who he actually was. The black, unkempt hair, the glasses and the gray eyes were way too familiar for him to miss. As the young man seemed to move away, Brandon called to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Wait!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Actually...\" Brandon knew he couldn't outright tell him about how he got here, as even in the story about the Metaverse, a game that sends you to another world would be way too far-fetched. \"I-I am a bit lost here. Can you help me ?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man took a few glances at the boy, noticing his blue eyes and blond hair before he said: \"Are you a tourist by some some chance?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes... I am Brandon Thomas by the way...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ren Amamiya. Nice to meet you.\", said Ren as he offered Brandon a handshake, which he politely accepted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that his actual name? There was no clue about that in the game... It actually sounds a lot cooler than what I named him...\", muttered the boy to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how did you get lost?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... I somehow found myself here. I know it sounds weird, but you have to believe me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait. You mean you don't know how you got here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I decided to look around the area a little and I guess... I kind of lost track of where I am...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you got separated from others as you strolled a bit and now you found yourself here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah, kind of...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Were your parents with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-Not exactly, no...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" Ren pondered a little before smiling a little and saying. \"Don't worry. I'll help you. Can you come with me? I know a place you can stay while I can get help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Sure! Thank you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRen then offered his hand, and the two walked together to Caf\u00e9 LeBlanc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man... I know I shouldn't be as excited as I am right now, but this is awesome! I got to meet Ren and next I will meet Sojiro. I wonder if I can meet the other character as well... Though for Ren to hold my hand like that... Feels a little weird. But somehow it also feels nice...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside Ren's bag, a black cat peaked out of it and looked at Brandon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something off about this kid... It could be my imagination, but he feels like he shouldn't belong here.... Then again, I have to agree with Ren, that he totally looks like a tourist... Maybe I am thinking to hard about this. Only time will tell if this is just a feeling or something else...\"  </span></div></div>",

The door isn't locked but he isn't here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think he went somewhere and forgot to close the place up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would normally say no, but... He once left the front door to his house open by accident. If he left in a hurry he may have forgotten to lock the door... He did say he needed tome more ingredients for the curry, but I didn't expect him to leave in such a rush...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon was a bit disappointed. It was true that he didn't knew much about Sojiro, nor he was one of the characters he really wanted to meet, but he still wanted to at the very least talk with him a little. He found it a little funny though how someone that looked as serious as Sojiro would forget to lock the door, not only to the caf\u00e9, but t his house as well. His little moment of amusement was however interrupted by a little feeling of dizziness. It was in a way similar to the time his parents gave him a little bit of alcohol to drink up, although there was no migraine this time. Ren noticed the boy looked a little lightheaded and tapped his shoulder a little worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay? Are you feeling sick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I just feel a little dizzy for some reason....\", assured Brandon, but even he was a bit confused by why he felt the way he did all of a sudden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout noticing, his feet started to grow a little bigger inside his shoes. But as they did, his toes became arched and smaller, while they gained a pedicure in the process. But what was the weirdest thing that happened was that his toenails were now coated by a red nail polish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the lightheartedness came, it disappeared just as fast, Brandon being surprised at how everything seemed normal again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel better all of a sudden now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure? You looked a little out of it a second ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am fine now... Whatever that was it is gone now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\", asked Ren, with the boy nodding in response. While he was curious what may have caused him to feel unwell, he sighed as he saw the boy looked alright now. \"If you say so... I would take you to Takemi-san to give you a small check-up, but she said she would arrive later today...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon perked up a little upon hearing the doctor's name as he inquired: \"Is she a famous doctor or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really. She runs a small clinic not far from here, but she doesn't work at a hospital. She may seem a little... apathetic at times, but she is a really good physician... It's just that she sometimes prefers to do some things her way...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the conversation, Brandon's sneakers started to darken, as the white became a light-gray. That wasn't all, as they lost their laces and the material seemed to overall thin out, being less form-fitting for his bigger feet. The soles also lost almost all of its ridges, becoming nearly flat in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's strange. She doesn't seem to be that important... She is a \"Confidant\", but I wonder why the old man from before talked about her the way he did? Also, what did Ren meant by \"apathetic\" and \"liking doing things her way\". She did look a little playful and a little sly given how she convince him to try that medicine out in the game, but she didn't seem too different than that... That makes me wonder what kind of work she does...\", thought Brandon to himself, as Ren looked at his watch in a bit of worry.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I have a few appointments scheduled and I need to make it on time. I am in a bit of a hurry, so I don't know what should I do right now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon was confused. Initially, he thought Ren had to leave for school, but upon a better look at his clothes, he saw that he was dressed a little too casual for school. A quick peek at a calendar on the wall, confirmed that in this world it was Saturday, which meant Ren should be free today. But he was having a schedule? While he played the game, he noticed that he needed to spend time with others to raise his Confidant level. He kind of got the idea that it meant that Ren had to meet others during the day as well, but to have a schedule for that seemed way too out-there. And given by how worried he looked, that meant he had to have made quite a big number of appointments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA part of him wanted to go with him, since he wanted to meet the rest of his friends, that were not yet shown in the game, but he realized it would be too much of a hassle. Not only would Ren need to drag him along for whatever he needed to do today, but it would surely feel a little awkward, as he needed to stay close to him to get get lost, which would make his private time with his friends quite \"crowded\"... And there was also figuring out how to get home as well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was thinking, his hair started to grow out. But it wasn't much, as his mane grew slightly thicker, without changing his hairstyle too much. But its color was what was started to become a lot different, as it started to darken, the one golden locks turning into a sandy-blond color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter sighing to himself, and resigning to his situation, he told Ren: \"You can go. I'll just wait here for the owner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\", asked Ren, a bit surprised by the younger boy's words. \"I know I am a bit busy today, but I think I can afford some time to stay with you a little bit longer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be fine, don't worry. I am old enough to take care of myself. I'll just wait here until the owner comes back. Besides, I don't want to take out too much of your time. I am sure you have a lot to do today, so I don't want to disturb you from your personal time. Just tell your friends I said hi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRen was really impressed. He didn't expect someone who was this young to be as composed as he was. He almost seemed mature in a way... Regardless, Sojiro had to return eventually, as he wouldn't close the caf\u00e9 on a weekend after all. Ren was sure he will get back in about 15 minutes at most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'll call Boss and tell him about you. He should be coming back any time now, but I want to make sure he doesn't get surprised when he founds a random boy in here alone. Just make sure you don't cause any trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't, don't worry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then. But before I leave, let me tell you a little about Boss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRen started describing Sojiro a bit to Brandon, and even though he knew a little about him from what he saw in the game, he was happy he could gain a few more details about Sojiro. In the meantime, his dark jeans began to tighten around his legs, showing them a little more now. Also, the material started to soften a little, as the color began to turn from blue to green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, did you get all that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, don't worry. I'll chat a bit with him before I leave... for my group...\"'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good. I wishes I stood a little bit longer, but I need to leave now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. Just make it in time for your friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will. And thanks... I will tell them about you as well... So... I guess this is goodbye for now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the two saluted each other, they parted ways as Ren left the caf\u00e9.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... I forgot to ask him how he speaks English if we are in Japan...\", thought Brandon. \"Oh well, if it means Boss will also speak English, then I will have no issues talking with him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside Ren's bag, Morgana was also having a little dilemma of his own. \"That kid spoke Japanese really well... I guess Ren got a bit used to it and didn't question it after we met that foreign exchange student from Shinya's class... I guess in the end he really was just a lost tourist... Whatever I found odd before must've been my imagination.\", mumbled the cat as Ren texted on his phone to Sojiro about Brandon. \"Still, why was Takemi busy today again? I thought she said she would in fact be free... Oh well, maybe something came up and Ren forgot to tell me...\" </span></div></div>",

Not long after, he started to think of his current predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so let's see... First this old man who opens a new shop that I haven't seen before gives me a game at a much cheaper price than I ever found. Everything about the game is great and all... then all of a sudden the game crashes and the next second it teleports me inside of it. And it so happens when I get to make a Confidant with Takemi, the doctor the old man said I would understand her... This really doesn't make any sense. I really doubt that guy played the game before, he's just too old for that. And why does he specified the doctor in particular? Is there something I am missing? Well, she is one of the first people you can establish a relationship with in the game, but she didn't seem that special. Besides, she's not even here from what Ren told me. So how am I supposed to understand her life and job if I can't meet her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was surely something that tied the old man to what was going on right now, but he didn't ask any questions about the game, as he was too excited to play it, which he was kicking himself right now. As he was thinking, his skin lost any traces of body hair it once had, except that one on his head, leaving it perfectly smooth. Also, he started to become a little paler, as he was gradually losing the usual tan he had from spending quite a lot of time outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I guess I can meet her later if want to. It's not like she would be away all day long. It makes me wonder though why he mentioned her specifically like that... I guess it would be cool to see how a doctor does their job and knowing a bit more about medicine might be useful later...\", thought Brandon as he began getting a bit curious about how would a physician work like... as well as wanting to learn a bit about medicine in general.\" Still, I don't think that should be my priority at the moment... I guess I should've told Ren the truth about how I got here... Who knows, maybe he would've found a solution or something... I mean the whole Metaverse thing is more or less with magic too... It sucks that I don't know when he comes back though... I wonder what he told Boss. I guess I will find out when he comes back from his shopping...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then patiently waited for Sojiro to arrive, looking around the place to keep himself preoccupied. During this time, the top portion of his shoes almost completely vanished. What was left was a few straps that covered his feet like a pair of sandals, but the straps got connected by another one as it started to slowly crawl its way upwards to his calves. His pants also started to recede, as they currently revealed his ankles. After about 5 minutes, Brandon thought of something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... This place is currently empty. So I guess I should check it out a bit until Sojiro comes back.\" A part of him wanted to visit the kitchen, as he wanted to know if the recipe for the famous curry the caf\u00e9 was selling was there. But as much as he would love to know how to cook the food from a game, there was another place he wanted to see. At first, he thought it would be a little mean to go there, but he was slowly developing a sense of boldness that made him want to know a certain person better... \"I don't think Ren would mind if I look in his room a bit, right? I am not going to touch anything. so I guess there shouldn't be an issue...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There was something about visiting Ren's room that was somehow very appealing. A part of him knew it was mostly because he wanted to know more about the protagonist of the game he was playing, except this time with emotions of his own. But there was this sudden desire to know him more than just a character of the game, something more important... Brandon shook his head as he stood up and made his ways up the stairs to the attic. If things were the same way that he thought, Ren's room would be upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd indeed it was. Despite the somewhat cramped space, but he noticed that some of the old stuff inside was now gone, as it was no longer cluttered like before, while his bed, couch and improvised desk were the same way like he remembered from the game. Sure there also were new stuff in there such as an old TV, an old gaming console, a heater, some plushies and a poster, with a character he remembered from Persona 4 and another one with what he assumed to be the Phantom Thieves logo he saw before in various ads for the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh... This place doesn't look too bad. I was a bit worried it would seem a little dull, but Ren really seems to have taken care of this place... But it still kind of looks a bit too rustic for my taste. I guess I can't complain though. It's a lot better than it was in the beginning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was looking around the room, he missed the fact that he slowly started to grow in height, as he aged from 12 to 15 years old. But the increase wasn't too drastic, as he grew by only a few inches, making him tiny bit shorter than a boy his current age. This however did made his clothes a bit tighter on him, but he didn't seem to mind. Like before, he felt a little dizzy for a brief second, but this time the sensation didn't persist, thus he didn't ponder too much on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is really a lot of stuff he can buy if he can fill his room all these things. But what's with the crappy TV? It looks like it came from over 10 years ago. And this console looks prehistoric... Where did he even find all these games for it anyway? Not that I am a video game person anyway... Wait, I am one right? I play games on my console once a week... Or was it once every two days?... Okay Bandon, keep calm and focus on this\", he said to himself as he tried to calm focus his thoughts, not noticing the different way he addressed himself as. \"Man, do I still feel a bit woozy from before? What was that anyway? Well maybe it was some sort of vertigo or something like that... It may be a side effect of coming into this world... Well, I guess I should head downstairs now. Boss may be coming back any minute now and I don't want to make him angry by snooping around... But if it was Ren the one that came back, I guess it wouldn't be too bad...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could head down, he felt his pants and shirt grew even tighter on him, as they clung to his body a lot more. He was confused as to why this was happening, but didn't ponder too much on it, as it didn't cause him any discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a part of him that seemed a bit more mischievous, that wanted to play around with Ren a bit, thinking he should hide in the room to see his reaction later, but he quickly let go of that thought as he went down the stairs. He also started to improve his vocabulary, as he knew quite a larger array of words than before, the curious thing about it being that a good portion of them were medical terms. Lastly, in regards to his name, his memories changed, firmly believing his name was now Bandon Tomas. It wasn't a big change at the moment, but soon, this will have many other implications...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Just as he reached the ground level, Bandon heard someone at the door. He quickly took a seat at one of the booths as the bell rang once the door was opened. The person that entered was a middle aged man with slicked-back dark hair and a receding hairline, a chinstrap beard with a goatee and black glasses, and was carrying a few shopping bags in his hands. He wore a pair of pale khakis, a pink shirt with its sleeves rolled up and a blazer on top of it. It took the man a moment to notice the boy, which prompted the boy to stand up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hello. Can I help you with the bags?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, thank you, I've got it.\", said the man, slightly impressed by the boy's politeness. \"I guess you're the one the kid told me about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I am Bandon Tomas. Nice to meet you sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Likewise. I am Sojiro Sakura, but people around here call me Boss. I am sorry for your circumstances, but given how big this place is, it really isn't a surprise to get lost around here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... It really was unfortunate...\", said Brandon,  but since he didn't want the discussion to head to a territory he didn't know, he decided to steer the conversation to a different direction. \"So, uh... I noticed the door was left open. Did something happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's just that I forgot. I know it was just for only 15 minutes or so, but it is pretty inexcusable to let the front door opened like that. I guess this is one of the signs that I am getting a little old...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, everyone forgets things from time to time. And you don't look too old anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, thanks kid. Can you wait a little until I put these things away? It won't take long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. Take your time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSojiro thanked the boy as he went into the kitchen, a she took his blazer off, while Bandon sat down again. As he waited, he didn't notice how his feet started to feel as if they were pushed upwards, a small platform forming underneath, while the color of his pants became even smoother, the fabric not being as rough as before, as they lost any pockets it once had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He sure seems like a nice guy. In the game, he was a bit colder, but I guess that as the story progresses, he starts to open up, huh? It's kind of clich\u00e9, but I don't mind it. Character development is important for every good story... I wonder when exactly he starts changing. Maybe after his daughter got better and started going out of the house...\" Bandon stopped himself, as he realized what he just said. \"Wait, how do I know that? And he has a daughter?! But there is no mom around or anything... Did she appear later in the story? Or is there something I am missing?... Did I spoil myself with some details about the story by accident?... I don't think so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile trying to get his thoughts together, his hands started to slim out as his fingers and nails got a bit longer. He missed the fact that the same red nail polish that was on his feet was now coating his fingernails, or that his hands became a little smaller as the same process started to happen to his forearms as they too started to become slimmer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before h could think further, Sojiro stepped out of the kitchen, which prompted Bandon to walk up to him, as he tried to regain his composure. Maybe he could ask Boss about the whole daughter business to make sure that he didn't remember anything wrong. But there was the risk that this was something he shouldn't know about Sojiro as well, and asking him something like that would seem suspicious.</span></div></div>",

Not to mention it would seem more like he was a stalker rather than someone from another world. And since he didn't know if Sojiro would even tell him about his supposed daughter in the first place, he settled to try and sort his thoughts out before anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I finished prepping the kitchen for when the rush hour comes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does it really get so busy around here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, not always, but I do have a good number of clients at noon and some time later. Some come here for the curry, and some come just for the coffee... By the way, do you want to take a cup?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it is a bit earlier than usual, but if you want some coffee I can make a cup for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But uh... I don't have any money at me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't sweat it, kid. I am not going to charge you money given your circumstances. Besides, I am sure you need something to brighten you up a bit as well, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Bandon was pleased to see that Sojiro's politeness, he wasn't sure he wanted coffee. Of course, he would've loved to eat his famous curry, which apparently can also be eaten for breakfast, but this would be too much to ask. He also didn't like coffee too much either. It always seemed to bitter for him, and the only time he liked it was when he put a lot of cream and sugar into it, but he thought in his opinion, that it kind of ruined the taste as well, as it didn't resemble the former taste it had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was about to turn down the offer, but he suddenly felt a little sore in his throat, as his vocal chords started to tighten a little. He thought a little water would do the trick, but at the same time, an odd craving to drink a bit of coffee began to appear. He didn't understood why he would to, but he was now thinking that drinking the beverage would make him a little more mature... and also since there was no carbonated drink around, he thought some caffeine wouldn't harm him right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I will have one please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing. Got any flavor you would want to try out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... I'll leave it to you. I am not that knowledgeable with the different types of beans you have... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well. Wait a few minutes until I make it.\", said Sojiro as he put on his apron and started working on the coffee, while Bandon sat on one of the stools.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile waiting, his shirt continued becoming tighter on him as its neckline started to plunge a little. Also, the fabric began to soften a little as well, as the texture was slowly becoming similar to that of his pants. Lastly, his sleeves also began to recede, leaving his forearms almost completely bare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he didn't notice anything , as he was slowly analyzing the situation. What seemed a little off was that he seemed a lot more calm about his predicament, no longer feeling nervous and confused as he did in the beginning, with his vocabulary also gradually improving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something feels off about all this. I wonder why Boss isn't already calling the police, given the circumstances of the story I made up. He doesn't seem alarmed at all... And he didn't ask many question about me either. Did Ren tell him enough for him to consider it's enough? Wouldn't it make more sense to ask me directly? It would seem more beneficial... Also, there seems to be something wrong with me as well. The whole family affair aside, I don't know why I wanted to drink coffee all of a sudden. The benefits of caffeine are a given, but I don't particularly remember a time when I drank... Oh wait... If I recall correctly I think I drank some before. Yeah, I think I had one at breakfast yesterday I believe. But why couldn't I remember that a second ago?... Maybe my mind is still muddled a bit after all that happened... I wonder when Ren comes back... Maybe I should ask Boss about it...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Just before he could ask, Sojiro handed him a cup of coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you go. It is one of the most popular we have here. I could go and tell you more about the way it should taste, but why won't you taste it first. Oh, I almost forgot. You are free to add a little sugar if you want.\", said Boss as he handed you a small jar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBandon still didn't understand why he thought he wanted to drink coffee in the first place, but it was slowly growing on him to drink the beverage. If this was the way he would normally act in this situation, he would try to add as much sugar as he could to get rid of the bitter taste, but somehow, he didn't find it a necessity to try and sweeten up the coffee as much as he did before. He added one teaspoon of sugar, and that was it. After stirring it up for a few seconds, he took the cup in his hands. The aroma was powerful enough to enter his nostrils, and found out that it actually seemed pretty nice, intriguing him a little bit more about about what will the brew taste like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then took a small sip out of it, and was pleasantly surprised by how good the coffee tasted. It was much sweeter than he anticipated, and it also had a nutty flavor to it, which made him even more pleased by how it tasted. As he slowly drank the cup, with each gulp, the bulge in his throat got smaller and smaller, his Adam's Apple seemingly getting dissolved by the tasty liquid. This in turn, made his vocal chords a lot tighter and slowly rose his voice in pitch with every gulp. The cup was half empty at this point, but there was still plenty left for him to savor later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... That sure was nice, especially the small nutty taste it had...\", said Bandon with a small sigh, not noticing how high-pitched his voice sounded, or the small seductiveness it had in its tone. \"What brew was it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was Cuban Crystal Mountain. I had a feeling you weren't in the mood for something too bitter, so I chose one that was naturally sweet with low acidity.\", replied Sojiro a bit proud of himself. \"If this was the kid, I would go a little more in depth about the process the coffee is made, but I don't want to bore you about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, Bandon was indeed a little curious now as to what other flavors Boss had around and if he would like them as much as he did the current one. But as the topic about Ren came up, he found this to be a good opportunity to ask about him. However, he needed to straighten his back, as he felt a little stiff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... My posture might have determined this. I was leaning forward for most of the time I was waiting for the coffee as well...\", he mused to himself as he pushed his back forward. A couple of seconds later, his spine was now in a permanent arch, making him a tad more flexible, while his chest was pushed out a little bit more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. It's just a stiff back, don't worry about it, it's fine now.\", said Bandon in a more composed tone than before. \"By the way, do you know when Ren is coming back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm? Why do you ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just out of curiosity, before I am to leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... To be honest, I don't know.\", said Sojiro with a small sigh. \"These days, he is really busy by the looks of things. Other than spending time with his friends, he also plays shogi with a girl at a church, goes to a fortune teller in Shibuya and even helps a minor politician with his speeches at times too from time to time from what I hear. He does a lot of things lately, and he even has a few side jobs... How he manages to do all that, and to help me around here is beyond me. Maybe it's the power of youth, or he just knows a trick to conserve energy I don't know of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... And what is your opinion about him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I initially thought he would be a trouble maker, but I was really wrong. He is a lot more kind than I gave him credit for, and he sure has a way to draw people around him, given how hard he tries to please so many different people. Sure, he has his moments when he can act like a normal teenager, but he quite mature most of the time. Kind of wish more youngsters were like him these days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBandon was happy with Boss's answer, proving that the type of character he thought to be was correct. He was glad that Ren was indeed as nice as he seemed in game... In game? Didn't he mean how he was before? He was a little confused as to why he would compare Ren to a game character, when he was an actual person. It was true, that he was now in his reality, instead of the game... but right now, Bandon didn't make the correlation with the video game purchased anymore.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Looking at the clock, Sojiro saw it was almost noon. The time for when his customers would normally arrive was approaching, which meant, he had to prepare the curry before they would arrive. However, despite Bandon not looking hungry at the moment, he thought it would be disrespectful towards him to feed others, while not feeding him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, do you also want to take lunch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know it isn't quite noon yet, but people should start arriving soon, and I was wandering if you would like some curry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... like I said before, I don't have any money on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it. Just considered it a favor this time. It is not as though a plate would matter too much. The kid would come later too, so I am sure he'll eat somewhere else, so I'll just consider it as his meal. That way, you can have it for free.\", smiled Sojiro, knowing full well Ren wouldn't mind giving his lunch to someone in need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBandon was however confused. While he didn't mind eating for free, he was surprised by how calm Boss was. He would have expected to call the police, given the circumstances of the story he made up. But not only did  it seem like he wasn't concerned at all, he actually behaved like he would normally would... But there was something that confused the boy slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp until now, he used his knowledge from the game to manage to talk with Boss and Ren, but he now seemed to know Sojiro's character a little better, almost as if he knew him for quite a while,, which seemed strange for him, given he only saw him a few times in the game. Also, unbeknownst to him, he was slowly forgetting about Ann, Ryuji and especially Morgana, only remembering a few details about them. But when it cam down to Ren, he actually knew more about him than he knew Boss. While it would be impossible to know that, since he didn't even had a real personality in the game, he now started to gain memories of him and Ren spending time together, as well as gaining a sense of gratitude for him that he didn't knew much about yet...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout him noticing, he grew older again, this time going up to 18 years old. He grew in height quite a bit, although contrary to what a teenage boy should look like, he remained quite slim, as his muscles didn't grew too much, while his legs became a bit longer than before, giving him a lanky appearance. And speaking of his legs, his calves started to morph, as they became sleeker and slimmer, and while they didn't became too toned, they nonetheless looked quite fit. As for his footwear, the straps settled to end just below the middle of his calves, before circling it three times. Also, his feet rose further, as they grew a small platform, but his heels grew even further, effectively turning his former shoes into a pair of strappy black platform high heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking this should be a good time to clear his head, and also to eat a bit to try and ease his nerves a little, Bandon decided to stay for lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I will accept your offer, thank you very much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then. It will take a while to prepare it, so can watch TV if you want to until then... I am sorry, but somehow I forgot your name already...\", said Sojiro a bit sheepishly, as he picked up the remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it. It's Banon Tamas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Banon... Here's the remote. You're free to watch whatever you wish, just make sure not to have the volume too loud.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it.\", said Banon as Sojiro went back into the kitchen, while turned the TV on.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Banon was surfing through the channels as Sojiro started to prepare the ingredients for the curry. Despite the text and language on screen was Japanese, he could perfectly understand what the people on TV said. He had a few instances where he stopped for a talent show or a cartoon, but quickly lost his interest as he continued surfing through the channels. He was slowly getting quite bored the more he searched, the things that would usually entertained him would now seem childish. He was also getting a feeling he should be somewhere else as well, but he currently brushed the feeling off as he thought it was his home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was searching, his shirt completely lost all of its buttons, the fabric no longer being split down the middle. As for its color, it also started to darken, gaining a dark-green hue, as it slowly started to resemble his pants. Speaking of them, the green got a bit more dominant, as the fabric lost all of its roughness. In addition, it now got to just below his knees, as his beautiful calves were now fully on display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple more minutes of channel surfing, he found a news channel, and given there wasn't anything else to watch, he decided to watch the news to pass a little bit of time. It went through the regular things, such as the upcoming election and something he was slightly more familiar, about how the psychotic breakdowns were not as frequent as they once were. Banon had to admit, he was still blown back by how disturbing the scene with the breakdown at the start of the game was, thus he had a general knowledge of how they worked. But he was slowly starting to forget about said scene, instead remembering a few medical reports on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now, about the current topic that everyone wants to know more about, the Phantom Thieves...\", said the newscaster, which drew Banon's attention. He knew who was he referring to, but he was curious what he had to say about the group. \"The police still hasn't found any clues or suspects regarding the identities of the Phantom Thieves, even after the 30 million yen ransom has been made public. After the murder of the CEO of Okumura foods, Kunikazu Okumura, and the principal of Shujin Academy, there has been a non-stop search for the group, with unfortunately, to traces of them being found, as no new targets have been posted on their website. Furthermore, Detective Goro Akechi, who recently admitted a hypothesis about the thieves' innocence, decided to withdraw temporarily from public events, as he desired to get to the bottom of this case. Despite Akechi's theory, the police and the Special Investigation Unit continue to pursue the group, with them warning the people to contact authorities should they find a clue regarding the Phantom Thieves...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more he listened, the more confused Banon got. There were so many things that shocked him, the biggest thing being the accusation of murder that the thieves got. He immediately knew that this was the group that Ren lead, together with his friends, so hearing something as shocking as having them take someone's life was completely impossible to comprehend.  While trying to understand, his waist started to cave in a little, as his figure continued to turn less muscular with each passing second, but he simply brushed it off as a small craving for food, so he didn't think of it too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Phantom Thieves killed someone? There has to be a mistake... I mean, the group decided to steal the Treasure, not kill the person, did they? And why did they choose the principle of the school and this Kunikazu guy to kill off? This doesn't make sense...\" He then paused for a second as the confusion on his face was soon replaced by frustration. \"It has to be a setup. There is no other way... If they really were responsible for something like this, they should've killed off that mafia boss rather than Kunikazu and that principal. And why would they do that when their popularity is at its peak?... I swear, people jump to conclusions way too early these days...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout him noticing, Banon has been referencing events that he shouldn't know, unless he would progress in the game's story to a certain event, but now everything he knew from a player's perspective, including the Confidants and even the game itself, was slowly replaced with memories of himself hearing about the thieves' exploits from the news rather than the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And besides... Ren would never do something like that... He is way too kind-hearted to be the monster the media describes him as..\", said Banon to himself, as his face softened a little and his expression turned slightly sad.</span></div></div>",

I know killing a person is a serious accusation, but they seem a bit rash about all this, don't you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older man sighed, as he put the plate on the counter. \"... I don't know much about the thieves, but I can't help thinking that the police is just trying to find a scapegoat... They have been losing face to them lately, so maybe this is a way to show how unreliable and distrustful the Phantom Thieves are. Besides, killing a CEO of a big company like that is a bit too extreme in my opinion. Kind of defeats the whole \"changing someone's heart\" thing, eh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Most likely. I just can't think they are as bad as the media says they are...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh... I guess they should be happy they still have a faithful fan like you around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanon laughed a little at the statement. He knew Ren and the others were respectable people, so there was no doubt that he was innocent of whatever the people on TV said... But there was one thing among his thoughts that slightly confused him. The annoyance of the accusations aside, he was somewhat feeling a bit more involved with them than he should, and there was this sensation of feeling indebted to Ren in particular for something, but couldn't tell exactly why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was thinking, the shirt and the pants fully became a dark-green color, as the pants were now just over his knees and his sleeves only covered his shoulders, as any pockets he had prior were now gone. Additionally, they slowly started to fuse with each other at the seams, as they gradually became harder to stay apart with each passing second. Not that Banon noticed, as he was too busy with his thoughts. But he decided to figure things later, as he went do eat his meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took a glance at the curry in front of him. It looked really tasty, but while he didn't eat anything like this before, his memories were saying something different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... This is today's special?\", he asked Sojiro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it is the regular recipe, but I do mix or swap a few ingredients from time to time to change the flavour if only by a little. I added today a bit more garam masala, but the usual blend of spices that I use is still there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see... I suppose you aren't going to tell me the recipe if I like it, do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh... That goes without saying...\", said the man with a small grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanon took one last glance at the curry before he took his spoon and put a good amount in his mouth. The second he tasted it, he was pleasantly surprised how good it was. The flavors were in tune with each other, and it really made him smile a little, just by how good it was. Yet oddly enough, he wasn't as ecstatic as he would usually be when he would eat something he likes, as he was now a lot more calm at the moment. In fact, there seemed to even be a familiarity with the taste, feeling that he ate Boss's curry before, but he didn't ponder on that as he took another spoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile eating, his waist became even smaller, but without any particular muscles developing in the area, leaving it just a little toned. Also, his hips started to push out a little, as a small layer of fat started to develop on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is as good as it usually is Boss. I just hope I won't fatten myself by eating so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You? Getting fat? I find it hard to believe. There isn't anything fatty or heavy in my curry. And even it was, I am sure you, out of all people to be able to find a way to slim yourself back down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably...\", said Banon as he took another bite.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As he continued to enjoy his meal, not rushing to finish it, he was carefully analysing the ingredients with his now more developed palate, as he ate. Even if Banon shouldn't know such things, the nutritional value and benefits of the food seemed to appear inside his brain. The energy value and different minerals the rice, meat and other components he could identify, as well as the effects they had on the body, slowly started to develop, as more medical knowledge entered his head. He didn't notice that aside from merging with the shirt, the pantlegs also seemed to start fusing together, as his legs were getting a bit constrained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way... Is there anyone else Ren is helping? Aside from the people you already told me about?\", asked Banon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just out of curiosity...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I suppose I can tell you. I have heard from Futaba about a few... interesting individuals he recently had spend time with... Don't tell him I said anything about this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? Is there a problem?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it is a bit personal. I don't want to think of him as someone shady or anything, that's all\", said Sojiro, looking a bit apprehensive for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Only if it isn't a problem. I don't want to make you or Ren uncomfortable if I shouldn't know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's fine. I suppose you should know as well, given how close you are to him... Now let's see...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoss began talking about the different people he met and helped during the past few months, and safe to say, Banon was quite surprised the diversity of people he was around. There was a boy he played video games at an arcade, a news reporter, the owner of a gun store and one of his teachers, who Sojiro caught once in the shop, working at a maid service company. While he was indeed surprised by who was Ren helping, he seemed a lot more accepting than he anticipated. He initially believed he had to ask more questions regarding these people, but he was quite understanding of the situation, instead feeling a sense of bride in hearing about Ren's natural instinct to help others. He was too preoccupied at the moment to feel that the seat gradually became more cushy. He felt for a second that he was sitting on a pillow on top of the chair, but he didn't ponder on it, not realizing his butt started to grow, already looking a little large for his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow... Now that quite an array of people...\", said Banon mildly impressed, with without any genuine surprise in his tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not going to question how he started meeting these people, but I am glad he is not getting himself in any trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there someone else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... oh yeah, I almost forgot about her. He is also helping a doctor that is at a clinic not far from here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A... doctor?\", asked the boy, as a strange feeling of familiarity about the word started to from within him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, she has a clinic not far from here... I think you already know the place. You pass it usually whenever you come here to eat...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I?... Actually, I think I am supposed to go there today...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are? Well, I think she said she will be busy today, but you can go there to meet her if you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks... I think I will...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanon had a weird feeling that something was wrong with where the conversation has gone, yet for some reason, everything felt perfectly fine. He didn't know why he had to go to the clinic, but for some reason, he felt like he should go there. It was definitely strange, but a voice in his head told him that nothing is wrong and that he should stop worrying. After a brief hesitation, he complied, as he went back to finishing his meal. He was unaware that whatever memories he had of his former world, as well as the fact that he was in a world inside a video game, were already mostly gone. He was so absorbed by the talk with Boss that he didn't even notice, but at the moment, that wouldn't be a bother for him anymore.</span></div></div>",

I wonder if that's why people keep wanting to talk with him, even with how cold he can be at times...\", thought Boss to himself. \"Well, he is a nice person overall, so it makes sense. But I wonder why he keeps talking about the kid from time to time... Could it be...? Nah, it's too early to think about that. But if it is like that... then the kid has more guts than I thought...\", smirked Sojiro as he took the customer's order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the street, Banon saw that the street was still full of people, despite not being the rush hour when he came earlier. As he was taking a few glances at the various stores and shops, more changes went beneath his radar. His butt became even more fuller, pushing his pants quite a bit. This was compensated by his hips which grew alongside his rear,  starting to form the bottom of a great hourglass figure. But interestingly enough, there wasn't much fat anywhere else on his body, which gave him a fit appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, his clothes changed further as well. His pants brought his legs closer and closer as they tightened further on him, before their legs completely fused with each other, becoming a skirt. On top of that, the seams that separated his pants from his top continued to merge with each other, as the material on them now matched each other, becoming a lot softer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... My clothes did feel a bit odd there for a second, but right now, nothing seems wrong. I guess it must've been my imagination.\", murmured Banon, before thinking of something more important. \"But beside that... Why exactly do I need to go to the clinic? Ren said there wouldn't be anybody there until later... I suppose waiting there is not much of an issue, but who exactly am I waiting for?... Is it Ren? Or somebody else?... I feel like there was someone that I wanted to meet there as well... It is strange how I am not remembering something like this, but I digress. I think I will find a clue about that when I get there.\", thought Banon, with a more composed and calm look on his face, despite his issue.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Eventually, Banon reached the clinic. It looked normal enough, but was confused as to why there wasn't a sign to direct people to the place. It looked  almost like whoever ran the clinic didn't want much attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Eh, I guess it would make sense. After all, with all the clinical trials and the extra work, who would want a crowd of people lined up at the door anyways?\", said the young man to himself as he got to the entrance. He was about to knock at the door, when he noticed that it was in fact open. Judging from what Ren said, no one should be here yet, which made him wonder why was the place open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeeking inside, as he expected, there wasn't anyone. He looked around to see if there was someone at the counter, but found nobody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez, what's going on with people leaving their doors unlocked these days? First Boss, and now this? It sure looks like people need to take some pills to improve their ability to remember things... Hm?\" Upon looking at the desk again, he noticed a black, leather purse inside. He was about to question if someone forgot it there, until he started to age up once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis body grew in height again, but it wasn't as drastic as before, as his figure remained quite petite. But this didn't stop his curves getting more pronounced in the process, as his body got increasingly feminine. Also, his hair, which didn't change too much up until now started to darken rapidly, becoming a very dark blond color. And if it wasn't enough whatever blond hue there was left, was slowly turning towards a dark blue color. His mind seized for a brief second as he grew up to 22 years old, but as soon as the changes finished for the moment, another thought regarding the purse came to his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... This isn't embarrassing, isn't it? I say about people forgetting too often, and I forget my purse here... Well, I guess I owe Boss an apology for that later, even if he doesn't want any money for the food...\", he thought as he checked the contents of the purse to make sure everything is there. After checking his wallet for his ID and driving lesson, which now had his current name on, Baon Tamami, he pulled out a set of keys and headed for towards the locked door in the room, and unlocked it, revealing it to be the diagnostic room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sure need to keep this a secret from Ren. Knowing him, I am sure he will tease me about this for a week... I'll just say I had to go to a meeting regarding the new medicine and forgot my belongings here... At worst, he'll just compare me with Boss, won't he?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thoughts drifted towards Ren as more knowledge about him entered his mind. At this point, what he recalled about the rest of the cast of the game was mostly basic knowledge, and forgot everything about Morgana's ability to talk, while he recalled more things about his friend, such as the times they hung together, he helped him with the trials and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm? My mind is a bit muddled... I wonder why... I think I should take a sip of that brew that I made a little while ago to clear my head up a little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter putting his purse on the bed, he went to a small cabinet to check for some medicine. He didn't notice as both his skirt and shirt completely fused together, forming one garment. He now wore a dark green dress that was still shrinking, now reaching his middle of his thighs. On top of that, his white boxers that he wore, and which were getting quite tight on him due to his larger hips and butt, began to adapt itself to the growths, as not only they fit him better now, they also started to shrink away, as they started to blacken.</span></div></div>",

After bracing himself a little, he took a few sips from the bottle. He then coughed a little, due to the very bitter taste of the concoction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I forgot I still needed to improve the taste of this thing. I remember I tried to change the flavour to something more bearable, but the bitterness is still quite assertive... I might need to have Ren taste test a few options later...\", giggled Baon as he waited for the substance to do its job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately, the fog inside his head started to clear out, as any thoughts of his previous life vanished completely as the elements of the one he was getting now were gradually developing. He started to recall things such as his life at the medical university, as well as the time he worked before in a hospital, helping in developing new drugs, before moving out to have his own clinic. However, his mood started to get a little sour as he recalled the reason why he left the hospital in the first place: He was framed for a colleague's mistake in using one of his experimental drugs to cure a patient, a little girl. As a result, her condition worsened because the medicine was rushed out, without proper testing prior, which prompted the other doctors to kick him out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook his head, as he put the cap back on the bottle. \"Way to ruin my mood... Remembering all that is the last thing I need right now. Maybe I should've waited a bit more before I took the medicine... Need to distract myself from all this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was recalling his past, he failed to notice how his skin paled quite a lot. It wasn't really marble white, but it now seemed like Banon was more of an indoor person that didn't go outside all that much, which wasn't true far from the truth at the moment. His hair also finished changing, as it became a messy bob-cut, a few longer bangs framing his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what I can do now though... I didn't plan to have this much spare time right now and I feel a little bored... I guess I can stroll a little bit, but if my little Guinea pig is to return until then, that would sour my mood even more than before... Just what triggered  that reaction? I doubt it's a side effect. Also, the medicine did its job, as I don't have the memory problems I had before... I may need to look into this later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could take a seat, he noticed a white lab coat on a hanger. \"Well, I might as well wear it. I don't know if a patient will come or not, but it sure feels a little strange to be in here without wearing it.\" He said to himself as he put on the coat, fixing his Doctor ID card, while leaving the coat open, exposing his dress. For a brief second, he felt something on his neck. But when he looked down, he saw it was just his black studded necklace choker. It looked a little weird on him, but he wasn't bothered at all by it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterward, in case Ren or someone else came, he went for the front desk, picking up a magazine, while waiting for someone to come. Without him knowing, proven by the ID he now had, he was now a full-fledged doctor, even if he was a tad younger than someone who finished university. But that won't be a problem for long...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Despite not expecting anyone to come, Baon sat at the front desk, waiting for Ren, or possibly a patient, as small of chance that would be. Once seated, he was about to read the magazine he took with him, bit found today's newspaper on the counter. Remembering he bought it this morning, but forgot to read it, he put aside the magazine as he started reading the paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBaon frowned when he read the first page of the paper: \"The Phantom Thieves are actually criminals?\" in bold letters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Way to start with the bad image, huh guys? They really hold nothing back it seems...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then proceeded to read the pages that talked about the subject, but he couldn't help but grow frustrated by how it seemed like the whole article was based more on Okumura and Shujin's principal's death rather than offering valid evidence on how the thieves did it or why were those two chosen as their victims, offering only several theories, but nothing more. As he continued to read, his figure finally became that of a mature woman, as his hips and butt became large and gorgeous while his waist slimmed down, with no visible fat anywhere on his abdomen, forming an hourglass figure, with his heart-shaped behind being beautifully shown through his dress. Also, his boxers continued getting smaller as they started to soften as well, as the material got lacier. Their color also continued to darken as the black hue on them started to get more dominant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is really all they have?\", said an aggravated Baon to himself. \"The police trash talks them, they show the calling cards in a few photos, offer a ransom, and that's it?!... And people buy this crap for granted...\", murmured the young man as he gritted his teeth a little. \"Murderers? If they want to label them that, they need proof! They only blame them because there is no one else to use as a scapegoat. I bet you they are still bitter after they got rid of those hackers and now the police takes it on them... This is so annoying....\" He took a few deep breaths to calm himself before he could throw the paper away. \"... If my patients saw me like this, I would close the clinic for good... As for Ren... I really don't want to worry him. If I show him too much concern and he gets to console me, I would feel really bad...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thoughts started to drift to Ren, as in his new memories, both of them were a lot closer that it seemed. Sure, he was still helping him with the clinical trials, and sometimes, he would take him to a walk around the town every now and then. But there was one specific event that made him remember the teenage boy fondly, which made him blush a little as he reminisced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile in deep thought, a few smaller necklaces appeared and connected themselves to his choker. There was also a pendant in the shape of a vial that was larger, as it sat right above his pectoral region.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more minutes, he opened his eyes, with a more satisfied look in his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really needed that. After all that crap from the newspaper, I really needed something to bring back the good mood. I just hope the people will understand the Thieves one day... I still wonder why the Detective Prince did though... I guess he saw some light in them. I just hope it says.\", thought Baon as skimmed though the newspaper's pages once more, to check if there was something else to catch his attention.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After skipping the article on the Phantom Thieves, he then proceeded to look into other news. Some were about the continued psychotic breakdowns that still continued. Once again, there was a paragraph citing that the thieves were the culprits for these as well, but Baon found a little pleasing that the police admitted to not have evidence on that statement yet. Other articles didn't interest him too much, except for one about a girl who became famous in the world of shogi because they were rigged, the \"Venus of Shogi\" as she was once called admitted that she is more than happy to start over, feeling refreshed that there will be no more cheating in future matches, after she herself admitted that her mother helped her. Baon smiled at the news, as he recognized who the girl was, given Ren's connections. She was another person he helped escape from their own confines, just like him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile continuing reading the newspaper he felt a little nauseous. For a split second, he thought a it was a side effect of the medicine he took, but the sensation only lasted a brief 30 seconds, so he didn't dwell too much on it. What was happening in reality was that in these 30 seconds, he grew up to 27 years old, his final age. His appearance didn't change as much, but his face no longer that of a teenager, but rather that of an adult woman. Speaking of which, some eyeshadow and a little lipstick made his visage even more alluring, while his bigger, almond shaped eyes became brown. The name on his ID, also changed in accordance to Tao Takami.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few pages later, he saw something that immediately caught his attention. It was regarding the final verdict of the trial of Shoichi Oyamada, a name he was very familiar with. The court found him guilty after he not made the entire staff of the hospital he worked at lie about the condition of a patient, a young girl named Miwa Ogawa, by claiming she died and hiding evidence in regards to this, but also for being trying to cure Miwa with a drug that was only in experimental phase, which worsened her condition, and then blamed the head researcher for it as well. Fortunately, the girl recovered after she transferred to another hospital, with the aid of the one who originally made the initial drug, but then gave her an improved version of it, which greatly reduced her symptoms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTao could only smile as he read the article. He could only laugh a little as he remembered his shocked expression when he heard the news the first time, and the immense joy and relief he felt seconds later. He was particularly happy that Miwa didn't die as Oyamada said, which made him even more determined to finish the drug. Together with Ren's help with the clinical trials, he managed to finish the medicine, and after talking with the doctor that took care of Miwa in the new hospital, the medication was finally given to her, which was the start of her recovery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ren... Even now I wonder how you went form just a Guinea Pig to someone that important so quickly... And despite being Phantom Thief, you somehow managed to make time for me and my trials... I am sure Miwa-chan would be thrilled to meet you as possible. After all, I take pleasure in seeing you whenever I can recently...\", he giggled to himself as a faint blush adorned his cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeneath his notice, a red grommet belt appeared out of nowhere and wrapped around his waist, accentuating his figure even more. Also, his boxers completely lost their legs, as their color became pure black. In the end, he was now wearing a pair of black, lacy panties, which hugged his butt and hips perfectly while his boyhood was cradled by the soft material as well. Lastly, a matching bra appeared on his chest, completing his wardrobe changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, a heard a knock at the door, which snapped him from his thoughts.</span></div></div>",

But instead, he was surprised to see Ren of all people striding inside, which made him smile as he stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you said you are going to be busy today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I believe you said you are not opening the clinic for today, and yet here you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Touch\u00e9.\", said Tao with a small smirk on his face. \"I didn't have much to do today and I thought I should come here in case someone really needed my help. But how did you know I was here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I went to LeBlanc a second ago and Boss said I should find you here. As for why I am here right now, I just finished my \"appointments\" so to speak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All of them? Didn't you say you were fully booked today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most of what I had planned today was simply to talk with my friends. I thought at the start it would be because of an important thing to discuss, but it turns out it wasn't anything serious... except for helping Makoto expose that the boyfriend of one of her friends was a host who didn't even bother remembering the girl's name and only cared about scamming her into a shady business.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Talk about superficial people... And after that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The girl ran home crying, but I am pretty sure she is happy with the result. She was one of Makoto's close friends that she just made a little while ago, so it was quite a personal thing for her... After that we ran into a bar to hide so that we didn't draw to much attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In a bar? With the student council? And what exactly did you do? Did you make her have a few drinks?\", asked the older boy slyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnaware to him however was that his nipples suddenly grew wider and a lot more sensitive as the areolae grew along with them. Some fatty tissue also started in his pectoral area as he developed milk duds as well. Also, his boyhood started to shrink away as a small wave of arousal started to overtake him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I wouldn't do that. I'll get in trouble not just with the school, but her prosecutor sister will most likely choke the life out of me on top of that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah... Well I'll have your back. A more mature person knows that getting a little tipsy isn't so bad, and having a first taste of alcohol in the presence of someone reliable would actually be beneficial.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks... We talked a little, and then she said she wanted to have a partner when it comes down to romance... And I told her that someday she will find one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... That was oddly mature out of you. I thought you would have taken the golden opportunity. From what I understand, she has quite the looks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe. She is indeed pretty... But I already have a girlfriend. And it will take more than just a few good looks to make me change my mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he felt like Ren's answer was a little cheesy, he couldn't help but smile at the answer, as a feeling of pride was growing within him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about we have this conversation inside? We don't any potential patients to disturb us, would you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certainly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs both went into the check-up room, Tao's testes nestled their way inside him as he shuddered a little at the feeling, but he didn't pay much attention to it. After all,  he was quite busy with other emotions that were slowly bubbling to the surface... </span></div></div>",

What do you want to talk about that you wanted to come here? Is it about the results of the drug on Miwa-san? Or do I have to take another trial?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the boy's sarcasm, Tao sighed as he took a more serious, almost sad expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's about the whole Phantom Thief business. I am sure you already know, but the police is after you.\" Seeing the sudden change in tone, Ren stood quiet as Tao continued. \"It's everywhere. The newspapers, the TV, the Internet...Everyone thinks they are these cold-blooded murderers... And I keep getting more and more frustrated. What happened to the people that supported them after they took down Kaneshiro and Medjed? It took just one person to die after they received a calling card, and then everyone abandons them... If it ever comes down for them to be caught, no one will be in their corner...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tao talked, more memories and thoughts entered his head, fully completing his transition into a doctor, which although had somewhat shady practices, and very intelligent and very kind-hearted, despite all appearances. He seemed a bit apathetic at times, but deep down, he cared a lot about people. Currently, however, he had issues considering himself a male, as his testes became fully-functional ovaries that produced an increasingly amount of estrogen, which made his breasts reach medium C-cups, while his boyhood continued to shrink away, as it was slowly being pulled inside an newly formed opening between his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know there is no way for you or your friends to be caught... But I can't help but get worried. With the whole ransom, and police investigation that just points only at you for the culprits of what happened, I... I just, don't know how I can help you...\" Tao was now quite somber and a little sad, as the the atmosphere got a lot more dark, as even if the chances were slim, he was afraid that there was a possibility for Ren to be apprehended, which greatly scared him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRen sighed a little as he closed his eyes for a couple of seconds before he shortened the gap between the two of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand. I... I am sorry I got you worried like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be. It's not your fault...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is in a way...I never assured you that everything was fine after the police made the announcement, and I didn't mind it too much, but I can tell you did a lot more than I.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You liar... I know how much of a tease you are at times, but even you show a great amount of maturity and seriousness when you need to. You may be a bit quiet at times, but I saw how determined you really are... I know because of how much I managed to know you ever since this spring. You agreed to take part in my trials, despite any potential hazards to your health, helped me get closer to my patients... and even the whole ordeal with Oyamada... I just... I don't want you to be arrested for something that's not your fault...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if it wasn't showing Ren could tell that Tao was not too far from starting to cry. He cursed himself a little from thinking that it would go as smoothly as it was with the other acquaintances that knew his secret identity. A reinsurance and some light-hearted talk to calm him down wouldn't be enough this time, especially knowing his relationship with Tao. Thus, he leaned closer, which drew Tao's attention, just in time as he planted a kiss on his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough taken by surprise, he immediately kissed Ren back. The second he did that, the rest of his previous identity vanished, the new woman whimpering a little due to the change, but was a feeling that was obscured by the kiss. The name on his tag now said Tao Takemi, signifying not only the end of the changes, but also the birth of the former boy's persona.</span></div></div>",

I am aware that this time, the risk is bigger than ever, but I promise this: I will surely return.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You promise?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then be a man of your word, or else I won't forgive you.\", said Tae as she put her head on Ren's shoulder, as he wanted to tell her more, but decided not to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I can't just tell her what exactly this mission entails. If what Morgana said is true, then there is a chance I might really die if I am not careful... I don't want to make her worry about me, but it's not like I can explain something she might not understand. I don't want her to get involved with Metaverse or whoever is framing us, or else her life will be in danger. Knowing her, she will most likely want to be part of the operation if she finds out, but I can't risk that... If those bastards are willing to kill Okumura, then...\" He shook his head a little without her noticing. \"No, just forget about this right now. This is Phantom Thief business, not something that has anything to do with her. For now, I should keep Takemi-san company... The next few days will sure be intense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two stood close to each other for a few more minutes, until Tae finally calmed herself down and let him go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This will supposedly prove you innocent, will it not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Technically, it should. But in case unforeseen circumstances appear... then it will most likely prove Makoto's theory that there is someone else that can do what we can, and that he is the one that killed president Okumura and Kobayakawa-san.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kaneshiro told us about it briefly. He said there is a person who has the same ability as us, but instead of changing someone's heart, they kill them instead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what is this... No, forget about it. I know that this is something that is outside my area of expertise, or even my understatement. I am sure you won't tell me regardless if I ask you or not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know me well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sure do... Just keep your promise for now, okay? If possible, I want you to meet Miwa-chan and introduce yourself to her. The main test subject in the whole process of creating the cure for her is someone that she must meet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once all this is over, I will visit her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good... I sure will feel a little lonely with you away like this. From what I understood, you will be quite busy for a period of time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It won't take too long... In the meantime, I say we enjoy the time we have right now.\", said Ren with a grin, as Tae also smiled at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, do you want to go on a walk? To a movie? Want to visit the shrine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually... I was thinking about something else\", said the woman slyly as she pushed the boy down the bed, which surprised him for a second, as she pressed her head on his chest. \"Since Boss is busy with the caf\u00e9 at the moment, I don't want to get you in trouble if there are going to be noise complaints. Don't worry, I won't go too far, just enough to satisfy myself for the next few days, while you are on Phantom Thief duty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile taken slightly aback, the leader of the thieves expressed the same smile he had while in his alter-ego, Joker, as he stared back at his girlfriend. \"Sounds good to me. I am always up to blow off some steam from time to time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I like to hear.\" Even if Ren was a decade younger than she is, she is really happy that they are a couple. She had her doubts at the start, but she couldn't be happier with the current life she had. With her reputation restored, and drive back and her sins cleansed, all thanks to \"her Guinea Pig\", she knew what she would be happy with him. She gave out a small giggle as she closed in, and kissed him on the lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the game store, the old man was reading on his laptop about other video games that would be released soon. While he wouldn't actually play them, he knew he could make the life better, or offer new opportunities to those that took the games that he bought... and enchanted. The life stories of the characters sometimes impressed him enough to make him put a spell on the game, and turn them into one of the characters to make them enjoy a better life. He heard a small beep from his digital watch, announcing him that another person was given a new role, a new life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It must be that boy from before... I could tell he wanted to know about that doctor, so I gave him her life. It would surely be an eye-opening experience for him... I hope she will have a better life right now\", thought the old man with a smile as another customer came into his shop.</span></div></div>",

He hadn't really know his uncle that well. He felt sure he'd have recognised him in the street, but he was part of the family he just didn't know that well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning home, he'd fallen asleep on the sofa. Too tired to head to bed, he'd vaguely grumbled, as the rest of the family retired for the night. A soft moan being his only protest as the light was switched off in the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam's dreams were filled with unsettling images, and terrifying situations that he couldn't escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe woke with a start, and stumbled around the room. Bashing his shins on the low table before reaching the light switch. Blinking he read the clock on the wall, it was 2:07 am.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStretching, and thinking of his sore spine, the thought of his own bed was enticing. Absently rubbing at his eyes, the cuffs of the jacket brushed his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe damned jacket wasn't that bad a fit, or so he thought. His half-asleep eyes weren't focusing properly, but his hand looked swamped by the sleeve, smaller than it should have been. Shrugging his shoulders, didn't help, with even more of his hand disappearing into the sleeve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was also the odd shifting he'd felt as he'd shrugged, he smiled distractedly, he really needed his sleep, hell, his fingers looked like they had nails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot just nails, but polished nails... like a girl would have. As he looked more intently, even his hands looked smoother too. \"Nah...\" he muttered to himself, \"That's impossible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut even as he spoke, his voice sounded higher, sweeter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he headed back towards the door, he caught his reflection in the dead screen of the TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked Asian,... he looked like an Asian girl. Nah, surely it was just the tiredness, and the baggy shirt hanging funny in the light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatting the shirt flat, Sam found she had a bust.... A sensitive one, too. Cautiously, his hands approached again, cupping his petite chest, he felt the fullness, the softness, undeniably he had a bust, small but absolutely real. He snatched his hands away, as he felt his nipples stiffen, crinkling tightly at the touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a second thought occurred, Sam's hands leaped to his trousers. Patting feverishly at his crotch, he found his body was... was fully female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWrenching the tie loose, and pulling it aside. Still fighting the mounting evidence. His... Her? fingers shook too much to unbutton the shirt, it took all his strength to rip it open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam blinked slowly, swallowed loudly, and had his first real, first-hand experience of an attractive cleavage. The stiff nipples were hers. All the evidence shouted it loudly, their size, their location, his every touch confirming she was now a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dilly-dilly-do.tumblr.com/image/159643253884\" target=\"_blank\">https://dilly-dilly-do.tumblr.com/image/...</a></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a little cloudy in Tokyo today, but still a fair day all the same. On this day, a boy from America and his father were visiting the headquarters of the company he worked for, Sony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon Thomas was a 14 year old of average height, if not perhaps a little small at 5' exactly. His dad, Samuel Thomas, worked as a sales representative over where they worked. In fact, he was one of the top sales people, and he had gotten invited for a business meeting over in Tokyo, Japan as a result. It was quite the accomplishment for Samuel, as he had been to Japan once in the past for some good work years ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, this time was different, as Brandon had been brought along for the ride this time. Honestly, Brandon wondered why his dad would be so interested in bringing him, but given that Brandon was a huge fan of video games as many boys were his age, his dad promised that he'd get a tour of the place if he came along. The idea of getting a tour of the Playstation area sounded like a lot of fun to Brandon, as he loved many of the Playstation and Nintendo systems. He was surprised that his dad offered it, but he wasn't complaining in the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, in any case, they finally arrived at the building early in the morning. A bit early for Brandon's taste but he hoped it would be worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, it's huge!\" he cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed,\" Samuel smiled. \"You'd be surprised at how many floors there are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Brandon followed his dad inside, passing by numerous other people going in and out of the place. Obviously from what Brandon could tell, most spoke purely in Japanese. Despite watching some anime and such, he barely knew a spec of fluent Japanese. Heck, maybe that would be a perk as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Brandon and his dad got inside, Samuel went straight to the receptionist at the front, who seemed to smile in recognition of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Mrs. Mizuki,\" he smiled formally. \"Nice to see you again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kon'nichiwa Samuel-san. Nice to see you again,\" she gave a witty smile. \"How long since the last time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About 6 months I believe,\" Samuel smiled before turning to Brandon. \"Brandon, this is Kana Mizuki. She's been the receptionist here for a few years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously Brandon wouldn't have known that thanks to her nametag being in Japanese kanji, so it was nice to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello,\" he smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello to you as well. So you're Brandon?\" she asked just to confirm, to which he nodded. \"Okay, Samuel you know which floor you need to go to correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I do,\" he nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay so Brandon...yes, your tour guide should be here shortly,\" Kana said and pointed in the direction of a break room. \"You could wait in there if you like. Help yourself to a drink if you feel like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will, thanks,\" Brandon smiled before turning to his dad. \"Bye dad!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you later Brandon,\" Samuel smiled back before saying good bye to Kana as well. With that, he turned and went straight for the elevator, making sure he had everything with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Brandon went inside to the break room, where some secretaries were idly chatting away without noticing him. Boy, Brandon couldn't help but notice how nice they looked. Japanese women always seemed to have this allure to them. Good thing they didn't seem to notice him looking. In any case, he had to admit he was pretty thirsty, though the break room seemed to have little in the way of drinks. Nothing much other than coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGranted, although he didn't like the smell, he was pretty thirsty. Perhaps it would be worth giving it a small try. While the others weren't looking, he walked over and got a small cup, filling it up just a bit. With that, he began to sip and drink it, not exactly enjoying the taste of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ew, gross....\" he groaned, still finishing the small bit he drank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf only he knew what that drink did to those who drank it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kevin Johnson could still hardly believe what had happened. For a 15 year old, he had already become quite accomplished. He had just finished up his first year of high school, and got very high grades. In particular, he had expressed a strong desire to become a doctor, a desire that had become very well known. As it so happened as well, his school had a connection with a hospital in Japan that was known for its great doctors, and Kevin was offered the opportunity to learn from there following the school year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed a little bit strange that the school would have such a connection in another country, but everything seemed to check out. The name was rather simple, Osaka Medical, but it had risen in popularity relatively quickly. It had been up for a few years, making its rise practically meteoric. Perhaps that was why Kevin's school had such a good relationship. There was even an advertisement on the school campus. It made Kevin really excited for it all. Not just a chance to actually get to try out his dream job, but also get some world experience in the meanwhile. Visiting another country sounded pretty cool after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thought back to his parents, and hoped they'd be proud. They seemed pretty happy at his accomplish, if not a little bit concerned about a 15-year old going off to another country. Then again, he had taken a plane alone once before to go visit family, so he was sure he could handle it. The hospital was finally coming into view from his taxi ride, making him all the more anxious about it. Putting a hand through his dirty blonde hair, he just hoped he would be ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe taxi driver eventually stopped. Kevin didn't have to worry about paying since the driver was already paid in advance to escort him here from the airport. Kevin nodded in thanks before the driver drove off, taking a deep breath as he began walking towards the hospital. Seemed pretty good on the outside, if not normal. Still, he was certainly anxious to see what awaited him. What made this hospital so renowned? Come to think of it, he would have loved to talk to others from his school that had come into the program but wasn't able to for some reason. Eh, whatever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a deep breath, Kevin walked inside. He walked past some people, getting a few stares. Sadly, he kind of expected that, given how things went in Japan frequently. Hopefully the day wouldn't be filled with that. He made his way up to the welcoming desk of the hospital, where some women were working. Pretty good looking ones too, which wasn't a surprise given the country.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Kevin could even introduce himself, one of the women looked up, smiling as she seemed to have an idea of who he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're Kevin Johnson, yes?\" she asked in near-perfect English.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes I am,\" Kevin replied, a little surprised though not unpleasantly. \"I'm here for the program with King Oaks High School?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah yes, I'm quite familiar with that,\" the woman smiled, getting up from her seat. \"I'm Mariko. It's nice to meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you as well,\" Kevin replied a little shyly, but no less polite. He could see her nametag, which had the typical Japanese characters but also \"\"Yamazaki Mariko\" underneath them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dr. Yokogawa should be here shortly. He'll be your guide for the day,\" she smiled, offering him a seat nearby while she got back to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, Kevin took his seat, hugging his backpack. He figured he should bring some materials like a normal school day, including his usual notebook, a little game system in case her had free time, some books, etc. You know, the usual works. He even bought the notebook for this trip, figuring he could make better use of a fresh book. He figured that would be more than enough for the trip. He was supposed to stay a few days or so, no more than a week at most. He hoped what he had would be enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about 10 minutes or so, a male doctor came through the nearby doors. His eyes landed on Kevin, smiling a bit as he motioned for him to come closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, I'm Hiroshi Yokogawa,\" the man smiled, also in pretty good English. \"Glad to see you made it here in good time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hoped so too, sir,\" Kevin smiled, returning the man's greeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, we're going to start with a little tour of the place,\" Dr. Yokogawa started. \"I'd like for you to assist me for the most part.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir,\" Kevin said with a nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First things first, we need to get a place to put your stuff,\" Dr. Yokogawa explained. \"Unfortunately, the doctor's station is full but there should be room in the nurse's station for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat seemed a little bit weird for Kevin, to go into basically the hospital equivalent to a women's locker room. Then again, if he had a professional doctor with him, then surely no one would raise a stink about it. Kevin nodded his affirmation as they began  The doctor explained that the stations were located here on the first floor so it wouldn't take long. However, not long after, he paused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I forgot,\" he said, going into his pocket. \"This nametag is for you. Don't lose it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it,\" Kevin said, seeing that the tag had his name put into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, what Kevin didn't know was that that tag was enchanted. The doctor didn't even realize the mistake himself, having taken the wrong one following his talks with Kevin's teacher. Suffice to say, it was a special tag often given to the women who were hired here for various purposes. Not the receptionists obviously, but for others....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin actually felt a tiny shock as he pinned the tag on, though he figured it was probably just him accidentally poking himself with the needle before getting it on right. Once that was done, he followed behind Dr. Yokogawa. His mind was purely on whatever might happen with the doctor, which was why he was ignoring the slight sensations he was getting, passed them off as anxiety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn reality, his height was getting compressed from his usual 5'10\" frame, pushed into a shorter 5'6\" frame, making everything just a little bit bigger to him, though again he shoved that off as more nerves than anything else. He was in unfamiliar territory after all. Further down, his shoes were changing slowly. The laces were vanishing bit by bit, and as they vanished, the tongue of the shoes began to meld in more with the rest of the shoe. A very slight heel began to push itself out of the back, again not enough for him to notice. Furthermore, the material started to become more pliant, shifting a little closer to rubber or latex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn addition to all that, his age began to jump, going straight up from 15 to 21, making him a full adult right off the bat. Come to think of it, Kevin wondered if he felt more mature for some reason. Eh, like that could be a bad thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And here we are,\" the doctor said, finally arriving at the room appropriately labeled for the women's station.</span></div></div>",

Dr. Yokogawa opened the door for them, allowing Kevin to go inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll help you get a locker set up for the time you're here,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, thanks,\" Kevin nodded, taking the lead and walking inside, albeit a little hesitantly as he hoped he wouldn't walk in on someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first glance, it seemed to be a pretty normal station. Rather quiet too, as Kevin couldn't hear anyone. Guess they all were out working. Lockers could be seen to the left, while other amenities could be seen to the right, such as if anyone needed a quick drink or snack. Typical stuff for whenever someone needed to relax a bit, which was nice. Kevin felt a little better about being here, and Dr. Yokogawa soon followed after him, closing the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ishi?\" <sup>Doctor?</sup> a really squeaky voice piped up from around the corner. Immediately, Kevin tensed up at barging in on a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Sorry! I thought it would be...\" he began to saw before his jaw hit the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurse came around the corner, and Kevin couldn't believe what he was looking at. It was a woman in her 30's at the least, but still absolutely beautiful. However, there was something that stood out above all else, and that was the girl's features. They looked.....almost anime-like with how exaggerated some of their features were. The woman's curves were incredibly huge as were her breasts, barely contained without her nurse outfit. They moved with each step, and you'd think there'd be some level of discomfort with such assets yet she seemed perfectly fine. Furthermore, her eyes were huge, extremely expressive like an anime girl and taking up a lot of her face. The woman certainly didn't seem to think anything was out of the ordinary, not acting harshly to Kevin's entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm....K-Kevin....\" he began to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anata ga koko de hataraite moraete uresh\u012bdesu\" <sup>I'm happy to have you working here</sup> she smiled widely, speaking in a very cutsey voice. She bowed gently to Kevin as well before doing the same with Dr. Yokogawa and leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's happy to see you here,\" the doctor smiled. \"Most people around here have been anticipating you coming. They're all pretty receptive to new visitors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I....I see...\" Kevin blushed heavily. That woman was incredibly cute. He couldn't deny that the little guy in his pants might have reacted to. \"Are...all the nurses like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, they're specially trained to help our patients,\" the doctor said. \"That's a large part of why we're so highly regarded. Service is a high priority after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin couldn't help but wonder what sort of training would result in an appearance like that, but he supposed he couldn't complain if it was all good in the end. After coming to grips with that, he got back to getting a locker for himself. However, when looking for an empty one, he ended up finding one that had his name already on it, albeit in the Japanese style by saying \"Johnson Kevin\" instead. Guess that was fair enough in all honesty, though Kevin was surprised they already had this here. Guess they thought ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, Kevin took his notebook out of the backpack since he figured he'd need that, while the rest of his stuff could stay in the locker. As he was situating everything, subtle changes were taking place on him. His legs slowly began to grow taller, while his torso got a little smaller to match, keeping his height the same. Small sensations crawled up his legs, beginning to make them sleeker and shapier. In particular, a little bit of fat was beginning to grow in his thighs, pushing them out slightly though not enough to notice. Additionally, his socks were beginning to climb up his calves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all that done though, Kevin closed the locker and grabbed his notebook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'm ready,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" Dr. Yokogawa said. \"Let's continue with the tour. The cafeteria is nearby.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Honestly, right as the doctor mentioned that, Kevin's stomach rumbled a little. He just realized that he ate very lightly before getting on the plane to come over, not to mention how he had been rushed here right from the airport. That meant he actually hadn't had a proper meal in quite a while. The rumble was actually loud enough that the doctor heard it, chuckling a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose this is fortuitous timing,\" he smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah, sorry,\" Kevin laughed and blushed a little. \"I haven't eaten anything too big since arriving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we can take care of that too,\" he replied. \"You don't have to worry about payment. That's all taken care of beforehand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell that was assuring, since Kevin didn't have that much native currency on hand to begin with. With that, Kevin followed the doctor out of the nurse's station, notebook in hand while the backpack remained in the locker. As he exited, he didn't notice the subtle change in his nametag, where his name became engraved in it as opposed to being written on like before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, the two began walking, with a little bit of casual talk to pass the time. Kevin wanted to ask some things about the hospital as a whole, which the doctor seemed happy to divulge. It was at least nice to get some input from someone inside the hospital itself, even if some of it was already on the Internet. Along the way, they occasionally passed by other doctors and nurses, and the more Kevin saw the more bewildered he got. They all seemed to have very similar features. Heck, even their hair color and styles were exactly the same. Perhaps a really strict dress code? Perhaps it was best not to question it. Still, Kevin couldn't help but blush at it all. They were all really beautiful. Guess patients didn't have to worry about much here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe also noticed that they didn't take much attention to him, even though they greeted the doctor, which he supposed was alright since it was a professional workplace. However, Dr. Yokogawa did say something curious during their walk, in that the nurses here didn't speak or understand English very well. That struck Kevin as pretty strange, since it seemed like most if not all of the doctors didn't have a problem. Still, as weird as it sounded, who was he to judge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, after rounding some corners, they arrived at the cafeteria, which was quite bustling with all the workers not tied up in appointments at the moment. It served to give Kevin further clarification on just how identical all the nurses were. Heck, only the little English on their nametags could separate one from another to him. It really struck him as weird that so many people could look identical. And just not identical, but identical with so many anime features. Still, guess he shouldn't make a big deal out of it. It'd be rude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got in line, while Dr. Yokogawa got in behind him and began conversing with some other workers, likely on any important business. With that, Kevin kept to himself, looking over the simple menu for some breakfast. As he was looking though, he couldn't help but notice something. It seemed like every nurse was repeating the same thing, and upon further inspection, they were. All their treys were getting filled with the same thing. Something he identified as butter noodles with chicken, plus chopsticks as you would expect. The only variance was in their drinks, but even then it was just coffee or water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, Kevin kept all that to himself in any case, and the others pretty much left him alone as well. When it was his turn, he ordered a bagel, egg, and some orange juice. Not really his preferred breakfast but it was enough given the circumstances. Eventually, the doctor got his own food and motioned for Kevin to join him. They walked over to a table that had some room, only occupied by a couple of nurses. Kevin sat down with them, feeling a little small under the gazes of the nurses. They actually both giggled a little, which sounded adorable with their high-pitched voices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sore wa shin'ny\u016bseidesu ka? <sup>Is that the new student?</sup> asked one of the nurses, to which Kevin could read \"Okada Katsumi\" on her nametag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tadash\u012b.\" <sup>Correct</sup> replied the doctor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nante omoshiroi! Tasuke ni kite mo \u012bdesu ka.\" <sup>How fun! May I come along to help?</sup> giggled Katsumi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watashitachi wa yorokonde irudeshou.\" <sup>We'd be delighted.</sup> replied the doctor with a smile, before turning to Kevin. \"Kevin, this is Katsumi Okada. She'd like to come help on the tour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh....that's good,\" blushed Kevin. Having one of these cute nurses along for the ride? He just hoped he'd behave properly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they continued to eat, Kevin's pants down below began to change. The bottoms slowly began to climb up, showing more of his slender calves in the process, stopping at the middle. However, in addition, the material began to soften a little. Kevin didn't even notice as the restrictive nature of the jeans lessened just a little, stretching out slightly and being a little more pliable. Furthermore, the shade began changing,tiny hints of green beginning to show in places. The same thing actually began to happen to his shirt, little hints of green showing as it got a little stretchier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, they all finished their food in a good amount of time, with the doctor ready to continue the tour. Katsumi seemed pretty excited, giggling and her wide expressive eyes practically sparkling. It was kind of unnerving yet also adorable to look at. Right as they exited the cafeteria though, Kevin felt an oomph in his gut. Guess that breakfast must have hit him harder than he thought. Against his notice, his hips were beginning to push out a little, the little pop in his bones not registering with him as they began to spread out. Fat began to grow on his hips as they grew, and some heading to his butt as well. His slightly stretchier jeans allowed the growth of his parts, growing out to 34\" around. Kevin just believed this to be a sign that he needed the bathroom though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, can I used the bathroom?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certainly, it's just around that corner,\" Dr. Yokogawa pointed, to where the signs for the men and women's bathrooms could easily be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding in thanks, Kevin began to walk over.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Separating himself from Dr. Yokogawa and Katsumi, it gave Kevin a little bit of time to himself. Honestly, he wondered why he was feeling a bit off. I mean, he needed to use the bathroom sure, but something seemed to linger in his mind for whatever reason. He looked down at himself, seeing if anything was out of order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be honest, he did look a little bigger down below, particularly around his hips and butt. He kind of wondered if he might have put on just a little weight. It was true that he tended to snack a little more than he intended at times, but he often tried to balance that out with proper exercise whenever he could. Also, his clothes seemed just a little stretchier, which made him wonder if he needed to get some new ones at this rate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I have had this shirt and pants for...a while....\" he paused, before clearing out his throat with a cough. \"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a second, it almost sounded like his voice cracked to a higher pitch. It didn't sound like that now, but it did seem kind of weird. Then again, he was in high school so puberty was still a thing. Although, even as he shook it off, he didn't notice that it had stayed one octave higher than it was before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurthermore, as he approached the bathrooms, he absentmindedly scratched his chest, adjusting his shirt in the process. Underneath his shirt as he was adjusting, his nipples were beginning to enlarge. The tiny things slowly began growing, darkening all the while as they got bigger and bigger, just poking a little bit through his shirt. Alongside that though, as he took a deeper breath, the flesh around the nipples began to push out slightly, forming two very small bumps on his chest, not that distinguishable if you weren't looking for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat aside, as Kevin didn't really notice them, he noticed that his legs almost took him right to the ladies' room. In fact his hand was even on the door ready to push it open. He shook his head rapidly, berating himself for not paying closer attention and getting lost in his own head. He corrected that action, heading over to the men's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no one inside, so he was free to take a stall and do his business. He took his belt off and put his pants down as he sat on the toilet. As he did though, and continued to be lost in thought, he only felt a small ache as his waist was beginning to cave in slightly, going down to 24\", just slightly curving him. Additionally, it was having an effect on his stomach, making it shrink slightly.</span></div></div>",
