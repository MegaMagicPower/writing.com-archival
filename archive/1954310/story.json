Sokka was sitting there at the head of the table as he was 25 years old as Bato walked in. Smiling he was holding the carcass of a wolverine fox. He grinned as he placed it down on the bone plate that Sokka had. He pulled off a rib as he ate the cooked meat. Sokka smelt all the spices on it as he bit into it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for more information about the people Sokka was sitting with Notai was the first woman hunter in the past 7 decades.  She had six hair loopies in her brown hair going back and joining a bunt that rested on top her long hair that was tucked in under the collar.  Her eyes were brown and upon her waist was a machete.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPalluqtuq was the newest honor carver after her father's death during the war that ended 10 years ago.  She had brown hair with a pair of hair loopies on the left side going to the back joining a braided tail.  Her eyes were brown and her chest rather generous compared to Notai.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinga is the Southern Water Tribe Main Settlement's Seaway brewer and wife to Sokka.  She has a blue eyes and is a rather beautiful woman.  Her hair is sandy brown which is unusual and does not sport any hair loopies.  Her eyes are as blue as Sokka's and height is beyond tall for a woman, standing at 6 and a half feet tall, two inches taller than Sokka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSayen is seaweed farmer with short brown hair and is a lot older than anyone.  He was damaged during the war mentally and has chosen to live a life of not killing.  His right eye has a long scar going diagonal crossing to the nose, his eye remains closed.  His left eye is a steal gray which is proof of his air nomad ancestry from his great grandmother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinona is the first member in history to be a part of the Brotherhood of the Whale Tooth Scimitar.  She has chosen to have her hair short like a man's on the sides and back with a pair of dreadlocks with accent beads like the traditional brother.  The only brother that does not keep this tradition is Bato.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomar had a chicken scratch goatee and jawline beard that was barely grown. He had two dreadlocks on the left side of his face that had blue beads at the bottom. His right eye was brown and his left eye was blue.  He is a member of the Brotherhood of the Whale Tooth Scimitar.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaika is a young boy that is 11 years old that has shown great maturity for his age.  He is clearly Fire Nation descent being pale skinned with red brown eyes a trait found in the Fire Nation.  His hair is jet black and in a bowl cut.  He is the result of his mother being raped by a Fire Nation soldier during the war.  He is the only Southern Water Tribe born water bender in the last decade.  Katara taught him everything he would need to know, he is sometimes treated with prejudice because of his looks.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then said to the others that were gathered, \u201cWell, I only turn 25 once go on and dig in. It may be my birthday carcass, but I want to share it with some of the people that mean the most to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling they all began to dig in as they ate Sokka gave a grin to Pinga. She was just sitting there beside him with her legs folded under her bottom.  She saw the look he was giving her and blushed as she then resumed eating. Sokka was so happy right now, there inside his wife was their first successful child that made it past 8 months. They had experienced many miscarriages. It would be any day now that Sokka would be a father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka enjoyed the meat as he then saw Gukki run inside. He gasped and panted saying to Sokka, \u201cChief Hunter, there's trouble at the pier.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka glowered as he stood up and walked with Notai, Somar, Maika &amp; Winona to his six. The five walked as Gukki tried to keep up with Sokka as he explained, \u201cThe East Lake trading company ship sent their Earth Benders on a rampage after they were insulted by our honor.  Now, their captain requests your presence for compensation for last month's tomatoes and lettuce that we paid him in what little silver and copper we had.  He expected the rest and when we offered him Honor, his earth benders attacked. He wishes to give his condolences and take his compensation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka saw the pier just a few minutes away when he stopped hearing the word 'condolences'. He then asked Gukki with as steady of a voice as he could, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGukki looked down as he said with a low voice, \u201cBrother Isi died trying to save Asa from being crushed by a boulder.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomar grabbed the hilt to his scimitar as Winona gasped, she was married to Isi. Sokka then said as he with his head low a single tear falling, \u201cWinona, you of course of permission to rite of grief if you wish it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinona then grabbed her scimitar as she growled with rage, \u201cThey attacked and their 'captain' could not control his men and women. I will take this earth bender's head!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then said to Maika, \u201cMake sure they can't leave the pier until the rite is over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaika nodded as he went to gather his water benders. Sokka then flicked two of his fingers beckoning Somar to him, \u201cI want you to find, rationally and civilly by their standards, who was the one to kill Isi. Put him under arrest awaiting rite, and then find him whoever he or she wants to either stand in for them or give their last words to. We will not have a blood bath on our hands.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomar nodded as he said to him, \u201cAs you wish my chief hunter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then said to Gukki, \"Bring the Avatar, he's here in the village.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGukki nodded as he went to go get Aang. Sokka then looked to Notai, \u201cGet six hunters and bring to the pier the money we have. I want it escorted, we don't want someone to steal it like what happened last year that resulted in massacre.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNotai nodded as she ran and Sokka said to Winona, \u201cYou make one move that's unbecoming of a brother of the Whale Tooth Scimitar and I will take your sword. Do we have an understanding? You are the ultimate judge of justice and keeper of the peace. You will not let your emotions control you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding Winona inhaled and exhaled as she calmed herself. Sokka continued with Winona on his side as he had his boomerang and space sword on him with his club on his other side of the waist. Sokka walked up to the boat at the pier as ice walls came up blocking off the pier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe captain a skinny short man with brown eyes and hair shouted, \u201cHey!  What's the big idea.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then said to him, \u201cIt's just protocol when you kill one of my people.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn Earth Bender walked out that was nearly twice the height of Sokka and nearly a person wider than Sokka.  Looking like a stone chiseled to human features the man said to him with his beady brown eyes looking down on Sokka, \u201cWhat's it to you, savage?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then heard Somar walk up, \u201cThis is him, chief hunter. He refused to come along quietly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka nodded as he heard the giant say, \u201cSo, what if I did.  It's not like you savages can do anything to stop me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then said to him, \u201cI don't want anymore blood shed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo water benders walked up beside Maika that took a stance as water flowed out. Two of the brothers walked out as they grabbed their scimitar hilts and several hunters grabbed their boomerangs and clubs. Sokka then looked at the brothers and hunters of his people. He did not like where this was going, they were just waiting for him to give the word. Sokka had to be careful otherwise this would result in more of his people dying than the Merchants.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNotai walked up with six hunters as she presented three small bags that jiggled. Sokka then said to the captain, \u201cThis is all the silver and copper we have. Please, leave your man here. He is not allowed to leave until he has completed the Rite of Grief.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAang's voice rang through out the air as he shouted, \u201cSTOP!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAang landed as he then said looking at the group of people. He then saw the blood under a boulder near the shore. Blood was in the snow and ice looking like a red snow. He then shook his nerves off as he then looked to Sokka, \u201cChief Sokka, I request that you drop the Rite of Grief.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka looked at him as he said to Aang, \u201cI'm sorry Avatar, I have no control over this. Personally, Isi was like a father to me. He was like my father or Bato, I take this personally too and if offered the Rite. I would take it. But, I am the chief as you just pointed out and am not allowed to take the Rite. It can only be offered by a person that is a brother of the Whale Tooth Scimitar, village chief or a Chief Hunter such as myself. If the victim is the grief of a brother then it falls to me to offer and them to take it. Isi was the husband of Winona and the father of three. Now, I offered to her and she took it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAang turned to her as he then presented his argument to her, \u201cWinona, I may not know you personally. But, think about this before you do anything rash. You have three children that you provide and love for.  If you die too from this barbaric rite, then who will love and provide for them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hunter in the crowd shouted, \u201cBARBARIC?  WE ARE PEOPLE JUST AS THE SAME AS YOU!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hunter walked up to be Mukka a village chief and skilled hunter from the Jagged Cove village of the Southern Water Tribe. It was one of the first villages built in response to Northern Water Tribe immigration.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMukka then said to the Avatar, \u201cWhere were you when our tribes were suffering for 99 years of the War? And where were you last summer when the chief hunter of the Water Tribe was killed by Earth Kingdom merchants from the Omashu Merchant Trade Alliance? You were standing to the side letting these things happen. Now, you ask us to forget the death of one of our peace keepers? Without order from the peace keepers who do we trust when we can depend on you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAang then said to Sokka pleading, \u201cSokka, you can't do this.  You'll only start a war. The world doesn't need an another war.\u201d</span></div></div>",

This and the incident of last year was all started over money and our Honor not being accepted among the other cultures.  And I asked you a year ago to find a way to make this happen.  But, it has not happened and I told you that the next time someone dies over the unacceptance of our culture and the bigotism that comes with it.  Judging us as savages and puny, that I would follow my people for they were correct and I was wrong.  Well, the time has come and gone.  We will let these merchants go and take the Southern Waters as ours.  Any, and every ship that is not Water Tribe or approved of by me that enter's the waters of our tribe.  Shall be fired upon and taken from it's owners to join our navy.  This shall be in full accord in one month.  So, says the chief hunter of the Southern Water Tribe.  If you don't want any more blood to spill Avatar.  Then, make this happen.  I don't want this as much as you do.  But, I am a servant of the people.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAang knew that this was his second chance that Sokka was giving.  Sokka could have easily made this decree take place in a couple of days.  But, he was giving Aang a month to fix this.  It was the Avatar's job to help keep the world in balance. The massacre of last year that took 40 Water Tribesmen, the Southern Water Tribe Main settlement village chief Hakoda among them, should never have happened.  And today thanks to cooler heads and Sokka's leadership, only one person died.  Maybe two thanks to the rite of grief.  But, Aang had to make this right, he screwed up once. He couldn't screw up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then said to the giant, \u201cYou need to come with us or face the entire ship to be boarded and commandeered by us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant looked down on Sokka as he said to him, \u201cMake me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then moved extremely fast as he grabbed his sword as Aang leaped into action. He used his air bending to make the giant hit the snow as Sokka cut off the giant's furthest segment of the middle finger. The giant roared in pain as he screamed, \u201cYOU-!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAang then said to him as he water bent the giant into the snow with ice on his limbs, \u201cYou will follow the traditions so says the Avatar!  Or are you disagreeing with the Avatar?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant asked the tribe, \u201cWhat sort of tradition is this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then said to him, \u201cYou fight to the death with loved one that accepted the offer to the rite of grief.  Basically we take this to Cave of Light where you will fight to the death with Winona of the Brotherhood of the Whale Tooth Scimitar.  Either you will die or Winona will die.\u201d</span></div></div>",

She moved at the Avatar as she said to him in passion, \"YOU WILL NOT TAKE MY LITTLE BROTHER!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAang turned nearly too late as Sokka moved and his brother in law out of the way.  Sokka had his sword still in hand as the two began to fight sword to sword.  Sokka took her sword apart in less than six attacks as she reformed it each time it broke from the six attacks finally becoming more of a hindrance than a tool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then earth bent some plates of earth from the ship for it's defenses at Sokka.  Sokka then leaped back as he defended himself.  One of the hunters then threw his boomerang and shouted rallying the people, \"DEFEND YOURSELF THIS DAY!  FOR THE BROTHERS AND SISTERS OF THE JAGGED COVE MASSACRE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then knew it was too late, he knew that he either had to end this with this woman's death or turn on his own people to stop it.  Aang could see this as he then realized that he had no true power.  The abadonment during the war truly left the people with any true respect to the Avatar.  The Avatar was seen as someone who was the judge, jury and executioner for peace and balance of the world.  That's when it happened Earth came from the ship and the boulder as the Giant stood up and killed seven people as he roared.  Blood every where, it was a horrible sight.  Now he knew what Sokka must have felt a year ago.  He really screwed up as he then water bent up a field of mist and used air bending to pull the two earth benders back.  Using fire bending he warded off the pair as he then strapped his foot and moved his hands up.  Ice became water and ensared the giant into a block of ice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaping into the air he air bent to the top as he then placed his thumb on the giant's head.  His eyes became a blue as the red energy flew out of the giant.  The energy bending was completed the blue swallowed the red as the man lost his bending.  Sokka then saw Aang release the giant as he said to the people, \"Stop fighting he can no longer hurt you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man who had rallied them was a water bender of Maika's, he was Trum.  Trum walked up as he then shouted, \"The damage is already done, they attacked our chief, they had slaughtered our peace keeper and killed what accounts to be seven people.  Bending or not he has to die now along with the bitch who helped him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAang then argued to him, \"No, you people believe in honor and that you shouldn't kill a defenceless man.  He is unarmed and has no bending, please let them go in peace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then said to Aang as he saw the already done damage, \"Any man can pick up a bone and be armed.  I'll offer Winona the Rite to Grief one last time since you are so bent on having the outcome be of peace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara had finally gotten there as she looked to be a few months pregnant.  She saw the blood and could not believe what she saw.  Katara was grabbed by a man who helped her down. She nearly vomited at seeing the dead bodies.  It was just like a year ago when her father died.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Flashback</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA man of tremendous build, but no giant shouted at Hakoda, \"This bone and junk is worthless!  If someone has stolen the money that you planned on giving me.  Then I want their head!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHakoda then said to him, \"This is Southern Water Tribe sovereignty, you will respect the judgement as I have of our Brotherhood of the Whale Tooth Scimitar.    He needed the money to buy medicine for his village because of the plague that has broken out.  I'm sure that we will have enough money by next month to pay for the barrels of seed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man then shouted at him, \"Next month?  I am not coming back here to freeze my ass off.  Either you give me my money now or I will get upset.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHakoda spoke calmly as Katara was looking worried and Sokka was standing guard of his father.  This was not turning out to be a good day.  Sokka had just became a sub chief and Bato put in for his retirement.  Why did this have to happen?  Hakoda said to him, \"What if we give you meat to take back with you?  You could sell it as exotic meats and make double the money.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man said back to him with a spit to the snow at Hakoda's feet, \"Not even the poorest peasant in Ba Sing Sae would pay for your shitty savage meat, water tribe.  Now, I'm going to give you one last chance.  Give me the man's head or my money.  I will not leave here without it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHakoda then said to him, \"I'm afraid I can not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man then earth bent up a bunch of coal as a merchant threw a toss mine at it as the coal went at the chief hunter.  Hakoda then pushed Katara and Sokka away as he and two brothers of the Whale Tooth Scimitar ran in to try and save the chief.  Three bodies fell as the captain called for defense against the 'rabid' water tribe savages.<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nEnd of Flashback</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAang then said to Sokka angrily, \"You and your people are so swallowed up by war and being treated as foreigners that you can't see the bigger picture.  You have to let these things roll over and take them with a grain of salt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then just said as he took his sword to the Avatar's neck, \"I'm only doing what a Chief Hunter should do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara then said to her brother, \"This isn't what Dad would have done, Sokka.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then cried out as he pulled his blade back, \"NO!  YOU DON'T GET TO SAY THAT!  I HAVE TO FACE EVERYDAY THAT MY BEST WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH!  I FOUGHT TO KEEP BACK THOSE EARTH BENDERS MY ABSOLUTE BEST AND YET THEY STILL KILLED MORE THAN MY FATHER THAT DAY! I hate to say it Katara, but what Dad did that day disgraced every Tribesman standing here.  I don't want this, but order must be upheld.  Balance must be restored, if we just stand by and let the Southern Raiders of the world just roll over us.  Then we don't deserve to hunt the animals for their Honor. We should all just go into the Ice and starve.  We are Water Tribe.  We are better than this.  And I am a servant of the people. The people have spoken and now the peace keeper and judge of the Ice shall now lay decree. Somar, Winona and Bato as the last brothers I ask you. What is your decree on these two?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBato, Somar and Winona then said in their infinite wisdom and judgement, \"...\".<br>\r\n<span class=\"clteal\"><b><br>\r\nThey decree that the death to the pair should be given the harshest of dooms. Option 2: They shall be spared, but Winona still take the Rite of Grief for the Giant. Option 3: Too much blood has been spilt and they agree with Sokka's original offer.  One month of staying out of the water of the Southern Water Tribe unless if you have the Water Tribe's permission.</b></span></span></div></div>",

For a moment, they seemed to confer among themselves without speech, as though communing in thought by way of some secret, forgotten art.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir eyes were dark, cold and impersonal like the depths of the ocean as they pronounced the Doom of the transgressors, even as had been the tradition of their people since before the Earth Kingdom was united under a single monarch, before the Air Nomads built their four great temples, back when the Sun Warrior Dynasty still prospered in the West.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the bloodshed which these two have unjustly inflicted upon our brethren,\" they spoke, the cadence of their words perfectly matched, such that it seemed they were more a single being speaking at once with three mouths voice, \"and the bloodshed enacted against us by their people in the year previous, it has been decided. They must be punished, in accordance with the way of the Water Tribes. Thus do we, the appointed judges of the Brotherhood of the Whale Tooth Scimitar, declare that these two shall face the harshest of Dooms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAang and Katara paled, both knowing full well what this meant. They looked like they dearly wished to interfere, to try and sway them from this course, but they did not make any moves. They had been chastised, perhaps, by Sokka's sharp words, and feared to widen any more the divide that seemed to have formed between them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Earth Kingdom merchants and their guards, however, seemed simply vexed, appearing more annoyed than anything, as if they saw no reason to fear the judgement of the Southern Water Tribe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what is it, then?\" said the mousy, middle-aged captain, a man who looked more a bureaucrat than a sailor. \"What is this '<i>harshest of Dooms</i>'?\" He sounded irritated, but unconcerned -- as though he did not believe he had any reason to fear the judgement of the Water Tribe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Ice,\" said Sokka simply, and there was a grim weight in his words. \"Those who commit the worst of crimes within the Water Tribes are left to the judgement of the Ice. They are blindfolded, stripped of all supplies, tools, or rations, left with only the clothes on their back, and brought out into the furthest, emptiest wastes of the tundra. That far out, left stranded, alone, whether you live or die, your fate is left in the hands of the Ice. If it judges them worthy of life, if it shows them mercy and permits them to return to humanity, then they shall be considered cleansed of wrongdoing, purified by the cruelest of Nature's hardships.\" His eyes alighted upon the two accused, the two guilty. \"However, if they die, then they are left to the Ice, and their names are stricken from all records, save those of their transgression and judgement. Their names are forbidden to be spoken among the tribe until they return.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If they <i>ever</i> return,\" said Aang, and face was pale. \"Sokka, you can't actually be considering--!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not the one considering it,\" Sokka replied. \"It's already been decided. The Brotherhood of the Whale Tooth Scimitar has spoken. Even I could not overturn their judgement, if I wanted to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAang sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you don't,\" he said, sounding weary, tired. He leaned against his staff, looking very old and worn at that moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not about what I want,\" said Sokka, pointedly avoiding the question. \"As Chief, I must follow the will of the people. Judgement has already been passed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAang shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sokka...\" he said slowly, quietly, and the man for a moment felt truly sorry for his friend, and the position he must be in. \"I understand that this is how your people settle such matters, and I will not interfere. However,\" he added, \"I do not support this. I cannot support it. Sokka, I know your people want justice for everything that's been done...\" He sighed, shaking his head. \"Yet, I wonder what Justice really is...\" he seemed to be whispering this more to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Justice is the Will of the Ice,\" said Somar. \"It is not the place of men, or women, to determine it for themselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yet still you would leave them out on the tundra,\" murmured Katara, a distant, sad look in her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the way of our people, Sister,\" spoke Sokka softly. \"I'm not in any position to change that. It's not my place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatara sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" she said, and Sokka knew that she spoke the truth. She knew this every bit as well as he did, but she was still sad, too kind to truly accept what needed to be done. That, more than anything else, was really why Sokka had been chosen as their father's successor, not her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the Chief Hunter knew that his sister would never be able to really accept what he needed to do. She would never be able to look at him the way she used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I'm sorry, Katara</i>...\" Sokka whispered, before turning to face the captain of the Earth Kingdom merchant ship. \"Well? You have heard the judgement. Will you submit these two to the Ice, and accept that they must face justice for their actions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow did the captain respond?</span></div></div>",

The Omashu Trade Alliance already faced severe repremands from King Bumi for the massacre of the year previous. And it wasn't as if the current chief wasn't giving him an option.  To prevent global crisis he looked down as he said to Sokka, \"Take them, they are yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then moved his hand to the hunters as several surrounded them as Maika and his water benders rose the pair onto ice sleds.  Katara ran up to Bato as she begged him, \"Can't you give them something?  We may have to follow your judgement, but even a water tribesman is allowed a weapon while in the Ice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBato disregarded her simply saying as he walked, \"Yes, water tribesmen are permitted such a advantage.  But, these people are not Water Tribe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then walked with Notai on his six along with her six hunters as the ship left the pier.  Sokka then said to her, \"I'm going home to be with my wife.  Send word to Kyoshi Island, that they either join us or they set up their own Navy to protect their waters.  No Earth Kingdom ship or Fire Nation ship shall set sail in Southern Waters until I say so.  I want this to be understood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNotai then said to him, \"Personally, I think that it's long past due, my chief hunter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then replied to her, \"I did not ask for your thoughts, I asked nothing from you accept to get word out.  Do it now, I've already had a bad day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNotai nodded as she went feeling a tad hurt by his harsh cold voice.  Sokka went to the meeting igloo where Pinga was waiting sitting with hunters guarding her.  Sokka then said to her cold and angry, \"Pinga, we're going home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinga nodded knowing that Sokka must have had a rough day. She stood up as she walked with the three hunters.  She then took his hand and pulled it up to her face.  She held his warm hand to her cheek as she said to him, \"Take us home then and I will make sure you forget.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then said to her, \"Nothing will make me forget.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinga then replied to him, \"Don't be so quick to assume that I the wife of the chief hunter can not do my wifely duties.  I shall make you forget if only for a little while.  And if you don't then you won't be forgetting anything for a while and I'll take the skank leather as well.  So, take us home and I shall make you forget if only for a minute.\"</span></div></div>",

It was hanging in just the right place to be shook like a door bell of knocking on a door.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka heard the rattling of the rib cage as he stood up from the covers of furs.  Pinga smiled with a flushed face as she said grabbing his ankle, \"Let them solve their own problems or have the brothers solve it.  You have duties to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then said to her as pleasurable it would be to continue he didn't want to strain the baby, \"Give me an hour and I'll make you feel good again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka went out of the room as he pulled on a shirt and hopped while putting on some pants.  He walked up the steps in his bare feet as he walked up.  He saw that it was Aang as he glowered and then motioned for him to come in.  Aang walked behind Sokka as the pair went into a room that was normally closed off by a door of Koalaotter furs.  Sokka went to a seat made of Arctic wolf bat bones as he sat down at a table made of the three skeletons of three hunted dolphin piranha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then said to him as he wanted to be curtous slid him a Arctic wolf bat bone chair, \"Sit if you desire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAang then made an ice chair as he sat down and said to Sokka, \"Sokka, you don't have the power to over turn the judgements of the Brotherhood of the Whale Tooth Scimitar. So, I won't ask you of that. But, you do have the power to disband it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka looked at Aang as he said to him, \"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAang tried to argue, \"But, Sokka if you don't then the next merchants will be met with prejudice.  They are brothers and sisters, if one dies they all feel the pain.  And let's face it you only have three left.  Your population is less than 6,000 people and you have three settlements.  You have made great strives in rebuilding your people along side your father.  Sokka's point is a place of learning instead of just being taught what your father was taught and his father before him.  Please, you don't have enough hunters and your water benders are starting to just push, and not pull.  The brotherhood is small and no child has exhibited the mental abilities of one since Somar was born.  And he's as old as Katara is.  What are you going to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then said to him, \"I will trust the spirits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAang never saw this side of his friend before.  Sokka was up against the wall hanging like a Gemsbok Bull on a wall of some Earth Kingdom game hunter.  Sokka was at his lowest if he was praying to the spirits as he knew about the spirits of the world.  Not just anyone became a Brotherhood of the Whale Tooth Scimitar. There was nothing spiritual or magical about it, just natural born talent.  Of course the spirits did design the destiny of every child born into the world.  A water bender would concoct a special brew.  This brew was drank by a child at the age of 6 and produced a mind numbing state in the child.  The child would then be attacked by the combined attacks of a boomerang from a hunter, three water bent attacks and kill the wolverine fox in the room.  If the child could not do this then the hunter would kill the wolverine fox before harm could be done.  The Water Tribe knew they were no warriors, they were hunters.  And those who were born to pass the test by the brew were trained to be warriors.  Pitted against hunters and water benders.  And in order to become a brother you had to defeat in honorable battle 30 hunters or water benders, one hunter or water bender a day for 30 days straight.  Then you were presented with a whale tooth and carved it into a scimitar with often a chiselled story of all the feats they had to do in order to make it.  Then it was up to the brothers to maintain law and peace, the chief hunter made the laws and the water benders made the peace.  The brothers were the ones who kept it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAang then said to him, \"If I talk to the spirits for them to bless more children with the brotherhood.  Just, please restrict their power or something.  You have too corrupt an order to be keeping the laws and peace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then said to Aang as he looked him dead in the eyes, \"Aang, I could have said one word today and there would have been 40 dead earth kingdom merchants.  I could have said you had a week to figure this out before I start attacking ships that enter the southern sea.  But, I didn't say the word or give you a week, I kept my trap shut and gave you a month.  You will drop this subject, we do not need the Avatar.  The Avatar has done stuff for the world, not us.  If it was not for me and my sister, you would have stayed frozen.  And the world would be burned to ash by Ozai.  Yet, the world seems to think low of us.  Even our sister tribe thinks us weak and licking our wounds.  Well guess what, we aren't.  We are as strong as ever, nothing lives down here where there are little to not plants.  No metals and 8 out of 11 animals here are carnivores.  Nothing lives down here, they survive and nothing truly dies down here.  The polar bear dog that gets wounded and manages to live another day doesn't die in the snow.  No, it survives and raises to power to take what it needs.  You don't back us water tribe into a corner.  We bring you into a corner and pull you into the embrace of death.  Death is very thing that allows us to survive.  So, I will not be needing your services. I have already called someone and sent them a request. They should actually be docking any day now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door flew up as Pinga was standing there smiling dressed comfortably, \"He's here Sokka.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAang rose an eye brow as he asked, \"Who's here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then said as he got up walking out with Pinga, \"The man that will make our tribe brothers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka walked with Pinga as Aang followed him to the pier where there was a fire nation ship.  At the dock Notai greeted a face familiar to Aang and Sokka.  The man that had agreed to travel all the way to the South to help him out and help restore his people.  To help restore balance and honor to the laws and traditions of the Southern Water Tribe.  The man who would make warriors yet.</span></div></div>",

I hope your trip was enjoyable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiandao nodded to his student as he said to him, \"Please, Sokka, a student you are not.  You are a swordsman like myself, from here on out we will learn from each other and the teachers of life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiandao then said to Aang, \"Avatar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAang then did the polite thing and nodded as he continued to dwell on the matters that had happened today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka nodded as he said to him motioning his arm to go a direction, \"If you will join me at my house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiandao nodded as he walked with him and noticed Pinga's baby bump, \"So, a congratulations are in order I guess.  When is the baby due?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinga said to him, \"Thank you, and any day now.  They'll greet us any day now.  It's only a matter of time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling they then came to Sokka's house as Somar was there waiting for them.  Sokka then walked to the meeting room of which he and Aang were just at.  Sokka moved some of the chairs to allow multiple people to sit.  Sokka then introduced Piandao to Somar, \"Master Piandao this is Somar of the Brotherhood of the Whale Tooth Scimitar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiandao bowed as he quarter nodded the man as Somar did the same.  Piandao then said to him, \"I guess we'll be seeing each other more soon.  So, Sokka this plan do you have any young students for me to train?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka nodded as he said to Piandao, \"Master, please allow me to thank you for coming to help us restore the brother hood of the whale tooth scimitar.  I assume a master of your skill will be able to teach with one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiandao then said to him, \"On a couple of conditions.  That we discussed in the original letter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then nodded as he said to him, \"Of course Master, you shall gain full sanctuary from the New Ozai Society and you shall be given full citizenship of the Water Tribe.  What is the new condition?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiandao then said to him, \"Sokka, I am no hunter like you are and I am a painter and writer, not a honor carver.  And making seaway is nothing like making tea.  So, I was hoping to make honor by working as a brother of the whale tooth scimitar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then said to him, \"Of course and just because you become a brother does not mean you have to abandon the White Lotus.  By the way we have things to talk about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAang then stepped in, \"Yes, your new chief hunter has declared militarization of the Southern Sea and just sent two people to the Ice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomar then said defending his and his brothers and sister decision, \"They killed 7 people and Isi just three hours ago.  They were not innocent and they were greedy merchants. We have no problem against the Earth Kingdom.  We have a problem against trade and merchant alliances not accepting our values.  So, if they so desire the resources of the South at the Patola mountains, Whale Tail Island or the exotic furs of our home.  Then they will either have to accept our ways and traditions or live in fear of surfing in our waters.  This was a decision made not by the Chief Hunter.  He has no power when it comes to our decisions.  Before the first Southern Water Tribe Avatar, before the Earth Kingdom was a monarchy and dragons were still respected in the west, we have had the Brotherhood of Whale Tooth Scimitar.   And it was made to prevent the hunters or water bender from having too much power.  The water benders would make religious and spiritual decrees while the hunters made civil and resource decrees.  It was for these reasons and people wanting power that we were created.  We are the ones who keep the balance and make order where there is chaos.  So, do not accuse my chief of anything, he is a servant to the people as is I and Maika the head of the Water Benders.  Katara gave up her position as head water bender when she renounced her duties to be wife and mate of the last air bender.  So, if my chief wants the Earth Kingdom and Fire Nation as well as the new erecting United Republic to get anything out of us.  Then they need to respect our values and our way of life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaindao then said to Sokka, \"I am sorry that you had to see blood shed today.  When will the services be held?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then said to him, \"They will be slid out in the morning with the prisoners.  But, we promised the tribe a party upon your arrival in your honor.  And a party we will have.\"</span></div></div>",

They began to move about as they began a sacred dance of the Ice. They rose their hands as snow went into the air and they lowered their hands digging into the ice.  They dug and dug as stairs were made and people walked down them into a giant underground igloo with a large hole at the top.  Dead animals were brought down the steps with closed bone basins of seaway as Sokka walked with Pinga down the steps.  People three bones into a pile as Sokka poured on a skin full of fat and grease as Bato used spark rocks to light the fire.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarge and roaring were the flames of the bone fire.  People began to take off their cloths as people began to drink and eat.  Sokka then said to the people that were dressed down to loincloths and wrappings, \"TO WELCOME OUR NEWEST BROTHER OF THE WHALE TOOTH SCIMITAR AND BROTHER OF THE WATER TRIBE!  PAINDAO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople threw up their glasses as Sokka then said to Notai as he bowed to her, \"May I have this first dance?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNotai smiled as she began to take a swing at him. Sokka bent his knees dodging her punch as he then lifted a leg and spun to kick her legs.  She leaped and landed as the pair began to 'fight' each other.  But, they purposely dodged as if this was some form of brutal dance and meant to show that even in a harsh life of kill or be killed that you could still live in the moment of danger by turning  danger into love.  People began to follow suit of their chief swinging clubs at their loved ones or brothers or sisters, siblings or parents.  People began to 'attack' as they leaped and walked around the fire.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaindao walked with a cup of seaway as he drank it back with a toss of his head.  He found this young lady there that took interest to him.  He began to dance with her as he swung his sheathed jian at her and she snapped at him with her club.  The people began to shout and jeer. As the moon rose and danced in the sky.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka walked to the side as he watched his people enjoy life. He then looked to the moon as he said to the sky, \"Hey, how are you doing?  Really?  Bored enough to visit me?  Well after life must be really boring if you want to watch a free stripe show.  Well you know what they say when you have a body this fine it's a sin to wear layers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then laughed as he said to the, \"Got you to laugh didn't?  (Sigh) I miss you Yue, I really wish you were here with us.  Then again I suppose that you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinga was enjoying the water and meat as she watched people dance and celebrate.  People would defititely need it after what happened today. She couldn't believe it, but it felt like it was just yesterday when she and her brother were hiding from the raiders.  The very raiders that took her brother from her and let him lay in the melted snow burned.  She then smiled as she saw her husband.  He was what made things better and to name their first child in honor of her brother, that was his promise.  Pinga told herself the truth, no man in the world would match him.  She really was lucky.</span></div></div>",

The hunters and civilians were next as the two prisoners were walked out with the Brothers of the Whale Tooth Scimitar surrounded them.  Bato and Winona had their blades out behind the pair as Somar lead them with the seaweed rope binding their wrists. Sokka then looked at the people as he walked with a large binded rope of seaweed.  He pulled out bone sleds with wrapped bodies as he came to the surface.  He walked to each body as he pulled back the flap covering the heads.  He opened the lips of the dead and poured in some seaway.  He then walked to his people as he turned to face them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaika then walked up to the sleds as he said to the people, \"We are gathered here for life and death alike.  Death is the very thing we worship here in the Ice.  Without it we would not survive.  There is no living here in the Ice, there is only survival.  We are born into the Ice and we sacrifice ourselves for it.  Sometimes we survive and others we become mortally wounded.  But, one thing is certain.  That when we take from the Ice we know that someday we will join the Ice again.  Today we give the Ice 8 of it's occupants and say to it.  'We survived and will continue to until the day we die.'  So, with that said, may you the dead find peace in the afterlife with the spirits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe water benders walked up as they and Maika strapped their feet and pushed after pulling.  They pushed the sleds out onto the Ice as the sleds went out and far into the Ice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomar then said to the prisoners, \"Enjoy your stay, know that if you turn around from this spot.  That you will die, find your way home if you can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe people began to walk away as Ice was bent around their ankles and wrists.  Maika then said to them, \"To make sure that you don't follow us, you will have to break out of those before you can truly move.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka led his people as he walked with Pinga and smiled at his wife.  They walked with the brothers coming up behind them and Paindao asked Somar, \"Where do I get a sword?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomar then said to him, \"Just as soon as you defeat 30 water benders or hunters in 30 days or less with hunter weapons. Then we give you a tooth and you make a sword from it.  Good Luck.\"</span></div></div>",

Sokka stood at the ready as Maika then water bent down the thin wall of water the seperated the two.  In an instant they pulled out their weapons.  Paindao with his sword and Sokka with his the two fought swinging at each other's blades.  The jians crossed and slid on each other as sparks were born.  Sokka leaped off the snow as he reached with his free hand for his boomerang. Throwing it Paindao moved forward grabbing Sokka's left leg with his free hand.  Pulling he jostled the chief hunter to the air loosing the boomerang to the icy wind.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka hit the snow as his sword landed in Paindao's free hand.  Paindao went in with his two swords as Sokka grabbed his club.  Getting up he bashed the swords from their course of attack.  Sokka looked dead certain as he went in for an attack.  He was determined that if he was going to be the 30th hunter defeated for this new brother, he would be the hardest to defeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka ran at Paindao as he forced him to back up as Maika then began to move.  Ice blocks appeared from the snow that was disturbed.  The ice went in front of Sokka's feet as he leaped over the block.  Paindao took advantage of the snow and swung a jian at it causing it to hit Sokka.  Sokka then snapped his wrist breaking the cloud of snow and landed where Paindao used to be.  Paindao was taking advantage of this snowy day that came down from the clouds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaindao was freezing wishing that this 10 day was not his final day.  What he wouldn't give for some hot tea and some biscuits. That's when he saw it, the wall of ice raising from the front of Maika.  Maika's job was to officiate this duel and provide obstacles for the hunters.  Maika slide his arms making ice disks come off the top of the pillar.  Paindao was going to be hit if he did not get out of the snow.  He had choosen to hide in a snow pile to take advantage of the blindness the sky provided.  Leaping out of the snow pile would alert Sokka to his location, but then again.  Sokka only had his club left and his boomerang laid somewhere in the Ice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka walked as he listened and then his ears heard it.  A disturbance in the air as he moved his club to his side and snapped his wrist up.  The disk smashed against his club as Sokka then moved to protect himself from three more ice disks.  He then hit the snow with a downward hammer disturbing the snow to cover him.  Sokka was gone after the snow hit the ground and the snow from the sky was starting to slow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun shown it's brightness as Paindao knew that with the snow fall gone he would soon be discovered.  Now was the time the disk was right on top of him as he snapped his wrists.  The disk was cut in half as he moved to duck under a club swing.  Paindao then said to Sokka, \"Good, you found where I was at using your knowledge of your homeland.  Very good Sokka.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then went in as the two began to duel again.  Paindao won though as he sacrificed his own jain dropping it to the ground.  Moving his hand away and turning around with a swing of the space sword.  His free hand joined the hilt of the space sword as the club was struck down to the ground.  Sokka was defeated and the chief hunter then lowered his head and said to him, \"Honorable duel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then put picked up his club putting on his back waist where the bone clip was waiting.  The clip snapped around the hilt of the club allowing it to bob with his steps.  Sokka to his jian and put it into his sheath as he went to his boomerang placing it back into it's holder.  Walking up to the victor was Somar as he said to Paindao presenting a tooth, \"Like the brothers of the Brotherhood of the Whale Tooth Scimitar you have victored the best hunters and water benders the tribe has to offer.  You have braved the Ice and you have earned the scared Whale Tooth.  By the morning sun of the morrow you will have carved your story into the tooth and make the finest hilt for it.  Then name your sword which shall forever be your at your beck and call.  Today, we of the Brotherhood of the Whale Tooth Scimitar welcome you in brother Paindao.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The tooth would become his weapon, his sword. It had been the living weapon of a great whale, a mighty lord of the sea, and now it would become his blade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he carved, Piandao allowed himself to meditate. He contemplated the nature of the whale tooth, its purpose, its contribution as a small part a great and powerful whole. Even as the brothers and sisters were each but only a single part of a whole, so too was the lone tooth only one out of many. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlone, it was no great thing. But together with others of its kind, moving in unison with dozens of other teeth to come down upon their prey, their foes, driven by the icy, gnashing jaws of the ocean, it could become a terrible force, among the greatest in all of nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiandao allowed his knife to move along the innate contours of the tooth, shaping it according to its grain, carving it not into a form he envisioned, not forcing it into a shape which he desired, but listening to the substance, the enamel, and shaping it according to its natural strengths. He did not give the tooth a form he chose -- rather, the tooth itself chose the form it would take.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did not guide it, or lead it. He simply allowed its innate potential to come out, simply acted as the will of the substance with which he worked, shaping it according to its own native powers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd at last it was shaped, a scimitar of the whale tooth -- as finely honed as any could manage, carved with as much skill as any of the Southern Water Tribe. Only one thing remained to finish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA name. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt came to him easily, as naturally as if he were simply giving voice to what already existed, using a name it had always possessed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ming Bo Fu,\" he said, half to himself, and half to the weapon in his hand. \"<i>Shining Wave Lotus</i>. That is your name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

On it was a large hole on the West side that let in light into a large cavern.  On the North side of the mountain was a large square wall made of ice like the entire mountain.  The entire land of the tribe was nothing but ice and in different densities.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaindao sat on a bone sled with one of Maika's brothers water bending up the mountain.  As they approached the square set of walls Paindao observed the strong hold.  This is where Sokka two years ago upon making sub chief hunter decreeded a place of learning.  Water benders came to hone their natural talents, boys and girls alike came to hone their skills of the hunt or sword.  In the case of teens they came to learn trades such as astronomy, mapping, spiritual mythology, cultural learning, boat building, sailing, fishing, sea weed diving, weapon carving, honor carving, seaway brewing, trade negotiation, delegation and cooking.  Those were the only courses taught so far at the strong hold this deep into the Ice.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they neared the wall a water bender at the top bent a hole into the wall as the sled went inside.  There Paindao saw great buildings made of ice, not igloos like what one would see at the main settlement or the Jagged Cove settlement.  These were cubes, domes and a pyramid?   Sokka did tell Paindao that he would know the college when he saw it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the sled slowed down Paindao got off and bowed to the water bender.  The water bender bowed back and bidded him fairwell, \"May the Ice not burden you today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaindao walked into the triangular archway of the pyramid.  He stood in the large building as he walked down a hall.  There were many doors as he walked he saw Bato at one door.  Bato smiled at him and said motioning to the door, \"Please, come in, come in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBato and Paindao walked inside as they walked  down many stairs until they reached the cavern.  Inside the cavern they saw at the bottom 12 kids sitting on their knees with bone in front of them.  Paindao then said to them as Bato walked behind him, \"Today we begin your training.  Of all the boys and girls that drank the brew and failed.  You 12 had the best potential judged by the chief hunter.  I have been instructed to teach and train you into the new generation of the Brotherhood of the Whale Tooth Scimitar.  During the week you shall learn from two instructors two days a week and then two more days will be taught by instructors Winona and Somar.  Today, Hakodaday, and tomorrow, Kamaiday, shall be taught by me and Bato.  So, if you all would pick up your bones we will begin with the basic movements.\"</span></div></div>",

Kanna was sitting with Pinga helping deliver the child as she instructed Pinga to breath and push.  Pinga was panting as she said to Sokka, \"Please, don't leave me, no matter what comes up.  No business today, just, gaaaahh (scream), stay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka took a cloth to her forehead as he wiped away the sweat. Maika was there using his water bending to heal Pinga as the body was helping deliver the child.  Pinga then nearly broke Sokka's hand as he said to her stroking her arm after drying her forehead, \"Just calm down, this will be over soon.  Alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\"><i><b>Meanwhile in the new Republic City</b></i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAang stood in front of five councilmen one from the fire nation, one from Omashu, one from Ba Sing Sae, one from the United Republic and another from the Northern Water Tribe.  As the Avatar, and last air bender, he could not stand here helping the world.  He could only plead with them.  The new Air Acolytes were trying to form on their own and bring back the Air Nomads a nation to participate in the United Nations council.  The Southern Water Tribe did not have an enough population to send a councilman, so the North had one.  And the Earth Kingdom had two representatives and three if you count the 30 year old United Republic representative who had more loyalty lying with them than his own country.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe odds were in the favor of the Earth Kingdom.  This did not look good for Sokka and it looked even worse for the world.  If the Southern Waters were militarized over cultural differences then the Earth Kingdom would possibly aggressively send in troops to secure it.  While the Fire Nation would send aid to the Southern Water Tribe of food and supplies.  The Northern Water Tribe recently with it's newest chief Hahn, through political marriage to the cousin of Yue, has shown favoritism with the Earth Kingdom cutting off all trade and aid to the Southern Water Tribe.  Things did not look good for the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clteal\"><b><i>At the Southern Water Tribe main settlement</i></b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka and Pinga laid on a mountain of pelts looking at their new daughter.

She then said to Sokka, \"They're like little moons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then said to his wife, \"I know I've told you about her and how she gave me inspiration to take the war on a higher level.  And I was just wondering.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinga then said to him, \"Of course.

From Ba Sing Se was the upper ring woman named Mu Ning.  She wore fine silks in shades of green and sported gold trim.  At Mu Ning's neck was a gold chain that went to her waist joining her skirt.  She stood as she said to the Avatar, \"This council has had one vote on producing a new global currency that shall be converted into any other currency.  From the Northern Water Tribe they have voted no and chosen to produce their own precocious metal currency as they have some earth in their territory.  Having silver and sapphire made coins as their currency.  The Fire Nation has voted to produce a global currency siding with the Avatar.  While, Omashu and United Republic representatives have voted with the Northern Water Tribe against producing a global currency that could not be tracked.  And as a representative from Ba Sing Se, I can positively say that adapting to such a new currency would be difficult and learning how to convert it to gold or vice versa would be complicated.  So, I vote no on the subject of producing a new currency.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAang then looked and saw the representative of the United Republic speak.  He was a man with white hair and closed eyes being a veteran from the war.  His eyes were lost to him as a long scar laid across them and went up to his ears.  The man was the famous Captain Mong, who even under brutal Fire Nation torture, did not give away the weaknesses of the Earth Kingdom offensive lines.  His boldness and quiet tongue had delayed many Fire Nation victories costing the Fire Nation precious resources and men.  He then said to the council, \"I move for a war against the Southern Water Tribe for becoming aggressive against the United Republic and the Earth Kingdoms.  The evidence is clear that the massacres were obviously staged and have been all planned to orchestrate this militarization of the Southern Sea.  To lead to a staging area for a war against the Earth Kingdom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAang's jaw dropped as he said to him, \"You can't be serious!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMu Ning then voted as she said to the council, \"I agree, Ba Sing Se will have it's navy set sail for the Eastern Air Temple islands for a staging point to combat this militarization of the Southern Sea.  The moment they produce a blockade we will have our answer of their attentions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe representative of Omashu a black haired man with green eyes named Jemu stated, \"The Southern Water Tribe has already set up it's blockade in the Western area of the Southern Sea.  Intelligence reports state that ships are approaching Kyoshi Island to see if the Kyoshi Warriors will join them.  If that becomes true then they will have betrayed the Earth Kingdom.  I shall vote yes to the Earth Kingdom attack on the Southern Sea to secure it for our selves.  And if Kyoshi Island joins them then Omashu will destroy them along with the Southern Water Tribe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAang could not believe what he was hearing as the representative of the Northern Water Tribe began to speak.  His name was Sum and he was a water bender with blue eyes and brown hair in a tail.  He said voting with Ba Sing Se, Omashu and the United Republic, \"We shall give aide to this attack.  The ocean and moon teach us that we should push and pull.  Not take more than we need.  We will give our best admirals and sailors to help send undercover soldiers into the aggressors territory to sabotage the Southern Water Tribe efforts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAang looked in terror as he then heard the Fire representative Mai stand up, \"We will not be apart of this war.  We will sent supply to the South, but we will not join them in the field of battle.  But, if you attack us for relief efforts to the civilians that will undoubtedly be caught in the cross fire.  Then we will attack and join them in an effort to establish their borders.  You have been warned.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAang stood there in shock as he listened to what was undoubtedly the first moves to a war.  He had failed and as the Avatar he would have to stand aside for now until the world was truly in danger. </span></div></div>",

The three of them sat on pelts of furs as Sokka has listened to Aang failure and plea to not militarize the Southern Sea.  Sokka then looked at Maika and Somar as they then knew what was to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then said to Aang, \"We can not back down Aang, we were willing to have peace.  But, we were challenged indirectly by killing our people. And to just back down after shouting something is seen as cowardice and weakness.  So, I can not allow this.  I am not sorry Aang, this is something that has to be done and I am willing to do what the people want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka stood up as he walked outside and looked at four people that were gathered.  Notai was among the four as he then said to the four, \"You are the four new commanders of the hunters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAang walked out and then said to Sokka, \"I have to go back home.  I'll wish your sister your love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then said to him, \"Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAang took flight as he went to the pier where Appa waited for him.  Sokka then looked to the four generals and hunters of his new military.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNotai, Mojag, Galilahi and Qaletaqa were all standing there waiting for orders.  Mojag was a quiet stout man that had served in the 100 years war.  He had long grey hair showing the evidence of his ageing body.  But was still the fastest and strongest man of unarmed combat specializing in the Southern Water Tribe martial art known as the Polar Bear Dog Wrestling.  His eyes were a near dull blue showing his bad eye sight, but still the man could see light and shadow.  While he couldn't make out a face and had to listen and feel his way around the world.  He was still the only man to have mastered the PBD wrestling and no one, not even the younger hunters could take him down.  He was called Mojag the Canine for a reason, a legend that he took a chomp to the ribs and still killed a Polar Bear Dog without the aide of his hands as they were broken in the legend.  Whether the legend was true or false, only he would know as did not verify or deny the legend.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGalilahi was a younger hunter being in his late twenties and had been a veteran of the 100 years war.  He was the master of the bow and arrow, wielding a bone bow that had sung in legend. The bow was named 'Pangolin Fisher Striker' for it's incredible accuracy and the fact that it's arrows could even go into the water.  A feat that was accomplished, but not that well.  However his arrows always went in and still struck.  Galilahi was a brown hair man with brown eyes and seemed to have a lean body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQaletaqa a young hunter and the second female hunter in a century.  She is the master of the bone club and with her twin hammers.  Having a pony tail and a right side tail, the left side had two hair loopies linked to the bottom of her neck were a bun was under the pony tail.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sokka then said to the four, \"Alright you women and men are the new Party of Four.  I wish you to gather and test the hunters for the next week.  Train them for your specialities while I make a trip with Somar.  By the time I get back, I want these hunters to be ready for possible war.  I will be talking to the boat builders and ship captains.  We are almost done establishing a Eastern blockade and depending on the answer I get will be building a Northern Blockade.  I will be back in a week.\"</span></div></div>",

The boat was of a canoe design with a tent of fur erected by bones.  The boat was long enough to let eight people sleep on it.  The ship was often used as an attack ship when deployed from their mast ships.  Currently Sokka had a feeling of trepidation for this trip.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMart was swinging his arms behind Sokka water bending the ship to go faster than usual.  They had a week to get to Kyoshi Island and back.  Sokka just didn't know how Suki was going to respond to his ultimatium.  He had sent a Pelican Owl that was housed temporarily in the Pelican Owl receiving post of the main settlement.  The Pelican Owl flew to Kyoshi Island a few days ago with Sokka's ultimatum.  Either join the Southern Water Tribe or be cut off from trade with anyone else besides the Earth Kingdom via blockade.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka pulled out some jerky as he bit down on it and chewed it.  Somar was standing outside the tent helping man the boat with the hunters that were joining them.  Sokka then thought about how he and Suki had split up 8 years ago.  Sokka was told by his people that if he did not marry at 17 or face a possible life with no wife for the entire future.  The tribe was lowly populated and it was his duty to marry.  Suki was flattered by the proposal, but had to turn him down for she was married to Kyoshi. (All credit of this idea goes to Evilfuzzy9 in his Unexpected Aftermath.)  So, Sokka and her for the better of tribe split up.  They honestly could have been lovers as in the Southern Water Tribe polygamy and open marriages were very common.  However the temptation to love someone more than he would his future wife was too large of an unknown variable.  Suki didn't want to stand in the way of tradition and so, they split up.  In his opinion on good terms they still sent friendly letters to one another and before Hakoda's death during the first massacre, visited one another.  But, Sokka hadn't seen her since the death of his father.  He didn't know how she would react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomar then lifted the tent flap as he said to Sokka, \"We are here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, Sokka figured he would find out her reaction now and not later.  Sokka stood up as Mart had stopped water bending a while ago.  Walking out of the tent Sokka saw his five hunters secure the boat to the docks.  Getting onto the dock and disembarking from his boat Sokka had Mart and Somar to his back on each side of him.  Sokka looked up from the planks of wood as he saw the woman that first stole his passion, the woman that he had to break the heart of in order for them to have a future.  He saw the face of which woman?</span></div></div>",

Kyoshi island could become the graveyard of my people, and you want to start a war because your pride demands it.\" Sokka hadn't heard her speak to in this tone before and it was not the reaction he had hoped for, but he couldn't say he was entirely surprised by the result. \"What I do here, I do for my people\" He interjected. Suki shook her head \"I have to look out for my people too Sokka.\"  He nodded unsure of what he could say, to sway her mind. It had never been this difficult to speak to her before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I am sorry that we will no longer be allies\" He said sternly, a warning at the tip of his words.

So, how's Pinga?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then replied to her, \"Pinga is doing good, a little relieved that we've had our first successful baby. She's hoping that Yue is a water bender, I'm hoping for the opposite.  So, I can take her out hunting.  She may be blind, but we hunters in the South are trained to hunt blind thanks to the blizzards and heavy winds blowing the snow in our vision.  Of course, the boomerang is automatically out of the question.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki smiled as she said to him, \"You're going to be a great father, sorry that what we had couldn't have worked out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then said to her, \"Listen, I understand, you are not allowed to marry as a Kyoshi Warrior.  Sure you can have kids, but your commitments are to Kyoshi and the island.  What we had was absolutely some of the best memories of my life.  And the friendship we have now, I would never trade that for anything.  Honestly, I wish the war could be avoided, I mean I tried to give the Earth Kingdom a way for peace.  And only wanted to set up a blockade.  What I can promise is that we will not fire the first shot.  We are only going to mine the water and blockade our waters.  If the abbey wants in, I don't see why.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki then said to him understanding, \"Sokka, as advisor to governor Oyaji, who currently is dying. I can tell you personally, if someone killed my people blatantly and the people commanded vengeance.  Then I like you would be a servant to my people.  You are not a tyrant, you followed your father's ways at first.  Trying to let the Earth Kingdom be civil, but they did not change their ways to peace.  You are a servant to the people and that is what a good leader should be.  Not swayed by his own emotions, but by those of his people.  Let the people decide and then lead them to their goal as safely as you can.  I'm very proud to know you Sokka, you are great, courageous, fair minded and of course we can't forget funny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka blushed a bit as he then stood up and said to her, \"Shall we have lunch perhaps?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling Suki said to him, \"Yes, follow me please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then said to Somar, \"You are dismissed, go have lunch or relax.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomar nodded as he walked out as Sokka walked side by side with Suki.  His hands were behind his back as he walked with the Kyoshi Warriors behind them.  One of them then reached for her waist.  The three were totally unaware of it, but she was about to pull out her fan.</span></div></div>",

But, these men were not in love, but they did like each other.  Mart was a young man in his twenties with long black hair in seven tails.  His eyes a deep blue with white tint in them showing his fading sight.  But, that did not stop him as he could feel the water of others when he walked allowing him to 'see' whatever had water inside it. Sure, that made seeing stone hard, but he figured if it doesn't have water in it.  Be prepared and be on your guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMart felt the water someone near Sokka's voice take a rise.  Like aggression on the ocean in the form of a tide.  So, he moved as he ran in and pushed his left arm back.  Then pulled his right arm forward snapping water from his water skin belt at the fan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe steel fan hit the ground as Zhu Ja the newest Kyoshi Warrior was revealed to be a traitor.  She had thick black hair that if undone from it's big due would be long.  Her eyes piercing green as she growled at her attack being sabotaged.  Then she reached for her katana as she was going to attack.  Then suddenly she froze as she hit the ground and standing behind her was Ty Lee.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy did Zhu Ja do this?

Tae looked at the traitor as she then asked her, \"So what do you have to say for yourself Zhu Ja?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZhu Ja then replied to her, \"Can't you see what this outsider is doing to us?  He is making us betray our people.  We may have Southern Water Tribe ancestors for a majority of the island.  But, we know that the core of Kyoshi Island came from the mainland.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki then said to her as she walked into the tent, \"And that mainland was willing to destroy our ancestors.  If it wasn't for the Southern Water Tribe back then and Avatar Kyoshi.  Chin's followers after he fell to his death would have engulfed our ancestors and destroyed them. And where were the Earth Kingdom soldiers during the 100 year war?  At least the Southern Water Tribe came to our island, sure it was an accident, but at least they came and helped when they were needed. And as you said earlier the majority of the island are descendants of the South.  And guess what, there are several on the island that desire to join the South's struggle for acceptance and peace.  The Earth Kingdom is making this into a war not the South.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZhu Ja then replied to Suki, \"Why not just put in an embargo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka was present the entire time with Somar at his side.  Somar had his blade drawn, but at his side ready for use at any moment that called for it.  Sokka then looked at her as he stood up, \"An embargo is being discussed as we speak with Omashu and Ba Sing Se.  The Earth Kingdom as a whole is not a bad place, such as Gaoling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZhu Ja then said to him, \"I don't care what you do with me.  I am an Earth Kingdom patriot through and through.  If you wish to see my act of violence as an act of war, then know that you will be crushed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka looked at her as he said to her with even brows showing no real emotion, \"No, it shall not.  You acted alone and I will allow punishment to be disputed by commander Suki.  For you did not betray me, but your commander.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuki looked at him as she said to him, \"Thank you Sokka for allowing me to handle my own problems.  Brother Somar, as of this morning we joined the Southern Water Tribe in it's customs.  You have the right to make judgment upon her based on our laws and punishments.  Please make your decision by the morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomar nodded as Tae was left with Lie Ying and Ai to guard the traitor.  The rest exited as Sokka saw Mart walk up with a dragon hawk.

She also left a disturbing. It read: \u2018don\u2019t worry dear brother I am going after Sokka this time\u2019. It seems she also escaped three days ago after setting free the massager hawks so we only just found out about it yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe can only assume she is after your life since you were the only one able to track her down after her last three escapes. I hope this reaches you in time to warn you and you should also find the bird to be very familiar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn a different note the Fire Nation wants to stay out of the brewing war for now. I kept this information from the council but Bumi sent me a letter stating that Omashu will be on your side should his incompetent representative not get the notice of his termination on time. Zuko is also willing to throw the Fire Nation into war again to aid the South if you just ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Also the new leader of the Northern Water Tribe is a man named Hahn and he chose to support the Earth Kingdom and United Republic against the south. Look out for infiltrators. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Beifong family should be sending you a letter soon. It also seems that the Beifong Metal Bending Academy burned down last night under strange circumstance. The odd thing is none of the forty metal benders bodies were found and that fact seems to not be in any other reports but the one I received, Is that not strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHope you\u2019re still alive<br>\r\n\t\tFire lady Mai. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nP.s. Zuko wants you to be little Urna\u2019s Godfather. I agree with his choice and hope you except the offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka was touched that Mai and Zuko wanted him to be the godfather of the future ruler of the fire nation. Sokka then takes a look at the dragon hawk who carried the message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHawky is that you boy?\u201d Sokka asks the bird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bird gives happy caw at being recognized by his true owner. That\u2019s when Sokka was grabbed around his chest as a hot blue welding blade was held to his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello peasant it\u2019s nice to see you again. Why did you not visit me? And as for you guards stay back or I will kill the peasant.\u201d Azula asks Sokka as she held the blade a bit closer to his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you want Azula I\u2019m kind of in the middle of planning a defense for a war that is about to start and don\u2019t have time for this.\u201d Sokka tells the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m here. You see I originally plan to kill you so no one could track me down. Then I hear your little nation is about to enter a war against the Earth Kingdom and that you are also the new High Chief and Chief Hunter of the Southern Water Tribe. I also heard about the massacre that happened last year in the south. So I decided to become a member of your tribe, which will grant me the freedom I desire. And just because you are the only person to capture me I want will become your second wife. I think that is a far trade for the services of the woman who not only took down Ba Sing Se but counter your invasion of the Fire Nation. Don\u2019t you agree?\u201d Azula tells Sokka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka knew it would be to his advantage to except Azula\u2019s demands since she was now perfectly sane after falling into a healing spring. He also felt he owed Azula for saving him during the journey they took together with the gang to find Ursa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDeal we will marry after we arrive back at the Southern Water Tribe. Somar I am leavening things here to you for now. I will be back in two weeks\u2019 time. Sorry Suki but I need to leave and deal with new events. We will have to catch up more when I get back. I also have a favor to ask you.\u201d Sokka says when Azula lets him go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka finally gets to see the woman who was holding him captive. Sokka saw that Azula was dressed in clothes similar to the ones she used well a member of the Dai Lee. Azula also filled them out far better than the last time she wore Earth Kingdom clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula was now standing at five foot, five inches tall making her shorter than his first wife. Azula also had almost as good an ass as Pinga. However Azula did have the lager breasts with a nice round pair of e-cups, she was also bigger than her mother. Azula was wearing her long brown hair down at the moment it reached her large heart-shaped ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you need my chief?\u201d Suki asks Sokka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you mind giving Ty lee two weeks leave to attend her friend\u2019s wedding?\u201d Sokka asks Suki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course she can\u2019t have the time off. Ty lee is the reprehensive I will be sending with you so she will be there it any way.\u201d Suki says with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you Suki.\u201d Ty lee says as she hugs her boss.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It\u2019s also the reason she decided to hunt Sokka this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe you still get sea sick on a boat.

So my new bride will not need to suffer the two days it would normally take to get home to the south. Maybe Zuko can give you a fire nation ship for as a wedding gift.\u201d Sokka says as he takes Azula into his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy are you holding me and he better if he knows what is good for him.\u201d Azula asks Sokka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I thought you might feel better if I hold you and you need to get used to me holding you. I am a cuddlier after all. And Pinga says I move around in bed if I don\u2019t have a girl to hold onto. I do not know what will happen with two in my bed.\u201d Sokka says as some of his foolishness pops back up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo matter how mature Sokka gets he still seems to do something stupid every few days. Luckily Azula feels a bit better in Sokka\u2019s arms. You see like Pinga and Notai, Azula\u2019s chi system is compatible with Sokka\u2019s and as such Sokka\u2019s chi can help sooth certain ailments. Some of this includes sea sickness and morning sickness. Pinga would not leave Sokka\u2019s side through her last pregnancy when she learned this little fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re lucky I am feeling better and that I decided I want to be your bride or I would hurt you badly.\u201d Azula says as she cuddles into Sokka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe may be a bitch but she was a girl and Sokka made her feel better on the boat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou will not be letting me go until we get to the village Sokka or I will hurt you.\u201d Azula tells as she holds her right hand covered in her blue fire up to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes mam.\u201d Sokka says with a gulp.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

How was this boat with two guards, a water bender, Ty Lee and Sokka with her plus going to handle a trip to the water tribe?  It was small, made of bone and it went against a decent amount of current.  The creaks and noises made her stomach unsettled at this adventure.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't tell Sokka this or anyone else for that matter.  But, now that she was healed thanks to falling into some healing water.  She appreciated Sokka, here he was a non bender and capable of tracking, matching a decent amount of benders with no bending and if not for her brilliance a master strategist.  So, she liked him, but he was handsome.  You don't just attract a Water Tribe princess, fire nation girl that's the enemy, Kyoshi Warrior, Metal Bender of time and earth kingdom village girl with just your jokes. (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://avatar.wikia.com/wiki/Kaya_%28village_girl%29\" target=\"_blank\">http://avatar.wikia.com/wiki/Kaya_%28vil...</a>)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula then heard from one of the guards, \"Land ho!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula was relieved by this knowledge and pulled the fur coat given to her by Sokka all the closer.  Who knew the South was so, cold?  It was called the Southern Water Tribe, not the cold lands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka pulled up the flap as he got off the boat and smiled as he smelled the frigid air, \"Ah, Azula welcome to the Ice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula thought to herself, '<i>I stand corrected.</i>'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking up was Notai as she then saw Azula, but didn't question it.  Azula was obviously Fire Nation by her looks, but if she was with Sokka.  Then she was good, but her looks did make Notai jealous.  But, then again, Notai was aware that Sokka was married.  Though she secretly hoped that he would pick her as a wife canidate.  It was no secret among the tribe with the exception of Sokka, that Notai admired and crushed on Sokka.  When they were kids the two would hunt and fish together.  Being that she was older she was expected of certain tasks.  Eventually her father tried to make her get married to this guy named Tukki.  But, she turned him down and decided to approach Hakoda into making her into a hunter.  She succeeded on her first hunt and became a grand hunter in a very short while.  When the war came too far into the Tribe she went with the other hunters to join the war effort as a ship hand.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNotai said to Azula, \"Welcome, Fire Nation citizen to the Ice.  Could I ask what your visit pertains to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula instantly could read her like an open book.  She was jealous, and that suited Azula just fine.  Azula said to Notai, \"My <i>visit</i> as you call it will pertain to my marrying of your chief.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrows rose as Notai felt the ice break around her, how could this happen?  She loved the man that stood before her and felt heart broken when he proposed to Pinga.  But, as they say, if you really love them you'll let them slid on the ice and not stand in their way of happiness.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNotai then smiled as she said with near clenched teeth, \"Congratulations.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka then said to Notai, \"Report, Notai.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNotai then looked to her chief as she said to him as they walked, \"Master Water Bender Katara has left with Avatar Aang to Republic city to help quell the encroaching forces of the Earth Kingdom.  Traitors General Cow and General Jing of Omashu have joined the representive commandeering the Omashu navy fleet.  The soldiers that did not support his neutral jing during the black sun have also joined forces with the generals.  King Bumi has about a quarter of his army left and is sending messengers to small villages that hopefully will join in an effort against the wrongs of the world.  Pakku has neared the Northern Water Tribe hopefully to reason with the North on the manners of the blockade.  Lastly, we have received on the Western line of the blockade supply ships from the Fire Nation that wish to head to Whale Tail Island and Patola Mountain islands to deliver supplies to the smaller villages.  Also, the Fire Nation is currently dealing with the New Ozai order and some of the sailors say that the Fire Nation may not be sending too many supplies soon if the fighting gets worse.  Lastly, the party of four and I have trained multiple hunters in the efforts to becoming battle ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs Sokka satisfied with this report?

It had been six weeks in total since Yue was born. Sokka inside as he saw a smile on Pinga lips.

In the mean time I'm going to go hunting myself. I'll take a couple of hunters with me and Piandoa. We have to go visit the western artic village anyways. I'll be back for meal in a few days, I would like to eat some seal jerky if you bought some.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinga said to him with mirth, \"Now what kind of chief's wife would I be without buying your favorite wilderness meal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka said to her with deviance, \"A beauty and no brains kind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGasping Pinga lightly hit his side as he pulled back with a grin.

Sure it was kinda far away from Republic city, but not far away from Air Temple island.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka got off Appa as he checked the beast.  Being a hunter he knew a few things about animals.  Mainly, how to gut them or kill them more efficiently.  And that came in handy today as he looked at all the signs as Aang seemed worried.  Katara got down as she water bent herself a slide of ice and a patch of snow to fall in for safety.

But, how could I not have known what gender she was until now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSokka replied to him, \"Well first off, from what I understand in legend. All sky bison, male or female have horns.

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Remember in Avatar Day the Chin Villagers refused Water Tribe money?  Well this was inspired by that, from what we can see and read on the wikias the water tribe money is not accepted in the Eath Kingdoms or Fire Nation.  But, from what we can see and read that two previously mentioned currencies (EK and FN) can be exchanged with each other.  The only reason this could happen is if the SWT currency is different than the EK and FN currencies.  And seeing as in Book 1 before Korra we are told and showed that the SWT is on Ice with little to no natural resources other than bone, animal hide, seaweed, prunes and fish we can assume that they don't value precious metals as the others do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlot of the story: Sokka is the chief hunter of the Southern Water Tribe and is forced into a situation for his people.  To go to take up arms against those who invade the Tribe's waters. With the brutal massacre of his father and 39 other tribesmen a year before this story.  Sokka has to make the touh decision when a similar event happens of doing what his people desire.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInfo you will be needing:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://avatar.wikia.com/wiki/Currency#Water_Tribe\" target=\"_blank\">http://avatar.wikia.com/wiki/Currency#Water_Tribe</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://avatar.wikia.com/wiki/Currency#United_Republic_of_Nations\" target=\"_blank\">http://avatar.wikia.com/wiki/Currency#United_Republic_of_Nations</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Rules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Sokka will have to go to war against the Earth Kingdom ships that tread in his waters.  This is the will of the people and he is their servant as any good leader should be.  He is no tyrant and he had tried to be reasonable, but now he has to serve the people as is the role of every good leader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Sokka can have relationships with other females in the canon, but he is married to Pinga.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Sokka will eventually sign a treaty of peace thanks to global currency being introduced the global currency will solve the war and it will be the United Republic yuans.  Where all cultures can exchange their currency for Yuans and the United Republic must respect the culture currency and exchange yuans in exchange.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. No killing Sokka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. No making Sokka a merciless tyrant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. Add more than just a bit of choice to the chapter<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7. Keep in third person please.</td>",
