You were hanging out with your closest friend Claire Johnson she is very beautiful and you secretly have a crush on her. You two were watching world war z together because you both loved the movie and because there was nothing better on. Claire gets up from the couch and asks if you want something to drink you ask her if you could have a glass of water and she says no problem I'll be back in a flash. Then all of a sudden you start to feel strange you notice everything around you was getting bigger but you then realized that you were getting smaller. You had shrunk to the size of an ant and we're freaking out! You then hear thump,Thump,THUMP, it was Claire returning from the kitchen with your water she looks puzzled as she can't find you anywhere she then realizes that you might have gone to the bathroom and waits for you there in the living room on the couch. You then think to yourself how am I going to get her attention .</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You moan as the weight on your back shifts. It's unbearable feeling like ton upon ton pressing you down into the short-weave carpet. Pain wracks your tiny, ant-sized body as your best friend Claire idly moves her gigantic foot and wiggles her toes totally oblivious to the agony she's causing you as she continues to watch the movie that you had both been enjoying together just a short time ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel and hear your joints and bones popping as her foot moves again. New pain shoots through your body like you've never experienced before and you feel tears welling up in your eyes. You can't begin to even understand why you're still alive as the massive weight should had popped you like a grape (ages ago?). It seems like ages anyway, but you know it couldn't have been more than a few short minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking matters worse was the smell. Claire's feet were rank; the walk from her house was about a mile and it was hot out even so early in the morning. Summer had arrived with a vengeance and the temperature was probably pushing 90 degrees already. And she had worn her favorite shoes; those old white leather high-tops that she had had for years that she loved so much. They were soft and well-worn after miles of wear and tear, which was why she loved them so much, but they stank to high Heaven as she never seemed to wear socks. And now you were gasping for a breath of fresh air smelling the rank lingering odors of the old leather, stale sweat and whatever flowery-scented body wash she had used that morning and trying not to gag. You could only imagine that if there was really a Hell, this must be what it was like; hot, humid and reeking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have no idea why you were forced to endure this misery, or even how it had happened. One minute you were relaxing with your best friend and watching a movie and the next you were little more than a bug under her foot. It seemed impossible, but then you remembered the stories. They were just little News Bites on television shows like Inside Edition and the even less reputable 'Shock Shows' on cable, or an article in the tabloids you've seen at the supermarket checkout lines: People Shrinking! It was on the Internet as well; posts about government experimental gases and some weird new virus that was sweeping the globe and causing people to actually shrink. It was just so ridiculous, at least then. Now it was reality and you had apparently become a statistic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHHRGH!\" you scream as you feel the weight of Claire's foot increase a thousandfold! Your vision greys and you feel your blood pressure skyrocket as your body compresses. Blood rushes echoing in your ears and your head feels about to explode. Somewhere in the back of your mind you reason that Claire must be standing up for some reason but the agony of pain swiftly pushes that thought away as you yell for mercy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please! Claire... Stop!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd miraculously it does. Fresh air rolls over your body as you gasp for breath again trying to move. You feel the pain lessening, receding as your bones seems to 'Pop' out loud and your body molds back into shape. You sob with relief as the torture seems to be over, but you realize that it could return at any moment and try to move, gripping the carpet in desperate fists and dragging yourself away from the front of the couch where you had fallen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHOOM... THOOM... THOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up in wide-eyed panic as you see your best friend coming closer. You look up and up along her now gigantic body; her forever-long tanned legs disappearing into her raggedy denim shorts, her black Lycra, spaghetti strap tank top barely holding her now gargantuan breasts in check, her pretty, smiling face framed with a short mane of thick black hair and thin, wire-rimmed glasses making her dazzling green eyes twinkle all the more. You've had a crush on Claire for years, but now those feelings seem intensified as she is so huge and powerful... beautiful as a Goddess!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd deadly you realize as her huge bare foot slams down just inches in front of your tiny body...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scream again realizing just how close you had come to getting crushed frozen in panic as you were. Desperate you turn about fighting past the receding pain and claw your way across the carpet. You force yourself to your hands and knees as you hear Claire's feet so close and scramble for safety finally tucking and rolling underneath the sofa. You are gasping for breath as you look back at Claire's huge, bus-sized feet shifting there where you had just been lying seconds before. You stare in awe at their size, almost mesmerized by her pretty, pink toenail polish sparkling in the sunlight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen your heart clenches as you hear again the now familiar sound of footsteps somewhere off in the distance. The 'Thooming' seems far away at first, but getting closer and you look around frantically to see what's going on; your mind racing as panic wells up inside you again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Hi!\" You hear Claire's voice booming from somewhere high above but out of sight. It's loud but distant and happy you sense. Terror rises in you though as you hear a new voice echoing from still far away:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Claire! How are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groan again as you hear your sister Juli's voice, watching as her feet come into view from the hallway getting closer and bigger. You inch back deeper into the dim as terror grips you a little tighter; now two giant women that could easily step on you and snuff out your life without a thought or even realizing what they had done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you know deep down that things just got worse. Your younger sister loves you, you figure - maybe even idolized you when you were both growing up and she followed you everywhere. Now she's fifteen however and a budding young, rebellious woman, and towards you - a brat! For some reason over the last few years she had started to become annoying and annoyed at whatever you did. She would rat you out to your mother at the slightest chance and the least infraction hoping to get you punished somehow and thoroughly enjoying when you did. She would sit there grinning in the background as your mother berated you for anything from missing your curfew to not taking out the trash before the garbage truck came. She seemed to love getting you into trouble and humiliating you now and you have no idea why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch as she comes closer, her bare legs just visible from the calves down in your line of sight from under the couch; tanned and well-toned from her soccer over the years. You have to admit she's pretty with her long, blonde hair and budding figure; not quite come into her full beauty but still a heart-breaker. Her feet stop right in front of Claire's and you immediately smell the reek of the old ratty, black Tom's she's wearing as the two girls hug in greeting. Now there are four gargantuan feet to dodge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, where's my stupid brother?\" Juli asks as her feet shift as though she is looking about the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno,\" Claire answers before sitting back down on the sofa. You hear the springs inside squeal as the furniture creaks as Claire crosses her right leg over her left. You can just see her pretty, dangling foot as it bobs in and out of view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I went into the kitchen to get us something to drink and when I got back he was gone. I thought he was just in the bathroom, but NO...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Typical,\" Juli said as she flopped on the sofa. You wince as the couch moans with the added weight watching the back of her heels as she gets comfortable. \"He's such a loser!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, he's not,\" you hear Claire say in your defense. \"He's a nice guy, you just need to give him a chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile, nodding as you realize Claire understands. She is 18 like you are and knows that your sister is at that rebellious age and not liking authority of anyone older than she is. It doesn't make you feel any more safe, however as you watch their feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfft!\" Juli says with disdain. \"He's a jerk and probably headed off to his room to play his stupid X-Box! I dunno why you even give him the time of day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've been friends since grade school. You know that; Best friends. You'll realize eventually he's a good guy and you'll regret these times you're missing with him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I doubt that,\" Juli said with a snort. Her feet shift and you hear her drinking - probably your water. \"He's a jerk! If I ever get the chance you KNOW I'll put him in his place.\" You hear Claire sigh...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What-EVER!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bit of silence then as the girls focus on the television. You try to screw up your courage as you prepare to crawl out from under the sofa. You need help, you know. You need help to get rid of this 'shrinking curse', but you doubt very much that you'll get that aide from your bratty sister. You have to hope that you can somehow get Claire's attention; her help.You have to hope she sees you before Juli so you start to crawl forward towards her massive feet hoping you can make her see you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoping for the best...</span></div></div>",
