Sitting up and pushing off her covers, the green-haired girl, dressed only in a bra and panties, placed a lithe hand upon her flat stomach. She waited several seconds before it groaned again, as if it were crying out. She was hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hmm...' C.C. yawned, 'I guess I should have breakfast then...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLelouch had already left, persumably for some food, so C.C. was all alone in the bedroom.

The Black Knights seemed to be able to hold the fort themseleves and Lelouch thought it was best to give himself and C.C. some downtime.  The boy thought that his witch might enjoy the pizza ad a reward for all of her efforts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the sight of both Lelouch and the precious pizza, the green-haired girl rose from the bed into a seated position.  She gave a hungry look and motioned the boy to sit next to her. The boy understood and took the seat next to her.  He gave her the boxes and she set them aside from her.  She then turned to the boy and gave him a simple peck on his cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" was all the girl said ad she now focused on the pizza.  Lelouch slightly blushed at her kiss.  He was glad that he could make the girl happy.  Lelouch stood up and headed towards the door.  C.C. Was too distracted to notice, all of her attention was focused on her favorite meal.  She quickly open the pizza box and took a precious slice.  She shoved it into her mouth and gave a soft moan of pleasure.  The witch then reached for a new slice...</span></div></div>",

It took the pizza lover a good while to finish all of the pizza given to her by her partner.  The many pizza boxes certainly took a toll on the girl.  Due to the amount she ate, C.C. was very stuffed.  Her normaly flat stomach bulged a bit and was rock hard due to the how much she consumed.  The belly currently pushed against her top.  Her small hands were covered with trace remains of cheese and sauce.  She took both hands towards her mouth and licked the tasty scraps off, failing to realize the own mess around her mouth. She let out a small blech and layer back down onto Lelouch's bed.  She rubbed her stuffed tummy with one hand as she made herself comfortable and felt herself drifting into sweet sleep.  She was far too drowsy from her big feast.  As the green haired girl took to sleep, she thought of how nice it felt to be full... </span></div></div>",

As he passed the kitchen and into the hallway leading towards his room, the young man heard some strange noises eminating from the room.  Lelouch moved close enough to figure out what the sound was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-louch don't g-go...\" was what the black haired boy heared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What's going on in there?' though the geass user as he continued to eavesdrop.  He figured that the voice belonged to C.C.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-please!  I, I lo..\" shouted the girl from his room.  At the word, Lelouch decided that it was enough and entered the room. On his simple bed, he saw the girl he cared for, tossing and turning in her current sleep.  He had seen the discarded pizza boxes thrown across the room and he bed looked very messy with scraps.      He moved closer to his bed to check on the girl.  She looked like she had broken into a cold sweat and continued to mumble things in her sleep.  Deciding to save her from her silent torment, he gently shook her awake.  The girl jumped up at his touch, her heart beating rapidly due to her.  She quickly became confused and looked very fast.  Rather suddenly she spotted Lelouch and tears began forming in her bright eyes. Lelouch motioned closet to her and C.C. quickly hugged him and pulled him close.  A bit shocked at the embrace, Lelouch wrapped his arms around her quviering form.  He felt her nuzzle into his chest as she calmed down.  After she was comfortable she looked up at the boy with an embrassed look.  She had never acted like that to him.  Lelouch stared back and simply moved some stray green hairs from her blushing face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\". Lelouch asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I had a bad dream...\" nervously said C.C, looking away from the young man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want to talk about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...</span></div></div>",

However, after a whole year, Kallen had slipped into a state of boredom and laziness. As much as she hated to admit it, she had actually enjoyed a life of combat, and the adrenaline rush that came with it. She wanted to be able to fight again, if only for the sake of having something interesting to do. Unfortunately, there was no hope in that ever happening again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a half-hearted attempt to ease her boredom, Kallen began to eat more, most of it being high-calorie snacks like chips and cookies in particular. During the weekends she would spend hours lying on the couch, staring at the TV, all the while shoving handfuls of greasy potato chips down her gullet. Her boredom also resulted in laziness, and the only time she ever got any real exercise was during gym class. Because of these factors, the redhead had begun to grow a little flabby in the belly area. It was hardly visible, but there was a slight jiggle in the underside of Kallen's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...I've seen this crap already...\" Kallen grunted under her breath as she changed the channel for the tenth time in the last two minutes. Two family-size bags of potato chips and a case of oreo cookies laid empty on the floor, and she was currently digging her right hand through a third bag of chips. Crumbs and grease were splattered all over her face, which had recently grown more puffy. She just couldn't stop eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere didn't seem to be anything interesting on the TV, but Kallen still sat there watching.

She had never eaten so much at once before like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I know I'm stuffed,' she thought, rubbing her stomach, 'But I still feel peckish...I wonder why?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer boredom and desire for excitement was making her constantly hungry for food. Since eating this much wasn't helping her, it seemed that her only choice was to eat even more!</span></div></div>",

She decided to start on the selection of cheeseburgers stored within, tearing into them with a voracious hunger. Each burger was devoured fiercely, Kallen imagining she was a wild animal teairng into her prey. This helped satisfy her desire for action as well as her interest in eating.<br>\r\nShe finished off the cheeseburgers and attacked the potato chips next, eating at a swift pace. She felt an odd ecstasy at being able to eat so much, and loved every moment. The potato chips disappeared, followed by chocolate bars, party pies, candy and a few blocks of butter. Grease covered her clothes from where she had wiped her hands, and crumbs were all over her shirt, flabby face, steadily growing double chin and also growing bust.<br>\r\nFinally, the cupboard was bare, and Kallen sat back, a satisfied grin on her face. Her belly had long popped out of her clothes, pushing her shirt up to just below her breasts and popping her jeans, which had fallen off. Her underwear seemed to be under a bit of stress, but Kallen didn't mind at all. However, when she tried to move from her seated position on the ground, there was an issue.

There was a great fast food restaurant in town, renowned for its fatty foods... and it delivered, as well. Kallen shrugged and smiled, flipping up her mobile phone and dialling the number, trying as best she could with her flabby fingers.<br>\r\n\"Who needs to move around, anyway? It's so overrated\" she said as her call went through. She was salivating at the prospect of all the food she could order...<br>\r\nHalf an hour later, her massive delivery had arrived and she set about eating it all, with a ravenous joy. She barely seemed to have time to swallow, tearing through the burgers at an incredible rate. Each one was ripped apart, wolfed down and sent down to her heavily expanded stomach, adding steadily to the rolls of fat her body now carried. She crammed handfuls of fries into her mouth as fast as she could, wiping away the grease on her over-stretched underwear or, as her belly expanded to cover her panties, on her growing gut, giving it a shiny look. Pizza followed, each slice dripping with cheese and coated heavily in fatty meats. As she consumed each piece of junk food, Kallen's belly grew and grew. Her breasts had swelled to well beyond the size of a basketball, and she was growing a third and fourth chin. Kallen scoffed down her dessert of ice-cream, chocolate bars, candy and even a special treat made almost entirely from pure fat, designed to boost gaining.<br>\r\nFinally, it was all over. Kallen patter her belly and gave a small burp, then tried to stand up. It was no good - her body was far too heavy. The fat on her legs was beginning to cover her feet, and her belly stretched out quite a way, to the ends of her legs. Kallen was truly immobile, but she didn't seem finished yet.<br>\r\n\"Awwww... all that fat hasn't covered my feet yet\" Kallen observed. \"I want to be fatter... but maybe I ought to let this settle and see where it goes\".</span></div></div>",

It's been ages! Are you okay?\". A realization strikes Lelouch as he looks at Kallen, sitting by her desk. The girls continue to talk, but Lelouch pays no heed to them, now stuck in thought.. <i>Of course, I thought she looked familiar.</i> He sits down, quietly concentrated and assessing the situation. Having someone amongst the rebels that knows him personally is risky, even if she is mostly absent from school. If she recognized him, it would jeopardize all his plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLelouch's train of thought is broken, as Rivalz leans over to him. \"Watcha looking at, my dear Lelouch? Might you have a crush on her?\" He says jokingly. \"Just thinking this is a rare event, she hasn't been here since the term started.\" <i>No doubt busy partaking in guerrilla warfare</i>, he thinks to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Something needs to be done. I could use Geass, but what do I command her to do? Killing her is out of the question. What else could I command her to do? Can I ask her to back down, live a life separate from the rebels? How will the geass last? What happens when it's duration ends?</i> A lot of questions haunts Lelouch as the day passes at a snail's pace. These are not simple issues to deal with, certainly. But he cannot stand by and do nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLelouch spots Kallen outside, hiding behind a bush. A quick look-around reveals she hid from a bee. He walks over to her, not yet quite sure what to do. Kallen kills the bee with a quick hand strike, with impressive reflexes. Lelouch slows down, approaching silently. Kallen speaks as if to herself: \"..wish I didn't have to act like a freaking invalid!\". <i>It had to be her!</i> She turns to him, her sandwich held in her mouth. In that moment, Lelouch thinks of a solution. <i>Force her to leave the rebels, and test the limitations of my geass. She is the perfect candidate!</i> \"C-can I help you?\" she looks visibly frustrated, and her expression even reveals a hint of fear. Lelouch smiles with confidence. \"Yes.\" He activates Geass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kallen Stadtfield...\"</span></div></div>",

Just like he expected she is snacking on a chocolate bar, doing her best to be discrete. He smirks, content that his original orders are being adhered to. He has made a pretty solid assumption on how his geass works, and he has set in motion a plan in order to convince Kallen that the mention of Shinjuku was completely coincidental. Everything is going according to plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class ends, and the pupils disperse. Most leave to attend other matters, though some linger in the classroom to converse casually. Lelouch walks over to Kallen. \"Could you come with me, please? I'd like to talk to you.\" Kallen stands up, and to the amazement of some of her peers responds; \"Yes.. I was expecting you'd ask me to\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey head to the student council club house. And though Lelouch does his best to make the conversation sound lighthearted, like there's no hidden agenda behind his behavior, Kallen still eyes him with suspicion. \"So we won't be disturbed here?\" She asks. \"Excactly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There it is! Found it! This is it, right?\" Shirley's voice is heard from above, her voice being carried seemingly from the top of the stairs. <i>As if on que</i>, Lelouch thinks to himself. Kallen looks around, then at Lelouch, surprised that the studint council arrives. Lelouch acts the same way. Kallen is completely unaware, that this is all a part of a carefully thought-out plan. Then Milly Ashford, the head of the student council enters. In front of her, is a vast amount of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm.. what is all of this?\" Asks Lelouch, even though he already knows the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't you bring her here because you knew? It's because we are letting Kallen into the student council.\" .. \"My grandfather asked us to.\" She concludes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe student council all introduce themselves. Rivalz, Shirley, Nina, Milly and even Nunally, Lelouch's sister. Kallen eyes the food infront of her with a strange hunger, though nobody seems to take notice. They all sit down to dine together, and the student council are all welcoming to Kallen, who is clearly taken back by all of this. <i>Now, let's see just how far geass allows you to push yourself.</i> Lelouch smiles at Kallen, but turns to Milly to compliment her on the food. He would of course not want to raise suspicion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all eat their fill, but only Lelouch notices the absurd amount of food that Kallen is able to consume. Eating at a steady pace, she barely finds time to talk, and she keeps eating long after everyone else has had their fill. Her expression reveals that it's now painful for her to continue eating. <i>But geass will not let you stop, just yet!</i> Lelouch supresses a grin as Kallen devours another plate filled with pasta, barely taking the time to wipe the sauce off her chin using her sleeve. But she doesn't stop yet, she can't stop yet. She pours the last of the pasta on her plate. \"Wow, you were really hungry, huh?\" Says Milly in a friendly voice. Kallen looks shocked, as if just realizing what she is doing. \"Uhm, I guess so. And it seemed a waste to leave this delicious food uneaten\". \"Thanks, I'm glad you liked it!\" Milly responds joyfully. The council shares more laughs and stories as Kallen finishes her last plate, finally being allowed to rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Impressive, she managed to eat it all. She looks uncomfortable, though, she must be near her limit. I'm surprised if she's even able to move after that, or if the student uniform still fits her.</i> Lelouch catches himself staring at Kallen, fortunately before anybody else did. He pondered for a second if he was actually a bit enticed by the view, but quickly discarded such thoughts, as rivalz brings forth a bottle of champagne he had hidden away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This calls for a celebration!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Campagne?\" Shirley asks reluctantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina follows up. \"Student council members can't drink!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, loosen up, you guys!\" Rivalz starts removing the cork, but is abruptly interrupted by shirley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're not allowed to drink that!\" She graps the bottle, trying to force it out of Rivalz' grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe twists it out of her grip. \"Lelouch, catch!\" the bottle flies through the air, and Lelouch barely manage to catch it. But <i>accidentally</i> the cork falls out, and Kallen is soaked in the alchoholic beverage. <i>Just as planned.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unsuspecting redhead can do little but sigh, as the champagne seeps through her clothes. She tries to get up, but finds that the table is now blocking her abnormally large gut. <i>Oh my, did I really eat that much?!</i> She thinks to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry!\" Exclaims shirley as she readjusts herself on the chair. \"We'll wash your clothes and give a new set right away!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKallen rubbed her pathetically overstuffed belly. She sighed, as this meant she had to get out of her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKallen hurries to the showers, shirley and milly go to wash her clothes, and Lelouch to bring her a new set of clothes in the meantime. Kallen ponders what just happened to herself. <i>That guy from shinjutsu, can it really be him? And how could I let myself eat that much. This is so emberassing..</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomebody knocks on the door. \"Who is it!\"<br>\r\n\"Lelouch, I brought you-..\"</span></div></div>",

She witnessed the dark-haired boy easilly making the other girl blush. Shirley was able to recognize the other girl due to her size.  Unlike all off the other girls from the school, she was fairly fat.  The other girl had long black hair with beautiful light skin.  She had a round face with a hint of a double chin that just made her look adorable.  Her belly was large and soft and caused her buttoned uniform top to become strained against the softness. Her breasts which were large and soft, rested quite nicely onto her belly.  The girl's skirt was pretty small for someone of her size.  The material strained against her wide and plump hips and thighs.  The girl's plump bum would often cause her short skirt to ride up and reveal her tight stripped panties.  Shirley recalled the girl's blue eyes go in shock as Lelouch hugged her goodbye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, did I lose Lelouch...\" sadly said girl to herself.  Currently she was in the student council room sitting by the table with her head down due to her dejected mood. She didn't even notice her president enter the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, Shirley?  What seems to be the problem?\" asked Milly, seeing that it was obvious that her friend was having troubles.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Lelouch...\" said the girl, her voice having a depressed tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, is it about that heavier girl?\" asked the blond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you know?!\" exclaimed the girl ad she raised get head to look at her friend.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I just heard rumors, but I've never seen the girl.\" stated Milly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you haven't lost yet!  You only have 1 person as competition now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what?\" nervously asked Shirley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We now have proof of the type of women that boy likes.  Use that to your advantage.\" simply said Milly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean fatter girls?\" warily asked Shirley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.  Why do yo think he never showed intrest in the girls here until that girl showed up?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-it does make sense...\" said the girl, feeling a bit shocked at the new information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So all we need to do is fatten you up a bit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, what if he doesn't chooser in the end.  I'll be fat and still end up with a broken heart.\" sadly said Shirley, hanging her head down in sadness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just a chance you need to take.  That's what love is right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.  I'll do it!\" exclamied the girl with raw determination.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, let's go then.  I know the perfect place!\" stated Milly, becoming more and more excited by the situation.  She grabbed Shirley's hand and rushed out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait where are we going?!\" yelled the orange haired-girl as she was dragged through the school hallways.<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

Milly than got into the line and handed Shirley a huge tray \"Here hold this while I dump food on it.\" Milly said as she grabbed large amounts of bacon. Milly than grabbed donuts, and pastries \"Here this will go straight to your ass.\" Then Shirley's tray was weighted down with pizza, burgers, and chicken wings. \"You'll be busting out of those clothes in no time Shirley.\" Milly than shoveled mashed potatoes on the tray. \"You'll pop a few buttons with this\" Now at the ice cream part of the line Milly scooped an enormous amount of ice cream onto Shirley's tray \"Good luck finding a bra that fits after this. tee hee.\" Shirley's arms could barely hold the massive amount of food on her tray \"Milly please I can't hold this any longer.\" Shirley begged. \"Okay you'll start eating, besides we can always get back in line.\" said Milly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls sat down and Shirley just stared at the massive amount of food in front of her. \"Whew well here I go\" Shirley said as she meekly took a small bite out of a piece of bacon. \"No not like that, like this.\"Milly said as she grabbed a whole burger and shoved it down Shirley's throat. \"If you want Lelouch you're going to have to get fat and if you're gonna get fat you're gonna have to really pig out and not take danty little bites. Now open up\" Milly said pressing a donut to Shirley's face. Milly kept feeding Shirley loads of food, fattening her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple hours later a fat Shirley waddled out of the buffet restaurant. \"Oh god I feel huge\" Shirley said. \"You are huge just see for yourself.\" Milly said pointing to her reflection in the window. Shirley was shocked at what she saw \"O my god.\" Shirly said as she lifted her arms to see fat hanging off once boney arms. Her shirt was now torn open exposing her fat belly. She also saw a huge size increase in her breasts which now poured out of her helpless bra. I better get Lelouch with all this fat!\" Shirley said rubbing her belly. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lelouch Lamperouge (really, Lelouch vi Britannia- wasn't that more fitting now?) sat at his desk in his room in the Student Council Club House at Ashford Academy.  He sat with his hands on the empty wood, palms turned up, staring at them, not quite believing they were real.  They still looked like his old hands, the hands that wrote the answers to tests and moved chess pieces across the board and tucked his sister Nunally in at night.  They weren't his old hands, though- not really, not any more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow they were the hands of a murderer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Killer</i>, he forcefully corrected himself.  <i>Clovis' death was justified after what he did.  He was butchering those Japanese!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that wasn't why Lelouch had killed him, was it?  Lelouch hadn't killed his older half-brother, the now late Governor-General of Area 11, to avenge the slaughtered Japanese of the Shinjuku ghetto.  Clovis la Britannia had died because he'd been part of the vicious and wicked apparatus that was the Holy Britannian Empire, the apparatus that had killed his mother and crippled his sister.  Lelouch had killed Clovis because he hated Clovis and all the rest of his relations in the Britannian royalty- his father, the Emperor, most of all.  It had been an act of his own vengeance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>And it wouldn't have been possible without this power...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strange power that green-haired girl had given him as she lay dying at his feet.  The 'Power of the King,' she'd called it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith it, he could give anyone any order and they would obey it without question, without hesitation.  There appeared to be some limitations- he couldn't use it more than once on a person, and he had to make direct eye contact for it to take effect; there were probably more that he hadn't yet discovered.  Even so restricted, the power he now possessed was frightening and exhilarating.  He'd gotten a taste of what it promised in the ghetto- the ability to seize control of vital resources and information, to put into his hands the tools he had longed to use.  Now the revenge he had dreamed of could be realized; he could at last pay out the wages of his long hatred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe glanced across the room, to his bed.  The standard issue military sidearm was there, the one he had taken from the woman whose Knightmare Frame he had commandeered.  His violet eyes sharpened on it.  That was the pistol he had used to kill Clovis- the first death by his hand.  He would not be the last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLelouch put his palm against his pale forehead, his long, delicate fingers running through his unruly mop of black hair.  Just remembering what he'd gone through in the past twelve hours wore him out.  He loved to have his mind challenged, normally; it was an almost erotic thrill for events to pull his brain in many directions at once, to apply himself to multiple problems simultaneously and tackle them all with skill.  This new business was weighty, though.  It was more than anything he could have prepared himself for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere came a knock upon his door.  \"Lelouch?  Nunally said you were in here!  Hellooooo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLelouch whirled around in his chair, surprise and annoyance spiking at the voice.  It was Milly Ashford, granddaughter of the Academy's master, President of the Student Council- of which Lelouch was Vice President, a position he had been granted by Milly herself.  \"Oh, hullo President.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tch, don't be so formal, Vice President!  People will think we're having a spat!\"  She tried to open his door.  \"C'mon, Lulu, open up!  We missed you at the meeting today!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... I got stuck in all the mess around Shinjuku.  Didn't Rivalz tell you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was hours ago, Lulu!  You could have let us know you were all right; Shirley was worried sick!\"  She tried his door again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm fine, so there's no need to bother with me,\" Lelouch said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I'm <i>really</i> going to have to come in,\" Milly said.  She tried his door one more time.  \"I mean it, Lelouch, I'm coming in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course she was.  Milly had managed to convince her grandfather to give her one of the school's master keys; Lelouch's lip curled at the thought of her barging in-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The gun!</i>  His heart nearly stopped.  The gun was lying right on his bed!  The lock turned even as he began to panic; there was no time to hide it!  He wondered if he could convince Milly not to report it.  No- not with something as serious as a gun.  Milly allowed him many liberties, but she would not overlook a firearm on school grounds, certainly not in the hands of a student.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doorknob turned.  The door opened.  He had to do something quick!</span></div></div>",

Her wavy blond hair flew around her shoulders at her dramatic movements; her bright blue eyes practically sparkled.  She was a few inches taller than Lelouch.  \"Now, Lulu, you're wanted in court!  Come leap to your defense!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLelouch almost bounced across the room; in one long step he was standing at the doorway, blocking Milly's view inside.  She tried to sidle past him, but he moved with her, keeping her from getting by.  \"I'm sorry for missing the meeting,\" he said quickly, putting on what he hoped was a disarming smile.  \"Now I've got a migraine, so-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lulu, you never get migraines!  Come on, what's going on in here?\" Milly asked.  She gave him a saucy wink.  \"Were you pleasuring yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha- No!  No, for heaven's sake, no!\" Lelouch was so shocked by the insinuation that he drew back in horror, his face flushing scarlet.  It gave Milly enough room to slide past him, her considerable bosom brushing against his chest as she entered.  Lelouch knew he was doomed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Unless...</i>  He really hated to do it.  He liked Milly quite a bit, and had hoped to keep her and the rest of his friends at the Academy out of his plans.  Besides, he didn't think it was a good idea to go around wasting his power on trivial matters.  But this was life and death- he couldn't let her discover what he'd been up to!  That decided it.  \"Milly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had just been about to turn toward his bed; now she looked back at him.  \"Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLelouch looked her in the eyes.  His left pupil shimmered; in it there flashed a wing-shaped sigil, gleaming red.  <i>Now, what shall I send her off with?  It can't be anything she could take dangerously.  I don't want her to act suspiciously.  Ah!</i>  Smiling, he spoke fateful words: \"Go eat something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMilly's pupils grew large, and faintly glowing rings of red shone around them.  She smiled a small, placid smile, and nodded.  \"All right,\" she said gently.  She pivoted toward the door; Lelouch stepped out of her way, and she walked out of his room without a backward glance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLelouch waited until he heard the door to his and Nunally's rooms close.  He closed the door to his room and locked it again.  Then he sat down on his bed, cradling his head in his hand.  \"Whew!\" he breathed.  \"That was too close.\"  He immediately set about hiding the gun, as well as finding a better hiding place for the soldier's armor he had stolen during the battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMilly, meanwhile, strode purposefully across the upper floor of the Club House, humming gently as she went.  She wasn't quite sure why, but all of a sudden her appetite was raging fiercely.  She had only eaten lunch a few hours ago, but now she felt hungry enough to down a five-course meal!  She walked down the grand staircase and made her way out to the grounds.  Food, food, food, she <b>needed</b> food.  But where to get it?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Milly strode resolutely across the grounds of Ashford Academy; the Geass placed on her had filled her with firm purpose.  She was going to have something to eat.  <i>What shall I have, though?  Ooo, there's so much to choose from!</i>  She could get something from the vending machines, or she could peruse the items being served today for lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she recalled the lavish dinner her family had had the past Sunday.  She knew there was some left.  Milly thought greedily of the beef tenderloin with its marinade and accompanying mustard sauce.  That would hit the spot!  She cut across a field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving at her family's home within the Academy's grounds, Milly burst through the double doors and hurried through the entrance hall; into the sitting room, through the dining room with its long table, she finally reached the kitchen.  She was practically drooling by this point.  The girl's blue eyes bulged when they lit upon the ice box.  Sliding it open, Milly sifted among wrapped raw meats and bagged produce until she found the shelf where the tenderloin still sat, whittled down to one quarter of its original size.  She took out the platter; diving back in, she retrieved the scalloped potatoes and the green beans that had gone with the meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMilly was licking her lips by the time she had removed the meat's cellophane cover.  She ladled the remainder of the potatoes and the green beans onto the empty portion of the platter and popped the ensemble into the light oven.  Humming gently under her breath, she slid open the wine pantry as her food cooked, looking up and down the stacked bottles until she found the delicious Cabernet they'd drank at that lunch.  She pulled it out, popped the cork, and was just pouring herself a glass as the timer for the oven went off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill humming, Milly carried the large plate out to the dining room, setting it at the head of the table.  She went back to the kitchen for the wine and some silverware.  She sat down and rubbed her hands together; it smelled as good as it had on Sunday!  She was just picking up her fork, when she stopped, feeling she'd forgotten something.  <i>Ah!</i> she snapped her fingers.  <i>The mustard!</i>  She quickly returned to the kitchen, and after a few minutes of rooting, produced the small boat with the brown-yellow sauce inside.  Milly returned to the table shaking with excitement.  The Geass was pressing hard upon her mind, nearly driving her into a frenzy to start eating.  She poured the mustard all over the tenderloin, cut a bite, and began!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm, delishush!\" she said with her mouth full.  It was so good!  Somehow even better than it had been when it was fresh!  She tried to savor every bite, but she was ravenous, so she ate quickly.  Nevertheless, there was a lot of meat.  So she ate, and ate, and ate, with some drinking at the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little more than an hour later, Milly was soaking the last bite of tenderloin in the last of the mustard sauce.  With a contented smile she stuck her fork in her mouth, chewed slowly, reverently, and swallowed.  The last bit of potatoes went down right after, and then a final gulp of wine.  She leaned back in her chair.  \"Ahhh... Urp!\" she belched softly, covering her mouth as she did.  She had eaten the entirety of the remaining food.  Her stomach was so full she thought she might burst, but it had been <i>so</i> good.  She'd eaten so much her school skirt felt tight around her swollen middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompletely full, indeed, stuffed to the gills, Milly had finally fulfilled Lelouch's command.  The glowing red rims around her pupils vanished, and the slight alteration of her mind reverted to normal.  Wiping her mouth with a napkin, Milly surveyed the empty platter with a little puzzlement.  What had come over her?  It wasn't normally like her to eat between meals, certainly not to the extent of eating more than she would at lunch or dinner.  \"Oh, well,\" she shrugged, \"it <i>was</i> good.\"  She yawned.  \"Ooof!  I think I need to go digest...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRising from her chair, Milly cradled her swollen stomach tenderly as she made her way through the house, up the stairs to the second floor.  Coming to her room, she gently set herself back on her bed, not even bothering to take off her shoes.  She yawned again, rolled over on her side, and was soon asleep.</span></div></div>",

The geass command had severly affected her desires.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more minutes, she finally entered the school lunch room.  Due to it being close to noon, the room was packed with various students, eating food and talking amongst themselves.  She quicky did a scan of the room and failed to spot any of her close friends.  Shrugging, she simply went to the start of the line and began to pile on food on to her plate.  Due to it being a very prestigious acadamy, Ashford had a very extravagant menu.  Milley added various meats and breads to her growing entree.  She couldn't understand why she was getting so much.  She felt as if a voice was just telling her to eat and eat.

She really didn't expect Milley to still be in school.  At this time, she would usually be in the student council office planning various plots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, you seem to be eating well.\" said the other girl in a slightly teasing tone.  At her remark, Nina's face went slightly red.  What the blond girl didn't notice was that Nina's face seemed slightly rounder with a small hint of a double chin.  Under the table hid a small potbelly that strained the lower buttons of her yellow uniform blouse.  The girl had softer hips and thighs that caused the hem of her skirt to ride up her rounder bum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I could say the same about you.\" stated the other girl as she pointed towards the blonde's heavy tray of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, you got me there.\" laughed Milley as she dug into her meal.  Silenece fell between them as both girls simply concentrated on eating.  After 20 minutes time, both had consumed their meals.  The girls were stuffed to the brims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, I can't believe I ate all of that...\" groaned Milley as she rubbed her slightly distented belly.  Nina was in the same condition, except that she was nursing a larger belly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, it was really good too.\" said Nina with a soft smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like this isn't the first time you've stuffed yourself.  Am I right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-um...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it looks like you're putting on some weight too.  What's going on?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right.  I'll tell you.\" warily said Nina.  She was worried that her friend would find her reasons for getting fat wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMilley could see how uncomfortable the other girl was.  She felt a bit guilty for putting her into the spotlight like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay Nina.  Please, just tell me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, well there's this boy.  I really care for him and I found out that he prefers larger girls.  So I thought I'd have a better chance if I plumped up a bit.\" said the girl with a rather large blush adorning her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so it's some boy trouble.  My,my I've never thought I'd the day where you would actually fall for a boy.\" teased Milley.  She found the whole thing adorable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-don't tease me!  I'm serious.  I-I really like h-him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay I'm sorry.  Well, how are we gonna plan this? asked the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, what do you mean?\" cautiously asked Nina.  She didn't like that glint in the other girl's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fattening you up of course!\"</span></div></div>",
