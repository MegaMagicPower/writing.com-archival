Fox was the first to notice when he saw Krystal go look for fire wood.  When she left, Fox notice that her butt had gotten a little bigger and jiggled a little with every step she took.  Also her thighs were almost touching each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm Krystal looking bigger lately.\"thought Fox.\"As a matter of fact,so am I.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox had also been putting on weight recently.  His stomach hung over his pants now and his belt fit tightly around him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think i should tell Krystal about this when she gets back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about a half an hour, Fox saw Krystal come back with some fire wood.  When the fire was lit, Fox struck up a conversation about his recent weight gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Krystal, do you think that I'm getting fat?\"asked Fox<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What no of course not.\"reassured Krystal, even though Fox already knew the answer to his question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at me Krystal I've been getting bigger ever since we landed here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's insane. I mean its not like im getting fatter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh Krystal have you looked at yourself recently.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Fox said this, Krystal realized that she really hadn't looked at herself.  When she looked down at her stomach she was shocked to she a little gut haning over her skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right Fox I have gotten fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you're not fat your just a little bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just look at me Fox, my belly is haning over my skirt.  My thighs are almost touching each other and my ass jiggles with every step I take.  Face it we're both getting fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Well Krystal i think that this planets atmosphere has something to do wiht our recent weight gain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think we should do.\"Krystal asked <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm....</span></div></div>",

This one looks almost new.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right,\" Fox said, \"it doesn't make any sense. Apparently someone else was here, but we don't really know where they could be, or what happened to them. Still, we need to look for a clue or two before we go back to our camp, as long as we're careful we should be fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them approached the ship, surprised when its door opened without any problems. Slowly and carefully, they entered, being sure to watch every possible corner they'd run into. But only a few empty halls met them. The first step they took was to enter the cockpit to check for signs of life, only to find none. Instead, all around the ship were what appeared to be the possessions of whoever had landed the ship. There were a few shirts and pairs of pants, with a few of them reduced to torn rages, as well as an identification card from a shipping company. The previous owner of the ship had been a young delivery jackal, red-furred and grinning in his company ID. There was also a pull-out cot - when Fox and Krystal pulled it out, it appeared broken - and there was a hat left behind on the driver's seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox lifted it to sit down and study the ship when he was surprised to find a video recorder hidden under the hat. Intrigued, he called Krystal over, and they watched its contents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt appeared that the jackal was a fan of video logs, and had been recording them for a while on the recorder. He mostly mentioned his new job shipping large orders across the galaxy and how happy he was to land the job. A few listings later, the jackal did a longer recording, noting that he had run out of gas before reaching his destination. To make matters worse, he was stuck there for two months before his company could send out a retrieval crew. To his relief, his company said the planet was nearly harmless based on their recon, so he'd just be able to hang out in the ship. He mentioned that in situations like this, the shipping company always included a freezer full of six months' rations on each ship they flew, plus he'd have access to any food-based shipments should those become compromised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the course of the next log, the jackal talked about his boredom - he mostly spent each day playing video games or watching videos in the ship's employee brig. He also consistently mentioned food, each video mentioning his appetite growing with more time spent on the ship. About two weeks in, he had started eating two meals' worth at dinner, then about a month in, he had upped his eating to two rations per meal. He mentioned that he had looked in a few shipping containers and wasn't worried about running out of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the videos went on, the jackal slowly but surely gained weight. In the first couple weeks, it wasn't too bad, but from there on it was off to the races. In two weeks he gained 25 pounds, then gradually saw the following weeks see more explosive growth. By the end of the first month he had gained 75 pounds, his uniform barely fitting. Another week later, he had grown another 25 pounds and had given up on clothing that fit, content to lounge around in boxers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the video jumped ahead to the end of the second month, and the subject of the videos changed to a tiger wearing a protective suit. He explained that the shipping company had discovered an airborne pathogen on the planet, one that slowly but surely would make an occupant's weight rise no matter what they ate and even more if they ate a lot. To prove his point, he pointed the camera at the jackal, who had gained nearly 300 pounds since last video. Pushing 500 pounds, the tiger and two other workers had to lure the jackal out of the ship with food - he barely fit - and then quarantine him once they left the planet's atmosphere for a week. The ship had been left behind as it would have been too worrisome that the contagion would spread. Before he signed off, the tiger noted that he was impressed the jackal had finished all six months' worth of rations, but noted he was surprised that he hadn't even really started on the cargo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that means one thing: we need Falco and the guys to get us as soon as possible,\" Krystal said. \"Did they ever respond to our distress signal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox checked his messages for the first time in a day only to see Star Fox's report back. It would take at least six weeks for them to make it to the planet, Falco had said, and it was looking more like two months if the planet's orbit was as fast as they expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not good,\" Krystal said. \"So... we're pretty much stuck here getting fatter and hungrier for the next few months. Great. What do we do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" Fox said. \"We can see if there's anything else useful on this ship, head back to camp or see if we can find a way to get away from the pathogen.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"We should probably see if the shipping company stocks these ships with anything else useful,\" Krystal said, \"now that we know it's abandoned and not dangerous. They might have left some good stuff here that would be used to protect employees.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer instincts were right, they found, as the company seemed to care about its employees. In short order, they managed to grab flashlights, some tarps to keep them dry if necessary, and a set of tools they could use to try to fix their ships, even though it was a big issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last place they looked ended up being the cargo brig. There might have been something else useful in there, and they still didn't exactly know what the mysterious cargo was. What Fox and Krystal found surprised them - it appeared to be an entire convenience store's worth of junk food, likely to help stock a new store being built on a new planet. Everything the average place would have was in stock, sodas and candies and chips and snack foods galore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn't exactly a good discovery, the two noted. By now they'd surely been infected with the planet's pathogen, and the call of the junk food might help contribute to some extra poundage. At the same time, they could preserve their rations for a much longer period if they used discretion or moderation. Then again, the jackal's growing appetite kicked in quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo make matters worse, the two hadn't eaten all day, and they were legitimately hungry, which was making the prospect of having a few snacks much more attractive... but they had to be careful.</span></div></div>",

I mean, a soda and a candy bar isn't that bad for you, right?\" \"Not really,\" Krystal replied, \"and we don't even have to go back to base for a while. The planet's not dangerous and we can always rest here until tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was enough to convince the foxes to each grab food. Fox grabbed an orange soda and a regular chocolate bar, while Krystal was content with a soda and some gummi bears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor about two minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs good as the junk food was, it wasn't quite satisfying for either Krystal or Fox, and they both surveyed the cargo bay. There were dozens of large crates stacked four-high in the brig, each one holding hundreds of snacks. \"One more?\", Krystal asked Fox. \"...I think so,\" Fox replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir hunger got the best of them, and one candy bar turned into two, then turned into four. Krystal grabbed a few brownies out of another box, while Fox found a freezer box stuffed with ice cream bars. He took a few to reward himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFifteen minutes later, both foxes were moaning, their bellies both full of pure sugar, each one having eaten more than their fair share of snacks. They thought about walking back to base but barely made it to the collapsed bed, both of them falling asleep instantly after hitting the pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, the two awoke to see each other... slightly bigger than before. Krystal's slight gain was a tid bit more apparent around her belly, while Fox's stomach hung out just a fraction further off his belt.</span></div></div>",

They had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, they spent the day lounging on the ship, playing the jackal's video games, watching TV and relaxing for the first time in a while. A fully tricked out ship that they could take refuge in, not having to worry about anything? It sounded like heaven, and felt like it too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, each day they dipped back into the cargo bay three or four times, taking a few snacks each time. The amounts were slowly growing, too - they avoided flat-out binges like they'd done the first day, but were still eating more than they should. Breakfast was a few donuts, lunch a few frozen burritos, dinner a few bags of candy. Combined with the contagion, they were growing pretty quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn their first week, Fox and Krystal had gained maybe just 5 pounds, but in the first week on the ship, those numbers jumped dramatically. They were steadily putting on nearly two pounds per day, and by the end of the that week, they had each gained twenty pounds. Fox's jacket was starting to ride up on him slightly, his shirts now giving away his slowly-rising paunch. Krystal, meanwhile, saw her pants take most of the burden - her butt had been steadily growing, to the point where putting on her clothes (when they returned to the camp every few days for a checkup) was becoming difficult. Luckily, they had found extra outfits from the shipping company, simple black t-shirts and sweatpants that were a few sizes bigger than they were used to.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was maybe four days later that Fox had woken up and looked at Krystal, still sleeping, when he made a sudden realization. She had always been beautiful, but Fox had loved cuddling with her at night now more than ever. He then looked himself over in the mirror. With a good extra 25 pounds on his frame, the fox looked at ease. The stress of bounty hunting had always been difficult for him, and now he felt happier than ever. Krystal looked good with her extra weight, too. They both managed to carry it well, with equal distribution all over their bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took another few days for Fox to muster up the courage to ask Krystal how she felt about the changes they were going through, only to be happily surprised when she mentioned she wasn't exactly unhappy with the change. She thought he had gotten a little cuter now with a little extra definition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this, Fox was ecstatic. The pathogen had affected his thinking a little, but really, he was driven by making Krystal happy. If his blue fox thought he was cute with a few extra pounds, well, he'd work on making her even happier, he thought. So he started upping his diet. After they'd go to bed, he'd get up in the night to use the bathroom, but take a pit stop at the cargo bay, scarfing down half a dozen candy bars before returning to bed. He'd tell her she could have the TV for an hour while he went for a walk, then grab a few sodas and some ice cream to eat while he was out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of the couple's first month on the new planet, Krystal was a good 50 pounds heavier, but Fox had taken his weight gain to heart, tacking on 75. Where her belly had expanded half a foot, his was much bigger; where she had gained a double chin, he was working on a triple</span></div></div>",

Falco had mentioned that the orbits were acting screwy, and he might need to take an extra week to get there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two foxes were fine with that, at least mentally. The air had finally affected their thoughts, and neither one minded being so big and found themselves enjoying the junk food a little more every day. Of course, their enjoyment was not their figures, and every day left a few more pounds on their bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the planet had affected Krystal relatively normally, in that her appetite was only growing a little each day, Fox's daily extra snacks had not only had a bigger toll on his body, it was making his appetite grow too. Whenever he stopped to grab something to eat, he was grabbing almost twice as much as Krystal. He didn't notice, either - in fact, he still thought he needed to eat more for Krystal, too, so he was plowing through even more food. Breakfast would be a dozen donuts, with two ice cream snacks before lunch, which was an entire bag of chips and a two-liter of soda. Two milkshakes, then chocolate for dinner and some snack cakes for dessert followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next few weeks, both gained even more weight, but where Krystal had just fully reached obesity, Fox was plowing into it.</span></div></div>",

Krystal had resigned herself to her fate long ago, and still regularly checked her weight to see exactly what effects were happening to her. After the fifth week, she was up by about 120 pounds, happy with her junk food feasts but still making sure she'd be able to remain mobile and be able to eventually get rid of the weight, or at least make sure she'd be able to live with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven then, Krystal had become lazy enough to just cuddle or spoon with Fox whenever possible, and she hadn't given a thought to his weight gain, assuming they were at relatively equal levels. He was out of shape compared to her from the beginning, so of course he's get bigger no matter what. One day though, watching Fox get up from the TV room and use the bathroom, she realized how much bigger he had really become. His wide stomach also had began to drop down from his waist, while his arms had tripled in size and this legs were massive pillars. Even his face had become larger-than-life, resting massive cheeks on three and a half chins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal managed to weight Fox later that day, luring him to the ship's scale with a bag of chips. Just as she had suspected - he was nearly 200 pounds bigger already. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal was offended by this for two reasons. She didn't want to be the only person mobile after they got rescued, and it was also unfair that she didn't get to join in his blubbery joy.

After more than a month, the two had barely exhausted a quarter of the total shipment of food, and no matter what they'd do, they didn't need to worry about running out anytime soon. Feeling jealous of her obese boyfriend, Krystal vowed to stop fighting her hunger and let herself go. Besides, with a month left until rescue, what's the worst that could happen? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer plan started the next day. She'd ask Fox for alone time and then grab as many candy bars she could hold, stuffing herself silly. She did this whenever she could - between meals and especially at night - and was able to do it on average four times per day. Sometimes she'd manage to spend hours a day eating, enjoying her soon-to-come comeback on her fat boyfriend. Though it often meant a sore and distended belly, she didn't stop going. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn just a week, Krystal found that her weight was skyrocketing. The first day she'd gained six pounds - the next, seven. These averages held and at some points rose - one day she managed ten pounds. Meanwhile, Fox was still growing, but hasn't progressed past five pounds per day. This meant he was still packing on significant weight, but Krystal's belly, then the rest of her, were quickly catching up. In just a week Krystal climbed 50 pounds while Fox gained just 20.

More to the point, they were both massive, their huge bellies both slouched toward the ground, while the rest of their features - literally their very outlines - had become several times more plump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was this point where both realized their gaining had simply made the other more happy. In the bedroom and in everyday life, both Fox and Krystal were ten times as pleased with the gaining life as they had been in their own lives. Nearly half of their days were spent eating or recovering from eating now, though neither one really felt any remorse, nor had they dented the convenience store too much - it still stood with 50 to 60 percent of its stock remaining. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the two massive foxes decided to ask each other about the gain, they both already knew they both still loved it. This led them to a new compromise - they'd declare the winner, and better partner, whoever was bigger when Falco arrived. What this meant? They were going to move into the cargo bay. The first one to leave for any reason would be the loser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey dragged the TV inside and got to work. With massive appetites and no distractions, both Fox and Krystal were able to lose themselves in eating, nonstop, for hours on end. When necessary, they'd pass out for temporary food comas, but for the better part of two days, all they did was eat. Finally, they both have up and went to use the bathroom at the same time, declaring a draw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Falco managed to land on the planet, following their tracks and finding them in the cargo bay.

Seven and a half weeks of space travel, seven and a half weeks he could have spent on vacation, all ruined because the damn ships had to crash-land. Falco knew he should have taken the extra few minutes to make sure Slippy had done the repairs right way back when they were doing annual road tests, and since he hadn't, a huge chunk of time had been ripped from his life to rescue his friends. Once he got Fox and Krystal off this rock, he thought, they'd be buying him a few dinners for the trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe muttered under his breath when he landed his ship near the crash site, cursed when he saw the signs pointing toward a path and complained as he had to walk the mile toward the new beacon sent to his location by who he assumed was Fox and Krystal. He'd brought a second ship with him, small but enough for two people, and had it land nearby remotely. The Great Fox was still ten days away, having hurried along behind him but not able to catch up in time, but there were enough reserves on the extra ship for anyone to last a month, if not two. He also launched some repair drones, which got to work slowly renovating his friends' ships.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Falco arrived at the ship, he assumed it was the right place, and walked in. \"Hello?\", he called out. \"Fox? Krystal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Falco, is that you?\", he heard calling from a few doors down. Walking down the hallway, the bird was quite excited to see his friends, at least until he turned the corner and saw them lounging in front of a TV. Lounging in a way he'd not seen before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile they were sitting on beanbags, the two foxes were much bigger than the rounded chairs which were straining for help. Both of them were massive, their large guts hanging between their legs and onto the floor, still rising up and out at the same time. Their necks were non-existent, their heads connected directly to their fat bodies, and their bottoms were spreading out over and around the beanbags. Fox burped as he finished a bottle of soda, which caused his stomach to ripple like someone threw a rock into a pool of water. Krystal laughed, her body doing the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox struggled to his feet, slowly, until he was unsteadily standing, giving Falco a chance to see just how big he'd become. He was nearly three times as wide as normal, twice as thick at LEAST, and strangely enough, happy. Krystal seemed content as she smiled up at their bird friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFalco was stunned speechless. \"...............what?\", he finally squeaked out. His best friend was completely different, hugely fat, and Krystal was just as large.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, right? It's so weird! But the food's so good, and waiting for you took so long...\", Fox said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, wait, what?\", Falco responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox and Krystal explained the situation to Falco, who was incredulous. \"So the planet's making you fat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep!\", they both responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it's in the air?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AND YOU DIDN'T TELL ME???\", Falco yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry!\", Fox said sheepishly. \"We didn't mean it! Plus, we can get out of here quickly now!\" He pulled Krystal to her feet, unsteadily, and they both tried to follow Falco out of the station, barely squeezing through the doors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey slowly meandered back to the initial crash site, where Falco discovered something very unfortunate. When he hopped in his ship to get it started, the engine whined and died. \"You gotta be kidding me,\" he muttered to himself. He'd left a light on, and the battery was dead. How did that even happen on a spaceship? He tried to assign the drone-bots to fix his ship - no dice. He'd have to get a new battery for the ship delivered from the Great Fox, which would take almost two weeks. Not only that, but when Krystal and Fox tried to get the extra ship started, it couldn't hold their combined weight (granted, they now weighed half a ton each, making things a little difficult). So they'd need to wait for the drone-bots to get their ships fixed and take those back up, as their ships had the thrusters to lift almost anything. The drone-bots said the damage would take, just the same, another two weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great. So I'm stuck here on a planet which makes you fatter, my friends are giant blobs and I can't go anywhere for two weeks. How could this get worse?\", Falco thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight after, he realized he shouldn't have asked that question.</span></div></div>",

Are you sure? It's pretty fun being fat,\" Fox said, making eye contact with Krystal, who nodded. \"Sure you don't want to give it a shot?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm not really in the mood,\" Falco said. \"I could eat, but not that stuff. I'd rather just have some rations,\" Falco said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too bad,\" Krystal said, as she slid her chair over to Falco's, right next to it. Her fat was oozing slightly onto the bird, who looked at the fat fox and said \"Krystal, what's this all about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis answer came when Fox slid his chair over from the other side, the two huge foxes making a bird sandwich between their bulging bodies. Try as he might, Falco was trapped, both vulpines' massive bodies trapping him save for his head and shoulders. \"Guys, what the hell are you do-GULPH\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMid-sentence, Falco's mouth was suddenly filled with liquid as his fat fox friends poured a bottle of soda down his throat. \"You're gonna love it here, Falco, but you've gotta give it a shot here! Sit back, relax, stuff your face! It's fun!\" Falco opened his mouth to protest, only for Krystal to shove a donut into his beak, making him chew until he swallowed it. Every time the bird fought, squirmed or tried to move, his captors would shove another snack into his mouth, slowly stuffing the bird over a period of about an hour. They finally exhausted their pile of food to see their bird friend passing out in a food coma, his head rolling back and tongue lolling. They let him fall back on his chair, pulling away from trapping him, to see their handiwork. His stomach was swollen out and bulged against his belt, his shirt riding up a bit. His face and other features filled up ever-so-slightly as well. The last thing the bird saw before falling asleep was Fox getting up from his chair, leaving the room, then returning a minute later with several 2-liter bottles of soda. \"Those better not be for me,\" he thought, before the fox poured the first bottle into his mouth and tipped it up until it was gone. Falco could feel his belt pop open and his stomach immediately jump another inch outward before the strain put him to sleep fully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFalco woke up after one of the deepest sleeps of his life and felt two things - hunger and contentness. Krystal and Fox were in front of him, each beaming. He felt his body and gasped. \"How long was I out, and did you keep feeding me while I was asleep?\", he asked the foxes.</span></div></div>",

Fox and Krystal continued to beam behind him as he surveyed the damage - the bird had grown in one day as far as his friends had grown in a few weeks. His belly was already stretching into his peripheral vision and his chest had made quick work of his shirt. The bird's wings had also thickened considerably, and he'd grown out width-wise as well, standing more than six inches thicker than normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat made things worse for him was when his stomach growled. \"Hungry again, Falco?\", Fox asked as he snacked on a chocolate bar. \"Yeah, buddy, want a treat?\", Krystal said, opening a soda and taking a few swigs. The food was enticing enough to remove all of his willpower, and the stuffing marathon had quickened the time it took the air to make him want to gain. \"Yeah, let's eat!\", the bird replied, following the two fat foxes to the pantry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the second consecutive day, the bird couldn't stop from eating, though this time his friends weren't forcing the food on him. Instead, Falco was gleefully filling his beak, again and again, with all the food he desired. Joking and talking with Fox and Krystal while he ate, Falco quickly became convinced how much he liked it here, and figured the two weeks he'd spend here would fly by. Meanwhile, his belly gurgled again, and as the three animals gorged themselves, they each were still growing fatter.</span></div></div>",

He was massive, his blubber-filled body having burst out of his clothes a long time ago.  Fox's cheeks were now balls of flab attached to either side of his face, which now had weight to them that made it hard for Fox to turn his head.  Fox had developed a few additional chins, which jiggled every time he lifted his patted muzzle open for another bite.  His belly was massive, a large, wide, plush mass of weight that sagged in front of him, reaching past his legs, holding him to the ground.  Even if he didn't have his massive stomach pouring in front of him like a gigantic bean bag chair, he also had his wide, lardy rear end, too big for any pair of pants, and now simply two giant, jiggling globes of flesh exposed to the world-- or at least, Krystal.  It didn't matter anyway; Fox just kept mindlessly stuffing himself, not caring a whit about how immobile he was getting, or even his recent nudity from growing too big to fit into his clothes... or possibly any clothes, for that matter!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven after a full day of nonstop stuffing had passed, Fox was still going, ravenously shoving the food of the planet's own essence down his throat.  Not only was the food incredibly addicting, it was also very fattening.  And although the planet-stuffing session had initially begun as an eating contest, Fox had outpaced Krystal a long time ago, and Krystal, although outdone by Fox's immensely growing appetite, had eventually shifted to just simply feeding him.  She had chubbed up a bit from the initial competition, though, now with fat bulging out of her two-piece, rolls bunching over the straps, she weighed a very healthy 350.  But of course, now she cared more about increasing the mass of her newfound feedee than her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them had already just ceased conversation completely, as the stuffing had continued for hours on end, neither of them running out of energy.  And Fox just got fatter and fatter; now too big for clothes, he was a large immobile pile of flab, no longer caring about escape, only about stuffing himself.   And over the course of that night-long session, those thoughts had shifted.  Fox no longer just cared about food.  He wanted size.  Impossible size, in fact, he wanted to be the biggest being in the galaxy, to be heavy enough to dominate completely over those below him.  He smirked as he continued to stuff, his cheeks wobbling, only striving to fatten himself more and more.  He was now an entire ton of fox, somehow still perfectly healthy even after all of the weight he had somehow accumulated over the course of the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Fox was no longer the seasoned leader of the StarFox team, not was Krystal his esteemed partner and friend.  Fox was now nothing but a creature of gluttony, and Krystal his servant, bound by an unstated, yet definite commitment to stuff her mate, and fatten him more and more... until he was the largest being of all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passed, the planet continuing to orbit through space almost anonymously, none aware of what could possibly be taking place on its surface...</span></div></div>",

I have no idea. Slippy mentioned it months ago but he had never handed it to me... weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnscrewing the top of the vial, Fox studied it. It was the viscosity of a milkshake, but didn't smell bad despite its green flavor. In fact, it smelled like mint to McCloud, who was suddenly a bit curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welp, down the hatch,\" Fox said as he gulped the vial down. Brushing off his snout, he burped, adding, \"Delicious!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox then felt a sensation in his belly, which slowly spread up to his chest, out to his arms, then up and down his spine to the rest of his body. It didn't hurt, but he felt strange nonetheless, like being engulfed in pillows. Suddenly his belly began to grow with fat, expanding far and wide on his waist, before his chest followed suit, his abs' definition giving way to a wide breast-plate trapped in his suddenly-four-sizes-too-small shirt, which strained to contain it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext were his arms, which quickly rounded out, filling his sleeves to the point of bursting. He could feel his face swell, gaining chins and folds, and though he could no longer see past his waist, he felt his legs and ass widen to stretch his pants to their limit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal, meanwhile, could simply gape at what Fox had done to himself. She had no idea the fox could ever be more handsome than she'd seen him, but the way he filled his uniform to its limits was the sexiest thing she'd ever seen. She threw himself at her boyfriend, climbing onto his belly to give him a kiss. Not used to his sudden bulk, the fox lost balance and fell back, where he finally kissed Krystal back. \"You're like a giant pillow,\" Krystal excitedly said between pecks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox slowly regained his balance and waddled to the Arwing, now about three hundred pounds heavier. Examining himself in the mirror, the former bounty hunter gave himself a shit-eating grin before looking back into the cockpit. There was another vial, freshly rolled out from under the passenger seat.</span></div></div>",

As he continued to grow, swelling upward and outward from his sitting position, the fox saw his clothing stretch and rip, freeing his giant chest and two-foot belly. His gut expanded further down his thighs as his pants and shirt both tore apart, leaving the fox in his stretchiest tighty-whities.

While he was lifting huge log to serve as piller for the roof, she noticed that the biceps were more visible, while he was lifting them she had the same conlusion well he was lifting a log so it would have tension them. Afhter that they felt exhousted and collapsed on to bed. Or rather a makeshift bed made of grass and leafes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning Fox woke up and noticed something diffrent. He noticed that his feet were a bit further of the leaves since last night,<i> \"I thought i made them further\". </i>Not only that but when he gotm up he felt like his shirt was wraped thithly on his body. Then he saw that his muscle were very well defined and bigger. He stood up and looked at himself. He looked at his biceps giving them a flex he heard how rips were made while doing that. His Biceps was 2 bigger then his fists. He noticed visible pecks beneth his shirt and nice set of abs. And his legs you could easily count every inch of his muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he looked a t Crystal and He gasped when he saw her. She also had a fine looking muscle on her. At it was all shown beneth her uniform. Clothes were tightly hugging her breasts. They were streaching out her uniform futhering from her chest an inch away, she had aslo a bit wider and rounder butt. Due to incerse amount of muscle. Her figure was more like and hourglass with that amount of muscle on her. While Fox gasped that woke Krystal up, when she looked at fox she said<br>\r\n<b>-Hello, morning fox. Oh, you've been working out in the morning? </b>- the last sentence she purred<br>\r\nFox stared for a while, she looked amazing. Then he shook his head. He needs to focus and said<br>\r\n- I could say that to you.<br>\r\n- What but i - Krystal stopped in mid sentnce, she was scrathing herself and notice that eveything got bigger on her. She was pinching herslef to make sure if this is a dream then she caresd her body cheking it its an illusion. Then she started freaking out. Fox started to calm her and said that they should talk about it during breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring their breakfast (a bit bigger part of rations, then they usually do) <b>Ok since last night we grown overnight, we must know what is the cpuse of this and if its dangerous. If are arwing wasnt busted we could analize some data. Maybe if i get some parts for the ship i may repair it. -</b> said Fox<br>\r\n<b>- Thers is something else i forgot to mention.

I didint walk there, becouse building the shelter was more important we can check them out maybe they inhabitants had some info there. -</b> replied Krystal <b>- So where to?</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1 - Gather parts and scan the planet (and growing slightly larger while doing so)<br>\r\nOption 2 - Go to the temple and find some records (and growing slightly while going into the jungle)</span></div></div>",
