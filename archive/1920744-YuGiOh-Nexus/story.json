If he's not dueling he's usually getting in trouble.<br>\r\nOn his 16th birthday, his mom gave him three blank cards that had belong to his now missing father. Then on a walk in Lower District he met a duelist named Fate Watcher. They dueled and Kouyu unlocked the power of the first blank card and changed a spell he had into a new card, a powerful new Nether monster and its weapon. The summoning of the beast changed Kouyu's outfit and made his normally violet eyes glow gold. It also left a strange symbol on his hand in the shape of gear with a key. After Kouyu won, Fate Watcher told him the the blank card had been part of something called the Original and there were more out there that needed to find their true owners or they may cause chaos. Since that duel Kouyu met Joel De'Arc and found that he was the true owner of the second blank card and held the symbol of a sword. The third card remains a mystery, but other Nether cards have found there owners, including the vigilante known as Phantom finding his. Another Nether holder is Miku Tenshi/Akuma, a blonde haired girl haunted by both sides of her personality. Recently Kouyu had a duel with a Nether Holder named Death Bringer who has made him question the meaning behind what he's doing.<br>\r\nBut what will the rest of the story hold.<br>\r\nKouyu uses a deck I invented that is all machines with secondary types. Symbol: Gear w/ Key<br>\r\nJoel uses a deck based off of female versions of the knights of the round table. Symbol: Sword<br>\r\nMiku uses an Angel/Demon deck. Symbol: Angel Wings or Demon Wings depending on which of her personalities is in control<br>\r\nPhantom uses a space deck. Symbol: Comet<br>\r\nDeath Bringer uses a Zombie and Fiend deck. Symbol: Skull<br>\r\nKouyu wears a dark blue leather jacket that is almost black, and has the Japanese symbol for luck on the back in gold. He has black pants. His short hair is black and straight, but it spikes in the back and has a white streak on either side.</span></div></div>",

It'd been a week since my last duel with an insane duelist by the name of Death Bringer. I'd won, but when I went to take his Nexus card, it shocked me.<br>\r\nThis surprised me because that could only mean that he was it's true owner.<br>\r\n\"But that's insane,\" I thought to myself, \"Death Bringer was evil, and the Original Nexus cards are suppose to protect us all. Unless maybe it was somehow corrupted further than that others.\"<br>\r\nThe sound of someone approaching reached me and I turned to see my friend Akita Yosei.<br>\r\nAkita was a nice enough girl with dark blue hair from Upper District. She didn't duel, but I couldn't ask for anyone better person to cheer me on.<br>\r\nShe wore a Slifer Red girls uniform today, which she looked great in. Obviously she'd just gotten out of her after school Duel Academy class that they had at our school. <br>\r\nAkita didn't know much about dueling, but recently she'd been trying to learn so that she could be more help to me and the others.<br>\r\n\"Hey Kouyu,\" she said, she almost never called me by the nickname K unless she was irritated, \"still thinking about your duel with Death Bringer?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" I said, \"I just can't figure it out. Death Bringer was obviously evil, but the Nexus card chose him to be its master. But Fate Watcher told me that the cards were good, if a bit chaotic at times, and that they were the only thing that could defeat the thing that was trying to corrupt the Nexus.\"<br>\r\n\"Well maybe there's something wrong with the card?\" Said Akita, \"I mean did you see what it looked like?\"<br>\r\nShe actually made a decent point. The beast itself had been called Death Abyss Dragon and it looked like a dragon made of bone, but with rotting flesh hanging from it, and a dark shadowy aura eminating from it.<br>\r\n\"I just don't know Akita.\" I said.<br>\r\nThe sixteen year old girl smiled, \"I bet I know what will cheer you up.\"<br>\r\nI looked at the girl.<br>\r\n\"Let's...</span></div></div>",

Plus it'll distract you from thinking about Death Bringer.\"<br>\r\nI thought about it, I'd heard she been improving, and she was someone I'd never gone up against before.<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" I said, \"but I'm not gonna use Prototype Dragon, you know, to be fair.\"<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" Shouted Akita as she activated her standard issue Duel Academy duel disk and she put on her pink and white duel gazer.<br>\r\nI stood up walked a few feet away from her, and then I took the card slots of my homemade duel disk, which I kept strapped to my leg, and attached it to the metal bracelet on my right arm.<br>\r\nI then took my goggle like duel gazer and placed it on my face.<br>\r\n\"You ready Akita?\" I asked.<br>\r\n\"You bet I am.\" She called back.<br>\r\n\"Then I've only got one thing to say, LET'S GET ROLLIN'!\"<br>\r\nKouyu: 4000<br>\r\nAkita: 4000<br>\r\nWho takes the first move?</span></div></div>",

She wasn't too worried about get attacked here though, because she knew Phantom was every where in this section of the city.<br>\r\n\"Why can't I stop thinking about Kouyu,\" said Akita to herself, \"he's my friend.

He lives a simple, mostly uneventful life as a railway worker, mostly doing trackwork with his fellows on the New Domino City Subways, on occasion getting called out to work on the Daedalus Bridge's under-road railway. His ultimate goal for his future is to operate one of the trains in New Domino City- it's not glamorous, but it's very important work none the less. <br>\r\nHikaru is a calm sorta person. He speaks when spoken to but doesn't start conversations unless he has to, and he can be a bit harsh. Like any normal person, he gets a bit fired up when he duels. His hobbies are dueling, doing research on trains, subways, and railways, studying up on work, and taking long walks down disused subway lines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of Dueling, Hikaru duels to pass time. He's never dueled for stakes higher than 'who buys drinks after work is complete'. He's very used to Quick Duels(half everything), but he can do Standard Duels as well. He prefers not to Speed Duel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHikaru's Deck focuses around the Railway Arctype, similar to Anna Kaboom. His Nether Monster, Skull Breakvan, was found on the tracks of a disused subway line. Hikaru finds a lotta Duel Monster cards on the subway lines, actually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNether Monster: Skull Breakvan<br>\r\nSkull Breakvan LEVEL 4<br>\r\nArchtype: Railway<br>\r\nAttribute\tEARTH <br>\r\nTypes\tMachine / Effect<br>\r\nATK 1000<br>\r\nDEF 1600<br>\r\nWhen summoned: equip this card to a member of the Railway Archtype. <br>\r\nWhile this card is equipped to a monster of the Railway Archtype,<br>\r\nwhen that monster declares an attack, you may cancel the attack of that monster.<br>\r\nIf the monster this card is equipped to is sent to the Graveyard/Extra Deck, banish this card. </span></div></div>",

Duelist still use duel gazers and all, but now there's a new type of monster card called Nether monsters.<br>\r\nThe basic idea is a combination between a Xyz monster and a Synchro monster. Each monster has a level called a Nether Level. The duelist removes from play a number of monsters whose combined levels equal the Nether level.<br>\r\nA Nether monster's abilities are accessed by remove cards from the graveyard.<br>\r\nThe rules for this story are-<br>\r\nTry to stay in first person as much as possible.<br>\r\nYou may use made up cards, but no infinitely strong monsters<br>\r\nTry to stick to the Yugioh Card game rules<br>\r\nNo gay stuff<br>\r\nNo sex (Romance is fine but these are 16 year-olds) <br>\r\n(Note- Kouyu Nekusasu, my character can be used in anyone's chapter, but you must ask permission and get his character right.)<br>\r\nIn your own chapters I'd like to ask you give the option to add different character then the one your option is for.</td>",
