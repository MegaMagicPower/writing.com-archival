Tohru, who helped the Sohma's with their housekeeping (mostly because they had no idea who to do it themselves) as a form of thanks for thanks. They went to school together, and were even lucky enough to be in the same classroom. However Yuki and Kyo and their problems, namely they hated each other, and they both liked the same girl: Tohru. Tohru on the other hand had no idea of this, all that she knew was of the Sohma's curse, whenever someone of the opposite gender or when a Sohma felt weak, they would turn into a spirit of the Chinese Zodiac. Yuki would turn into a rat, while Kyo would transform into a cat (even though he was excluded from almost the rest of the Sohma can) However right now that wasn't important, right now they were just ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************************************************************************** ****************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah. Yuki-kun! I've heard rumors that there's going to be a campfire, and we're even going to shot FIREWORKS! Is that true?\" Tohru asked with a bright grin on her face. \"It's not true, it's not true both of those are lies...\" Yuki, the school president replayed and then began to apologized. Shigure, the dog-author and home owner, broke in reminiscing on how Ayame, Yuki's older brother, the Sohma possessed by the snake, and one of Shigure's close friends, lit the school up with spotlights back when he was the school president. As they continued to talk Tohru began to leave to visit another Sohma, Rin the horse, who was in the hospital. After she left Kyo couldn't help but ask \"Hey...Is it just me or has Tohru been putting on weight?\" Shigure bursted out and yelled with passion \"KYONKICHI! YOU REALLY NEED TO LEARN SOME THINGS ABOUT WOMEN IF YOU WANT TO WIN THEM OVER, ESPECIALLY--\" \"ALRIGHT ALRIGHT!!! I GET IT DAMMIT\" Kyo said as he stormed off (which happened quite  often). But even then he couldn't stop thinking about the girl he loved. As he began thinking his rat-rival Yuki also thought about her and her new weight. Tohru was also thinking of her new girth. \"Must be from the class trip...\" But instead of thinking as most girls do and start worrying about it, she merely brushed of the matter for now and started worrying more about Rin. \"Oh! I forgot to get her some snacks!.... Well I guess I could buy some\" Tohru said. She entered a small convenience store and went strait to the snack aisle \"Hmm...\" Tohru pondered on snacks to buy.</span></div></div>",

There were some chocolates, a few boxes of pocky, and even a couple mints in case Rin wanted to have a fresh smelling mouth. She wasn't sure just what tickled Rin's fancy the most. Sighing in resignation, she figured that, in the event that Rin didn't like the candy, one of the other Sohmas would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bought a little of everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was grateful how cheap the candy was, seeing as how she didn't have nearly enough money to cover expenses as much any more. She rested a hand on her middle, surprised to find there was a little bit of give to it. She blushed deep red at the thought of this. She wasn't fat, she reminded herself, barely even thick. She was just at an ordinary, healthy weight, and besides, she didn't have the time of day to just start worrying about her weight when everyone else had more important issues to worry about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTohru arrived in Rin's room, smiling as she sat there, fidgeting. She glanced over at Tohru through the corners of her eyes, a slight grimace on her lips. \"Oh, it's you. Whaddya got there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, just a few sweets. I figured you'd like some,\" Tohru replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRin glanced away, her skin turning a light shade of green. \"Do you know what they serve in hospitals by any chance, Tohru?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...no...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jell-o, jelly, creams, and jell-o...it's enough to give me an ulcer...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm sorry! I didn't realize!\" Tohru stammered, blushing deep red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine, just...please...for my sake...take it away...\"</span></div></div>",

Now weighing around 300 to 400 pounds, Tohru's body was definitely on the borderline obese zone, as she could feel all of her newfound body fat upon her once average body frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn her face, Tohru now had a set of slightly chubby cheeks, as well as a thick double chin and plump neck. While on her upper body, her breasts were fattened up several bra sizes, reaching the Double-E Cup range. Her once flat stomach had blown up with fat, giving the schoolgirl a fat round belly, as it threatened to droop over her blue mawashi, showing off a prominent muffin top, along with displaying a pair of plump arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for her lower body, Tohru now sported a pair of medicine ball-sized buttcheeks, as they jiggled a bit with each waffling step with her new fat legs. However, due to her new size, Tohru's school uniform bursted wide open from the pressure that she gained from her new size, leaving Tohru in a large light blue bra and a light blue mawashi. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, it wasn't just that she was now a fat female sumo wrestler version of herself, as Tohru got a glimpse of her hands and saw that they looked like a catgirl's hands, having pawprints on the fingers, retractable feline talons on the fingertips, and having blue fur covering her hands and forearms, which can also be seen on her feet and lower half of her legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What's going on?\" Tohru asked, greatly confused as to what was happening to her, as she began to feel something long and furry slowly swishing from left to right. Slowly moving her right feline hand to the seat of her fat rear, Tohru felt what appeared to be the tail of a cat, tracing it to the base of her own spine, as panic slowly began to set in a little and she said, \"A tail?! I-If I have a t-tail, then that means...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around the aisle she was in for something to use as a makeshift mirror, Tohru looked at the pane of a glass for to the frozen foods, seeing her own reflection in the glad pane, as she saw a pair of blue furry cat ears on the upper sides of her head, noticing that her own human ears were gone, now coming to the realization that she was transformed into some sort of Sumo Catgirl.
