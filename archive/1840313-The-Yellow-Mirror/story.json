            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The world is known as Tamrah, and the East is dominated by the kingdom of Khynai.  Khynai has been a monarchy since its infancy, and now the crown is threatened.  Poverty and social unrest are at all time highs. The nation is teeming with crime, and whispers of a revolution can be heard on every corner in every ghetto. King Harlan's abuse of power is bordering on the obscene, and the breaking point of his people is teetering on the brink. It is in these chaotic conditions, in the small village of Gargylon, that Yessendra and Gunther Hart bear their baby girl, JoAnna. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYessendra is a halfling from the South and Gunther was once a powerful sorcerer - magic is strong in their blood lines - but now they are simple people, struggling to survive in turbulent economic times. It was not so long ago Gunther was a highly esteemed member of King Harlan's court, but he was banished from the castle when he objected to the atrocities taking place in the arena. Now he spends his days slaving away on the Timlin ranch for a miniscule penance, a penance he must somehow stretch far enough to feed his family and pay the bills. This is one magic trick that is becoming increasingly difficult in the Kingdom of Khynai, even for the great Gunther.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings for the Hart family were fairly uneventful for the first several years of Joey's life. Men were constantly venturing off to fight against Harlan's tyranny. Small rebellions had risen and fallen throughout the battle weary nation, but none were successful. King Harlan crushed them time and time again. It was said that Luther, Harlan's most powerful magician, was able to see all that took place in the kingdom. Some said Luther was more powerful than the gods, but this was obviously delusional paranoia. It was, however, generally accepted that Luther's power was frightening and any attempts at usurping the throne would be futile with him at Harlan's side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut word was spreading of a man named Arthur. Arthur's wife and daughter had been killed in the arena, and he had begun fighting with only his brothers and father-in-law at his side. His bravery and charisma were legendary, and before long he had amassed an army. He now lead a force of more than fifteen hundred men, and they made their stronghold along the southern borders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough it all Gunther kept his head down and his nose to the grindstone, and the world turned. He paid no mind when one of his fellow ranchers became deluded with visions of grandeur and tried to convince him to go riding off to the South. Gunther just stayed silent and watched them go. He had seen first hand the things of which Luther was capable. Harlan had gone mad, and he was quite sure Luther had more than a little to do with the corruption of King Harlan's mind. Anyway, he had a wife and daughter to look after, and if he could give them peace he would, even if it meant breaking his back in the fields.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey began schooling when she was four, and even at such an early age it was clear she was a very bright girl. She excelled at nearly everything she put her mind to. Scholarly subjects seemed to be made of her own accord. Mathematics and Languauge lent themselves to her will, Chemistry did her bidding. Her marks were the highest in the land. Gunther and Yessendra had birthed an exceptional child, but just how exceptional was yet to be revealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Joey was six her father was tasked with breaking a particularly spirited stallion, a job that proved too tall for him, and he was thrown. He landed in a heap, snapping his arm like a twig. It was a crippling injury, and hours later, as he lay in bed with his arm in a sling, lamenting over his ill fortune and his faimly's ruin - with his disability they would be starving within a week - Joey pressed her hands to his arm and closed her eyes. Her lips moved but made not a sound, and Gunther felt a soothing warmth spread through his fractured bone. When Joey removed her hands, nearly thirty seconds later, he was completely healed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen asked how she performed this miracle Joey had only shrugged.  Something inside her told her what to do, something she was unable to identify or articulate at such an age, even one as exceptional as her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the power to heal wasn't the only talent Joey possessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Joey was ten years old when she discovered she had the Sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree years earlier, during herseventh year of life, the Timlin ranch had benefited from an unusually prosperous growing season. There was a surplus of food and resources which Master Timlin somehow managed to conceal. He risked death in the arena by withholding goods from the tax collectors, but \"Tax collectors and the arena be damned!\" he was known to grumble whenever someone made mention of this grim reality. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a brazen act of defiance of the empire, and despite loud and vigorous protests from Gunther, Master Timlin demonstrated his capacity for compassion and generosity by bequeathing a young steed to Joey on her seventh birthday. Gunther was certain Master Timlin's hoarding would be discovered by Luther's omniscient eyes, and there would be hell to pay for all, but when he saw how overjoyed his daughter was with Timlin's gift, he knew he would fight to the bitter end if Luther or King Harlan himself tried to take it from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it turned out, there were apparently some things Luther did not see, or perhaps he just had bigger fish to fry, but Joey was not hassled for her newly prized possession, and Timlin was not arrested for cheating on his taxes. Although Gunther could not afford to care for the animal, Timlin fed and housed it while Joey groomed it, rode it, and loved it as much as one can possibly love another creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so it went until less than two months after Joey's tenth birthday. It was mid summer, and Joey lay down for a late afternoon nap, during which she became trapped in the throes of a terrible nightmare. She dreamt her beloved young stallion, which she had named Cupid, had fallen lame in the hills to the south. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her dream the sky was ravaged by a fierce storm, and Cupid was struggling to fend off attacks from circling hyenas. The horse whinnied and cried frantically as bits and pieces of flesh were stripped from its hide, and Joey was sure her heart would burst in her chest. For her the dream was reality, and she was powerless to protect her precious beast, but just when it seemed her poor Cupid's demise was inevitable, Joey's eyes fluttered open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrenched in sweat, heart pounding like a jackhammer, Joey screamed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen her mother rushed to her bedside, scared half to death, Joey was hysterical. \"Oh no. No, no, no. Mamma. Please. We have to help him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Baby, slow down. We have to help who?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cupid. Please, we have to go now. He's DYING!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Baby girl, relax. It was just a dream. Cupid's fine.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother's voice was soft and soothing, full of love. It helped restore sanity and order in Joey's heart, but the dream had seemed so real. So vivid. It had to have been more than just fantasy. \"I have to see him.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo this she received no objections, and before her mother could blink Joey was racing off to master Timlin's barn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCupid was safe in his stable, morosely chewing hay, as horses do. Not a cloud could be seen in the sky, and Joey's terror seemed ill conceived. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her nerves wound down and she blew out a deep winded sigh of relief, Joey spied the saddle hanging in the stable.  Galloping across the country side, the wind blowing in her hair, invariably provided priceless peace and serenity, no matter how turbulent her life might be. It was beyond therapeutic, and right now Joey needed to clear her head and forget her horrible nightmare. What better path to tranquility than a ride with her beloved Cupid?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so she rode, gallivanting for miles through the hills surrounding Timlin's ranch, until her nerves were steady and her bad dream was but a distant memory. When she returned Cupid to his stable, nearly two hours had passed, and the sun was setting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings went on much as they had for a while, calm and uneventful, and three weeks later when a storm began to brew on a Sixthday morning, Joey thought nothing of it. It looked to be a nasty one, but Joey had seen worse during her ten plus years of life. Not a thought was spent on the well being of her horse or of her dream all those days ago, until Bernard, one of Timlin's ranch hands and a close friend of her father's, came bursting through their front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Harts were gathered in the living room, Gunther sipping tea, his wife knitting, and Joey reading quietly, when Bernard barged in, not bothering with the social convention of knocking. His scalp was split down the side, half his face hidden behind a mask of blood, and his eyes were wild and fearful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gunther, forgive me. Joanna, please, my most sincere apologies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThunderstruck, Gunther rose to greet his friend. \"Confound it, man, what in creation...\" he began, but Bernard barely paid him any mind, brushing past him in favor of his daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet Joey, I'm so sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey looked at him with wide, abashful eyes, but never faltered. She rose to her feet and reached for the gash in the man's head, meaning to heal him. Bernard just waved her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no time for that now, girl. Your mount's gone free!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey froze, realizing what he must mean, and her beautiful blue eyes locked with her father's. Gunther, never one to be taken for a fool, understood immediately. Word of his daughter's nightmare had travelled from his wife's mouth to his ears, and Joey's dream had now manifested into reality. Tales had been told of gifted magicians and scorcerers capabable of seeing into the future, and it was now clear that Joey possessed such a gift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joey, get your coat.\" Not needing to be told twice, Joey raced to her room, and in no time she had returned, tunic draped over her shoulders, riding boots in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It must have been the storm,\" Bernard was explaining. \"I've never seen him like this.\" Sharp as a tack as always, Joey was able to fill in the gaps. Bernard had been watering Timlin's horses, when Cupid spooked and kicked him in the head. Her horse now lay lame in the hills, perhaps being ripped to shreds this very moment by blood thirsty scavanger dogs, perhaps already dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Father, let's go.\" Joey was dressed before her father, bidding him to make haste. Her brow raised as the old man fetched his mage's staff, something she rarely saw him wield since his demotion from the King's court, and they were soon off to the barn, albeit not soon enough for Joey's liking. If they had teleported to the barn, a forgotten skill no magician in the land could channel, it would not have been quick enough. The trio mounted the fastest horses in the stable, and rode for the hills to the south. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joey, close your eyes and focus your thoughts. Think back to your dream, and describe to me what you saw. Visualize the size of the hill, the height of the grass, the direction of the wind, tell me everything you can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey did as instructed, providing all the facts her father demanded, and then some. What probably saved her horse's life was the tree she recalled, a small birch in the distance, almost an afterthought in light of the horrific scene in the foreground. The tree appeared to her as she brought back every hideous detail, and upon its mention her father's eyes blazed with recognition. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the old birch by Clandestine Pass, by devil, it must be.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer father had been right about the birch, and not far from Clandestine Pass they located Joey's dying horse. The foreseen pack of hyenas was present, and for three ordinary travellers they might have posed a formidable threat, but Gunther was able to send them packing with a couple of well placed lightning bolts from his staff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCupid was a mess, stripped clean to the bone in some patches, his left hind leg broken and bent at an awkward angle, but still conscious. Joey went right to work, touching her beloved in all the right spots, murmuring silently, and Gunther and Bernard watched in awe as flesh, hide and fur regenerated right before their eyes. Once her horse was whole again, Joey collapsed on the Earth, too weak to move.</span></div></div>",

Sort of. I don't know. I mean, he was wearing a jacket with designs on it, and his shoes, they're the damnedest things, I can't even describe them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Joey, you cunt, you know what I mean,\" Lauren teased. \"Did he make you hot?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey blushed. \"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You fucking liar,\" Lauren cooed. \"You have a crush on the dream boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's cute, so what? So anyway, he was looking for something. He was in a cave, or something, and like, he was in this, like, golden light. There were none of those fucking big ass machines speeding by and no strange buildings this time. He was just in a cave, in that weird fucking light.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think it's the Sight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know it's the Sight. This boy is real, his world is real. It's just, somewhere else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well, sounds fascinating.\" Lauren skipped down the road, beaming and cheerful, as usual. Joey was up beat, but much more pensive than her light hearted, care free friend. She strolled along, her sparkling blue eyes distant and dreamy, as Lauren danced and darted beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSchool was out, and the girls were on their way to jintai practice, a type of martial arts involving sword play. Jintai focused on balance and flexibility, areas in which Lauren, a fiery red head with the body and agility of a world class gymnast (if gymnastics had existed in this world), excelled. Their teacher, Yahmen, a crafty old man pushing sixty, often boasted of Lauren's incredible natural ability and her uncanny skill. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey was also adept at the craft, her fourteen year old body developing nicely, although she still carried a hint of flab and was not as limber or as quick as her younger friend. Her frame had been what some would describe as chunky in her younger years, but as adolescence began the baby fat fell away, leaving behind a soft, yet athletic - not to mention breathtakingly beautiful - figure. Her interests, however, lie elsewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since that fateful Friday afternoon in the hills, the afternoon she first learned of the Sight, Joey had been captivated by the intrigue of magic. She wondered how many other hidden talents she might possess, and how powerful she could become if she honed her abilities. Alas, her father would not condone it. After Cupid was safe in his stall and sanity restored to the Hart household, her father had taken her aside, telling her they needed to have a \"serious talk\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it turned out, her father did all the talking, Joey did the listening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must forget what you learned here today. You might think this foresight is a gift, but I tell you now, as surely as the sun sets in the East, it is a curse. It will bring ruin on all our heads. You must suppress it, and never speak of it again.\" His eyes had been stern, his voice unyielding. \"What happened today is done, Cupid is safe now, and for that I'm thankful, but if I ever catch you practicing magic after this day, the consequences will be dire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes father,\" had been Joey's only reply. She had wanted to object, but her father's expression had been unrelenting, leaving no room for persuasion. Teenagers rarely heed their parents' warnings, however, and Joey was no exception.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanna have some fun?\" Joey's eyes were narrow and mischievious. As Lauren looked at her she retrieved a book in well worn leather bindings from the confines of her school pack. Although she had never seen the book before, Lauren was fairly certain she knew what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that what I think it is?\" Lauren asked, her big green eyes widening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You fucking crazy bitch, your dad's gonna kill you!\" But Lauren was laughing, clearly pleased by her friend's defiance. Joey had stolen her father's book of spells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls began thumbing through brittle pages, yellow and frayed at the edges. \"What do you want to try first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey gave this question some thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This looks interesting.\" Joey was pointing to an incantation in the enchantment section marked object manipulation. It seemed with the right words and mental capabilities, one could control an object with one's mind, a trick better known as telekinesis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want to try it on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey unsheathed her dagger and laid it on the ground between them. After casting a brief smile in Lauren's direction, her eyes returned to the spell. The words were foreign, too many vowels and not enough consonants, but somehow Joey was able to recite them seamlessly. Mumbling what sounded to both of them like incoherent gibberish, Joey's mind-numbingly gorgeous face grew slack, while her piercing blue eyes gained focus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the spell was out, the dagger seemed to float, bare millimeters above the ground, but float none-the-less. \"I think it's working,\" Joey said, her voice quivering with excitement. \"I feel something.\" Joey lifted her right hand, then slowly raised her index finger. The dagger ascended in mid air, the tip of the blade rising in response to Joey's movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got to be shitting me,\" Lauren cackled with glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipping her fingers, twisting her wrist, the dagger obeyed Joey's every whim. It was surreal. Lauren stood up and drew her jintai weapon; a long, slender sword with a curved blade, resembling a scimitar. \"You wanna fight me?\" she asked, grinning madly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're on, bitch.\" Such was the reckless disregard of youth. The dagger zipped forward, Lauren side stepping and blocking the attack with deft ease. Confident in her friend's abilities, Joey did not let up. The dagger dipped back towards Lauren, angling for her neck. Lauren's back bent backwards at an impossible angle, her limber body arching, and the dagger darted harmlessly through the air above her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving with liquid speed, Lauren popped back up and turned to face the unmanned dagger. \"Is that all you got?\" she cackled. Joey's dagger jabbed and lunged, probing for openings just to have them shut down by Lauren's impeccable defense. No matter the attack, Lauren was prepared. It was her own brand of magic, her version of the Sight, as if she could visualize the thrusts and slashes of the dagger before they manifested in reality. This went on for nearly ten minutes, both girls laughing gleefully as Lauren danced with death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Joey, enough,\" Lauren panted, still smiling, and lowered her sword. \"What else you got?\" Joey beckoned for her dagger with the tips of her fingers, and the dagger obeyed, floating into her grip with simple grace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno, let's see,\" Joey shrugged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there anything in there about the Sight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe.\" Joey recounted the earlier spell in her head, the nonsense words flying through her mind in a blur, this time focusing her attention on her father's book. She managed this in a matter of seconds, and once completed she saw that the pages of the book fluttered before her, turning to any page she desired without so much as a fleeting touch of her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice.\" Lauren was impressed. \"That is too cool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here.\" Joey found the page she was searching for. Scanning the section of interest she saw that there was no spell for the Sight, it could only be channeled by those with a natural gift, and application of the Sight came from practice and intense concentration. Meditation was the primary tactic for employing this rare talent, although some magicians had used fasting or isolation as a means of achieving the necessary equillibrium. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdditionally, it appeared the Sight did not always portray future events. It could be used to see into other dimensions, into other realms, or just to see around the corner, but the events revealed might be occurring in the present, or even the past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's it say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It says I have to clear my mind, like meditate, or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you gonna try it?\"</span></div></div>",

I'll give it a shot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now we're talking.\" Lauren smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStifling her giggles, Joey also sat indian style, her back straight, and placed her hands in her lap. In her mind's eye she pictured the boy from her dreams, with his blue and white jacket and peculiar shoes, shoes made from the hides of beasts not discovered in any lands known to her, and his fussy brown hair and stunning blue eyes. She shut her eyes and tried to recall her dreams as she had recalled the vision involving Cupid all those years ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thomas.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA voice spoke from inside her head, and the boy from her dreams gained clarity. His handsome facial features came into focus, illuminated in a glorious golden light. Stone walls surrounded him, and his eyes were full of wonder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your name is Thomas.\"  A girl was speaking to him, and Joey felt a tinge of jealousy as she realized this girl was the object of Thomas' wonderous gaze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe image wavered, as if threatened by Joey's envy. Joey tried to reel in her emotions, but everything was fading, and within seconds, the image was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What'd you see?\" Lauren was looking at her expectantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey blinked at her friend, as if awaking from a dream. \"His name is Thomas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You saw him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey nodded. \"But there was something else. Something right at the end, before everything disappeared.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the image of her dream boy had faded, the vision had transitioned to an entirely different setting. Emanating from a thickly wooded area, with oaks and maples and beeches living amongst each other in perfect harmony, an area rich with greenery, came that same eerie golden luminescence which had surrounded Thomas in the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That glowing light was coming from a forest,\" Joey said dreamily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that still wasn't all. This last part Joey kept to herself, but that glowing light had seemed to be calling to her, like a long lost lover.</span></div></div>",

Over the next year and a half, Joey snuck the book from its hiding a total of three times, and each time her pilfering was as undetectable as the last. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few new spells were attained, Joey's favorite being the ability to propagate love in a person's heart, so long as the seed for it exists. Now this is love of the neighborly kind, mind you, not to be confused with the love of romantics. No spell in existence can coerce true love from a heart, the type of love on which legends are made. Such love is built upon something much more magical, mysterious, and powerful. But Joey could induce forgiveness and acts of kindness from potential enemies, provided their disposition was not too convoluted with hate. Along with the acquistion of a few new spells, Joey also learned the ingredients for a couple of interesting potions, although she had yet to test them out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren, meanwhile, continued to excell in her jintai studies, advancing from the traditional jintai weapon, known as a shaido, to the taidai, twin blades, each twenty inches long and much more managable than the shaido. These new weapons were like extensions of the young girl's body, so masterful was her ability to wield them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring this time Joey's familiarity with the Sight improved, and her dream boy appeared with increasing frequency. More compelling than this strange boy from another world, however, was the vision of golden light pulsing in the forest. It called to her, this golden yellow light, beckoning with silky fingers. It was irresistible, drawing her like steel to a magnet. For reasons beyond her explanation, Joey believed it might be a doorway to this boy and his world. Perhaps it was a doorway to all worlds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she could not go in search of it. To do so would necessitate an explanation to her father, and what explanation could she offer other than the truth - that she had been summoning the Sight in defiance of her father's wishes? Joey loved her father dearly and could not bear to disappoint him. As things turned out, Joey's fears of letting down her father were of little consequence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the third month of the new year, a Fourthday much like any other. The sun had just breasted the horizon, painting the Western sky with brilliant pinks and reds and yellows. The roosters crowed, announcing the dawn of the new day, and Joey sprang awake in a cold sweat, her heart pounding hard in her chest, her perfect breasts heaving uncontrollably. \"Gods, no,\" she whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe face from her dreams still loomed over her, clouding her heart with terror. Eyes black as coal burned with fury, eyes so hostile they could almost cut a hole through you with their icy gaze. A stout, slanted forehead, a sharp blade of a nose, rigid cheeks chiseled from stone, thin lips twisted in an unforgiving scowl, a long, narrow chin. She knew to whom the face belonged, even if she had never seen the man with her own eyes. It was the face parents threatened their unruly children with to scare them into submission. It was the face of the boogie man. The face of terror. It was the face of Luther. And he was coming here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeathery wings beat at the air, propelling a beast of a creature through the night sky. Scaly feet, as large as a small child and capped with sharp, vicious hooks for claws, were tucked behind the creatures haunches. Fierce, red, reptilian eyes peered out from its snake-like head, and dozens of teeth both as long and as sharp as daggers glinted in the moonlight as the beast soared through the heavens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMounted on the back of this monster was the true horror. A demon of a man, with murder on his mind and hatred in his eyes, rode his dragon in search of something. Or someone. Joey watched in abhorrence from her mind's eye as the demon-man spotted his quarry, his eyes lighting up like coals in a fire. The dragon dove from the sky, descending upon its prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer vision shifted to show the target of this vile creature's wrath, and a scream that could not be voiced welled in Joey's throat. There on the ground, running in terror, was a lovely young girl, with beautiful, flowing brown hair blowing back from her face. The girl turned to look up at her pursuer, and Joey knew that face well. The silky milk chocolate locks, the wide, breath-taking blue eyes, the exotically beautiful bone structure, the curving, sensuous lips, the creamy complexion with reddish blotches high on her smoothly rounded cheeks - it was her, the lovely JoAnna Hart, running for her life, pursued by the devil himself. Then the dream ended, and Joey's beautiful blue eyes snapped open.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For what seemed an eternity, Joey did nothing. She sat up in her bed, her heart thumping like a spooked jack rabbit, and tried to will away the truth of what she had just seen. Perhaps it was just a dream, nothing more than the meddling of an overactive subconscious. Perhaps it wasn't really her Luther was pursuing. But that was bullshit, and she knew it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was no ordinary dream. It had all the clarity and realism of her horrible nightmare involving her beloved Cupid years ago. Like her dreams of the boy in the strange clothes, it was the Sight, and Luther was coming for her, for reasons she could not even begin to fathom. And what would he do when he caught her? She shuddered to think of such things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEqually terrifying were visions of what would become of her village when the monster arrived. Her father would no doubt fight to the death to protect her, as would many of the other villagers. Her father was a well liked and well respected man, and many men would proudly fight shoulder to shoulder with him, no matter the cost. Against a man as powerful and vicious as Luther, they would be lambs to the slaughter. As strong as her father might be, Luther was backed by the throne, and rebellion after rebellion had been crushed under the evil magician's boot. What chance would a rag tag group of common villagers have against him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey saw only one option. She had to leave town, today, right now, and her family could not know where she was headed. After dumping her books from her school pack, Joey stuffed it with a change of clothes, a few steaks and strips of jerky, a jug of water, and some ripe fruit. It saddened her heart to leave in such fashion, but it was for the best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt occurred to her that she needed one more thing. If she was to meet up with Luther, she would need all the help she could get. \"Sorry dad,\" she whispered, as she lifted his book of spells from behind his bed. Gunther had rose with the roosters to work the fields, and Joey's mother had gone to the town market to purchase new material for a dress she was making and leather for a new pair of work boots for her father. There was no one to interfere as she swiped the items she reckoned she would need like a thief in the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she saddled up and rode out of town, possibly never to return, Joey had one more decision to make. Should she tell Lauren, her best friend and lifelong companion? Would Lauren try to stop her, or would she want to come along? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey was still pondering this decision when Lauren rapped on her door. The girls always walked to school together, and Lauren was typically the earlier riser. Most mornings she waited in the living room while Joey scrambled to get dressed and get some breakfast together - breakfast she was often forced to scarf down on the way to school due to her tardiness. Joey had to make up her mind about telling Lauren, and now.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With a sigh, she went to the door and opened it. Looking into those wide, innocent, loving eyes, Joey didn't have the heart to lie. \"I'm not going to school today,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're ditching?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sort of. No, not exactly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren's eyes narrowed and the corner of her mouth rose. \"What's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Joey spilled it, telling Lauren about the dream, sparing no details. Wide eyed and gaping, Lauren stepped inside the house. \"Holy shit, Joey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What're you gonna do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm leaving. Today. Right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leaving where?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, somewhere. I just have to get out of here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren didn't question this. Her unflinching loyalty was one of the reasons Joey loved her. \"I'm going with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could be killed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So could you,\" Lauren retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gods, Lauren, what if something happens to you? I'll never forgive myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you can't leave me here now. Luther will know I know something. He'll probably chop off my fingers or something to get me to talk.\" Lauren was smiling, but Joey frowned at her. \"I'm kidding, come on, Luther will never catch us. Besides, you can always heal me if I get hurt.\" This was true, although Joey could not heal the dead, and she could not heal herself should the need arise (her body was surprisingly resilient, more so than she realized, but she could not heal herself as she could others). This, however, is not what weighed on Joey's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if he, like... does something... to my family? You know, like, to find out where I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren crinkled her brow, considering the dilemma. \"Write them a note. They can show it to Luther to prove they had no knowledge of your leaving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That won't work. He won't buy it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe he won't need to question your parents. People say he has what you've got, you know. That he can see everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't see everything.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe he can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's reassuring.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren laughed. \"You fucking fatalistic bitch, cheer the fuck up. At least you'll have me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful,\" Joey said with a sardonic smile. But it was decided. Lauren would accompany Joey on her journey, and once the decision was made Joey found she was relieved. Striking out in the world with the terrible Luther trailing her was terrifying, and she felt better with Lauren by her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls returned to Lauren's house, which was nearer to the ranch, to gather more supplies. Lauren's father, Bernard, was working with the horses, and Lauren's mother had died of an unknown illness when Joey and Lauren were both very young. Like Joey, Lauren had no sibblings, so they were not disturbed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren packed her own change of clothes, along with a loaf of bread, a dozen eggs, bacon strips, steaks, a jug of goat milk, and another jug of water. Her shaido was sheathed on her back, and her taidai were holstered on her hips, slapping against her thighs. She also took with her a long bow and a quiver of thirty arrows. \"For hunting,\" she said when Joey looked at her with questioning eyes, although they both knew there might be other, grimmer uses for the arrows. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only thing left to do now was to commandeer a couple of horses and ride like the wind. Bernard would be tending the stable, so they could not just walk in and take them, but Joey had an idea. It would be tricky, but Joey was confident it would work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting flush against the wall, her back straight, Joey closed her eyes and focused on her beloved Cupid. Summoning the sight had become almost second nature for her over the past year and a half, although she could rarely see into the future. Typically it just amounted to spying on someone, or some place, whenever she had a particular inkling. Her premonitions only came in dreams, unsolicited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly the image of Cupid came into focus, as did the stable surrounding him. She could see Bernard was watering the horses, his back to the tack room at the rear of the barn. Joey shifted her attention to the tack room, where things would get interesting. Her saddle was hung on the wall, among dozens of others. She had never cast a spell while using the sight, which is precisely what she intended to do now. This part of her plan would require great concentration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Lauren packed Joey had familiarized herself with a cloaking spell, which allowed her to bestow upon an object the characteristics of a chameleon. The spell would not last long, and the enchanted object would not become completely invisible, but it would be difficult to spot unless a person was specifically looking for it. Joey recanted the spell, keeping her attention focused on the saddle, and to her amazement, its tarnished tan began to change. Within seconds it had matched the color and design of the wood behind it, blending in so perfectly that it might as well have vanished into thin air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's really working! Joey thought excitedly, but as her excitement grew the stable and everything in it wavered. Focus, she commanded herself. Don't blow it now. With less experience the whole thing would have swam away from her, but she managed to check her emotions in time. The tack room solidified, and Joey prepared for the next phase of her plan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing the telekinesis spell, she lifted the saddle from its hook, and slowly floated it out of the barn, over Bernard's head. Its wooden color turned sky blue as it soared through the air on this beautiful growing season's morn, and once the saddle was resting safely outside Lauren's front door, Joey repeated this process, retrieving a saddle for Lauren.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, she would need to sneak two horses, which would prove an even more complicated task. Horses were too heavy to be lifted via telekinesis, so they would have to walk out of the barn on their own power, unseen. The cloaking spell should work on them as it did the saddle, and Joey had learned a spell which would induce her will upon the animals. It wasn't exactly mind control - more like a partnership with a willing recipient, and for this reason it tended to work best with domesticated beasts. Joey planned to use this combination of spells to sneak Cupid and Goliath, Lauren's favorite steed, out of the stable, but cloaking did not muffle the sounds of their hooves on the ground, and Bernard still stood between the stallions and the barn door. Joey needed a diversion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the north of the stable was a pig pen, which housed more than a dozen pigs. Using her magic, Joey finagled the gate to the pen open, then lifted the pigs' slop and dumped it throughout the yard. It wasn't long the hogs were running rampant through the ranch, unchecked. When duty bound Bernard was forced to quit his work in the stable and chase the pigs down, one by one, Joey snuck her two horses out of the barn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTacked up and mounted, Joey and Lauren rode off, embarking on an epic adventure.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Drawn to the mysterious golden light, Joey rode south, and Lauren followed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first couple days they rode hard, scarcely stopping to rest. They ate on their mounts and slept not at all. The lack of sleep would be devastating to most, and crippling to the horses, but Joey's healing power relieved fatigue the same as it did injuries, enabling the girls to ride almost non stop at full speed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was important to put as much distance between themselves and Gargylon as they could manage in as little time as possible. Gunther would no doubt send a search party after them, and Joey had no insight as to how closely Luther might be tracking her. They avoided the towns and villages they passed, for fear the news of their sighting might spread to anyone who followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey's body, however, could not be magically healed or revived, and after three days and two nights of constant riding she was wearing down. As I've mentioned she was extraordinarily durable, and despite her extreme exhaustion she felt capable of riding several more days before her weariness forced her to stop, and if left to her own devices, she might have done just that. Lauren, however, wouldn't have it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the girls reached a grassy meadow amidst a grove of orchids, the sun had just sunk beyond the Eastern horizon, casting a giant shadow over the country side.  It was here that Lauren asserted herself, \"Joey, we're stopping.  We'll camp here tonight.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I can still ride.  One more day.\" Joey's eyelids were steadily gaining weight and it took a monumentous effort to keep them from falling. They, like the rest of her, drooped and sagged like an old woman, and Lauren was certain her friend would come tumbling out of her saddle at any moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be silly, you're dead on your feet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not on my feet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what I mean.\"  Joey could be exasperatingly stubborn at times, a willful girl by all accounts, but in this case Lauren would not budge. \"Nobody could be following very closely, as hard and as long as we rode. We can't maintain this pace, and it's lunacy to try. We're stopping.\" Without awaiting further protests, Lauren dismounted and began removing her supplies. Joey sat in her saddle, still wordlessly exerting her will, and watched, before finally surrendering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, you win.  But we're only resting for a couple of hours.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren smiled. Once sleep took her, Joey would be dead to the world until sun-up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Lauren's prediction held true.  Dawn was well past breaking and Lauren had already prepared a breakfast of boiled eggs and bacon when Joey stretched, yawned, and rubbed the sleep from her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, sleepy head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey looked at Lauren with an expression of shame mixed with contempt.  \"You let me sleep in.  How much time did we lose?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, eat your breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey grimaced, and remarked, \"I've got to take a squat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take a squat, then eat your breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll eat on my mount.  Pack up.  We've wasted too much time here, already.\"  As Joey headed off to water the bushes, she called out, \"When I get back we ride.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Joey and Lauren continued trekking south, but at a more leisurely pace.  All the while Joey studied her father's book, continually expanding her repertoire of spells, and it was easy riding, the terrain dominated by gently sloping hills and wide open, grassy prairies.  Occasionally the girls would canter through a brook or stream to cover their tracks, and, although it hardly seemed necessary, they stuck to the lesser known trails and avoided the settlements scattered throughout the land.  They rode straight through the night on their fourth day, but at the conclusion of their fifth day they rested, and so they did on their sixth day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now Joey and Lauren had covered close to two thousand miles, and had crossed through three provinces since leaving Gargylon.  They were nearing the edge of civilization, and their supplies were dwindling.</span></div></div>",

It would get them through the day, but if they continued south, tomorrow they would be in the unforgiving climate of the Halaan desert, where food and water were scarce, and human settlements were scarcer.  Hunger and dehydration were beyond the powers of Joey's spells, and could only be countered with sustenance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should probably head for town, unless you want to end up a pile of bones out... there.\" Lauren said, waving her hand towards the South as they wolfed their breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we're far enough from home now.\"  It was a reluctant concession, but one that had to be made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs prolific in Geography as she was in other studies, Joey knew the land well.  The village of Kyrn was no more than forty miles east, the last stop for adventurers looking to brave the scourge of the desert.  It was the destination upon which she decided, and in less than three hours Joey and Lauren were passing through a canyon just outside of town.  Before they even reached the outskirts of Kyrn, however, they discovered their first villager.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the depths of a cave along the southern wall emerged a woman, clothed in a tattered robe that might once have resembled a shade of white, with a hood that hung down her back.  Her feet were bare and her hair was matted, but so far as Joey could tell she was astoundingly beautiful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe approached the girls from her position, nearly a hundred yards ahead, and waved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you suppose she wants?\" Lauren asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we oughtta go see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe she's a harrier, and she's set a trap for us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's possible,\" Joey laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe she's got a gang waiting to jump us when we get up there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They could shoot us full of arrows and take our horses.\"  Lauren smiled mischievously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll be fine,\" Joey replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or maybe they'll just knock us out, and then take turns raping our young, virginal bodies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're a virgin, eh?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, stop it, Joey, you're just as green as I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, but they're not going to rape us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They could always slit our throats, gut our carcasses, and roast us by moonlight in some sort of cannibalistic ritual.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gods, Lauren, enough.\"  Joey said, smiling in spite of herself.  She'd never admit it, but Lauren's doom and gloom conjectures were striking a nerve.  Neither of them had ever been so far from home, away from the protection of their fathers.  While Lauren's speculations were far-fetched, they weren't entirely implausible, and that scared Joey more than she cared to acknowledge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright, sorry.  Take it easy.  I'm sure she's perfectly harmless.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Of course she is,\" Joey said confidently, masking her earlier fears.  \"She looks like she needs our help.\"  Without further discussion the girls rode over to the woman, whom Joey could see was indeed very attractive.  She appeared to be in her mid twenties, and even with the loose, ratty robe concealing her figure, Joey could see she was a voluptuous woman.  Her skin was darkly tanned, her lips full and pouty.  She had wide, dark eyes that disarmed you with their enchanting allure.  When Joey smiled and waved, the woman reciprocated the gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there.  My name's Olive, and this is Lori,\" Joey lied, locking eyes with Lauren long enough to ensure her friend picked up on her alias.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name's Kim.  Kim the Wise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleased to make your acquaintance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Likewise, I'm sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kim the <i>Wise</i>, huh?\"  Lauren cooed.  \"Aren't you a little young for such a name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While years are not an accurate gauge of one's wisdom, my appearance is a poor indication of my time in this world.\"  Meeting Lauren's skeptical gaze, she continued.  \"My father's mother was elvish.\"  It was common knowledge that although humans with elvish blood were not immortal, as elves were, they aged much more slowly than did their pure blooded counterparts.  Examples of this were rare, however, since interbreeding was generally frowned upon by both races.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how old are you?\" Lauren asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim offered Lauren a thin smile.  \"I'm eighty-three.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren whistled to demonstrate her admiration.  \"Damn, J-, Olive, so that's what you have to look forward to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAddressing Joey, Kim raised an eyebrow and asked, \"You descend from elves?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My mother's a halfling,\" Joey said, realizing they had already given this woman far more information than necessary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we're kin.\"  Kim smiled warmly at Joey, but despite being hampered by the naivety of fourteen, Lauren detected a hint of craftiness in that smile that set her on edge.  \"You're bound for Kyrn, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey, sharing none of Lauren's unease, replied readily enough.  \"We are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps we could help each other, then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How so?\" Joey asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was once a resident of Kyrn, years ago.  Ill fortune left the elders and I at odds.  Regrettably, a compromise could not be reached, and I was banished.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My condolences,\" Joey replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Olive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ill fortune?\"  Lauren chimed in.  \"Sounds like a convenient euphemism.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I taught magic in Kyrn, in happier times, and for decades things went exceptionally well.  I produced class after class of level-headed, productive mages, but all that success was overlooked when seven years ago, one of my students grew unruly.  His abilities surpassed my own, and I could not restrain him.  While I could not be charged directly with any crime, I was stripped of my mage's staff, sent away, and warned never to return.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are other villages,\" Lauren offered, wondering why this woman lingered in a cave outside of Kyrn for seven years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are, but I'm not just a fugitive of Kyrn, but of my former student as well.  I fear he will one day be the death of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how can we help?\" Joey asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've heard rumors one of the elders, a man named Aldo, has kept my staff locked away all these years, as one of his personal treasures.  Some claim to have seen him with it in the cover of night, when he believes no one is watching, at vain attempts to channel magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want us to steal your staff back for you,\" Lauren inferred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One cannot steal one's own property.  But yes, that's the job I'm offering.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the pay?\" Joey inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the safe return of my staff, I'll pay five gold pieces.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bullshit,\" Lauren spat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My word is my bond.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Show us the gold,\" Lauren challenged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear child, I did not come by the name, 'Kim the Wise', by flashing gold at strangers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Touche.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My gut tells me you are capable girls, so I offer my employment in this matter.  You can take it or leave it.  In either case, I wish you a prosperous journey.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Luck be with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the girls continued into town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce a proud gem at the edge of the desert, Kyrn had fallen a long way from grace.  It was now a run down cesspool of human filth.  Beggers and vagrants crowded the streets, dilapidated housing huddled in tired masses, each building more decrepit than the last.  The commercial district consisted largely of ramshackle stands with shady merchants peddling any number of over-priced items, ranging from snake oil to rotting eggs to stolen diamonds.  It would be a challenge to find anything of value to take with them on their journey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not much in the way of sight-seeing.  Maybe we oughtta just find Kim's staff and go get our gold,\" Joey suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, right, assuming she has any gold,\" Lauren replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a feeling she does.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you can use your Sight to spy on her, and if she does we can find out where she keeps it and just fucking take the shit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, Lauren, just wow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?  It's not like she needs it.  She's just hiding in a freakin' cave, for fuck's sakes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're not gonna steal her gold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well, I don't trust her.  Maybe we should ask around about her before we go running errands for the bitch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Joey could reply a gritty, shabbily dressed man with a few black stubs for teeth and hair that most closely resembled a dead skunk addressed them,  \"Gimme all yer coin, lasses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey took a step back, eyes widening, but Lauren calmly turned around to face him.  \"Why would we do that?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If ye value yer lives, ye'll do as I say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hands going to her hips, and the taidai sheathed there, Lauren retorted, \"If you value <i>your</i> life, you'll get the fuck out of my face.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grizzled man lunged at her, flashing a dull knife, but it was a poorly timed attack which Lauren easily dodged.  As she side stepped him Lauren drew her left taidai and planted it in the dirty bastard's belly, and in a flash she had ripped him wide open.  Moving behind the hapless man, Lauren avoided the spray of his blood, and callously watched him struggle to keep his entrails from tumbling out into the street. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gods, Lauren,\" Joey gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I warned him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, let's get the fuck out of here.\"  Joey pulled Lauren into a side alley and they laid tracks for some other, less exciting, part of town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they were what they presumed to be a safe distance away, the girls stopped to catch their breath.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was fucking crazy,\" Joey remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh,\" Lauren agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really killed that guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey took a moment to ponder the gravity of it.  Everything the man ever had, and ever would have had, taken from him in an instant, all because of one single error in judgement.  She tried to imagine what was going through his mind right now, as he lay dying in the street, and fell short.  It was more than she could comprehend.  The frailty of life loomed in her mind like never before.  \"I can't even imagine what he must be thinking,\" Joey said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's thinking he shouldn't have fucked with me.  Now come on, snap out of it Joey.  The fucker's old news.  What are we gonna do about Kim's staff?\"</span></div></div>",

Besides, it was self-defense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where do we start?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where people's tongues will be their loosest.\"  Lauren gave Joey a quizzical look.  \"The local tavern, of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now we're talkin,\" Lauren said with a wide grin.  \"I could go for a brew or three.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're not going to drink, we're going to investigate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but we gotta blend in to gain their trust.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You might have a point,\" Joey conceded.  \"But just one, I can't be taking care of you if you drink yourself silly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're such a wet rag,\" Lauren told her, sulking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding the tavern was easy, as it seemed to be the most popular spot in Kyrn, but obtaining drinks was somewhat more trying.  The establishment was understaffed and exceeding its practical occupancy level by at least a few dozen heads. As Lauren shouldered her way to the bar and tried to flag down the server, Joey mixed with the crowd, seeking dialogue that might be relevant to their task.  She picked up tidbits of drunken boasts spoken in slurred speach, overly ambitious proclamations of affection, and poorly tempered disputes involving seemingly trivial matters.  Sane conversation was scarce, and Joey began to suspect this entire engagement would bear no fruit.  Around the time her doubt began its manifestation, a zealous and adventurous hand enthusiastically squeezed her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey squealed indignantly and swiftly turned to detect the owner of said hand.  What she saw was a burly man, wide in the shoulders and built like an ogre, and just as attractive.  His teeth were stained greenish yellow from too many years of puffing on fire grass, his upper lip was mauled by an unkempt mustache which still smelled of last week\u2019s breakfast, his eyes were mere slits in leathery skin that hung from his skull, the top of his bald head shined with grease, and a sleazy grin cracked his face from ear to ear. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Shortly after her fathers fall he lay resting in bed. He could hardly believe what his daughter had managed to do. Yet he found himself weakened by the ordeal and his eyelids grew heavier by the second. Joey sat next to him awestruck what had just happened looking at her hands. A loud clunk of the fence outside ushered Joey to her feet and out into the moonlit night. The cold air ran over her face as she walked inside the stables quietly. Closing the door behind her there was the sound of a loud kicking of wood before a snort was ushered from the stallion. Joey walked over to the animal looking into his eyes and found that it seemed to calm him. Carefully she reached out her hand towards the horses mouth and listened to his breathing as it slowed. She felt the soft fur under her hand then found herself studying the animal watching it's large chest heave as it breathed. Joey found her gaze settling on the animals legs and noticed it was holding one off the ground intentionally time and again. Walking in the stall next to the stallion Joey looked through a knot hole in the wood and seen a small sliver of steel was wedged in the stallions hoof.<br>\r\nThere was a creaking sound of the door opening and Joey began to panic. It was forbidden for any woman to be in the stables and after her father had displeased the owners by failing to tame the stallion getting caught in the stables would only render more peril. Joey felt her breathing quicken as her heart beat faster, her skin began to ache and she found herself lunge her chest outward suddenly. Joey tried to cry out but found only a wheeze of air as her ribs ached. Her body groaned and began to swell she felt her legs become weak and dropped to the hay beneath her. The sound of the ripping of her clothing ushered a new degree of panic and Joey found her self unable to stand up. She ushered herself onto all fours and found her sight blurry and shook her head while trying to steady herself.<br>\r\nThe sound of the door shutting caused Joey to squint and found her eyes focus on a dark image of a stable boy. Joey felt her body as it seemed lighter and turned her head down finding a set of hoofs beneath her. She tried to scream but a loud nee was all that was heard drawing the stable boys attention. He walked over finding the door open and the horse inside before closing it and mumbling to himself. <br>\r\nJoey watched as the stable boy did his routine filling the feed buckets slightly before grabing the water pail and heading towards the well. Her chest seemed heavy the entire time and Joey found her thoughts clouded but knew she wanted to change back. In a instant a sudden rush of pain ran over her causing her to drop her back knees to the hay. Joey wriggled in pain as a tightening in her chest caused her to exhale suddenly. Her breathing quickened and she felt her sight grow dim once again. she swayed her head and then lay in the hay. opening her eyes she found her bare arm before her covered in sweat. The cool night air around her reminded her of her nakedness causing Joey to grip the stable plank. She pulled herself up to her feet finding her legs feeling a bit strange before finally steadying. Leaning down Joey gathered her tattered clothing and pushed the items against her belly. Joey reached her hand over the stable door and opened it before stepping out into the walkway. Quickly she looked around and snatched a riding blanket off of a shelf she wrapped it around her self. She made her way into the night stopping for a moment in the darkness at the sigh of the stable boy. The stable boy walked inside the stable giving Joey a chance to make her way back towards her home.</span></div></div>",
