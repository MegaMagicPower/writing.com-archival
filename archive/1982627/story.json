Though booksmart, she is also outgoing, if somewhat clumsy. Lucy has been no stranger to wardrobe malfunctions during her time at Fairy Tail, not that she enjoys that aspect of the guild. Her magic enables her to call helpful spirits to her aid via the use of keys she holds. She views all of her spirits as her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Erza Scarlet</b><br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://fairytail.wikia.com/wiki/Erza_Scarlet\" target=\"_blank\">http://fairytail.wikia.com/wiki/Erza_Sca...</a><br>\r\nOne of Fairy Tail's strongest wizards, Erza holds the rank of S-Class, one of only four in the guild who currently hold that title. Though she may appear rigid and stern on the outside, in hides a much softer side of her personality that loves her friends, sweets and many other things girly. Her magic allows her to instantaneously replace any magic weapon or armor she is currently using. This is called requipping. She is extremely adept at almost all kinds of physical combat, to the degree of sometimes frightening her guildmates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Wendy Marvell</b><br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://fairytail.wikia.com/wiki/Wendy_Marvell\" target=\"_blank\">http://fairytail.wikia.com/wiki/Wendy_Ma...</a><br>\r\nOne of Fairy Tail's youngest wizards, Wendy is also one of the guild's three first generation Dragon Slayers, which means she was raised by an actual dragon and taught its magic. Wendy is bright, cheerful (if a bit shy) and intensely mindful of others, always putting their needs before her own. Her magic, Sky Dragon Slayer Magic, is mostly support-based, capable of healing her friends and enhancing their abilities, though she does have a few offensive options as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Juvia Lockser</b><br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://fairytail.wikia.com/wiki/Juvia_Lockser\" target=\"_blank\">http://fairytail.wikia.com/wiki/Juvia_Lo...</a><br>\r\nThough originally a member of the guild Phantom Lord, Juvia joined Fairy Tail after that guild's dissolution. Her primary motivation for joining Fairy Tail, and indeed her primary motivation for most things in her life, is an extreme obsession with Fairy Tail's ice make mage, Gray Fullbuster, with whom she fought and then was saved by. She has since fallen madly in love with him and bases most of her daily life around him. He is somewhat perturbed by this. Juvia's magic allows for very strong control over water, to the point of even making herself water if she wishes.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><i>Oh, this is magical!</i> Lucy Heartfilia thought as she smelled the rich, strawberry-like fragrance from the bubble bath she had just bought on clearance.  The saleswoman, whom reminded Lucy of the missing Mag Drug Owner, had promised that it was excellent for relaxing and aiding sleep.  Lucy decided that since she and her team were between any big events or bigger dangers, she had earned a personal luxury.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy's head jerked up as she thought she heard footsteps in  her room.  Holding on to the large white bathing towel that was the only thing on her body, she poked her head out of the door.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Natsu?  Lucy?  Gray?  Anyone else?\"  When none came, she shrugged.  <i>Take a break from the mystery/horror books, Lucy</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStifling a yawn, she decided to take the extra precaution of using the new deadbolt she had put on the door.  While she knew her <i>nakama</i> wouldn't be stopped by it if they really wanted to get it, it would hopefully be enough of a deterrent to prevent another incident like the one with the Phoenix Priestess.  Her face reddened as she remembered the ogling and  ribbing she got from Happy, Natsu, and Grey when her towel had fallen off with her being unaware.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Good thing Juvia wasn't there, because all of my Celestial Spirits couldn't save me if she believed I was trying to seduce Gray like that</i>.  Grabbing her pink pajamas, a small stack of books, and Gale-Force Reading Glasses, she returned to her bathroom.  She set the pajamas and books down, put on the glasses, and took off the towel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA peccadillo of her's, before Lucy got into the tub, she admired herself in the mirror.  While she knew that vanity was unbecoming, she felt it was almost justified with her Venus-like body.  She looked up from her cute feet, lengthy legs, curving hips, and smooth sex.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy turned around briefly and nodded at her bubbly bum.  After giving her behind a playful spank she noted with less pleasure her waist.  It was probably unchanged from when she last checked, but with so many of the Fairy Tail gals being thin, keeping the status quo might not be enough.  Her boobs still looked impressive though--firm, perky, and ample.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe jiggled them slightly before sighing.  <i>Yes, I've been busy, but I should have a boyfriend whose going crazy about not being the one to feel these up</i>.  Not that she wanted some lech only interested in her body, but she felt like she wasn't turning heads like she used to as of late; she certainly wasn't closer to finding a significant other.  She giggled quietly to herself as she looked into her reflected eyes.  <i>Maybe I should wear the Gale-Force Reading Glasses more often.  I might be able to land a guy with a glasses fetish</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding that was enough eye humping and pitying of herself, she put her lovely feet into the hot, foamy water.  With care, she lowered her beauteous booty into the water, then she sank her legs, and finally her great knockers.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This should almost be illegal</i>.  The smell of the sweet scent from the foam and its feel on her soft, creamy skin put her on Cloud 9.  It was like being a warm, happy baby in its mother's arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening her pretty brown eyes, Lucy picked up one book and began to read through it.  When she was near the end in a few minutes, she felt her head nod a few times as her eyes became heavy.  She finished and set down both the book and the glasses.  She then yawned in a loud and long way that she assumed was less than ladylike.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe remembered her father warning her about not falling asleep in the bathtub.  However, her reading and reasoning told her that an adult that was not conscious, drunk, nor medicated would be safe from drown by falling asleep; as soon as the water entered her mouth or nose, she would wake up sputtering and flailing, but safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother powerful yawn came from Lucy as her normally sharp mind tried to keep going.  <i>Maybe I shouldn't fall asleep here because my skin may become dry and itching, and I might be sore from the position and tub</i>.  Lucy scooched her well-rounded caboose back so her abundant bust and surfaced above the warm, frothy water.  She stretched, her arms up, causing her breasts to bounce a little as she made her decision.</span></div></div>",

Lucy thoughts went unfinished as fell into the arms of Morpheus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Mmmmm, you give such a good massage, Loke.  If only this were a more lucid dream.... <br>\r\nOh, hi Natsu.  Yes, you could rub my feet and legs while Loke does my shoulders and back.  There's plenty of me to go around.  What, why are you chuckling?  <br>\r\nNO, I WASN'T DOING A FAT JOKE ABOUT MYSELF, YOU IDIOT!  <br>\r\nHey, Loke, don't hit on Juvia.  She's only interested in--<br>\r\nGray, don't fight with Natsu right now!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy had no idea how much time had passed when she was startled awake by a young man shouting.  \"Hey, there's a naked girl in the street, and she's nude... with no clothes on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy blinked, feeling confused and chilled despite the still warm bathwater around her.  In her half-awake state, she sat up to try to understand whom was being shouted at, when she suddenly solved the mystery.  She was the stark naked girl!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the--\" Lucy exclaimed.  She was still in her bathtub, but somehow out in the streets of Magnolia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe startled stark naked blonde tried to think.  Her first thoughts was not to shriek, and her right hand managed to cover her mouth just in time.  Her second thought was that sitting up in the tub had put her bare, full, and shapely bust in clear view of half the street.  She moved her right arm across her breasts so at least her pink nipples were obscured and her left arm to cover her smooth sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy heard responses to the young man whom had seen her, though they seemed not to have eyes on her yet.<br>\r\n\"What's that?\"  <br>\r\n\"This must be a prank to see if we'll look.  Still, I'll take that chance.\"  <br>\r\n\"Maybe someone lost a bet, probably one of the Fairy Tail girls.\"<br>\r\n\"No, I'm not going to check, dear.  I know better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why me?  Why me all the time?\" Lucy asked the cosmos in quiet self-pity.  Lucy had come up with a few explanations for her predicament.  Someone had used teleportation magic to bring here her or had knocked her out with the bubble bath and brought her out here.  Regardless, she had to act, especially as the young man was moving closer and others would likely be joining him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, I wish I had my keys on me.\"  Some of her Celestial Spirits would be helpful right now.  Others would be decidedly unhelpful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy decided one option was to stay in the tub and explain the situation--hoping the townsfolk would be merciful and avert their eyes.  Who would want to see a beautiful, curvaceous buck naked 18-year old blonde, anyway?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother was to take off and try to get back to her room.  Her well-rounded booty was a bit sore from sitting in the tub, though giving the all of Magnolia an eyeful of it bouncing as she ran back home was problematic.  Besides, her room might still be locked, unless her friends had come in.  Which would also be not great.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA third option was to run to the guild hall.  Lucy was pretty sure it was closer, and should be empty or near empty at this late hour.  She could snag a drapery to be temporary clothes and then get help from a guildmate.  Of course, she'd be just as naked until she got there as the other options, though.</span></div></div>",

At least it was dark save for some street lights; maybe this wouldn't be too disgraceful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the voices returned.<br>\r\n\"There's the tub, but no naked girl.  Did she go down the drain?\"<br>\r\n\"Unless there's a big coincidence, she's running down the street.\"<br>\r\n\"Jewels to donuts it's a wizard from Fairy Tail.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, that is an enchanting derriere.

It was not so much that she considered her face well hidden with only one hand or that she was more worried about strangers ogling her rosy nipples than her flower.  As a buxom young woman, she knew she wouldn't be long into her run before it started to hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy momentarily wondered if her face would burn her hand, so hot and red it felt.  \"Like Natsu's fire,\" she told herself; though if anyone seemed fired up, it was the small crowd ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was also the sound of a chasing footsteps behind her, though it sounded like only a few die hard gawkers.  It was the bunch of voyeurs in front that knotted her stomach.  Within a dozen or so paces she started her remarks again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shame.  Shame I don't have a body like that.\"<br>\r\n\"I think almost anyone would want to take that body, dear.  Ouch.\"<br>\r\n\"Someone must have lost a big bet.\"<br>\r\n\"Funny.  I feel like I hit the jackpot.\"<br>\r\n\"Who is she?  Does she do this often?  I would schedule this in if she does?\"<br>\r\n\"Can't tell.  Maybe she's hiding a 'butterface,' as the kids say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last one stung in a different way.  Being perved out by townsfolk while naked was a burning embarrassment, but to be called ugly during it was rubbing ice into the wound.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPride from her reptilian brain made her want to stop, reveal herself (well, her identity), and chew out the speaker.  Fortunately, practicality won out and she continued her run.  It was a short-lived fortune--when she reached the crowd most did not disperse, but moved closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhether by plan or coincidence, the crowd had gathered near a streetlight.  Lucy turned her face away from the light, but that combined with her hand over her face, left her half-blind.  The crowd was decidedly not blind, and several hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Lucy screamed as someone lightly spanked her shapely right butt cheek.  She took a mere another step when another person goosed her left one.  She had to slow down as she was giving little room to run.  Other hands felt at her fleshy thighs and one tried to pull down her arm that was barely supporting and covering her jugs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back off or go to hell!\" Lucy screamed.  To her half-surprised, a handful complied.  \"If you're so smart, think of a solution,\" she muttered as she pressed forward.  She was getting pats and felt up by people, though it was more vexing than threatening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could try to power through the crowd.  She could stop and demand help.  She could attack one gropers.  Or she could stop thinking of options and make a damn decision.</span></div></div>",

Her booty probably looked extra active in the move for the pursuers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Lucy recovered her balance and ducked into the alley.  To her relief, it was vacant and she could put some distance between the people who were on her six.  Her next turn, putting her back in the direction of the Guild Hall, was also clear, at least in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally,\" she said.  She carefully moved her hand away from her privates to adopt a runners pumping motion.  She glanced behind her, and saw only a few young men and a woman following her.  Lucy didn't need to have Gale Force Glasses on to notice the woman had a camera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Paparazzi scum\" Lucy spat, since it was almost certainly one of the reporters for Magnolia's least reputable magazine, <i>Daily Moon</i>.  They were known for snapping photos of Erza during her requips, taking shots of undressed Grey, writing fictitious sexscapades of Fairy Tail members, and general trash.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next time I bathe, I'm taking my keys with me,\" she muttered.  Still, she held an advantage.  In addition to having Zeno's paradox on her side, Lucy was confident she was fit enough to keep ahead of her chasers.  True, her shapely bottom would likely become the most ogled in the history of Magnolia, but if it she'd keep her front side and identity obscured, it would be the best practical outcome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe race went on for a few more blocks without much incident.  There were occasional person that would see her from a window or there doorway, but only one joined the chase after another seemed to have given up.  \"I am going to kiss the next person to sell me a bra,\" she said to herself as she adjust the arm from being on providing nominal jug modesty to primarily support.  \"Sometimes, buxom is NOT better,\" she added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she came to the next intersection, she saw a hooded figure step into view.  \"Over here--come!\" a familiar voice called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy could see she was getting near to the Guild Hall and came to a quick decision.</span></div></div>",

She slipped on her whir cheeky panties with pink frills. She groaned as they rode up her perfect butt. She reached back to pick out her wedgie.

She quickly fell asleep after hitting the soft bed and covering herself up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy woke up in the middle of the night, when she heard rustling in her house. She wondered what it was, then quickly deduced that it was Natsu wanting a midnight snack. She sighed and put her head back on the pillow, knowing there was nothing she could do to stop him. Just then, a figure came out of the shadows and covered Lucy's mouth, preventing her from screaming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy couldn't tell who this was, but it definitely wasn't Natsu. In a short amount of time, Lucy passed out from lack of oxygen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe woke up hours later. When she woke up, she found that she was changed to a wall in a dark room. She was panicking at this point. \"What's going on?! Where am I?\" She asked aloud, terrified.

Why am I here? What do you want with me?\" She asked frantically. Minerva grabbed Lucy by the chin and pulled her toward her, until they were face to face. \"You are here so I can make you pay for humiliating me.\" She said sharply. \"You and your goody-goody, smart-ass comments during the naval battle made me look bad in front of the entire nation. You and your guild humiliated me during the games, turning my own guild against me! And most of all, I just hate you as a person. A weakling like you shouldn't be a wizard but somehow, you get by.

This caused Lucy to help in pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva let go after a few minutes. She smiled evilly. \"Now, what else to do?\" She sarcastically asked herself.

Anything but that!\" She begged frantically. She was very shy about her body and didn't want to be exposed in front of Minerva of all people. \"What's the problem?

Partly because she didn't want to look Lucy in the eyes but also because she was starting to undress Lucy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Juvia did not want it to come to this, love rival.  But Gray-sama's heart is harder to win than these games.

Boa head in took, Boobia.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuvia paused and sighed.  \"Lucy-san isn't making any sense.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy tried to slow the breathing through her nose and think.

Based on Juvia's slightly slurred, shakiness, and smell on her breath, it was clear to Lucy that Juvia had spent way too much time with Cana at the bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuvia steeled herself.  \"For Gray-sama, not half-measures.\"  Juvia looked at the blonde beauty and with an odd expression on her face pulled down Lucy's panties and then unhooked and removed her bra.  Juvia attempted to avoid her captive's womanhood and generous boobs, but her face was as equally hot and red as Lucy's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuvia looked unsure what to do with the clothes, and decided to fold them nicely and placed them on a box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>If only I had my keys... and weren't gagged... and my celestial spirit was summoned with a blindfold.  And why is Juvia bothering to take care of my clothes when she's made me look like I'm about to in one of Erza's eroge books?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gray-sama will be back to this room soon.  Gray-sama will see Lucy-san here with this sign and will be so disgust with your lewdness and flooziness, that Gray-sama will reject you.  Gray-sama will fall into the arms of a chaste (yet somewhat kinky) woman.... That woman is Juvia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy felt like her mouth was gaping despite the tape.  After being in Fairy Tail, she had heard many numskull plans, but this was a piece de resistance.  And she was the--um, piece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy groaned through the tape as she saw the sign Juvia had written: \"Gray-sama, <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Lu</span> I am a big hussy who does many hussy things with many people.  Gray-sama must have super filthy bondage whoopee with <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Luc</span> me.

Hey, focus Lucy.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuvia hanged the poorly written sign over Lucy's head and paused again.  \"Gray-sama would be suspicious of Lucy-san having taped her mouth up.  If Juvia takes it off, will Lucy-san promise not to shout?  If Lucy-san does, more people will see her body...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy was nodding vigorously enough for her breasts to jiggle.  <i>She thinks I couldn't tape my mouth, but that I could somehow chain myself up?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuvia tentatively took off the tape, which didn't hurt as much as the nude blonde expected.

Juvia then realized this was the best course for making Gray-sama confess his love for Juvia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy suppressed a scoff.  <i>Bonkers!  Lunatic!  Nutty!  Madwoman!</i>  \"Maybe, I can help you come up with a course that is equal chance at being successful that is more, um, subtle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat gave Juvia pause.  She had a distrustful expression, but her eyes showed curiosity too.  \"Lucy-san isn't known for being subtle,\" she remarked as her eyes went to her captive's heavenly breasts before glancing up again.  \"What does Lucy-san have in mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy put on a faint smile.  <i>Now what, storyteller?  What will you tell her?</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Dodge left!\" Erza bellowed to Lucy as a freeze bullet came towards her.  Lucy was just short of the task; as she dove right the magic struck her lower left leg.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy winced as she landed.  Erza landed from her short flight and her face darkened at her immediate foe who had injured her teammate.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe team they were fighting were called the Gelid Sisters.  Whether they were actual family or not was unknown.  Lucy had already noted by their matching appearance--navy-colored sailor-like school uniforms with their hair styled into a horn--that they were almost certainly members of a resurgent Dark Unicorn guild.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Gelids are magic gunslingers like Alzack and Bisca.  They don't go too much for style, relying on their magic motorcycles' speed and guns' firepower to complete their missions, which are usually theft, property destruction, or kidnapping.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group's bossy leader was Coryza.  She had long blue hair, a slender form, and wielded a bazooka that prevented its target from using magic.  Pruina was the quick-tempered one.  She had a dark complexion, a stout build, and carried an assault rifle that shot bullets freezing the perception of time.  Finally, there was the apathetic Algu.  She had spiky, silver hair, an athletic physique, and held a derringer-like firearm which bullets were like local paralyzers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You dare harm a member of Fairy Tail!\" Erza shouted to Algu.  Meanwhile, Taurus had finally caught Pruina, sliced her weapon in two with his ax, and knocked her down with the ax's broadside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlgu scratched her hair while Erza changed from Adamantine Armor to Flight Armor.  \"You... like, harmed Coryza first,\" Algu said and reloaded with amazing speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlgu was right.  Lucy's semi-successful plan was having Gemini pose as Coryza to confuse and divide the Gelid Sisters.  Unfortunately, Gemini tried to join the group before Coryza had left.  To their credit, Gemini managed to lead the pursuing Gelid Sisters to Erza and Lucy, who formed an impromptu ambush that knocked out Coryza   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Golden Bull knelt next to Lucy.  \"Lucy, you weren't moooobile enough and she hit your calf.  Is your perfect body harmed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy shook her head and sat up.  \"No.  Just my left foot, leg, and umm... half of my backside are asleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaurus eyes widened and he began to rub her lower leg and work up.  \"Perhaps a moooosage will bring back the feeling in your--\"  Taurus froze as Algu shot him in the back head.  Though he could not move his head or talk, his hands continuing to work their... um-hum... healing efforts up Lucy's thigh.  Again, Lucy was just a hair too late and the lewd bovine got in a slight feel of her unfeeling rump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlgu shrugged.  \"I didn't know if it would work on Celestial Beings.  I guess I'm carrying my sisters weight.  Oh well.\"  She returned her attention to Titania just in time to evade an attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you have two to answer for,\" Erza said and was just about to strike when she heard Lucy call \"Duck!\"  Erza did as magic bullets rapidly flew overhead.  They were coming from Pruina.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPruina spit and rubbed her black eye.  \"So do you, floozy!  And Algu--that comment about weight better not have been about me if you don't want to be target practice later!\"  Pruina had reequipped with an  Uzi-looking magic gun and was running in an arc toward Lucy but still firing at Erza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErza was dodging deftly, but was now worried about Lucy.  It looked like she was just about to summon another Celestial Being, so maybe she would be okay.  Algu was now firing to, so Erza decided to keep the attention on her.  \"At least it's two against two and now three against two,\" she called reassuringly to Lucy who had just summoned Virgo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErza suddenly stop as a small magic missile hit her in the back.  \"You're only half-right, strumpet,\" said the voice behind her.  \"Or did you forget, there are three Gelid Sisters?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErza, whose Flight Armor was rapidly disappearing, turned to see Coryza, whom stood coolly preparing to reload her bazooka with a large bump poking through her blue hair.  Erza tried in vain to select a different armor, but her amazing body was as bare as the day she was born.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, Pruina and Algu, be sure to take care of the Celestial Being while I take care of buxom blondie here.\"  Apparently, reloading the bazooka was its greatest disadvantage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVirgo was receiving non-BDSM commands from an increasingly agitated Lucy while Pruina and Algu turned to their self-appointed superior.  \"By Frost, Coryza,  it was a blessing to have you not giving us orders for a few minutes!  Orders that we... already... know!\"  Pruina said as she rubbed her sore eye again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ditto,\" Algu said and quickly reloaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then do them!\" Coryza screamed back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErza felt more humiliated than any time she could remember.  Having her breasts, butt, and genitalia visible to people, even those outside of Fairy Tail, was embarrassing, but nothing that would make here shriek and hide in the bushes the way Lucy probably would.  But to be without her ability to use magic and in the middle of combat where it put her teammate in danger?  It was worse than a thousand gawkers at close ups of her private parts.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErza wanted to sink into the Earth like how Virgo was now.  It must be like how those coeds in that one eroge story I read felt, she mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Erza remembered.  One of the alleged advantages of Seduction Armor was resistance to Nullifying Attacks.  She wasn't sure if this counted, but it might be worth a try.  Two other thoughts that came out from the self-pity: one, grab the partly limp Lucy and try to escape with her; or two, try to fan the flames of the Gelid Sisters argument until Virgo attacks and hopefully Lucy regains mobility.</span></div></div>",

You can have the display model at a discount if white is acceptable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErza scowled at the comely young man, whom was shaking slightly.  After a couple of long moments, Erza nodded.  \"Take it down and as long as it fits, I'll go with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarrett nodded and complied with the speed of Racer.  Erza took a second to look over the other swimsuits before accepting it.  \"Thank you.  Where is the changing room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarrett walked her over.  After entering the room, she re-quipped to her birthday suit.  She felt the bikini fabric thoroughly.  Erza had no intention of repeating what happened at Ryuzetsu Land.  Her face burned a little as she recalled the water slide incident: her bikini top <i>and</i> bottom fraying to nothing; her arms and legs wrapping around a masked Jellal; his palms inadvertently groping her knockers; her brief sitting on his face at the end.  She shook her head to clear the memory.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Erza put on the swimsuit at a slow pace, she indulged in a few moments to admire her nude splendor in the mirror.  She had a majestic allure that rivaled any of <i>Sorcerer Weekly</i>'s centerfolds.  It was a testament to her healing ability and that of others like Wendy that her skin remained so free of scars from the innumerable fights.  Erza frowned at the self-admiration and finished adjusting the bikini.  <i>You need to cut back on the ecchi, pervert</i>, she reprimanded herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked good.  It was tighter than ideal, but comfortable enough.  It was a flounce bikini--more conservative than many of her armors, yet she didn't wish to present herself as a temptress at this beach rendezvous.  Besides, she still had her black bikini and a school-type swimsuit as backup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErza assigned the new bikini to the Knight.  She considered what to wear on her way to the beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Scarlet.  Are you still back her or did--\" Garrett was asking until he was dumbstruck once he entered the changing room.  Before him was perhaps the most gorgeous sight he'd seen: cute flame feet; long, strong legs; smooth curtains; firm stomach; mouth-watering melons with small name-matching areolas; and an amazing and amazed blushing face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could... should... mustn't...\" Titania stammered and moved her arms over her sex and breasts.  She turned away from her unexpected admirer and looked around for some clothes to cover her.  Of course, she could have used Reequip, but she was too startled for that.  Erza saw a robe on the floor and bent over to pick it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarrett felt his eyes and head seemed to be moving involuntarily.  He hadn't intended to become a peeping tom, but he was almost compelled to not look away from the nubile wizard as her well-rounded butt was sticking out like an exotic dancer's.  Indeed, Garrett had to resist reaching out touch the beauty, even though he knew Titania would likely eviscerate him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErza pulled on the robe and stifled a curse that it was stuck.  \"I mean... stop and...\" Erza said and gave a mighty pull on the robe.  Unfortunately, the robe was fragile and already torn.  It tore completely and she went falling back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErza's rear came into contact with the still semi-stunned salesman's pelvis.  It would be Fiore's shortest dirty dance, as the rest of Erza fell against Garrett.  As if it weren't enough like an ecchi scene for Erza, Garrett attempt to grab something in front of him for support resulting in him groping onto Erza's generous rack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey landed hard on the floor, with Garrett taking the impact.  Erza burned with humiliation like when Mirajane was spanking her while she was tied up, in a maid's costume, and in front of half of Magnolia.  And at least Mirajane had the right of penalty to do it.  The burning embarrassment turned into burning rage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unforgivable!\" she shouted.  She pulled Garrett's hands off her breasts, put her feet on the floor, and lifted her ass off his thighs.  She looked down at Garrett with her veins bulging, but saw that he seemed out.  Erza nudged him with a foot and he didn't respond.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErza equipped her nurse armor and knelt down to check on him.  Garrett had a large bump on his head, but no sign of major bruising or broken bones; his breath and pulse were regular, of course.  He also had a nosebleed, which she decided happened when the back of her head hit his nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were going to be knocked out, anyway,\" she said. Erza lifted him up like he was a sack of flour.  She propped him up at the front desk so his body was leaning against it with his elbows on the top and his hands holding up his chin.  She then put the amount of Jewels to cover the swimsuit and the torn robe.  Finally, she found some pen and paper, wrote a note, and pinned it to Garrett.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div class=\"bquote\"> <i>higheyeamgairit. eyeamunconchess. pleasnosteeling.  allsoeyekneedtwolernknottwowalkenonnekkidwizards.</i> </div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nErza equipped her casual clothes and left the shop.</span></div></div>",

Ever since her power had grown, boats had begun to make Wendy sick, and flying was faster anyway. Their job was to investigate a team of missing employees of the Heart Kreuz fashion company, who had been on the island looking into certain plants for an interesting new form of dye that reacted to magic. The employees had been out of contact for a week and the company was beginning to get concerned, thus posting a request. This job was originally picked by Lucy, since the reward, in addition to a good chunk of Jewel, included some designer products. However, Lucy had fallen sick and Erza, who was also interested, had been called away by Jellal with an urgent message. So Wendy set out alone with the promise she'd share the spoils with her friends. Wendy liked clothes well enough, but not to the extent of those two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Looks like that's it!\" Wendy says, pointing down at the island below. Carla flies them down to the beach and the two land gracefully. Carla then assumes her more human form at the two survey the coastline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No sign of anyone so far...\" Carla says, worried. She hasn't had a specific premonition about this job, but can't shake the feeling something is wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah, and...\" Wendy sniffs the air. \"Something doesn't smell right. I can't put my finger on what, though...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The two head into the jungle for about half a mile before coming across a clearing with tents and a few per-fabricated buildings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"This must be the camp...\" Wendy says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The camp seems to be in disarray. Various items have been knocked to the ground and it's apparent whoever was here left quickly. Near an overturned chair Wendy spots what looks like part of a shirt, seemingly burned at the edges. She leans down to pick it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"WENDY, LOOK OUT!\" Carla screams. Wendy turns and ducks just in time for a phosphorescent blue slime to lunge at her chest. Wendy dodges at the last second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ah! What is that-\" But before she can finish her sentence, she feels a pull from behind. Something warm and wet on her back. Turning her head she can see one of the slimes has attached itself to her back and seems to be spreading. Without thinking, she shrugs out of her jacket and jumps away. She looks back to see her jacket fully enveloped by the slime. It dissolves quickly. Carla runs toward Wendy only to unknowingly step on one of the creatures. Her feet stick, but after a few furious tugs she frees herself, her stockinged feet emerging from the shoes, which are quickly absorbed by the creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"RUN!\" Wendy yells. The two make a mad dash out of the camp in a random direction, sickly squelching and rustling sounds following them close behind. Breaking in from the bush beside them, Wendy sees another slime, this one clearly in the form of a naked woman, grinning madly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Come baaaaaack!\" She jeers, her voice oily and strange. Wendy speeds up even more. Eventually they break through the jungle and find themselves on the beach, near a dock. Out in the water is a boat. There is a woman waving frantically, she pushes a gangway on to the dock and beckons furiously at the two wizards. Wasting no time Wendy and Carla sprint onto the dock and up the gangway, the slimes hot on their heels. The woman quickly withdraws the gangway and the slimes halt, some pulsing angrily on the dock, a few near the water, retreating as the waves inch toward them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"T-thank you...\" Wendy manages to choke out while catching her breath. She looks at her rescuer. She seems to be a woman in her 30s. On her upper body, she's wearing nothing but a bikini top and on her waist it looks like the remains of a lab coat fashioned into a crude kind of skirt. The woman looks at the emblem on Wendy's arm, clearly visible now her jacket is gone and she's just wearing a sleeveless blouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So you're wizards, huh? The company must have sent you to find us,\" The woman says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah...\" Wendy answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"C'mon inside, you've probably got a lot of questions.\" Wendy and Carla follow the woman inside the boat. There are about six other women in there, all in various states of undress. One is in nothing but her underwear. Another is topless and has fashioned a head-rag into a makeshift tubetop. There is a young girl of about ten as well. Her pants have been reduced to mere short-shorts, and her t-shirt has been melted to well above her midriff, exposing her tummy fully. Clearly those monsters don't discriminate based on age. Which should be obvious, Wendy muses, as they went after her and it's not like she's started to develop yet either...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What happened here?\" Wendy asks, her voice full of concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"My name is Felicia Darrow. I guess you can say I was the lead on this project. All of us here are employees of the Heart Kreuz fashion company. We had been on this island studying a pretty miraculous plant. It absorbed magic energy and took on a nearly fluid like substance. The idea was to turn the plant into a dye and put it in clothing. It was supposed to be like wearing water. We were certain it was going to be a hit. Then, about a week ago, two of our workers who had been looking for samples came across a cave and in that cave was something that looked like a very old tablet with ancient writing on it none of us could read. I told them to put it back and we'd send a note into an archaeology guild or something, but then...there was a blinding light and suddenly our samples started coming alive. They attacked us. Enrico, our mechanic, tried to fend them off, but they attached to him and burned him very badly.\" Felicia explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"The man!\" Wendy cuts in. \"Is he hurt? Is he still here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yes,\" Felicia says sadly, pointing to a bed at the far corner of a room. A grizzled looking man lies there, covered in bandages. Wendy rushes over to him to begin her healing spells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I wish I could have tended to these sooner. It will be harder for him to recover, it having been so long,\" Wendy says, sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Thank you, We are fortunate that you can help him, then. The stubborn old fool still keeps trying to get up to fix the ship. We tried to steer it out of here, but only Enrico knows how to steer it and we ran aground. In any case, the monsters burned Enrico. The women, though, they only tried to burn our clothes away. We ran for the boat, two carrying Enrico, me carrying my daughter, Sally, and we just made it. We were missing two of our workers but...they were right on top of us. We pulled the gangway away. Then...\" Felicia's face falls. \"One of the missing workers, Angeline, came out of the jungle, some of those things still attached to her. She was almost totally naked, save for a few scraps. Once the creatures finished those off they...they...\" Felecia covers her daughter's ears. \"They started...um...stimulating her...erm...erogenous zones.\" Wendy feels her face grow hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0'W-whaaat?\" She says, disbelieving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Y-yes, I was quite shocked as well. In any case, after Angeline couldn't...um...endure anymore more and...finished, the creature seemed to enter her. Then she...changed. She was Angeline, but...she looked like them now. Made of blue slime. And she started watching us like they did. They seem to be afraid of water for whatever reason. So it seems they want to...turn females into them, but they have to strip us totally naked to do so, and it also seems they can't pass water.\" Wendy looks pensively at the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well...what do we do now?\" Carla asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Sadly, our choices are pretty limited. Either you and I go back to that island and try to figure out what's going on, risking the monsters, or...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Or?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Or you fly back to the mainland to get help. I'm not sure I can handle this on my own and this could be dangerous to a whole lot of people if no one knows what's going on,\" Wendy answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Absolutely not! If I'm flying back I'm taking you with me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No, Carla. Someone needs to stay and protect these people, and since I can't fly that someone has to be me. If you go back to the mainland you could warn the guild. I bet Natsu could burn these things to nothing, or Gray could freeze them in their tracks. And since they don't seem to like water, Juvia would be perfect too. And if we can recover that tablet, maybe Levy could figure out what this all means. Also, if you could bring a boat back here to moor close to the island, we could evacuate everyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I...I could fly everyone off the island one at a time...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No, Carla. It's too far. You aren't strong enough, and if you collapse we'll lose the only means of contact we have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"But if I leave you'll be grounded with no way to fly! Those things might get you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0That was true. Wendy knows her choices are limited. She can either keep Carla here to explore the island and try to figure out the problem on their own with the benefit of flight. Or she could send Carla to the mainland for help. Finally, she might not be be able to evacuate <i>everyone</i>, but maybe one person...maybe the youngest. She could send Sally with Carla to keep her from harm, though this would undoubtedly slow Carla down, and likely make it take longer for her to get help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She has to make a decision.</span></div></div>",

Once again, none of her choices are great. She can stay on the ship with everyone, hoping the monsters don't adapt somehow to attack them and also hope they can stretch their meager rations long enough for Carla to arrive with rescue. Or she could brave the island again, attempting to gather supplies, info and maybe that tablet to give them an edge. She supposed she could also ask if one of the girls was willing to help her and perhaps recover more from the camp.</span></div></div>",

Wendy was beyond humiliated from these comments,here she was in her underwear in front of two people who she looked up to and wanted to be like. \"I'll never live this down,I won't ever get any respect and I'll lose what little I may have had!\" Wendy starting crying a little and ran away from her two older friends,who after a few seconds of laughing realized Wendy had run away crying.

Out from the bush come natsu and gray,natsu looks over to Wendy and then to gray and says\"told you my sense of smell could find her gray\". Wendy,with a big blush on her face says\"please! Don't look at me!\" Natsu and gray are confused,but look away. Gray then asks\"Wendy,we were worried about you. We came to find you,why exactly can't we look at you\"? Wendy then stutters out \"um my uh undies got ripped so I'm not wearing anything other than by bra\". Upon hearing this,gray and Natsu had a small blush on their faces. \"Why didn't you head back to your apartment to put on some new clothes\",Natsu asked? Wendy replied with\"I didn't want to be seen in my undies natsu! So I came here to wait until night.\" A few seconds passed and gray asked\"Wendy,how did you end up in your underwear in the first place? And why did you run away?\" Wendy let out a sigh and in a quiet soft voice said\" I ended up in my underwear because I was trying to stop the two of you from fighting. Your attacks must had ripped my clothes off. As for why I ran away,I didn't want two of the people I look up to the most to see me in such an embarrassing predicament. I knew if you did,I'd never gain your respect and proof to you I can be strong.\" When wendy finished,she had tears in her eyes.

Look at how much you've done at such a young age.\" Gray nodded at this showing he agreed with natsu's words. Upon hearing this Wendy stopped crying and said\"you really mean it?\" Both natsu and gray replied\"yeah of course\". Wendy then ran up to her older friends and gave them both a big hug, causing both to blush a tiny bit. Both natsu and gray ruffles the girls hair a little. Natsu then told Wendy to go wait behind a tree while he talked to gray. Wendy compiled and a few minutes later,natsu told her to come out. Hesitantly,she came out and saw natsu has taken off his shirt and gray his pants. Wendy was a bit confused as to why,but gray said\"Wendy,I know our clothes will be a bit big on you,but we want you to wear them but we wouldn't want our little sister to have to walk home practically naked.\" Wendy than said\"really? Thank you,that's so nice of you!\" Wendy then put on gray pants,which as expected were big on her but at least covered her up. She than out on natsu's best to cover up on top. Wendy than said\"ok you guys can look now\". Natsu and gray looked to Wendy and laughed a little\"wow,they really are big on you Wendy\". Wendy blushed a little and said \"yeah they really are, aren't they?\" She than laughed alongside them. Natsu and gray then stopped laughing and said\"Wendy, about before. We didn't mean to make you cry with what we said. We were just teasing you,you know that right?\" Wendy waited a few seconds and said\"yeah,that's just what big brothers do right? I'm sorry if I freaked out a little\". Natsu and gray pulled Wendy in for a hug and ruffled her hair. The three friends then walked out of the woods towards town. They talked along the way until they reached Fairy Hills,the dorm room female members of the guild can live at. Natsu and gray said goodbye to the girl who told them she would return their clothes tommorow. <br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Juvia Lockser wondered why fate was crueler than any Dark guild mage she had ever fought against... or with.  It should be a joyous time for her since she was now on a well-paying mission with her beloved.  There was just one snag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarlier that day, Juvia had stayed just ahead of Gray.  She had learned that staying close by staying ahead of her true love made him less suspicious.  She had it planned out that with nearly everyone already out on a mission, she would just need to wait near the board for Gray-sama to reach to pick a mission, she would simultaneously take it, and they would go together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she expected, Gray first talked to some of his guildmates.  This included Cana, and Juvia thought they talked for too long; and was she jiggling her jugs at him!  Granted, her attire would make most floozies blush, but bouncing busts should be forbidden near Gray-sama.  Juvia's anger turned melancholy as she realized that another one of her nakama had become love rival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like I just beat the storm,\" Lucy said as she entered the hall.  Sure enough, thunder crashed and rain started to aggressively pour down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Drip drip drop,\"  Juvia quietly said.  Her mood rose quickly as Gray moved to the board.  Using the stealth skills she had honed from staying by Gray, she sneaked over to the board.  Watching his hand, she timed it perfectly.  She closed her eyes when she felt their fingers touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Gray-sama.  Juvia guess we're fated to be together... on this mission\" Juvia said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that fair.  Even with a three way split makes the mission worthwhile,\" answered a voice that was decidedly not Gray's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuvia opened her eyes and realized that not only had Gray and her grabbed the highest paying non-S-Class mission, but so had Lucy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuvia fumed.  \"Lucy, proposing three ways with Gray-sama?  Unforgivable!  No doubt you waited for Gray to reach for this mission so you could go on it with him, you devious seductress!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy started to return that anger as the storm outside intensified.  \"Geez, what's with you water girls?  If anything, I grabbed the mission first, but it was close.  And for not the first hundredth time, I'm not interested in Gray!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies,\" Gray said, becoming concerned with how this would turn out, \"I'm fine going on the mission with you two if you won't fight like to alley cats....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy nodded and offered her right hand to Juvia.  Juvia looked at the red Fairy Tail stamp for a moment before accepting.  She also didn't want the chance of Gray and Lucy going without her.  \"Juvia will share dearest on this mission and work with my friend and rival.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray and Lucy glanced at each other wearily, which they should have known was seen by Juvia as lustfully.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should we head for the last known location of the outlaws now or do some research and planning first,\" Lucy asked in a way that indicated she preferred the latter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray shrugged and took off his shirt.  \"I don't think these two will be that strong, especially against the three of us.  I vote for going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuvia was saddened again.  She had arranged for a dinner with Gray before they left, but was sure how to do that now that they had a third wheel.  A buxom, blonde babe of a third wheel at that.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuvia was starting to second guess her conservative clothes again.  She preferred to be modest, but since all her guildmates seemed to be shoving their cleavage into her darling's face, maybe more risque was the way to heat up her love's heart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then realized that Gray and Lucy were looking at her waiting for her opinion on what to do</span></div></div>",

Lucy-san can do some research while Gray-sama and Juvia get supplies and eat at restaurant before leaving.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuvia suppressed a devious smile as the two nodded in agreement.  Lucy dug in her purse for some pen and paper.  Gray, semi-consciously took off his pants.  Gray was wearing his usual boxers, but enough to make his two companions blush.  Juvia didn't say anything since she was scheming; Lucy didn't say anything since she didn't want to set off Juvia again.  Lucy did loudly lament Gray's stripping habit in her head though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here.  Write down the address and time to meet at the restaurant.\"  Lucy began to read over the fine print of the mission with a semi-interested Gray as Juvia wrote it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuvia passed the note.  Lucy smiled.  \"Thanks.  This should be fun.  Oh, and look, the sun's coming out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy left while Gray shook his head, wondering how the ordinarily smart Lucy wasn't thinking about how Juvia's moods affected the weather.  Juvia took Gray's reluctant arm as they went to his apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe she's this late,\" Gray said with annoyance as the desert came.  \"Forget dinner, she's going to miss the train!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps Lucy-san changed her mind and decided to take a different mission.  And to let us being alone,\" Juvia proposed and poured some more wine for love and herself.  She felt cool, having changed into a blue dress with a low cut at the neckline and a high cut in the hemline.  He shoes were matching peep toe kitten heels that showed her pretty feet well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGray shrugged.  They finished there food and waited a few more minutes before Gray sighed and gestured with his head to the door and the train station not too far away.  Juvia nodded and moved close to Gray that her partly on-display, perky boobs pressed against his as they left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were on the train and departing when Lucy walked into the restaurant, arriving what she understood to be a little early.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuvia looked at the twin bed in the train compartment.  She had originally planned on having separate ones for her and Gray, but as a means of blocking out Lucy if she got to the train, she had canceled one of them.  Now it was a modest-sized room where Juvia's thoughts were anything but.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuvia had gotten Gray and herself a nightcap drink and he was presently in the restroom.  Juvia looked at the small mirror on the nightstand as she undressed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was completely bare, she paused and considered a few options.  Should she get under the covers nude and await Gray-sama to come and then ravish her all night?  Or would it be better to put on her bareback teddy that would allow Gray-sama the thrill of undressing her and then ravish her all night?  Or would it be even better to put on her teddy covered by a robe, discuss their mission and budding affection until Gray-sama decided to strip her and then ravish her all night?  Hmm...</span></div></div>",

Though having failed to achieve S-Class five times, Cana has considerable latent potential within her, possibly due to her father, Gildarts, being Fairy Tail's strongest wizard. She utilizes card magic, throwing cards with various effects in battle.

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\"> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Fairy Tail is the most famous wizard guild in all of Fiore. Situated in the town of Magnolia, it is home to some of the country's strongest wizards and some of its most beautiful women, and there's plenty of overlap in that score as well. While they are certainly known for their capacity for destruction and their unfortunate habit of getting in to trouble, they are also known for their strong sense of duty, honor and loyalty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Lately, though. the girls seems to be getting in to even <i>more</i> trouble than usual. They seem to being having a hard time keeping their clothes on. What will come of these unfortunate situations? Maybe you'll find the answer inside. Maybe you'll create the answer yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Rules For Additions:</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. No growth/shrink, bodymod or vore. Yeah, I know the setting has magic, but threads like that tend to distract from the ENF parts.<br>\r\n2. No scat/pee/diaper or anything related to bodily functions of that kind.<br>\r\n3. No gore, disturbing violence or death.<br>\r\n4. Sex is okay, so long as it has proper lead up. You can even do ecchi/hentai things like tentacles or some domming and even bdsm style situations are fine, if not encouraged. All I ask is that you keep the tone light/funny/sexy. Don't make it dark or disturbing. This is supposed to be an erotic comedy.<br>\r\n5. It's fine for the male characters to show up. This isn't going to be a girls-only story or anything. I think most of the POVs will end up being female (at least the ones I set up), but men are allowed in the story for sure.</td>",
