It was said that any who could face the temples hardships and trials would be granted a power from Aphrothera herself.  For Link, this power could be useful in the continuing struggles to protect Hyrule from the forces of evil.  There was just one problem: The Temple of Aphrothera could only be accessed by a woman.  And Link was a man.  Which brings us to where we are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink stood patiently in the center of circle drawn in chalk.  Around the edges were mystic symbols.  And on either side of Link were the symbols for man and woman.  Princess Zelda finished the last of the symbols before stepping back to see if the symbols matched up correctly.  Once she was sure she looked to Link.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Link, everything is in place.  Are you still sure you want to go through with this?\" Zelda asked in concern.  Changing genders was an extreme thing to do.  While she respected Link's courage, she often found his desire for adventure to dip into stupidity.  While she could see why taking the challenge of the Temple could be rewarding, it wasn't exactly necessary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink looked back to Zelda, stern look in his eye, and nodded firmly.  He was determined to see this adventure to the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda gave a sigh of resignation.  \"Alright, let's get this over with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Zelda concentrated on her magic, focusing it through her hands and into the circle surrounding Link.  As the magic took affect, the chalk lines began to glow a soft purple.  The purple light the spread into the circles center towards Link and passed up his body.  The changes were immediate.  First his feet shrank.  Then his legs became smooth and shapely.  Then his penis and testicles retreated into his body forming a vagina and ovaries.  Then his, now her, hip popped outwards.  Her belly pulled in next, becoming curved and thin.  After that, her chest bubbled out as a pair of D-cup breasts formed.  Her arms and hands soon mimicked her legs and feet, becoming dainty and slender.  Her neck's contractions caused her a few grunts that grew more light with each second.  Finally, her face began to change, softening cheek bones, growing eyelashes, and growing her hair down to her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the light faded, Zelda became the first to see the final result.  There stood Link, the Heroine of Time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow what shall Link do?</span></div></div>",

Zelda kind of felt bad for Link as Link was trying to save the world, but she could not forgive him for what he did before. Link figured out Zelda was disguised as Sheik, and during the battle with Phantom Ganon in the Formest Temple, he told the Phantom Sheik told him about the temple and was Zelda the whole time! This offended Zelda very bad, and deciding of what she was about to do was a proud thing to do.     \"Um.. Okay Link, I will teach you the ways of being a woman like me and others.\"Zelda said. Both Zelda and Link started the lesson, and the first one was a banana. \"Link, this fruit is a sign of respect to both men and women, it comes in different objects, but as long as you see the shape of this banana, respect it.\" Zelda lied. Poor for Link, he was all ears to Zelda. \"For this greeting, you need to open your mouth and keep it open.\" Link opened her mouth as followed and Zelda then inserted the banana to Link's mouth. \"Now Link, dont eat it just hold the banana there and suck it. Dont feel shy, we women do it all the time.\" Zelda said. Link did not doubt anything and did as she was told. Link then felt great doing what she was doing, an experience never expected to be good. Zelda could not believe what she got away with, and when looking at Link once again, Link gave a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd for the first time in Link's life, with the help of the female transformation, she spoke. \"That... Felt nice...\" Link said. \"Umm yeah Link, good job. Now I think there is a last lesson you should problably know before going.\" Zelda said. \"What is it... Zelda?\" Link, with a beautiful female voice said. Zelda then told her, \"In a womens life, to show peace and happiness, we bend down, showing our butt. Trust me, monsters will not attack you once you do it. Whoever sees it, he or she will plug something in the middle of your butt as a token of friendship. They can also squeeze and feel your round butt, and that is valid. Just remember to keep a smile Link no matter what.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink heard all of this very carefully and agreed. \"Oh, and before I forget, if you moan, it is natural. It is a sign of a good woman, if you understand Link. And the most important thing you need is how to kiss. A kiss is a sign of yes or no, so when you kiss someone, hold your mouth and move it with passion.\" Zelda finally commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink then practice what Zelda told her to do, bending down for the first time, which left Link a feeling of satisfaction and freedom. Link then asked Zelda, \"Can I get something to kiss with?\" Zelda responded \"Sure Link, here, take this soft rock in form of a mouth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink kissed the rock and felt turned on, not wanting to stop telling the rock of a \"Yes\" or \"No.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you very much zelda for your help. Getting with this dungeon will be a piece of cake.\"Link telled zelda. But before Link left, Zelda stopped her and told her women do not need weapons or items. Link realized it and apologized. Link then left her equipment to Zelda and left with her male clothes (Were kind of big for Link to wear, hanging them with her hands from falling) and a piece of womanhood, a vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink entered the dungeon. What happens?</span></div></div>",

Meanwhile, Ganondorf noticed Link was near his castle, and that could only mean he finished all the temples where he sealed the sages. \"Impossible! How did he manage to beat my minions?\" Ganondorf exclaimed. He soon knew that there was a way to solve his problem, and that was by kidnapping Link as soon as he saw an opening. Ganondorf then rushed to his room of spells, and before he could even tell, he found the spell that would save both him and his castle. \"Perfect! Now let me see what it can offer.\" Ganonforf said. The spell was to transform monsters or hylians into women. It was weird for the fact it was a book from the royal family of hyrule. The spell could turn a person into a woman, and it could put that woman to be the servant of the person who casted the spell. Ganondorf was interested in this, as he had no other person living with him. In conclusion, the woman could be transformed to a beautiful princess or a sexy maid, but it would keep their original personality and mind. <br>\r\nWhich costume does Ganondorf want for his future servant Link?</span></div></div>",

The only thing of any interest, was a box sitting on the bed. The hero of time walked over, opening the box up. Inside, was a corset, a bodysuit, a mask of Zelda's head, a wig of her hair along with her outfit. Along with that stuff, a note laid at the bottom of the box.

But, there was no turning back. He slipped the dress, gloves and heels on and headed over to Zelda's vanity table. There, he stared into the mirror and fitted the face mask on. After he was sure it was on properly, he fitted the wig on followed by her crown and triforce earrings. After, she dug into the vanity and pulled some make-up products out.

It wasn't really a tunic, more of a costume of a female zora.<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" Link answered and unzipped the tunic. He immediately pulled his boots off, slipping his legs into the costume. He then zipped that part up and looked it over. His legs were now covered in the dark cyan and pale blue fabric with two ulnar fins attached. The left fin was attached to the left side of his knee. The right fin was attached to the right side of his knee. He then fitted the rest of the costume on, looking at his reflection. The skin on his legs was now on his body, with two C-size breasts hanging out. An ulnar fin hung to the exact same sides to the ones on his legs. His hands and feet were now webbed, possibly to improve his swimming. All that was left for him to do, was put the mask on. The pale was colored pale blue, with holes for the eyes to see through. Kissable blackish blue lips complimented the face along with the fin-like ears. The top was strangely colored dark cyan with a hammerhead shape. Along with that, their seemed to be an eye in the left and right ends of the head.<br>\r\n\"Ready to do this?\" Navi remarked and Link nodded. He dived into the pool, ready to tackle the water temple...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After Link and Navi separated, Link dove back into the watery depths of the temple, thinking they may have missed something underwater. As he swam towards the bottom of the temple, he started to notice how the suit he was wearing was starting to feel kinda like a second skin with how the water felt on it as it flowed around him. It felt wonderful on him as he swam exactly like a Zora now. On top of that, breathing in the water now felt just as easy as it did when he was on land. But the things he really noticed was that the suit's nipple like features felt like they were erect and there was also a very warm sensation between his legs, which normally Link would start freaking out at, but for some reason, he didn't. Soon enough, Link emerged into an empty room that was behind one of the sliding cage panels and it was a room he wasn't familiar with. He saw a chest where he was too, but his attention wasn't focused on that right, but rather the warm sensation between his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I've got some privacy for now, might as well see about this feeling I'm getting right now.\" Link said, not even noticing his now higher pitched voice, making him sound more like a girl. He took his hand and put it on the area where the sensation was at, which made him suddenly let out a sharp gasp as two fingers penetrated what felt like a pussy, which indicated Link wasn't a 'he' anymore. She moved her two fingers around in her new pussy, causing her to pant in pleasure as she took her other free hand and began massaging her breasts with it, the suit no longer a costume. The female Zora suit had merged with Link and he was now a female Zora that was currently in heat. She continued to pleasure her scaly, silver colored body, sending waves of pleasure throughout her body as she thought about many male and even female Zoras fucking her in many ways, which sent her over the edge as she came all over her hand and passed out from the pleasure, unaware of the changes to reality that were taking place right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, the new female Zora woke up with no recollection of where she was or even who she was. But then her 'memories' returned to her. Her name was Marina, a female Zora who was bisexual and was willing to get it on with any of the Zoras, but she was currently in the sacred Water Temple to help Princess Ruto, a Zora she had a huge crush on, find a way to restore the Zora's Domain. But she was currently in heat and was having a hard time focusing on the task at hand, as she was trying to find a way to cure the intense heat and agonizing pain in her pussy by any means necessary. Then all of a sudden, Marina heard a gate opening. She turned towards the water and saw someone surface from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you are Marina, what are you doing here?\" came another female voice. It was Ruto herself as Marina blushed that the princess had discovered her, but thankful she had done her business for now before she had arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I just got here actually.\" Marina lied, as she had been there for a while. But fortunately for her, the princess believed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, alright. Well this annoying fairy helped me solve the problems going on here at the temple, even though it died while helping me take care of the monster responsible for everything. Anyway, Lake Hylia should be restored by now and our home should be thawing out now.\" Ruto explained, much to Marina's delight knowing that their home would be back to the way it was soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good to know. We should get out of here then.\" Marina said, to which Ruto nodded. But before the two female Zoras could dive back into the water, Ruto smelled something in the air. Something she was familiar with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you just arrived here Marina? Because from the smell in the air, it seems like you were here for a while.\" Ruto said, much to Marina's embarrassment as she blushed heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm so sorry your highness, it's just that-\" She was cut off by Ruto placing a finger on her lips, silencing her as Ruto just gave her a warm smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright, I know when I helped thaw you out, you were in heat. It's really bad isn't it? Intense heat and pain that makes you go crazy and drives you to the point where you need to do whatever it takes to take care of those problems. I know because I'm in heat too.\" Ruto admitted, much to Marina's shock as she noticed how close her face was to Ruto's. Marina knew this was probably going to be her only chance at this and if she didn't take it now, she would probably never get another chance. Marina slowly started to close the gap between her and Ruto before, eventually, she went for it all and kissed the princess. She had completely expected Ruto to instantly back away disgusted by this action, which only made Marina even more surprised when Ruto began kissing her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Marina, it felt like a dream come true as she wrapped her arms around Ruto's neck, bringing the princess further into the kiss while Ruto wrapped her own arms around Marina's lower back, all the while bringing her closer to the water which they eventually fell into, though for them, the water seemed to cushion them in their own passion as Marina arched herself while continuing to kiss her princess in shining scales as they floated deep in the water, though she was so lost in the kiss that she didn't feel Ruto leading them somewhere. Soon enough, Ruto had lead them back to the starting room of the temple as they finally separated, though they continued to stare into each others eyes, light purple staring into deep blue, both filled with passionate love for the other. Eventually, Marina noticed where they were at as Ruto smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Follow me so we can have some real fun.\" Ruto said seductively as she hopped out of the water and onto a part of the stone that shown brightly with torches, giving Marina a good view of her ass and pussy, which Marina could was wet, but couldn't tell if it was wet from the water or the heat. But either way, seeing both that and her glorious ass made Marina blush brightly as she followed the princess into an unfamiliar room. It was a kinda boxed shape room with what appeared to be broken spikes next to each wall. In the middle of the room was oddly colored water with four pillars sticking out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What room is this?\" Marina asked, though she heard Ruto quietly giggle as she suddenly pushed the female Zora into the odd colored water. Marina soon found that the water felt tingly and she couldn't breathe it as easily as she could with regular water. She also couldn't see as clearly either, but she was able to see Ruto hop in with her. Marina was about to question what was up with the water, but she suddenly felt something go into her pussy, making her moan loudly as she surfaced, with Ruto's head popping above this water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember when I said the monster was taken care of? Well what I meant was it's tamed now and it apparently likes to use it's body to pleasure female Zoras. This water we're swimming in now is the monster and it's going to pleasure us until I say for it to stop.\" Ruto revealed before she kissed Marina once more, with the two females feeling the water around them begin for form tentacles over their bodies. Marina moaned into Ruto's mouth as she felt the tentacles start massaging her breasts while another one also went into her ass, making Marina moan louder as she felt it slither in her own body. She then felt it suddenly come up her throat, somehow not cutting off her oxygen, leave her mouth and go into Ruto's mouth, going through her body the same way it went through Marina's, but in reverse. As soon as it came out of Ruto's ass, it then penetrated her pussy, making Ruto moan into Marina's mouth now. To the two Zoras as they continued to be pleasured by the tentacles and each other, this felt like heaven and they didn't want it to stop any time soon. However, eventually, the pleasure they were feeling was too much and they passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they woke up, Marina and Ruto both saw that they were now on a small island in Lake Hylia. The monster must have brought them out here after it finished it's business with the two female Zora lovers, who smiled at each other as Marina no longer felt any heat or pain coming from her pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that thing works wonders.\" Marina stated as Ruto just smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but now it's time we head home.\" Ruto said as Marina decided...</span></div></div>",

After all of the excitement and adventure, it was nice to have a quiet afternoon for once. Queen Zelda's castle was being rebuilt and the Bulblins made peace with the rest of Hyrule. Link sighed, content with the state of the world at last. Could things get any better than this? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Link's fishing pole nearly jumped out of his hands! He got a bite! Reacting quickly, the Hero of Light began reeling in the unknown creature, who was strong enough to give even a hero as strong as Link a difficult time. The fish dragged the little boat all around the pond, dashing it against the rocks and under bridges until at last, Link gave one final tug and out came...an ugly blue fish about as long as his palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y'all better let me go, partner, 'fore I slap you in the head!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink simply stared for a few moments. Was this fish talking? And was such a little thing what gave him such trouble?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lookee here,\" The fish said, \"I ain't no reg'lar fish. Ah'm a magic fish. Set me free and you'll get something really cool!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink, not wanting to upset the magic fish and deciding that she would not be very tasty anyway, put her back into the water. The fish dove into the water and resurfaced with what looked like a message in a bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This here's a recipt for some sorta magic potion.\" The fish explained, \"I can't remember what it does, but the ingredients can be found all over yer home.\" Just don't mess up the ingredients or I don't even know what'll happen. Oh yeah! And one more thing, sugah, when y'all mix the potion up, don't drink it after midnight or it'll become perminent. Kay! Ah'm off See ya!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, the fish dove back into the water, leaving a bewildered Link  holding the recipe. What should he do?</span></div></div>",

The Magic in the temple was long gone ever since the fairies abandoned it long ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda was getting ready to give the order to head towards to the last stronghold to face Cia when Link stopped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink tries to express his concerns to Zelda. \"Hey Zelda don't you think that this just a bit to convenient that Cia is not only here but practically defenseless? I mean this has Trap! Written all over it to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda responded trying to reassure Link. \"Look Link if the enemy makes a mistake and leaves them vulnerable<br>\r\nWe should jump at the chance to take it Cia must think that she can get some kind of magic from this place despite the fairies being gone and i doubt that this is a trap because if it was she probably wouldn't have let us have this place surrounded like we do so please just try to focus. Zelda began to return to the battle but Link stopped her again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look I Trust your judgement Zelda but just promise me if things start look bad that you'll give the order to retreat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda took notice of how worried Link was\" Fine if things get to bad I promise to give the retreat order ok but right know please just Focus we are so close to ending this nightmare\" and with that Zelda started to head towards the last stronghold of the enemy <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink just follows her despite his concerns. \"I hope she knows what she's doing. but she is right i do need to focus if this is a trap I need to be ready.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so they came face to face with Cia and her few troops of grunts that she had with her. Zelda run up in front of the group and started to speak \"It's over Cia we have you out numbered and trapped just surrender and we can end this peacefully.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCia just started chuckle a bit at the princesses remarks \" That's Cute yes you have indeed won princess but little do you know that's exactly what I what.\" Cia then pointed her scepter at them shooting a giant black wave of energy  that made all of the soldiers in the area to fall unconscious. And then a  dark circle went around Zelda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda started to panic \"What is this? What are you tr.....uh!\"  Zelda had become completely still and silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink saw this and tried to intervene, but then the same spell that made the soldiers pass, out began to effect him as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCia laughed and said. \"You know what they say if you  can't beet them be them.\" And then a another dark circle went around herself, and she began to charge some kind of magic in her hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink didn't know what Cia was trying to do but he had to stop it. Even though he was about to pass out he couldn't let what ever Cia was trying to do to Zelda happene. So he gathered all his strength and ran to get Zelda out of there!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCia saw Link coming though. \"oh my darling such a hero, but that's what I love about you.\" She looked at the grunts that were there and was about to order them to stop him. But she was surprised to that her spell from earlier had  affected them as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What! Are you doing get up dammit! Uh! \" but then Link shoved Zelda out of the circle landing unconscious on the ground. But when Link stepped in the circle himself he like Zelda just stood there in a daze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCia yelled.\" no not you!\" But it was to late the circle's around them began to shined a blinding light from the center of them and when it disappeared Link and Cia where at opposite sides of were they were and then Cia's body fell over unconscious leaving a distressed looking (Link???).<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He'd met the strange people of this world, who managed to find a modicum of peace in the world that had been wracked by the Calamity Ganon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now, after days of pushing through the Gerud desert, each step more difficult than the last, he had to dress as a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLife was a very peculiar thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe merchant said he looked like a \"good looking gal\" in this, but that was easier to say when Link wasn't in danger of getting tossed out any minute.

It was just tradition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGerudo Town was bustling with activity as the Gerudo women shopped at the market, gossiped about local going-ons, with tourists examining the various wares that were available. It was difficult attempting to exude normal confidence in this outfit. The Gerudo dress covered his chest and face, leaving his midriff bare to the elements. He was sure he would get caught any second and branded a pervert. But, so far, everyone just said hi to the Hylian vai.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started to relax.

I have heard hylian vai are bery sensitive with their figures. Take care.\" As Link saw the gerudo walk away, he looked at his body. His hips were now shaped as an hourglass figure, as well as a bubble butt (a good round butt that a woman would dream of). Link was shocked and ran to an empty valley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink looked down his body and more changes happened. His arms and legs became soft and slender, giving a feminine look. Link got a little dizzy as he felt his gerudo pants were giving a massage to his thighs, expanding its size, with a more soft skin. His legs shrinked, putting Link's size to be smaller, close to 5'5 feet high. His original height was 5'10 . His feet shrinked as well, and the gerudo flats adjusted to his feet size of 7. Link tried to stand up from the ground, but do to his feminized changes in the bottom body made him fall. He then felt there were more changes, being to the upper half of the body. But before that happen, Link felt a horryfying experience, where his penis started to shrink, up to the momemt he felt his organs changed. The penis swelled inside and the internal organs transformed into ovaries. Finally, a hole between his two sexy thighs was created and made Link moan. \"Ahhhh!!!\" Link then felt the gerudo top to extend from his chest. His chest popped out two soft breasts, at a C-32 cup size. He moaned once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink then felt a weird shift on his face. His sharp face became a round face of beautiful vai hylian. His lips were more feminine, with soft touch and with a pink color on his lips. Link's eyelashes were longer and well pointed for her eyes. His kneck became tight, slend, soft and small, losing his adam's apple (male voice). Finally, Link felt his hair growing longer, losing his rubber that kept a small pony tail. The hair reached the way down to his butt, with a shiny blonde and soft look, a thing that would make Linj a model.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink finally felt the transformation of the vai gerudo clothes were over, so now she (became a beautiful hylian vai) was able to stand up. It took most of the noon for Link' s feminized transformation, with the sunset becoming a nightime. Link felt very light walking with her new body, and the gerudo flats were very uncomfortable to walk on moments later. Her breasts kept bouncing up and down, and Link gave out small moans.

What can I do?\" Link answered with worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Gerudo took a peek at Link's body and clothes and thought of something with a smile. She then called out at Link and told her, \" Well, you can do something young vai, perhaps beneficial to a friend of mine.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink was curious of this deal the Gerudo was telling her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will that help me stay for the night?\" Link demanded with hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, as long as you help a friend of mine. Besides, my friend requires a young hylian vai to help a little problem of hers. So are you in?\" The Gerudo commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink, with no other choice as everything had tired her body and eyes, accepted to the deal the gerudo made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok then, take a bed and you will start by tomorrow to aid my friend's problem.\" The Gerudo announced to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you very much ma'am.\" Link thanked her with a very feminine tone, as well as putting a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink picked the closest bed to sleep in and carefully laid on it due to her body and began to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gerudo forgot to tell Link something about but Link was already fallen asleep deeply.<br>\r\n\"I forgot to tell her about my friend secretly taking her to her place before morning. Oh well, it is better for this gal to rest for her task. She seems to have experience at it due to her body.\" The gerudo whispered and later went back to her position in the job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time passed by and the friend that the gerudo mentioned about came to the Inn and found Link.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the one that will aid my task?\" The gerudo who was the one with the issue said.<br>\r\n\"Yes, it  is her. Take her now before she wakes up.\" the gerudo employee demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, the other gerudo carefully picked Link behind her back and left the Inn ( Gerudos are stronger than common Hylians, specially if they are women,. Poor Link).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink was taken to...<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Link looked at herself and thought of her being a sexy female gal was just a dream. Just to make sure, Link touched her boobs, which were size 32C, and gave a moan once again (Calm down Link!). Shortly after that incident, Link looked around the area she was in and gasped with horror. It was a medium sized room, which had tons of boxes spread out in the room and Link was in the middle of the room laying on a bed full of hay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where am I?!\" Link exclaimed. She felt a terrifying emotion on her chest, forcing herself to hug on her boobs. Link later heard footsteps coming from a dark corner and, without anything to do defend herself with, she begged to the shadowy figure,<br>\r\n\"Did you kidnap me? What did I deserve to be here? I will do anything for you, but please let me go!\" Link begged with a voice that was just to sweet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure came closer and revealed who she was; a Gerudo.<br>\r\n\"Please keep it down young princess, you already ruined my good sleep. Unlike you, which you slept exactly as a princess would sleep.\" the Gerudo blurted out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who.. Who are you? And why am I in this place instead of the Inn?\" Link intervened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Gerudo laughed to what Link asked and responded, <br>\r\n\"Well, it is usual for someone for a vai hylian for you to ask, so I will be nice to you princess. I am Greta, owner of the Secret Club, an exotic clothing shop for people like voe to come here!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreta, who was the mysterious Gerudo, was similar to the other Gerudos in town but had short hair, neck-reach, and looked athletic to the looks of Link by the abs clearly showing, as well as the muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought my friend told you that you were going to wake up somewhere else safe. Guess she forgot. As always.\" Greta said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink felt relieve once she knew she was not kidnapped as this body of hers was not suitable for combat, instead, by the knowledge Link gained from this new body, it was for being a model, a person for girly purposes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't mind that now, but this does not look like a store.\" Link commented to Greta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are right. My business for selling voe clothes on a town only for princesses like you was not the best idea. I spend here 5 years waiting for a voe to buy my products, so that was a failure.\" Greta continued, now focusing on Link and her body, \"However, that is where you special hylian princess come to aid, instructed from my friend in the Inn. I managed to convince some of my outside sellers to get any exotic female clothes, no matter what. To my surprise, my sellers brought me all these types of clothes inside these boxes you see. Unfortunately, I was warned that these were not suitable for Gerudos, except for vai hylians. With my sense of fashion, I require to know how these exotic clothes suit a costumer that comes here,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreta took a good look at Link, and Link noticing it, gave an embarrassed face and covered herself with her hands as much as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are an interesting one, princess. By the way, those clothes do not suit you whatsoever. Here, take this at least so you can feel a little bit... comfortable. This is part of the task I need you to help me in.\" Greta giggled as she reached a small box and threw pieces of cloth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink was handed..... <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This is absurd.\" Link argued back to her while still holding the underwear which were soft and Link could not drop them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And stop calling me princess! My name is Link.\" Link added to her little protest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreta then looked around the room, pretending to have not heard that and then jumped above Link and in a box she found a scythe and once Link blinked, there was a sharp object surrounding her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look here, princess. Even if you have another name. I dont care. Your character defines of a princess, and what I am offering you is perhaps the nicest thing I have done to a vai like you.... Link. If you go against me like this, do not expect to wake up any longer. Understand?\" Greta fiercely warned Link, slowly pulling the scythe on to Link's neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry! Please dont kill me! I'm sorry! I will not go against you Miss Greta.\" Link responded quickly before she was dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreta then separated the scythe away from Link and told her,<br>\r\n\"That is much better princess. Hope you are sure of those words you said. You may just be the best princess I have ever met. See? We are getting along much better.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink then kneeled on the floor after experiencing heavy pressure on her life. Greta gave a smile and reached to another box, grabbing a pair of white wedge heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the bad behavior you gave princess, you will also wear these. They are good quality. Here.\" Greta offered as Link accepted them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now put on the clothes I gave you. now.\" Greta ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Link hated to do this thing, she had no other choice but to do it as she was almost at the edge of death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Miss Greta.\" Link accepted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink began to remove the gerudo veil first. It was the easiest part, but feeling her golden long hair made it odd but soft. She then removed her giant flats that to be honest with Link, were a pain to walk as they were heavier than ever before. The feet and head were now done, but the hardest part had yet to come to Link.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gerudo garb and sirwal were the hardest thing for Link to do. She looked at Greta and she gave her the death stare. Linj had to do this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink then removed her garb first, which soon led her boobs expand and reach freedom. The gloves she had were removed and Link was very shy to look at her amazing boobs, which fortunately did not ripped the garb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, Link slowly removed her sirwal. It was loose, so being careful with it was meaningless. The fine bubble ass was revealed at its glory, having been out of that sirwal, and Greta secretely was impressed to this discovery. The thighs did their job of being sexy when Link continued to pull the sirwal down. The thighs showed a slender and thick image to whoever was seeing it. The shorts Link had as a man fell off instantly and the vagina he wished not yo see first was revealed too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink was now a sexy naked gal, and with so much embarrassment on her face, Link grabbed the panty first and inserted them first.<br>\r\nThe pink panty helped to position the fine ass Link had, resulting on a perfect circle to just touch on.Link felt the panty so soft she gave a moan and noticed her ass was more thick than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bra came after and Link tried to put it on. The difficult was the back of her bra, having to connect the two buttons. It took some tine but Link was done with that part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe white wedge heels Link was given as punishement were the final step to completion. Link carefully put them on in a sexy manner, showing her clean legs in a straight position. Once she put the heels, Link had to tighten the ankle strap of the wedge heel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink then straighten herself like a soldier and Greta could not believe the gold she had found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This.. All of this is... Extraordinary! Oh princess, you are my savior. Look at this body. You are the best princess to have ever looked this way!\" Greta complemented to a sexy model named Link.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreta reached up to Link's boobs, which were now even more bigger and had the perfect cleavage, and began squishing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh.. Ohhh..ahhh... Aaaahhhh.... Ahhh.. Aaaaahhh...\"Link moaned at her best performance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreta stopped and Link kneeled again with a horny face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go now and let you try out these clothes in the boxes over here princess!\" Greta announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink recovered and followed Greta, having now become a sexy gal on full power. This made Greta happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope this is over soon so I can find out what made become a sexy gal.\" Link whispered secretly, making sure for Greta to have not heard her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Link is still him, in a sexy gal's body)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink, with much greater difficulty on walking on heels, having to hold hands with Greta to keep balance, reached a box full of.....</span></div></div>",

However, Greta noticed Link's difficulty on balancing on her heels that she had to hold her hand to help Link walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greta, why are these heels so tall? I could have walked better on my flats.\" Link wined, almost sounding as a complaining spoil princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember those heels were your punishment for defying me, princess. And for your information, those heels are wedges and are 3 feet tall, not bad for a princess for you to walk with. Weird that you are struggling with those based on your body.\" Greta informed Link while coming near a box that had labeled \"To your service.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink looked down at her white heels and stopped to unhand herself from Greta's hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing princess, do you really want to fall?\" Greta asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will teach you I need no help from you with this heels!\" Link proclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Link became a sexy gal, he never needed any help from strangers to assist him on a quest or any other thing. He would teach himself how to do it, so the thing Greta did for Link now as a gal had an impact of his character of a man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink straighten up herself and began to walk by herself. The heels were now a challenge for Link to master even though this was a girly thing to do, but Link's character could not resist it. Link put a step forward on her right heel and balanced it successfully. She did it with the left heel and succeeded. But Link was going slow at this point and she did not master the manner of walking on it yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are so funny princess!\" Greta laughed, but then gave a serious look soon afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreta picked Link up with her arms and carried her to an isolated chair and sat Link there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha.. What are you doing Greta?!\" Link yelled as she was unable to fight back Greta's strong agility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need you to stop messing around princess! It is almost nighttime and I need to finish the task!\" Greta continued, as she was pulling Link's ears.<br>\r\n\"So I need to tie you here and start right away! We do not have much time. So be silent and patient while I pick the product for you to wear, but I will help put it on for you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreta grabbed rope that was used for the box that contained Link's new set of clothes and tied her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink's hands were tied behind the chair, her ankles, which had the heels' ankle strap, was tied to the chair, and for Greta's benefit, she tied Link's boobs as well to the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAAHHHHHH!!\" Link moaned as loud as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreta ignored her and reached to the box. There, She ripped the cover of the box and found a bag that had a mysterious set of clothes. Greta then opened it and revealed the clothes Link was about to wear for this task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just please let me go Greta! I do not like to be treated this way!\" Link begged, with tears coming out of her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're crying princess? Oh, this is sad! Little princess wants to go home. If you want to so bad, do these final steps to solve my task and then you leave!\" Greta argued with anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink realized that she was crying and it was so uncommon for her to cry, specially as a guy. She then slowly stopped crying so she could notlet those girly emotions get to Link, not yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreta pulled the clothes for Link to wear, and to Link's memory, what she was to wear was the most girly thing to wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A MAID'S Outfit?!\" Link yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's hurry. Do not move.\" Greta warned Link.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clothes were of a French Maid costume, but this one in particular was a sexy one for a gal like Link to wear. It had a tight off-shoulder black dress, a white half-apron, a white ruffled headpiece for Link's shinning hair, a long black stockings that reached fully to Link's thighs. and black stiletto heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did Link do?<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Link wanted to fight, but she already knew it was impossible as her body was only for being sexy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greta, why become this mad?' Link commented as Greta was getting closer to her along with the maid outfit. Sadly, Greta ignored Link and was preparing for putting Link the clothes on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink got a little sad and looked at the maid outfit once again. Link then took a deep breath and knew Greta was doing this because she had not spent time with a foreign person in a long time. Link remembered before that she had never seen Greta in the past, both in or out of Gerudo Town. What Link was doing was the key for Greta to have new friends and be popular, that is why she is mad. Greta calling Link a princess was a nickname for a friend and Link did not noticed that as she had a male conscious before becoming a hot gal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink also knew this was a thing she got involved herself in. So once this task is done, Link will look for assistance on terms of transforming into a woman through those gerudo vai clothes she received.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink then was looking at Greta and saw her untie her but decided to just be dressed. Link was now standing on her wedges and was pushed to a wall. Link stood still and witnessed her heels being taken off by Greta. Link was now only on a bra and a panty in a feminine color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not move.\" Greta said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't.\" Link accepted the sentence greta delivered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe floor was now cold, informing Link it was nighttime already. Link now preferred to have still wore those wedges from before as the cold ground was killing her feet, wanting to move but could not because of Greta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreta grabbed the pair of black stockings first and slipped them on Link's legs. Link assisted her by straightening up her leg, feeling slowly but very soft a black stocking go up through her legs all the way to the thighs, were the stocks did their magic. The thighs were now more shaped and reavealing than any before!<br>\r\nNext, Greta grabbed the ruffled headpiece and perfectly landed it on Link's hair. It was tight a tiny bit, and this annoyed Link in the inside as she could aknowledge even more that her golden hair was long and soft. <br>\r\nLater, Greta began to grab the tight off-shoulder black dress, which by its fabric, was elegant enough for a woman searching for love (Link did not know this).<br>\r\nLink was shaking a little bit as this was going to be her first time wearing a dress, and it was a sexy one. One enough for Link to hate.<br>\r\nGreta lifted Link's soft and slender arms up in the air and Link held them up as instructed. Greta then slided the dress down onto Link's body and boobs, and to the fear Link had, the dress tighten up her back, forcing her to be straighten up at all time, and the dress also showed the perfect hourglass figure Link had. Not only that, but Link's boobs were tighten as well and, due to her great C-cup boob size, the boobs were now a perfect shaped sphere that a pervert would want to dive in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAWWWWHHHH....\" Link moaned hard enough that her face blushed at a good red color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that Link was wearing a beautiful tight off-shoulder black dress, which the length of the waist to hips was of a pencil skirt, showing off the finest ass Link was showing. The shoulder lace of the dress only covered a tiny part of Link's slender arms, which gave the dress much more sexiness onto Link.<br>\r\nThe white half-apron came next and Greta, with her immense strength, tied and tighten the laces of the apron on Link's waist, giving another hard moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAAAWWWWWHH...\" Link moaned once again. (Link, you need to relax.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe outfir was almost complete, but Link forgot about the new heels. The Maid's heels greta pulled out were different than the wedges. These heels were a 5-inch stiletto black peep toe heels. The heel of these type of heels were separated from the platform of the front side of the heel. There was an arc gap separating them and gave Link anxiety. Greta lifted the frozen feet of Link and slided those stiletto heels softly into Link's feet. These heels had a peep toe, and the big toe of Link appeared there, showing even more sexiness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink was now fully dressed as a Sexy Hylian Maid ready to serve the task of Greta. Link looked at herself and blushed at maximum speed. She closed her eyes with embarrassment at now noticing she is wearing a sexy dress and everything about her body makes her sexy and tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreta checked Link and the dress. She inspected a little and thought of something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did Greta want to do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her legs were tight due to the black stockings and with the fear of falling with the heels, Link remained still as a display statue. Something intrigued Link, as she lifted one of the heels slowly. The heel did not seem to slip off Link's womanly feet, giving her the idea the heels were glued to her feet, maybe perhaps the outfit too. Link ignored it as Greta said something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sit on the chair.\" Greta commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink carefully sat down on the chair she was tied on and stayed silent. Her legs were positioned as the way Link used as a guy. That bothered Greta as a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess, cross your legs.\" Greta suggested, leaving Link confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CROSS YOUR LEGS. Meaning, cross one of your legs on top of the other.\" Greta stated frustated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink felt the aura of Greta's fury and did what she was told.<br>\r\nLink lifted her left leg across the right one and without noticing she had a vagina, Link succeeded to do it and noticed all of this occured due to her existing vagina. Soon, Link witnessed that these sitting posure was making her even sexier, both in outfit and now in legs, revealing her thick thighs and black stockings, as well as the elegant heels Link was wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not move. I'll come back. Just wait there and do not move a muscle. Or else you dead.\" Greta threatened Link once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTherefore, Link nodded and Greta went to a dark hallway that appeared to have giant boxes. Greta did not take too long until she came back with a little pink box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This product is said to be the best quality for a woman's beauty. Perfect for you.\" Greta suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink said nothing as she was not aware of what that little box had inside. Greta opened the pink box and Link got a peek of what was inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A makeover kit?\" Link stressed. She knew about these kind of things before when she met a female sheika villager, who used many makeup on her from the armlr shop in Kakariko village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis box had luxury makeup items, tons of them, and Greta chose the best ones.<br>\r\nA romantic red lipstick.<br>\r\nA shiny pink lip gloss.<br>\r\nAnd A mascara for the eyelashes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bring your face forward now princess.\" Greta said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You kidding me?!\" Link protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to die now?\" Greta smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink was again terrified to that phrase of Greta's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, okay.\" Link accepted in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink brought her face forward and Greta began to give Link a makeover with the mascara first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreta ordered Link to keep her eyes open and applied the mascara on Link's thick eyelashes. The mascara did its job and darkened, as well thickened more onto Link's eyelashes. Link felt her eyelashes be more visible and thickened at the point that part was over, she could feel her eyelashes touch her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the part Link did not want to take was of the lipstick. Greta grabbed the lipstick and twisted it to have the romantic red lipstick be visible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do the kiss princess.\" Greta instructed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink gave the kiss face and Greta applied to Link's lip the attractive red color from the lipstick. Link weirdly felt the lipstick go around her lip and felt its soft texture. The feel then felt like magic. Link oddly blotted her lips, as if she knew how to use lipstick before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink lip gloss came along and added feminine sparkling pink sprinkles on Link's romantic red lip. Link's lip was now shining with a red that was elegant enough for a date. Link's lip was hydrated and softened with this makeup, as well as the eyelashes, showing off beauty from Link's eyes that shined like a diamond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are getting sexier princess.\" Greta complemented Link.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink still could nkt believe she was doing all of this. What else did Link had to wear to be sexier? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreta inspected Link one more time, and in Link's ears, which were covered by her golden hair, there Greta saw some ugly blue hoop earrings Link had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreta grabbed both of Link's ears and took those earrings off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch! My blue earrings!\" Link gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreta throwed the earrings to a random location and were lost in some giant boxes Link was not capable of moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need better luxury jewelry, princess. Good thing I noticed your pointy ears of a hylian hiding in that golden soft hair.\" Greta explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Link was now forced to wear....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Link wanted to escape this nightmare since the start of her wearing the sexy black stiletto heels and the French  maid outfit exclusive to sexy female hylians such as the transformed Link. Link, of course, did not move anywhere due to the heels she was wearing, and was sitting still with the sexy pose of hers, crossing her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreta rushed to a very small box that seemed to be a special box out of the others. This box had an elegant cover, which its color was white, and from Link's view, it seemed to be for a girl who was about to get proposed. Greta grabbed the white box and unwrapped a bow that sealed it and succeeded to open it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe box was opened and gave a cold breeze towards Link. This breeze was not from the ordinary climate the desert was, instead it felt something of passion and love that once Link felt it, crossed her legs tighter, already knowing with a loss that she had a vagina, and blushed so hard she gave a small moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aawwwh...\" Link moaned softy and quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreta was confused what the princess did in front of her as she was getting closer. Greta shrugged at this odd event and brought the box to Link.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay princess. This jewelry is said to be the most valuable and gorgeous thing a vai and any other gerudo gem lover can witness. This will be wore to you and you better not take it off as you know very well your life can be taken away. Understand?\" Greta warned with immense pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink nodded rapidly. She was scared of dying like a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Greta reached into the white box and Link gasped of horror what jewelry she had to wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe white elegant box included:<br>\r\nA black cloth choker necklace, which held a white-colored heart, shiny as a diamond. (very tight necklaces)<br>\r\nA pair of golden teardrop earrings that had the shape of a heart.<br>\r\nTwo silver colored wedding rings<br>\r\nA golden engagement ring which its stone had a sapphire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreta begin with the rings first. She lifted Link's right hand and inserted one silver colored ring on Link's baby finger and the other on her ring finger (next to the pinky)<br>\r\nGreta then took the golden ring and inserted it on Link's left hand on the ring finger. Link now felt some weight on her fingers and at the same time felt the tight rings being on her fingers. Link was getting sexier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreta later grabbed the pair of golden teardrop heart-shaped earrings and told Link to move her hair from the pointy ears. Greta inserted the earrings onto Link's ears and once they were clipped and inserted, something odd made Link scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EEEKK!!\" Link screamed. It was not that loud, but it as strange for Link to do that. it seemed as the earrings were now stuck onto Link's ears, unable to be taken off, and the heart of each earring gave a tiny shine to Link's eyes, as if they were magical. Otherwise, these new earrings unlike the ones Link had before added more weight to Link's ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Greta pulled off the choker necklace and Link thought this necklace was nothing to worry about except for the girly shining heart held on the choker. Greta went behind Link's neck and began to put the choker on her. Link's neck was very clean and soft, and the choker was easily settled onto her neck, almost as slowly attaching to Link's neck forever. The clasp of the choker was being closed  to make sure the necklace did not fall off from Link. Link soon felt this necklace was fairly tight for her neck and was surely inserted to her neck thanks to Greta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This necklace is tight Greta. Very tight. It feels as it is glued to my neck.\" Link complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is how the necklace is supposed to be like, princess. the design and length matched your neck perfectly. And that heart form the necklace gives the beauty of yours. Perhaps this is your lost jewelry princess.\" Greta explained, giving a little giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink was anxious of the necklace. The choker was tight but due to the cloth, it gave the vibe to Link to not take it off, almost as if it was magical. Now Link would have to be wearing an elegant black cloth choker on her neck that held a gem-shaped heart. Her neck was now wearing something sexy as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That should do it. Now we can go to the place which my task is at.\" Greta stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink felt glad as she was done with this preparation of wearing makeup, clothes, jewelry, and a very sexy heel! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is the place far away? Either way, I cannot walk that far on these heels.\" Link asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It sure is princess. Guess I have to carry you? Or let you walk on those sexy heels?\" Greta doubted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah. Princesses like you should walk with such luxury equipment as yours. It is all on your attractive body.\" Greta smile as this was the harsh answer for Link to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreta grabbed the same rope she used on a rampaged Link and tied up Link's hands together, making Link feel arrested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now hurry along me princess. We have a mission to complete with the aid of your gorgeous body and outfit of yours. Do not forget about the makeup and the jewelry as an upgrade to your body.\" Greta ordered as she pulled the rope she tied onto Link's hands and Link herself began to move at a constant speed of Greta's on the black 5-inch stiletto heels, making Link walk very elegant and her body was straighten up at maximum level. Link's steps were small but fast, having Link pray to not let herself fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink and Greta exited the shop and headed towards.... <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It wasn't before too long Link and Greta arrived to their destination. Link was relieved as the heels she had on were making her get tire a lot faster and oddly enough, Link was not sweating. it is as her body did not give any sweat, and when Link decided to sniff herself, she smelled pretty good. A flavor that could mean so much to any person, perhaps coconut or strawberry or lemonade or watermelon or peach, you name it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we are princess.\" Greta continued, \"From here on out I want you to remain quiet and give a cute smile of yours if anyone looks at you. Got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink nodded to her with a calm face, but in her inside, she was so triggered as these instructions were for a very cute girl to do!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the other hand, Greta untied Link's hands from the rope, and then she quickly grabbed Link's left hand as if she was taking care of Link. Link try to avoid so much madness on her mind. the place they were at was called \"The Noble Canteen\" displayed outside of the place. Link could hear so many voices in there, but she was interrupted to a couple of stairs for her to step on as it was the path to the entrance. Link took a step up and because she had the sexy black stiletto heels, her whole body magically forced her to straighten up, softly and slowly put each heel upward and it repeated until she was done with the stairs. Link was questioning I this was her or the clothes were manipulating her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they entered, Link and Greta arrived to an old gerudo on a counter, waiting there as she was expecting them to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello my dear friend, Furbosa.\" Greta greeted to the old gerudo. Link then took of notice that the old gerudo was named Furbosa, but kind of curious of the name as it was reminding her about someone she knew before who had a similar name like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you finally have the stuff, greta?\" Furbosa demanded quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, my lady. Here, look what I have to offer.\" Greta responded, bringing Link forward for Furbosa to take a look at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh. that is a fine vai.\" Furbosa stated. Link blushed to that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That means we can talk about it then?\" Greta commented while Furbosa was inspecting Link.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"yeah, yeah. Just sit in the seat overthere in the corner.\" Furbosa instructed to Greta, and quickly enough Greta hurried there, pulling Link with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink saw some Gerudos in the place, some talking to each other and some, well, taking a little nap if Link wanted to imagine they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreta and Link arrived to the seats that were in the corner, and as Link knew from the feminine torture she had back at the store, she seated softly, once witnessing her great ass bouncing a little bit to the chair she took. Link then crossed her legs and showed her sexiness if that is what anyone would so bad want to witness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurbosa later arrived and from that point, both her and Greta talked in Gerudo language. Link had no idea what they were discussing about, but she was scared that it would have to do something about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreta and Furbosa, both speaking in gerudo, were discussing of Link becoming a servant and show-model for Furbosa and in exchange Greta would get popularity for her shop and earn good rupees, as well as new friends other than Link.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink had an idea, perhaps of making an escape because Link noticed furbosa and Greta were both looking back and forth to her and her dress, and specially for the hidden ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink saw three annoying Gerudos that seemed to be in an argument, so if Link threw an apple she found under her seat, she would lie to them that Greta and furbosa did it and cause mayhem, distracting enough for her to escape the town and look for help in regards of being a sexy woman on a maid's outfit, a very sexy outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink timed her plan perfectly and one of the annoying Gerudos saw her and Link whispered to her,<br>\r\n\"It were those two besides me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, the three Gerudos stood up and arrived to Link's table and told Furbosa and Greta,<br>\r\n\"Think it is funny to pretend to not have thrown this apple, huh? Well, here is your apple back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole canteen then became a boxing ring. Every Gerudo, except for those that were sleeping, interered and fought with everyone, distracting enough for Link's escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink then sneaked behind the whole fight and made her escape. Link's heels were making it difficult for Link to run, so she took the small quick steps and exited the building. Link was now making her way out of the town successfully and took a little stop to catch some breath from what she just did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank Hylia I made it out alive.\" Link sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink was in the entrance of the Gerudo town, and strangely enough there were no guards guarding the entrance. Link was worried but relieved she was free, except for the fact she was still wearing a sexy dress and heels, as well as some makeup on her and gorgeous jewelry attached to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink then stepped on the sand and it was ten times worse for her. It seemed that the heels were making it hard for Link to walk any faster and easily on the sand. that meant Link was now walking like a turtle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, something happened to her as she was half-way in the cold desert, making Link cross her arms and oddly enough her legs a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout looking clearly in the darkness, Link crashed with a person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" Link exclaimed to the stranger she met as she was rubbing her soft golden hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a young male teenager, exactly the same age as Link's right now, being 17-years-old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was his name and why did he crash to a sexy gal like Link?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The young male teenager was surprisingly a male hylian. Link could see that once she looked at him and saw his pointy ears. The guy was well-built in a way that he was athletic, similar enough to Link's past body. His hair was dark-brown and oddly similar alike to Link's past hair, except he did not have a ponytail. His clothes were the hylian trousers and a green-colored hylian tunic. Finally, he had a knight's broadsword equipped behind him and a traveler's bow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink soon looked around her area if there was anybody along the traveler but it just her and the male hylian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm... Excuse me, are you alright?\" Link assisted to the hylian traveler. The traveler began to gain consciousness and he then saw the attractive hylian gal in front of him, primarly looking at Link's boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah! I am so sorry! I was not aware of a girl standing in front of me like that!\" The hylian apologized as he backed off a little bit from Link's breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink took a moment to process what he said and blushed rapidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hylian soon got up from the sand, except Link who was still laying down there in the sand, and talked to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This wasn't the best way to meet each other, and I am sorry about that. The name is Dan if you want to know so you can report me for being a pervert.\" Dan greeted the gal Link while he was lending his hand to her so she could get up. Link blushed again but accepted the help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Link was back on her heels, she saw the height of Dan and she matched his height of 5\"10in. only due to the fact she was on 5 foot stiletto heels, otherwise she would be shorter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink checked her dress, making sure to remove the sand out of it. However, there was no sand on her dress! Link was coming closer to the theory of her outfit being magical. Dan was curious what Link was doing, and Link caught his little peeking of him on her dress, at the part of the skirt that can clearly show her thick thighs and possibly pink panties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pervert!\" Link exclaimed. She could use that phrase to her advantage towards Dan. It worked and Dan apologized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way, Dan, I guess I did not told you my name. My name is Link. Nice to meet you.\" Link responded to Dan, who was shocked that Link called him a pervert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you too, Link. That is a cute name, Link.\" Dan commented. Link gave him the death look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, just saying! It really suits you and your.... dress.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink forgave him before she could kill him for calling her name cute, but something in the inside made her feel... Happy. Dan noticed that for a second Link's blue eyes turned pink and quickly changed back to its original color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan wanted to ask Link about it, but with the feel of being nervous from meeting a beautiful girl, he kept silent. Otherwise, Link looked back at Dan and questioned him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is a young hylian like you doing in the Gerudo desert at a time like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, Link, I am in search of finding a way to destroy Ganon, and an old man told me I could find important information wit the Zoras, Gorons, Gerudos, and Ritos. I visited the Gorons and Ritos, and I am about to finish my investigation on the Gerudos. After that, my last destination is with the Zoras.\" Dan explained to Link, but then asked Link what she was doing here, as well as the reason she was wearing a \"beautiful\" dress and make up near Gerudo town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I umm... I..\" Link blushed to his question as she was not ready to just go and tell Dan he was a guy transformed into a sexy gal woman, escaping from maniac gerudos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd before Link had the courage to answer Dan's question, Link and Dan heard some loud voices heading their way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no.. Greta is coming back to get me!\" Link feared from the loud voices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gerudos? Great! Now I can go to them and ask them about my research and see if they can help.\" Dan commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Link denied Dan's action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why? Do you have information based on the Gerudos?\" Dan asked her. If Link did not want to be captured by Greta, she would have to lie to dan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Dan! I do!\" Link replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure?\"  Dan interrogated Link.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Let's try to get somewhere far way from here! My research tells me they are on rampage right now because of change of time.\" Link lied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Ok. I trust you Link.\" Dan agreed to get Link out of the desert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know this is stupid, but, Dan, can you carry me? I can not walk on my heels on sand? Please?\" Link asked, not realizing she was doing a puppy face on Dan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan blushed a little and responded, \"Okay.. Link.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan went up to Link and grabbed with one arm Link's soft and thick thighs, and the other arm grabbed onto Link's head, having Dan touch Link's soft and golden thick hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please be gentle, Dan. I hate being in this condition, and I do not want to punch you in the face.\" Link warned Dan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I.. I promise, Link.\" Dan blushed again, not believing he was carrying a sexy gal on his arms. Link was a bit heavy to Dan, but he had to admit this was kind of awesome at the same time. Dan had never been that close to a girl in this occasion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Dan carrying the sweet gal Link, they both towards...... so they would not come in contact with Greta and the mad Gerudos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere did Dan and Link go to?<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

Dan was not a very strong hylian, but he could not give up just yet because the consequence would be painful according to Link. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later in the night,  Dan and Link made it out of the desert and now where in the Gerudo canyon pass and an obstacle was ahead of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it, the hynox is back.\" Dan whispered to Link. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink took a closer look at the hynox and it was a black hynox,  the strongest type of hynox to appear in hyrule. She then took a look at Dan and his equipment,  and Link concluded that he couldn't defeat the hynox at this state of circumstances.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a plan Dan,  one that can help us get across that hynox.\" Link proposed to Dan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it one to attack him and get his loot? \" Dan guessed with no thinking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No idiot. Look,  my plan is we can crawl like babies and go around the sleeping hynox and not cause any sound and as well continue on our path. \" Link explained to Dan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh. That is a great plan Link!  Better than my plan that was foolish.  Hahaha. \" Dan agreed with a laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink reacted a little bit embarrassed for that but at the same time she felt... Complimented by someone.  It made her happy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan looked at Link and once again saw her eyes shine pink. <br>\r\n\"It happened again. \" Dan thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the plan Link proposed and was agreed between each other,  Link told Dan to put her down to the floor and she would lead the way.  Dan did what she told him and by the time Link's heels touched the ground, Link forgot how hard it still was to walk on this sexy heels and fell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Link! \" Dan shouted as he saw Link falling. Dan reacted fast like lightning and reached out with his arms to grab Link from hurting herself and caught her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink did not fall thanks to Dan,  but the way Dan caught Link was unexpected.  Dan caught Link by grabbing her boobs,  and it took a little bit of thought of what he grabbed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh,  why does her body feel squishy? \" Dan asked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink did not say anything yet as she was shocked to be rescued by a guy,  but she also realized her C-cup breasts were being touched by Dan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan pulled Link back up but accidentally squished Link's boobs and Link gave out a moan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhh! \" Link moaned.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan got nervous and removed his arms from Link and got some space away from Link.  Link moaned again,  but this time was due to a guy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Link? \" Dan asked to Link. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink turned to Dan with a head down and slowly went closer to Dan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dan?  Do you really like to be a pervert?  Well,  I thank you for saving me from a fall,  but I am sure I can help myself. \" Link creepy said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look Link,  I did not meant to grab your...  Boobs,  but it was an, accident? \" Dan responded nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Accident?  Oh yes,  I'm sure this also will be an accident! \" Link replied with anger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink gave a fierce punch to Dan,  and before Dan saw birds he saw Link blushing at maximum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Pow!)  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan fell unconscious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink calmed down and began to cry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why am I behaving like this?  I'm a guy!  But my reactions are of a girl.  My body is of a woman. My clothes are just out of this world.  I cannot take then off. \" Link shred tears from her beautiful eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I will have to tell Dan everything about me at the right time and place. \" Link thought deeply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTherefore,  Link got a little bit more of practice on walking on her stiletto heels and then started the plan solo. <br>\r\nLink dragged Dan with her quietly around the hynox,  and it was secretly surprising that her heels did not make a ton of noise when walking on grass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink successfully made it around the hynox with an unconscious Dan,  but Link began to also feel very tired.  Dragging a heavy person in a body of a woman took a lot of energy from Link,  and her feet hurt because of the heels.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink still had a little bit of energy,  and with that she took Dan and dragged once more to reach a place to stay and rest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere did Link and Dan go? </span></div></div>",

It would not be a place to rest in but due to the conditions Link was having now (her heels)  with having to carry a man that was heavy to her,  Link had no other choice but to go there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I was a guy nothing of this would have happened. \" Link murmured to herself with a soft feminine voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Link's last breaths,  she managed to get in a building of the Gatepost that seemed stable,  having walls and sort of a door to close and open.  There was no ceiling so Link hoped no one would attempt to climb the walls.  She weakly threw Dan to the ground and Link was beginning to get sleepy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink took a look around the place and none of them had a soft spot to sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, I do not want to sleep on those rocks or ground.  I don't deserve this. \" Link denied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink could not wait any longer to sleep,  but she did not want to lie on something hard like the shattered rocks<br>\r\n However,  there was one spot she could lie on,  and that was on Dan's body. She looked at Dan and his clothes seemed soft,  soft enough like a pillow.  Her thoughts got feminine in that moment and tried to convince Link to sleep on Dan's body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I... I don't know....  Is it okay to sleep with him? \" Link blushed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink thought over and over again and looked at Dan's face and even though he was unconscious,  he was smiling.  That made Link feel satisfied. Her feminine thoughts won over Link. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess it should be okay to sleep on him...  Is not like I am doing this for myself but I really want to sleep. (Yawns) Okay,  here I come. \" Link whispered. Her eyes turned pink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink carefully kneeled to the ground due to the precaution of not falling again with her heels,  and slowly crawled towards Dan and laid down with him.  Link placed herself on Dan's stomach,  where the soft clothes were,  and she put her head on there.  Link then noticed about her gold hair and did not want to get it dirty,  so she pulled her hair over her and it covered Dan's body as a blanket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end,  Link got into position to sleep in a good manner to experience a good night sleep,  and due to her eyes being pink,  she flirted with Dan,  <br>\r\n\"Sweet dreams, Danny. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes began to close and the pink color from her eyes turned back to light blue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both slept in peace on a quiet night and who knows what these two dreamed about in their dreams. <br>\r\nBut one thing for sure was that the sun began to appear,  meaning a new day for Dan and Link to experience.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn sunrise,  one of these characters wakes up earlier than the other,  so who would it be? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It took him some time to open his eyes fully because he was gaining consciousness back from the punch Link gave him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Yawn)  Morning already?  Huh,  I thought I would sleep longer.\" Dan yawned as he opened his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his surprise,  he looked around where he was and it seemed to be a ruined building.  He was not bothered by it as he usually slept at any place due to his quest from finding a way to stop Calamity Ganon. However,  he felt something laying on his stomach and it seemed to move slowly towards his legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan looked down and saw the beautiful girl herself,  Link.  He witnessed for the first time a glance of a beautiful girl like Link sleeping on his body and while looking at such beauty Dan saw Link smiling while sleeping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She must be having a good dream. \" Dan whispered,  not trying to wake up Link. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan looked at the bright sky and thought for a second. <br>\r\n\"Goddess Hylia,  forgive me for my bad actions that I did to this young woman named Link.  I pray that we can stay cool to each other and perhaps help her. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that,  Dan slowly got up,  and  without thinking,  Link rolled down from his stomach onto his legs. <br>\r\nDan was shocked that Link did not wake up yet,  but he soon felt Link moving herself and placed her hand on his Manlihood.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the!? \" Dan exclaimed inside his head.  He blushed and saw Link move once again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sleeping beauty placed her other hand on Dan's Manlihood (Dan had his pants,  don't worry)  and turned her face in front of his penis.  Dan had to do something,  and it had to be fast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan took his hylian hood and with the speed of light Dan made the hood be a pillow and quickly lifted Link's head and put the pillow beneath her as well taking his legs out of the occasion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet apples,  that was close. \" Dan sighed in relief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan got up and stretched,  helping him to get ready for a new day.  To know exactly where Dan was,  he claimed a wall and stood once again shocked where he was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are in hyrule field.  (Looks at Link from above)  She took me all the way from the hynox to here...  She really is something,  specially her clothes. Is she of royalty? \" Dan thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see women wear clothes like Link's these days, so maybe she is a Royal hylian?  I am not sure,  but for a woman like her to not leave me behind must be nice of her even though I did things that got her pissed.  I must treat her well with some food. \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan jumped off from the wall and saw a lake,  Lake Kolomo was its name. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan had his soldier's sword equipped,  and he headed to the lake.  There were trees and water,  so there were many possibilities of food to make. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan found fruits and hearty bass,  the rarest fish to find in hyrule field.  He stored the food in a clean bag and found a cooking pot on his way back to Link by surprise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weird,  but oh well,  it is good to have somewhere to cook for a great woman like Link. Now,  should I cook fish with fruit,  resulting a great Hearty Steamed Fish,  or only fruit,  giving me a Simmered Fruit. \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich one will Dan Cook? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I am good when you want to please a certain girl sleeping,  but I am bad when you make her angry or uncomfortable. \" The voice explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan took a moment to hear all the mysterious voice said as if it was another person talking in front of him. Then he tried to identify the voice and it sounded like.... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,  your voice young lady...  Doesn't it sound like Link?  And where you referring to her if you were good and bad? \" Dan commented with curiosity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a smart boy you are.  I knew you were the one for this moment. \" The voice whispered,  and Dan listened it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The one for this moment? What is it? \" Dan interrupted the voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boy,  didn't you know it is rude to interrupt someone?  Look,  if you want to know more about me,  please accept my advice and be quiet while I am speaking  or that sexy girl Link will not care for you anymore as people you met in the past,  like your parents. \" The voice threatened Dan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan stood shocked about hearing that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,  go ahead. \" Dan apologized. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.  Now,  you wanted to know which plate to serve,  right? \" The voice stated.  Dan nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,  I recommend you making the Hearty Steamed Fish.  It will leave a taste that will be unforgettable. Besides,  it is Link's favorite type of food. She'll love it.\" The voice recommended Dan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Roger that! \" Dan accepted with a blush.  The voice giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,  I should leave now... \" The voice stated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!  Hold on,  will I get to talk to you again? \" Dan interrupted once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,  only if you are in big trouble like this or worse. \" The voice began to fade away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I know your name at least?  Maybe we can be friends even if I get punished by you. \" Dan quickly said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like you,  boy... Fine,  the name is Mythra.  Nice to meet you.  Now,  bye bye.  Take care of Link...  Teeheehee. \" The voice said before disappearing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Myhtra,  huh?  Sounds cute like the name Link. \" Dan thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that mysterious encounter,  Dan cooked the Hearty steamed fish,  one for him and one for Link.  The  fish was in perfect condition and after a short time,  it was done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!  This is great food coming from a rookie chef. \" Dan complimented the food, and the smell of the food made it specular. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't wait for Link to see this. \" Dan predicted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took the two plates trough a door that led him to Link and it was interesting to see Link still sleeping. <br>\r\nDan soon looked for a place to place the food so he and Link could eat together,  and some fallen rocks in a rectangular shape near a corner of the building was the perfect spot to eat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good luck today,  huh? \" Dan nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe place the good on the rock and waited until Link woke up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow,  how did Link wake up? </span></div></div>",

Instead of the maid outfit,  Link wore a long white dress and a tiara on her long golden hair. The dress was tight and her heels were white. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought it was over! \" Link began to cry.

Isn't that something a hero will do? \" Dan laughed with confidence.  Link saw him smile and she smiled as well.  Her tears soon became of joy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!  Yes Dan!  We will! \" Link agreed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I like to hear!  Now come to me,  Link. \" Dan advices her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink ran to him and what she did not expect is that Dan hugged her and gave Link a new emotion of....  Love.  Dan then took a spin with Link and she was having fun. He stopped and Link asked him, <br>\r\n\"Why did you stop? \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have to go up and wake up.  But remember, as long as you work with me together,  you will be back to normal. \" Dan proposed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan then took a breath and launched Link so high that Link was flying and then met the light.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Link's dream ends*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink began to open her eyes slowly and quietly got up into a sitting position of splaying her knees out to the side. Dan noticed Link waking up and shouted at her,  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning Link! \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink turned her way to where Dan was sitting at and gave him a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning as well Dan. \" Link giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe soon got all of her energy from yesterday and before Dan wanted to say something to her,  Link smelled the food in front of Dan and it was no other than her favorite food! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rapidly crawled her way to Dan and said with excitement, <br>\r\n\"Hearty Steamed Fish!  My favorite!  How did you know I liked this? \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan looked at her and when he tried to respond her,  Dan caught a sight of Link's cleavage in front of him. It was an accidental pervert move,  but it was worth it as Link's boobs were the best breasts Dan had ever seen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I might have a nose bleed. \" Dan whispered.  However,  Link heard that and got worried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no!  Dan,  do you want me to help you stop it? \" Link asked with worry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?!  No no no no!  Not at all Link!  I will be okay!  Besides,  I don't want my lady to miss her delicious food. I worked hard to get it you know. \" Dan claimed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink began to blush for what Dan was doing for her,  and she soon took the advice and began to splay her knees out to the side to begin eating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan and Link ate together and Link could not stop being happy with the food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm mmm mm mm!  This is so good! \" Link cried in joy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink jumped with joy and Dan saw her boobs jiggling up and down as Link jumped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't kill me Mythra.  I never see this often.  Forgive me. \" Dan thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some time passed,  Link finished her fish faster than Dan,  and she then told Dan,  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dan,  I am getting thirsty.  I'm gonna get some water.  Is there a lake nearby? \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan,  who had not yet finished his fish,  responded, <br>\r\n\"Yes,  there is a lake.  Go straight out of that door and you will see it.  Want me to come with you? \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink replied,  \"I will be fine Dan. If anything comes up,  I will scream your name.  Besides,  you need to finish your food. You do not want to miss the full glory of the Hearty Steamed fish. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Link.  Be careful. \" Dan sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink got up straight and slowly made her way to the lake with her stiletto heels. She went on the grass due to her heels making a hole every step and soon getting stuck there.  Eventually Link made it to the Lake and drank from it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Refreshing! \" Link said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kept drinking the water with her hands,  but as she was doing that some water ran down her hand dropped on her cleavage.  Several drops of water got in Link's cleavage and it made Link moan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhh ahhhh! \" Link moaned softly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink did not want to keep moaning became perhaps someone would hear her,  maybe Dan would hear her. <br>\r\nSo then Link stopped drinking water and started to make her way back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever,  Link saw a traveller next to the Forest of time.  The traveller was close to a tree and from what Link saw,  the person seemed lost and scared. She got closer and it was a man.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should I help him?  I know hyrule pretty well. Perhaps I can help.  But my body feels cold,  including my...  Breasts. But I want to help.

Link successfully went down the small cliff and in front of her was a puddle. Surprisingly,  Link's feminine thoughts kicked in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A puddle?  That is so like uncool.  I do not want to ruin my heels.  They are sexy and special. \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink wanted to back off because of those thoughts,  but she reminded herself that this was going to be a hero thing to do,  and Link walked in the puddle. She then stopped in the puddle to greets the man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?  Are you lost? \" Link greeted the man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man heard her and looked surprised to see a woman like Link to meet him. The man seemed to be a male adult, and he had ordinary hylian clothing like Dan's,  except his were in good condition. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man looked at Link and responded nicely, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings my lady.  No,  I an not lost but I am looking for...  Someone.  \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so?  Pardon me. I saw you from that lake over there and when I saw you it looked like you were lost,  so I wondered if I could help. \" Link explained to the man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine girl.  Besides,  what is a young lady like you walking near Hyrule field.  It's too dangerous to go alone. \" The man commented. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink wanted to tell him she was not alone,  she was accompanied by Dan,  but in this occasion Link did not want to bring Dan into this.  Even as a sexual gal,  Link could be a hero. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Well,  yes,  I am going alone,  but it feels..  (Looks around)  good to take some fresh air by yourself. \" Link replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man inspected Link and her clothes,  specially her jewelry and asked another question, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Taking fresh air in those clothes?  They seem pretty tight and perhaps fancy by the looks of it. \" The man said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink looked at herself and forgot all the stuff she was wearing.  Link then thought being a heroine in those clothes was not going to be an obstacle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...  You see,  sir,  I just came here to help,  not chat. So,  will you tell me what you are looking for exactly? \" Link blurted out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man gave a smirk to Link,  and Link did not realize how sexy she looked when putting her hand on her waist on one side and showing off her legs that were in stockings reflecting light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink felt a small breeze once the man gave the smirk and said,  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir,  is everything okay? \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man looked at Link once more and creepily responded, <br>\r\n\"Young lady,  isn't a bit stupid to realize that it is dangerous to talk to strangers? \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm,  no? \" Link answered nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides,  you want to help me find the person I am looking for,  right? \" The man asked with a creepy look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...  Ummm..  Yes,  I want to help,  so who is that person you are looking for? \" Link said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,  I think I just found the person I am looking for, \" The man pointed his finger at Link and continued,  <br>\r\n\"And that is you girl! \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man jumped towards Link and before Link moved,  the man grabbed her hard and whispered to Link, <br>\r\n\"You and I are gonna have fun,  girl.  Your body is so sexy and soft. Your jewelry is expensive and shiny,  so when I take you to my place,  the boss will reward me with so many mighty bananas.  I will share some with you,  girl. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink was panicking in pain that she tried to break free,  but she couldn't as the man was too strong for her,  just like Greta was. The man held Link hard and then pulled her up to his shoulder,  ending up carrying her with a view of a bubble shaped ass.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will not regret this, honey.  You will feel pleasure in every way thanks to me. \" The man claimed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink could not fight back,  but she gave it a last try and ended up letting one of her golden teardrop earrings fall down to the puddle,  the golden engagement ring with a sapphire placed on top of it,  and her black choker necklace which had a heart shaped diamond,  perhaps the most expensive thing the man saw in Link's jewelry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know how to calm you down,  if it works. \" The man warned Link. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe used one of his arms and with his hand placed it on Link's ass and begin to run on it smoothly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aahhh ahhhhh ahhhhh!!! \" Link moaned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kept moaning as long as the man has his hand on her ass.  Without thinking,  Link decided to scream before getting unconscious from all that moaning and <br>\r\nScreamed, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dan!  Ahhhhh ahhhhh!  Dan!  Dan,  I need YOU! \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose words were the last words to say for Link as it was her last breath.  She then fell unconscious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man ignored what Link moaned so hard about and began to vanish inside the forest. Before Link and the man disappeared,  the man murmured through his mouth and said this, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Yiga Clan always finds a way to be successful at their missions. Good think Link the hero was not here.  Hahahaha!  Hahahaha! \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan heard Link's scream in a short time and with no time to waste he headed to the place he heard Link scream. He then stood in a puddle and looked around from there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Link!?  Link!?  Are you okay?  Where are you!?  Don't play tricks on me!  I'm sorry if I looked at your boobs,  but please answer me! \" Dan shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no response.  The sky soon began to turn gray and it started to rain.  Dan looked down and saw the jewelry Link was wearing when he saw her eating. It was the necklace, a golden earring,  and a golden ring with the gem sapphire placed on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan picked them up and the rain started to get heavy.  It did not matter for Dan at all because he realized Link was kidnapped. And gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan put Link's jewelry on his pocket and then kneeled to the ground and begin to cry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?!  Why me!?  Why goddess Hylia?!  Why was I stupid enough to not protect Link? \" Dan cried angrily and then imagined the smile Link gave him in the morning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She was happy...  For the first time since I met her in Gerudo Desert. A girl was smiling at me,  and then she is gone. She did not abandon me unlike people important to me. Why then?  Why didn't I follow her? \" Dan kept crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought she could be the person my...  My big sister wished for me to meet someday. Her last wish before she died in hyrule castle by the hands of calamity ganon. By meeting Link showed me that I could really defeat ganon,  but if I can't even take care of her,  how can I live anymore? \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan stopped crying and stood where he was,  only holding in one of his hands the golden ring Link left. Dan then thought something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mythra!  Mythra,  my lady,  please answer me!  I need your help,  please answer me!  This is not for me but for Link! \" Dan yelled to the gray sky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid Mythra answer Dan's yell? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

All because of me.\u201d Dan stated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMythra took a moment to process of what was going on, then she grabbed Dan with her tiny hands and told him,<br>\r\n\u201cThis is no time to blame ourselves for now. Link is great danger, and I know she cannot get out of this one easily.

So please trust to what I\u2019m ordering you to do.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan was confused yet confident that Mythra might no longer help him out at a time like this, so he nodded to her statement and asked her something else.<br>\r\n\u201cMythra, before we get to the yiga hideout, you must tell me about the relationship you have with Link and I want to know who truly Link is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMythra expected this to come from Dan at some point, so she nodded at him and responded to him,<br>\r\n\u201cAs you wish, Dan the hylian boy.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Mythra held on Dan\u2019s hand and advices him to not let go in this event that she and Dan will travel in order to save Link. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoreover Dan will know the truth about Link and the presence of Mythra.

He was silent for a few seconds and then said,<br>\r\n\"Alright, Mythra, I want to know everything about you and Link before we get to the Yiga hideout.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMythra snapped out of her little nap and replied, <br>\r\n\"So you did not forget about it, huh? Well, then, I will tell you in these 10 minutes that remain to arriving to our destination to Yiga headquarters. You ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan nodded and was all ears to Mythra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First, lets start with me. As you know me, I am mythra and I am a spiritual fairy that lives in this world yet in a different dimension from the people of Hyrule. My presence exists within clothes, and there further many more fairies of my kind in other clothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I have a fairy that lives in my clothes?\" Dan interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you idiot, those are just materials sewed by your people. We fairies are none like the other fairies that heal you when you are badly injured.\" Mythra answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I was saying, these type of fairies such as myself created certain clothes specifically for women to wear, no matter the situation of they were too big, small, or fat to fit into it. Sadly, no one who saw our clothing tried it out, and so we fairies were left unknown for centuries.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Im sorry to hear that, Mythra.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No worries, Dan. I was quite enjoying living in peace for many years. Moreover, even we fairies were not aware of our own powers.\" Mythra shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean by that?\" Dan replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMythra sighed and seemed unsure to keep talking to Dan about this topic, so she insisted on keeping it going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We fairies were 100% sure that our powers of altering the shape of girls was enough to our access, like just making sure the girl or woman who tried on our clothes would fit into it by adjusting her hip size or breast cup size, but until the night you found Link, I realized there was something else into our power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan got nervous at this point but kept listening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, the nice-looking gal Link that you know has quite an interesting background with me. My last clothing I created was a gerudo set that was light blue, including a gerudo veil, high top shirt, a gerudo pants, and women flats. And until someone wears my clothing I create, I am awaken from my sleeps. Well, guess who wore this clothing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Link, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly, Dan. However, Link was perfectly sized for the gerudo set I made, and she wore it thanks to a merchant who liked cross-dressing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMythra sighed once more and then continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dan, the gal Link that you met in Gerudo's entrance was not really her. Link was someone else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan was confused and replied, \"What do you mean?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dan,\" Mythra stated nervously, \"Link back then was a guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan, at that moment, was stoned. Mythra kept talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When she, I mean he, wore my gerudo set, I was unaware that it was a guy wearing it, and soon the clothing gave me a headsup that this person was having issues with my clothing, so I used my magic to solve it, but what was soon about to happen was unreal. My magical clothing soon managed to transform Link, who was once a man his whole life, into the most sexy woman you met her that night. Soon, all the manhood Link had was gone, including his penis, and was in exchange given a new gender and a stunning body of a woman. She was soon a sexy-gal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan had no words to say, except realizing that this girl that was at his age was once a guy like him, and due to Mythra's magic. Link was transformed into a woman, a sexy one. Dan was a little frightened by Mythra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could not believe we fairies were capable of transforming a man into a sexy woman with our magic. After knowing this event, I did not want to reveal it to my people because I am afraid they might use it for evil to men such as yourself. That is why after we save Link, well if you still consider her a girl even though she used to be a guy, I will no longer exist both in this world nor my home.\" Mythra ended her explanation with a sad tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Link used to be a guy, and now she is a girl. But wait, Mythra, cant you change Link back into a guy?\" Dan asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it is impossible. My magic denied to itself to do anything else with Link but to make her look more sexy, which occasionally happened while she was at Gerudo Town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan felt really bad for Link, on the topic that she, or he was a guy like him, and knowing that she is a girl now, a sexy one indeed, was really unfortunate. But he knows that Link is in danger, and she is a girl now, a sexy one, and many dangerous obstacles are in front of her and she cannot do it alone. No matter if she used to be a man once, Dan still knows that Link needs someone next to her, and that has to be him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mythra, it is allright. Maybe it was destiny for Link to become a girl, so at the same time dont put all the blame on you.\" Dan persuaded Mythra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMythra still was worried of something else, but began to reply Dan, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dan, I appreciate your kindness, but there is something else about Link. Link is actually the he-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything around Dan and Mythra stopped at an instant when they fell down directly into the entrance of  the Yiga hideout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch!\" Dan yelled in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, something bad is going on with Link, I cannot locate her anymore nor have telepathy with her.\" Mythra said with worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to hurry then, Mythra.\" Dan told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMythra nodded but yet worried about something, and she then flew up to Dan's shirt pocket and advised him to go in the Yiga hideout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Link has taken off her clothes, specially the maid outfit, my first set I created.\" Mythra whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan soon entered into the Yiga hideout, unaware of what danger was to come both he and Mythra.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

You will now be witnessing the whereabouts of our heroine Link.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink, who had been kidnapped by a mysterious man back at hyrule field, was now found in weird looking place. She soon began to open her eyes slowly, gaining consciousness in order to know what happened to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urgh...\" Link murmured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was fully awake, she somehow felt uncomfortable with her body, specially with her hands and legs. She soon noticed she was tied up in the middle of the mysterious room she was in. Her hands were tied up above her head, and her legs were tied together firmly to not allow her to move them. Link then thought of yelling for help, but she figured it would not benefit her, so she kept her mouth shut. Moreover, the room were Link was placed in had no doors, and as she looked up, it was pitch black, except for some fire torches located around the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did I get here?\" Link whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere seemed to be no entrance but by looking around the place confirmed she was somewhere inside a cave. Whatever was going on was something Link did not want to find out, but the mysterious man who kidnapped her is involved in this situation.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nShortly, Link felt unsecured the way she was tied up. Most of her body was exposed to anything or anyone if that man was inside this place. Her thick thighs began to bug her as they squeezed against each other, and that may impact her bubble ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of a sudden, in front of her, a section of the wall in the room began to move, soon telling link that this was a secret room. This wall was moving upfront towards link, but it then stopped and slid to the left. Then, Link's eyes caught the presence of the man who had kidnapped her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man closed the secret entrance and then looked at Link.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, honey. It seems you woke up early.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey?\" Link replied with confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you are asking for me? Well, I am doing fine but by seeing you now my day is getting better.\" the man replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink was confused yet scared of what this man was doing. What is he planning? Am I safe? Why is he so nice? Who is he?  Where am I? these question went spinning around link until the man called her out again by saying \"Sweetie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What are you doing here, sir? And why am I tied up?\" Link questioned the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't ask to many questions, sweetie, or you will get a headache. If you are worried about me, I will answer as you wish.\" the man replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, I am no ordinary hyilan around Hyrule, sweetie, as I do not match those peasants that are also hylians. Neither am I related to those nasty sheikah people of kakariko village,\" the man began to explain, \" you see, honey, I am a very powerful and interesting man, and yet the people treat me like a monster, but they do not know that power is important to live in this world, and I learned that thanks to our great calamity!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink soon began to know that this man was dangerous and crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweetie,\" the man continued, \"since I met you in hyrule field, your crystal eyes told me you were unlike other peasants of our race, and you did not consider me a monster, so I have felt something in my heart that told me you would be interested in knowing me, so I will introduce myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink was in terror to what this person was trying to mean through his sentences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man got into a mysterious pose and yelled, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am MASTER KOHGA!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Link saw the man transform in a cloud that showed the signs of the Yiga clan. Link then realized that this man was a member of the Yiga clan, but her face was shocked in cold fear knowing that this man was the leader of the yiga clan, follower of calamity Ganon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaster Kohga was in his yiga form, and he quickly went close to Link's face and placed his finger on Link's lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sweetie, you look surprised to see me in my true form, huh? It's alright, looking at such a handsome guy must be hard to resist from saying something, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink could not believe what kind of situation she had just been placed in. Not only is she kidnapped by the leader of the yiga clan, but it seems he is in love with her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now sweetie, why don't you tell me your name?\" Master Kohga. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink was even more scared than ever. Should she tell him her name is Link or make a fake name?\" </span></div></div>",

The heels were similar to the last one, but they were peep-toe stiletto heels. Also, it included ruby earrings and a yiga clan ring for one of Link's fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was peculiar how both clothes were red in order to show loyalty to the yiga clan, and link disliked it, but she had to wear something or else would Master Kohga keep staring at her boobs and perhaps her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink looked at him and nervously shouted out:  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Please, Master Kohga!\" She made a worry face to kohga as she ended her statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaster Kohga was flustered a tiny bit as his future wife had pleaded for his assistance in a sense that Link was still tied up by him, yet his heart gave a beat faster because of this.<i> Woah, my... heart....she will definitely be mine.</i> Kohga thought to himself for a short moment. Once again unfortunately for Link, her feminine appearance and change changed the way she talked, sounding like a damsel who was of a royal family, and she was not aware of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, sweetie, as you desire.\" Kohga replied to Link's statement. He then snapped his fingers and both the long dress and its accessories disappeared out of thin air and all that remained floating in the room were the short red dress, a gold tiara, a yiga clan ring and the red peep-toe stiletto heels. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink still disliked going through this as it seemed by now she was being dressed like a doll those little girls played with in Hateno village. As a hero and champion of hyrule, Link was uncomfortable of her circumstances. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaster Kohga then proceeded to bring the clothes closer to Link, and then before Link was about to be dressed by his magic, Kohga whispered to her, <br>\r\n\"You will enjoy what my magic can do to satisfy your needs, sweetie Link.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink was then confused and at the same time scared of what he meant by what his magic can do to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaster Kohga then snapped his fingers again and then Link felt her wrists and legs being magically untied. Yet, she was still placed in the same position of being tied and that is when she saw that two magical red clouds were covering her hands and legs, holding her still as what the rope had done. Then, Kohga made a fist in his right hand magically made pink powder. He got even closer to Link, mostly to her face, and blew the pink powder unto Link's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuuucckkk! What was that?!\" Link demanded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Link, this powder will try to make you feel a bit sleepy, but you will experience the love I have inside me to you!\" Kohga happily commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wait, did he say he loves me? Like, for real?</i> Link was thinking in disgust, but then Kohga's powder began to take its effects on her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I just be dressed... (moans) Please, Master? (moans) Please?\" Link moaned in a quiet manner.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<i>What did I just say? I even moaned!! No this... wait... I feel.. feel.... very calm and satisfy for some.... reason. </i> Link thought until she was not thinking anymore and instead was in a state of mind control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is finally taking effect of the tranquilizer powder I specially made.\" Kohga said to himself as the damsel Link was now \"calm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKohga then touched the red short dress, then the tiara, the heels and finally the yiga ring. These items slowly hovered around Link and slowly took independent action to be dressed into Link's body, who still was in her pink underwear and bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKohga turned around and said before leaving Link was being dressed, \" I cannot believe I am in love with the champion of hyrule. Unbelievable. Strange, I feel her aura that informs me that some advanced magic changed the hero of this land into a sexy woman, irresistible for men to not fight for. i was about to not buy this theory but as soon as she told me her name was Link, it shocks me to say that the woman I am in love to someone who used to be the a fierce man and was hero of hyrule, meant to be the one to eliminate the yiga clan and our savior calamity ganon, but now he is a fine woman and will be married to the leader of the Yiga clan.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKohga kept walking towards the exit and before actually leaving the place, he sprayed more pink powder to the ground and said, \"Enjoy your femininity taking over, hero of hyrule. You shoukd thank this sorcery for giving you this curse! I look towards 'fighting' you in my bed after marriage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Kohga exited the room but left the door open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, Link was being dressed up by magic, and  began to enjoy it due to the pink powder that its purpose was to fill in the feminine thoughts Link kept restricting. (These feminine thoughts are only meant for Link to act more like a woman, even a princess, but it will not change her memories of being the hero of hyrule. Basically, Link would act more feminine and still think like she would do when she was a guy.) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, the short red dress began to slip from below link upwards her body. the dress was tight, meant to show off Link's amazing hourglass figure, and there were no shoulder support, so the dress was wrapping all of Link's cleavage all the way down to the middle of her thicc thighs. The dress began to slip upwards, and Link felt it and moaned nicely. the dress was taking its time to fully position to the point where it was tight for Link's body to hold it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh (moans) Yes, I was a bit wrong on opposing wearing dresses. Oopsie.\" Link mindlessly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that Link was wearing her sexy red dress, the red peep-toe stiletto heels came up. Both heels placed themselves perfectly for the red cloud to lower Link's soft feet and slip in gracefully into the heels. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Teeheeehee, I am becoming so pretty! I should start wearing heels more often. Maybe I can surprise Dan with my body and clothes.\" Link kept talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid I mention Dan? Like, the boy who rescued me? what is wrong with.... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, for the final touches, the gold tiara softly landed in Link's blonde hair, being glued as if never to come off, the ruby earrings were pierced to her rings, and it shined a pink heart. Finally, the yiga symbol ring slipped in Link's ring finger (Duhh!) and Link was now fully dressed. Now, her slim and soft arms were showing off, her thicc thighs were visible without any stockings, and her bubble thicc butt was easily viewed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red clouds that were holding Link lowered and laid her down to the floor softly. Soon, before the effects of the pink powder wore off, Link whispered something unusual, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I cannot wait to see Dan. He will be surprised by my beauty and these romantic clothes that he will kiss me. he is so strong and brave like me. Awww.... I really like... want to call him.... Daddy Dan....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink was now asleep for five minutes and soon woke up. (When Link was under the pink powder effect, she was talking words of her feminine side. However, when Link wakes up and no longer has the pink powder's effect, she will not remember what she said or thought, but she will be a bit more feminine when talking and doing actions later in the future.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ughh, what happened?\" Link groaned as she lifter half of her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then noticed she was on the floor, meaning she could finally move, but she also realized she was wearing the tight short dress, the heels, and its accessories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my, this is just.... Whatever, I have to get out of this room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink then stood up firm thanks to her heels and slowly walked again on heels, swinging back and forth her hips to keep balance, and she soon felt that her butt was swinging along her hips. She wanted to complain, but exiting this room was more important. She looked at her finger and noticed she was wearing the yiga symbol ring, and gave it a disgust face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, she felt that she was wearing the gold tiara and felt the ruby earrings adding a bit of weight to her ears, yet it made her feel.... pretty and satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I get out of here, I am taking off this ring. But this ring earrings, I will keep them with me as long as possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink was now exiting the room she was kidnapped in by Master Kohga, and she looked that the floor was summoning roses and a pink mist blurring a bit to Link's eyesight. Then, the mist was gone and the roses made a path that Link followed, and at the end of the path, Link found a huge room but empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room Link found herself at was in:<br>\r\n   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The pink mist that was blurring Link's eyesight disappeared immediately as she entered the new room that was opened to her, and when Link looked around this new room, she saw a huge bed, almost the size of a dining table, placed in front of her trying to catch attention. Left side of the big bed there was a red one-person sofa that had written \"Kohga\" to indicate it belonged to Master Kohga himself. As Link got closer to this sofa, she could notice that it seemed to be new and not used recently as the material has not been changed. Moreover, to the right side of the bed, a big wooden box was sitting there untouched. Link approached it and wanted to break it open, but with her clothes and very delicate female body, she could not do anything, unless there was a weapon around here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Link wanted to take a look once again at this huge bed. The bed was indeed big, and having the red blanket over the mattress of the bed with a Yiga clan symbol drawn in it showed Link no surprise, but having to keep seeing red things after being kidnapped was annoying her. Then, as Link looked back to the entrance from her cell room, it was instead a wall of the room Link was in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What? Where did that entrance go? I am now totally trapped here...</i> Link thought in fear. She wanted to go find that door she came from but maybe there could be another secret door in which could potentially be the way out of this Yiga clan hideout. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink then saw that at the other side of the room there was a closet, maybe there would be something worth looking for in there. She then walked over to the closet at a slow speed due to her red strapless dress pressing her legs very close together. At least she was doing fine walking with her red stiletto heels. When she opened the closet, she noticed that there were banana peels on the ground and smelt bad for Link's delicate nose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ewww! Disgusting! Whatever, there has to be a secret exit around here...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink pushed aside some of the clothes Master Kohga was wearing at the moment and unfortunately there was no secret exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed in disappointment to be stuck at a moment like this, but then she heard footsteps from where she came from and quickly closed the closet and placed herself next to the big wooden box. She then put her hands on her hips and posed until the anonymous person making louder footsteps arrived closer to the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA door began to form next to the red sofa and lifted, showing the one and only Master Kohga stepping in to the room Link was found at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaster Kohga then closed the door behind him and Link gave a \"damn it\" face expression as she concluded that only Kohga could open the way to other rooms, possibly her way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKohga then looked around the room and the moment he saw Link posing with her hips next to the bed, he began to blush and thought, \"Oh my calamity! This is the first time a woman has ever been inside my master bedroom! Which means...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink stood still in confusion why Master Kohga had said anything to her, but by the way he was staring her up and down, Link spoke first:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Master Kohga, are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaster Kohga looked at Link when she was talking to him and blushed even more as Link was wearing the dress and heels that was making him blush more. He gained back consciousness of not blushing anymore and responded, \"Why my darling Link, I am feeling great! Especially having you dressed so... beautiful... yes... beautiful.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaster Kohga then moved and sat on the red sofa, taking all of its space and soon he commented, \"Well, I guess you know where we are, my dear Link.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I actually do not know where we are, Master kohga.\" Link replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... alright then. Link, I welcome you to my bedroom.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink stood shocked and thought <i>What?! This is his bedroom? I do not feel comfortable about this....</i>   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaster Kohga proceeded, \"Normally, I do not have my bedroom like this, but because of you, my sweet Link, I made it perfect just for us two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink was getting a vibe that something very wrong was going to occur, in a way that her feminine body attempted to warn her about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, sweetie Link, would you mind coming to me for a second, I would like to tell you something that could be what you are looking for.\" Master Kohga informed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Is he for real? I mean, I guess I should at a moment like this, because I cannot do anything to fight my way out and he is in control of the entrances around here.</i> Link thought with awareness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving her mind done thinking, she walked slowly to Kohga, and Kohga himself caught a view of Link's hourglass figure in action, maybe having a peek at Link's butt swinging in action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment Link stood in front of Kohga, Master Kohga then began talking, \"You know, it is wonderful having you here with me although I kidnapped you, so I should forgive you by taking you out of here for some fresh air.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink then got happy but realized she should not have done that, so she let it pass by. Master Kohga then continued, \"However, before we do that, why don't we spend some time with each other?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink then was worried and asked, \"What do you mean by that?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaster Kohga then thought, <i>Oh, Link, my innocent wife, you will see. Perhaps we will be having fun tonight.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaster Kohga looked around and then told Link, \"Link, sweetheart, why don't you take a seat on my lap? Just do it, or else..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink could not think about what he was going to do with her as his words scared her and persuaded her to sit on him, so she did as Kohga ordered her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink began sitting on Kohga's left leg, and although she felt this being very uncomfortable, her thick butt thought otherwise. It was rather comfortable and Link now sitting on Master Kohga's lap was a weird experience, but her butt was moving closer to Kohga's crouch, but that was being ignored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaster Kohga then told Link, \"Are you hungry Link?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm.... I mean... Yes, Yes I am Master Kohga.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaster Kohga then stated, \"No worries, seeing you next to that wooden box helped me figure it out because that fox contains food, mostly fruits, hope that does not trouble you Link, my love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. I do not mind.\" Link replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Although I am not sure what type of fruit there is today inside that box. Well let us see what is inside.\" Kohga indicated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaster Kohga grabbed Link's shoulders with his left arm to sustain her and then with his right arm, he lifted open the wooden box. Whatever was inside there Link would have to eat while sitting on Kohga's leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink and Master Kohga saw the wooden box open and inside there was:<br>\r\n     </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was an early morning in the fields of hyrule, with the giant sun rising up to call the new day. It was just then that Link woke up to the journey ahead of him. <br>\r\n\"What a beautiful day it is today.\" Link yawned while getting up from a small cave he had found last night as he had walked for a long time, trying to find the master sword for the fact he had recovered memories of owning. However, he remembered in each memory a beautiful young woman hanging out with him, calling his name every time. <br>\r\n\"Zelda... Zelda...\" Link murmured while checking the field of hyrule, in case if there was a guardian patrolling the area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink looked for his champion clothes and put them on (he was naked with the sheika shorts). He then walked out of the cave and went forward to his journey waiting for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a while later that the hero of time found the lottery at a lizalfo's base. He found himself 9,572 ruppees in 3 treasure chests. \"Awesome! Today sure is my lucky day! But, I already have more ruppees than this. Perhaps I should spend them at Hateno Village. I have heard the armor over there is pretty strong.\" And with that, Link used his sheika slate and teleported to Hateno Village's shrine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later Link was greeted by the villagers and considered to get something to eat. He did not worried about the amount of money he spend on. Link looked around shops to buy items and arrows. Ready for his upcoming approach at hyrule castle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn his way out of hateno village, already passing through some woods, Link heard an old voice. \"Get yourself some magical items. Magical items! Only for today!\" The old female voice yelled out wide open. Link was curious of the advertisement the voice said. With that, Link followed the voice, closer each time and at last found its location.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a small cave, similar to the one Link stayed in, but this one was more of a settlement for a person to live in. He went on and noticed it was an old woman yelling. \"She sure has a loud and strong mouth to begin with.\" Link said. The lady looked at him and welcomed him with an evilish smile, but Link decided it was just what a regular old person would be capable to do. <br>\r\n\"Hello traveler, it seems you are interested in my shop. Take a look around, they are sure unique.\" the lady mentioned. Link inspected the items, and to his surprise, most of them were items he sold to other fellow merchants. A fire sword, a lynel bow, an ice longsword, and a royal guard's shield. None caught his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink was attempted to leave, but the lady stopped him. \"Please, buy something. I beg of you, I need some ruppees to help me survive. Here, take a look at this.\" the lady continued. \"This is a mysterious medallion. It is said the hero carried it in honor to his relationship with the beautiful princess Zelda.\" Link was shocked to hear this. Zelda had a relationship with him? Link thought. The medallion had feminine purple color, an item a young woman would have with her. That did not matter to Link, as it was a key to his past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will take it. How much will it cost?\" Link asked.<br>\r\n\"It will be 301 ruppees.\" the lady answered. That was a cheap price in Link's view, but for that Zelda he remembered, he gave all his ruppees to her-900 ruppeess to be exact.<br>\r\n\"Keep the change. Have a nice day.\" Link smiled while quickly walking away from the old lady-he could have jus teleported with his sheika slate, but sadly he left for repair for Purah, the child sheika scientist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old lady smiled once again and whispered, \"I cannot believe he obtained the princess's medal of transformation. It was an item for a female decendant of the hyrule family to use to transform into the princess Zelda of this kingdom a century ago. And the hero bought it. Cannot wait for the hero to be a princess. I will wait for the right moment the hero becomes the beautiful princess Zelda and offer a special offer on her, rather say from the transformation, that if I have enough time to do it. I have to find some food first.\" the old lady laughed with joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink took the girly medallion and took a deep stare at it. \"I wonder what it does. The lady sure said it was magical, but for what?\" He questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink noticed it was getting dark. There was no cave place this time around, so Link found a well-hidden forest, with trees acting as a shelter. He jumped to the place and felt the ground soft. He did not worry, however, an usual thing started to happen once Link fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purple medallion began to shine, and echoed \"Zelda... Zelda.. Say I am a princess.\" <br>\r\nUnfortunately for Link, as he talked in his sleep, responded \"Yes Zelda, I am here for you... Zelda... I am a princess...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe medallion flew on top of Link and gave pink sparkles on Link. And shockingly, the medal itself went inside Link's chest and before it was inside Link, it echoed \"Nice to have you back princess Zelda, thr most gorgeous and good-looking young woman in this world. May you live with joy in this body newcomer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink then...</span></div></div>",

Link wants to know about it but Zelda only says to him that it is a secret to everybody. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink feels a little pissed as after he had rescued Zelda, she had kept so many secrets from him. He also complained of every woman he saved or did a task to them, none of them rewarded him. Link stated to Zelda that women were stupid, and they were only good to be a housewife. Zelda was offended but pretended to not react to his statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda explains to him that the reason she came to him was to tell him to take in charge of Hateno Village for her. Zelda could not be in two places at the same time, and so she would leave it to Link. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda also mentions that Purah will go with her, so she will need Link's sheika slate. Link gives it to her and then is intrigued to know what he will be charge of in Hateno Village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda said, \"Oh, do not worry Link. You will know about it soon when you step into my heels.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink did not understood that sentence clearly, but soon enough Zelda moved fast and casted a spell on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink got dizzy and was losing concious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am sorry to do this, but I hope you understand something about women. We are better than a silly hero like you. So it is time for you to lose that title and become a woman, but not any woman. You will transform into a beautiful princess like me, Zelda. Good luck being me.\" Zelda informed Link as he felt into a deep sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Link was asleep, Zelda took a black choker necklace and put it on Link's neck. It was highly feminine and Zelda casted a spell on it, and it was to not get off Link's neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was later that Zelda began to transform Link. She said unknown words that became sentences and once she was done, Link floated in the air and transform to no other than Zelda herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda left the house but casted another spell that teleported Link to her room and feminized his clothes as Link had transformed into Zelda, the most beautiful princess in the land of hyrule. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda was no longer in the kingdom of hyrule as the end of the day came, and there a new princess was left to take things forward.

It seemed that she was sleeping for quite the whole day yesterday, and so she was very tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink then got off her bed, uncovering her mantle, and headed to the bathroom. She felt lighter for some reason, and all the weight she was carrying was from her ass and chest. No mayter, Link was too lazy to notice it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a long amount of steps to get to the bathroom, and when Link went to look at the mirror, he saw something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zelda!\" Link talked to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then tilted her head and raised her hand to the mirror, and at that point a scream fell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eeeeekkk!!\" Link (now Zelda) screamed in horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink looked at herself and knew she was imitating Zelda's movements, which she was doing. Link then notice she was touching herself, feeling a very soft texture on her Zelda face. She then looked down and saw a pair of c-cup sized breasts blocking her bottom body. It was then that she was naked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am naked! I am Zelda! And I am the sexiest woman in hyrule!\" Link stated. She tried to look for something to cover her nudity, and specially her bottom body. There was nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shoot, nothing. Perhaps I can go to my closet and put on my champion clothes at least. That is the only thing that can calm me from realizing I turned into Princess Zelda.\" Link commented as she got out of the bathroom while remaining naked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe attempted to cover her self with her arms on the breasts and the bottom body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do not want to look down, do not want to look down. I have to look down!\" Link yelled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked further down and saw the unexpected.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nHer legs were clean and soft, with her toes being in perfect condition. Her thighs were so thick Link was embarrased and could conclude that the thighs were adding weight to her body. But must of all, she turned to look at her ass and it was insane, with a level of thickness that as a pervert Link used to be towards Zelda, he was speechless and felt exposed for someone to take a picture of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My ass is so thick! It is a perfect bubble as same as Zelda! I became Zelda, but how?\" Link questioned, but she soon remembered to look diwn again and gasped once more as she now had a woman's vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This feels weird and uncomfortable to look that I have nothing but a vagina, losing my manlihood. I better get to my closet, I can not take this feminine look on my tramsformed body that is of Zelda's.\" Link said embarrassed, and before she knew it, she was at her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe window was open, and Link went towards it to close it, and while she closed it, a cold breeze of air passed through her naked body, making Link shiver in embarrassment. But most of all, her golden hair which reached Link's waist moved along tge wind and pulled Link back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, my hair is so long as Zelda's too! And it is golden too! I am shocked that all this hair is light but strong enough to pull me along with it.\" Link talkedto herself again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Link opened her closet, she noticed her closet to have been transformed as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hill?!\" Link gasped with fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole closet had become its own room, about the size of Link's living room. There were many cabinets and boxes, as well as shelves. The clothes Link looked at were clothes for women, including a wardrobe of each including its own dresses or shoes or even makeup kits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink decided to....</span></div></div>",

Or bad?<br>\r\nMoreover, Link searched the small houses first and found green ruppees. He then walked to the medium houses and found a traveler's sword and shield, but Link did not need them right now, there were no enemies and the blood moon would appear the next night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Link gave up, he saw a big house, or rather a mansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, this place must have been pretty wealthy. Perhaps this mansion has something valuable.\" Link commented as he arrived at the mansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink pushed the rusty door, and to his surprise, water came out and splashed all the way to his champions tunic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, just what I needed.\" Link said with anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he was inside the mansion, a small breeze of air passed through him and made him shiver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strange... Why did I shiver? It felt like... Fear.\" Link whispered once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink soon walked around the old mansion and there were so many rooms, more rooms than his house in hateno village! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Link's exploration, he encountered chests that had red and purple ruppees, and even better, he discovered that this village had a relationship with the townsfolk of Hateno village, loking at pictures showing the buildings of Hateno village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink thought he had explored every corner of the mansion, but he encountered something interesting, a room that was locked and thr door was not broken or rusty, it was clean and kept a strong jold of material.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is strange. Maybe this room was very special to thepeople in this mansion.I do not want to go there, but I feel it is urgent for me to find out.\" Link thought, but before he knew it, he was at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink tried to open the door normally, but it was locked.<br>\r\nHe did not worried about it so then he summoned his sledgehammer, which was about to break, and used all of it to break the door. The hammer broke, but Link was now able to enter the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother small breeze came by and made Link shiver, but Link went with the fact it must have been his wet clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was clean and organized, but the thing Link noticed about this room was that it must have been a woman's room. He knew that because there was a mirror and a desk, alongside a chair, that was used for women to do their makeup. Link knew this because he has visited a lot of houses where he encounters woman doing their makeup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe searched the room, but it all seemed empty, with no clothes or ruppees to be found. But before Link left, he saw something shining under bed and quickly Link moved the bed to one side of the room and found a special chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chest was pink and gold, but it was odd for Link that the gold shined in the nighttime. There was no light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNonetheless, Link knew this was a feminine treasure chest, but perhaps it had something very special he can use in his adventure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink opened the chest and obtaine a....<br>\r\nBlack and white lace headband with white bows on the sides? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I.. Ummm...\" Link stared in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a piece of headgear, but it looked extremely feminine. He would not wear that as he did with tge gerudo clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink was about to leave the lace headband, but in his mind the headband looked important and perhaps useful to him.... Maybe if he wore it? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, Link would do that, and as he tried to put the black and white lace headband with white bows on the sides back to the treasure chest, it was gone. What Link saw now was a piece of paper that when Link picked it up and read it, it said: <br>\r\n                   \"To the person who obtained the<br>\r\n             Black and white lace headband with<br>\r\n       white bows on the sides, you will be awarded<br>\r\n            With a nice reward that will aid you in your life <br>\r\n       And so much more that pleases you. But first, <br>\r\n          You must head to a house that is about to<br>\r\n          Be destroyed in Hateno Village. Go there and <br>\r\n      More information will be given about the reward.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink was now intrigued about this quest as he would obtain a reward that will help him on his journey. And the location the paper told Link to go was his own house because he bought the house that was about to be destroyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTherefore, Link headed to his house in Hateno Village!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Strange.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda turned her attention back to the colossal machine, which was swimming around in the waters of the Zoren's huge dam. It was odd, Zelda thought, to go offline like that. She was pondering different theories, trying to come to a logical conclusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was suspecting Calamity Ganon was to blame. Or perhaps It was the the aftereffects of the malice that had corrupted it. Or perhaps it was just a technical glitch. These things were machines, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think, Link?\" Zelda asked to her companion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen there was no reply, she turned around, but Link was no where in sight, and Zelda got worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Link!\" she called, \"Link!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of heavy panting filled the air, and over the boulder climbed the tubby form of Zelda's companion. He was exhausted, she saw, large sweat stains visible under his tight clothing. He lifted his hand to signal to her that he was on his way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe dropped off the rock, nearly losing his footing, and did a half jog towards her, his fat roles jiggling and his large stomach bouncing up and down. In her absence, and thanks to the bountiful food available across the lands of Hyrule, Link had put on a lot of weight on his quest to save the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he had first defeated Ganon and freed her, he was weighing close to 210 pounds, with a growing belly visible on the folds of his clothing. Now he weighed close to 305 pounds! Zelda knew that she should scowled Link for letting himself go like this, perhaps try and whip him back into shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she found that she just couldn't. She didn't know why, but there was just something that attracted her about his weight gain. Perhaps it was his moon face, his developing second chin, or maybe it was the fact that he just looked...well, big all over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her, Link seemed to poses every masculine trait that could be asked of a man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda just shook her head. \"Let's go,\" she said, \"We need to get back to the Zoren and report this.\"</span></div></div>",

Would you like to hear the song I've learned?\" He asked. \"Yes I would, thank you.\" Link said and listned to Kass sing as he ate and rested. After a few more songs Link sat down by the fire and closed his eyes. While he slept, no one noticed as he went from his full size to three inches. It might have been better if they had. Kass was exhausted from singing for the stable people and headed to the fire to rest. He stood over the tiny hero as he started to awake, unaware of the bug sized man he was about to sit on.

Horrid smell poured through it in a constant stream, but Kass didn't seem to  think about it but Link had no choice but to think of it. He gagged and tried to escape but the bird was so heavy Link couldn't. The tiny hero's face paled as a grumble was heard, and Kass let one rip long and loud, Link heaved and vomit filled his mouth. He forced it back down, not wanting to add to the smell. A couple more short ones came out, not as bad but still gross. But at this point Link was very stuck, and Kass didn't have plans to move.
