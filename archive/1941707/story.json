The image of fat women strutting their stuff on the internet wasn't anything new, but these guys had some flair to it. They ran multiple series, each focussing on fat women. One had the second in command explaing to us why the round female figure was oh-so much more desirable than a thin one. Others had them showcasing their overweight 'priestesses.' I guess the them was they were an ancient society or something, but it was plainly obvious they were filming it in a poorly lit garage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir leader was a girl named Veronica Bliss, or as she caleld herself, Madame Consumer, the Grand Digestor. She weighed around two hundred and eighty pounds, and always declared how that made her a goddess of sorts. She believed that one day she would rise to power and become the reincarnation of Adephagia, Greek Goddess of Gluttony. One of her primary video series was Madame Consumer Consumes, inwhich she would eat something and act like it was an action against the skinny ruled world. It was actually pretty funny until Episode 37, Madame Consumer Consumes: A Cheerleader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBad enough half the internet watched her swallow that poor girl whole, but she decided to hold the microphone to her stomach, allowing us all to hear her horrified screams as she was melted into a layer of belly fat. The outcry was enormous and a search for the group was instantly initiated. Despite what we had once believed, they were indeed difficult, maybe even impossible to find. Worse? Her stint got the attention of British Priminister, Gwendolyn Gotblub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe already corrupt Prime Minister decided to follow Consumer's message and gained hundreds of pounds, eating both food and British citizens alike. However, she managed to keep it under wraps, until she declared war on the United States for trying to keep away it's delicious fattening foods and overweight populace from her. Thankfully, this sparked the Rebellion, and not so thankfully, sent us spiralling into our current state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, the UK has been split into the United Republic, and the Gotblub Empire. Gotblub has managed to conquer a good chunk of Europe, and even Australia; and through extremely devious means, eliminated the worlds nukes. To combat the growing threat, the United Republic formed an Alliance with the United States. After some negotiations, China and Japan have also joined them, forming The Potbelly Alliance.<br>\r\nThe Adipose Organisation has ironically fallen from the picture almost completely, the vast majority of soldiers on all sides is female, and somehow, warfare is just as much about growing in size and weight as it is about combat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYep, welcome to The Corpulence Conflict. The world will never be the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the upside though, junk food sales has risen to an all time high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, where will we go from here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1 Empress Gotblub, as you know, is the undisputed leader of the all powerful Gotblub Empire and is on her way to becoming the supreme ruler of the entire world. But even a relentless glutton such as she has other needs. Gotblub is on a search for her true love, and she'll find them. No matter how many people need to get eaten first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2 The Potebelly Alliance Leaders, Jennifer Torque (Fat, but patriotic. America), Penny Francise (Chubby, chain smoking badass president. United Republic), Midori Yamada (Obese, intelligent, but actually quite playful. Japan), Abril Hsiung(Chubby. Well meaning but aggressive. China). Relationships clash when a mysterious assassin enters the Oval Office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3 Tash and Kishi, originating from America and Japan, respectively, are a natural pair of badasses working proudly for the PA and are finally given the chance to do some real damage against the Empire. But this potentially nautical adventure may prove to be too much for the doughy duo to handle when the weirder side of the Gotblub Empire is let loose on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4 Kohana, the leading Japanese researcher in weight gain and technology. Looks like someone got her funding cut. And stole some of her high tech equipment? There is very little left to keep her thirst for revenge back now that she's out of a job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5 More. </span></div></div>",

At least two thousand people filled up the seats, though with all the extra weight, it seemed more like four hundred. They cheered and screamed in joy as the stage curtains began to open, slowly revealing their lord and master, Empress Gotblub. She smiled upon them with a giddy look of joy; she was always giddy from eating a huge meal. Her intense appetite was originally feared to cause famine and poverty within her Empire, but in regards to food it was actually far better off than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a being of such intense gluttony, Gotblub knew she would eat her country's resources before too long.This of course meant that she would have to stop eating once she was finished with them and her subjects, so she put forward a project for her scientists to increase crop and livestock production. Knowing that failure would equal digestion, they wisely decided to work as quickly as possible, and managed to achieve exactly what she asked for. In fact, there was so much extra food lying around, the populace of the Empire were not only able to survive, but bloat themselves with hunger like their ravishing leader. But of course, nobody held a candle to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGotblub was as much into gaining weight as she was eating, and as such, also ordered her scientists to create an powerful weight gain drug for her. Again successful, she had all food cooked and drenched in the drug (Bellyup), and regularly drank it like water. As a result, she weighed about two million pounds and was able to fill up a Air Hangar. She refused to let anyone say her weight in tonnes, she wanted to hear those numbers go higher and higher! At such a size, people began to forget that she was once known for her beautiful black hair and super model looks. She'd have it no other way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her size and gluttony, she was also still very much interested in a number of things that would appear to be out of the question. For example, she was still thoroughly convinced she needed to wear royal garbs. The amount of fur needed to make her robes was much closer to a massacre than anything else, especially considering how she outgrew them so quickly. In fact, her current outfit was ready to burst at the seams, though due to being designed to show off every ounce of her planetary stomach, this may not have been very noticable.<br>\r\nShe also had the Crown Jewels incorporated into her crown, as well as most of the mueseum. While she hadn't taken a step since she consumed her first victim a year or two back, her scientists noted that if she actually tried, she may very well be capable of walking. Of course, she had no interest in the matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after a few moments of getting herself ready, her microphone was in place and she managed to stop admiring her building sized breasts to talk. \"My people,\" she thundered, being such a massive size did many things to fuel her ego, booming voice included, \"You all look...delicous today...But do not fret, I promise you that this press conference is not an excuse to get you inside of me. The last one was purely spur of the moment and I had every intention of telling you about our progress. You may recall that recently, we had added the continent of Australia to our list of conquered lands. I am happy to say that their current Prime Minister, Bronson Delfin is digesting rather nicely.\" The crowd roared as she patted her immense stomach, cause a wave-like jiggle throughout. And by almost, I of course mean that it looked like pink colored water crashing against the beach. \"With this new conquest, we shall have an inflush of delicious kangaroo meat, koala burgers and leopard roast!\" It should be noted that despite her massive success as an evil dictator, she wasn't particulerly bright at times \"But that isn't why I have gathered you here today. No, what I want to talk to you about is my newest plans for a different kind of conquest. I am a goddess, and as such, I require more than just food. I want a husband. All I ask is that it is someone who I can be fond of seeing, who will do all in his power to take care of me, and be able to make love to me without ending up crushed. If I want to dispose of you, I would like to devour you alive! Try outs start tomorrow, remember to be either handsome as hell, or fat and tasty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, this caused teh crowd to roar in excitement. Though for them, it was a bizarre expereince. Though many did believe in the Gotblub Dream, there were just as many who could see her for the monster of society she was. Yet they cheered anyway, perhaps their wills were broken under her rule, or perhaps they just feared her wrath. Whatever the reason, Empress Gotblub had absolute power in her domain, and she so desperaately wanted to spread it as far as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were magnificent your worship!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Jennifer, it took oh so much effort. Please, order her up another meal. And tell them to octupple up on the Bellyup, I'm beginning to look anorexic!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer stood by her Empress as she was carted down her insanley huge palace (previously known as London) by her personal convoy of specially built trucks. Despite being made of the highest quality possible, they continued to creak and groan under her weight. Her workers were certainly not looking forward to sitting her onto her throne. Jennifer was her personal assistant, so to speak. She could possibly be considered the brains of the operation, had Gotblub not had such a tight hold on her. Essentially her job was 'Tell army to conquer more land, keep Empress happy,' and she did it with a certain form of excellence, to the point where she was the only servant that the immense woman even began to consider a friend or worth remembering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer herself was fuelled by a bizarre mix of emotions towards her. Jen was originally a popular BBW model for Bigger is Better Magazine's European Branch. After the Corpulence Conflict broke out, she witnessed Gotblub devouring every other model in their employ, and even her own beloved family. For that she should have hated her! But no, somehow the unbridled gluttony and selfishness made her somewhat envious and filled her with uneasy admiration. She refused to commit to either feeling and just did as she was told from then on, eventually developing something resembling a friendship with the gigantic mass of fat calling itself an Empress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have they finished converting the Thames into my bath yet? I feel I'm overdue for a washing that didn't involve so many sponges.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, production has been halted on that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT!? WHY!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you also asked them to do something about your...waste. You produce twice as much as the entire Empire combined, so it's getting harder and harder to get rid of it. The fertilizer plan is working, but you make it six times faster than it takes for it to dissolve.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, I can see how that would be of concern. I apologise for snapping at you. To make up for it, you will be able to personall feed me a course of my meal tonight.\" Due to the sheer amount she consumed, this meant hard labour AND the use of a crane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well Empress. We don't want you looking too skinny for tomorrow. Big day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed a big day. Tomorrow would see the Empress find her Emperor. Or possibly, just a meal. She salivated enough for a river at the thought of what tomorrow would bring. </span></div></div>",

Of course not. Your word is of course law. I merely wish to know why. Why do you want a wife?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Today my Kingdom proved to me that our men are not worthy of my affections, and though I do thank them for a very filling meal, and several thousand extra pounds of belly, am quite dissapointed in them. That was how I realised it. Our armies are now comprised of three quaters of women! Almost all of the heaviest Non-Me's are women, and the one responsible for my size, Madame Consumer, was a woman. But most importantly, I, the most spectacular and powerful being on the planet, am a Mountain of Woman. As such, it is obvious that the only thing that can possibly be my equal is another woman. It'll be just like my drunken University days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat technically made sense, and it wasn' exactly insane. It merely meant that she would massacre the female population before deciding on another tactic. And considering that she purposely enforced overpopulation, that wouldn't be so much of a loss for her empire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, more try outs my lord?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but things must receieve the slightest adjustment. Perhaps I was too hasty with the last time. I shall select about twenty or ten or so women who come closest to fitting my requirements. Then, we will bring them to a private island where they can battle for my love. Of course, we may need to supply them with jaw widening lessons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More maneaters Empress? But wouldn't that remain your own skill?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jenny, if I want a divorce, I will also want a very filling meal. A big appetite will be one of my requirements. Now, let us begin preperations for The Chubbylove Tournament!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chubbylove? No offense my mistress, but perhaps I should name the tournament?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try outs for the Sweet Digestion Tournament. A search for Gotblub's soul mate. Women only. What, she can't announce this to a full stadium as well?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanda 'Whale' Wilshire was one of many genuine believers in the Gotblub Dream. For her, a utopian world was one with the solar system digesting nicely within her belly, and society surviving in colonies spread across her galactic body. She drooled at the prospect of pleasing the Empress, though she had never considered herself a lesbian, or even bi. But, if it was for Gotblub, so be it. She felt her chances were good, she weighed about eight hundred pounds and her entire wardrobe was coloured as the Gotblub flag, which she also wore on her head as a bandanna. She stroked her chubby chin, and headed down for the try outs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLook at this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's gay? I knew it. She's way too friendly to that Jennifer woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo! The tournament! If we get in, they'll teach us how to eat people! Do you know what that means?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe'll never need to pay for a meal again?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo! It means we can take over! We fight our way up the ranks, and once we're supposed to down each other, we go after Gotblub!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she's real big. Wait, how are we going to both eat her/'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNO! I...wait, actually you have a point there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia and Viper were, in contrast to Whale, NOT believers in the Gotblub dream. While they both loved to eat and were together seven hundred and twenty pounds, they always felt that they would do a much better job of running things Well, Viper would, Cynthia was a bit of a ditz, meaning her sister had to look after her twice as much. And they had martial arts training, so that was a start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\nHoney! Gotblub's holding a tournament for a wife, sputtered four thousand pound Debra Dennis, I have to try out, I want to be with her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer husband had a very hard life under her unintentional tyranny. For one, while clever in some ways, such as history, literature and psychology, she failed to realise that her husband was in fact...he husband. She was a lesbian, plain and simple, and had crushed on Gotblub since she revealed her evil ways. She merely saw him as a good friend and helper. Though failing to realise she was at her own wedding was a bit of stretch, he didn't do a thing to remedy their situation, taking advantage of her obliviousness to pamper and feed her. But this was just the final straw. He was going to drive her down to those try outs dressed in last years (Seventy sizes too small) Kill Bill Bride outfit, and hopefully he'd never have to pick her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, having taken advantage of her cluelessness set him in bad karma, meaning he would end up rounded up as one of Gotblub's snacks shortly after dropping her off.<br>\r\n----<br>\r\nWhat? HOW CAN SHE DO THIS TO ME!? Kat Godfrey was very upset. She had always been a BBW and a glutton, so back in the day, she wasn't treated very well. The highlight of her life was when a drunken Gwen Gotblub made out with her, and then made out with her again several times while sober. She had fallen in love, but then she left and went into politics, promising to return to her one day as a Senator or something. She ended up as a dictator and never called back once. The Husband try-outs were one thing, but now she was just being cruel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, I'll show her, I'm gonna go down to that damn tournament, kick and eat everyones ass, and then you'll love me like you did back in college!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat decided to don the same sweatpants, crop top, jacket and sunglasses she wore when they first met. True, she spilled out of them like they were made for a doll, but through sheer force of will, she somehow kept it from ripping. </span></div></div>",

With the sheer amount of food that disappeared past those enormous lips (Enough to fill a three story house to the bursting point), it was almost impossible to believe that this was not only a small portion, but that there was absolutely no food shortage in the Empire. Though she would usually eat several times this, Gotblub felt too disheartened by her failure to find a husband, though not in a very emotional sense. She was used to getting exactly what she wanted, and right now she wanted a husband!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut perhaps it was also because she was thinking. A very devious mind existed within the walking stomach, one that didn't take no for an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jennifer! To me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course Jennifer was never very far away. Due to her position, she was required to stay very close. For the last few months, she had been treated to a new office and living quarters in front of the Empress's blouse. From a distance, it just looked like a colossal emerald and locket, but closer inspection revealed it's status as a one room house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, your highness? What do you desire?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My desires have not changed,\" she boomed, \"But I feel that I may have found a solution. It is obvious that my personal subjects are not fit to serve as my other half, this is clearly because I have them all wrapped tightly around my thumb. A suitable man would need more than absolute devotion to me, after all I have that my the country full.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what are you suggesting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The British cannot birth a man good enough for me. They're too soft, they let other people push them around because it is 'polite.' If I am to find a husband, I must look elsewhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to leave the kingdom...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! We must look everywhere for my soul mate! Everywhere except France. They're even squishier than the British. Though of course we'll still stop by for a snack. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-But your Highness, that would be extraordinarily dangerous! We use enough power getting you around from one street to the next. If you were to travel outside, you'd be vulnerable!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am well aware of that. If I am to possibly travel to the United States, do you not think I would consider this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The...United States? But you couldn't possibly go there without the Alliance coming down on us in full force.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! They would need such an effort to rid themselves of me, wouldn't they. I am going to slumber; when I awake, I want to get this ball rolling as quick as possible. I have been alone for too long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer watched as her master closed her eyes and began to doze off into a deep sleep. This was bad. What if something happened to Gotblub? She honestly didn't know how to feel about it. What would happen to the world if her reign suddenly ended? In the current state, a slightly smaller successor was quite likely. In general it just wasn't a good idea. No doubt she would still desire to visit unconquered areas of Europe, and going to America? Suicide! Plain and simple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut despite it all, she knew there was no arguing. The next day there would be preparations for the Empress's travels.

That one felt good.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh god! Auuurgh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTash smiled as the final toots of her thick and foul smelling fart erupted from her behind and into the face of the foot soldier. She liked this type of warfare, not as many guns. Though of course, just to be on the safe side, everyone was given a firearm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso like most other soldiers, Tash was overweight. She wasn't downright fat, but she had a gut that poked out a little from under her uniform, a bubble butt (AKA her pride and joy) and some flab handing off her arms and legs. This was justified in that she only signed up a few months back, and had spent a lot of time training, resulting in considerable weight loss, meaning that her huge meals were only keeping her at a constant weight.<br>\r\nThough she didn't mind, she did want to pack on the pounds, even before the Corpulence Conflict started she was interested in weight gain. Some laughed at her or told her how disgusting an idea it was, but she just took it in stride. She had the sort of face that said 'I don't give a damn what you think about me' and at the same time 'You and me, let's go do something nuts!' To empthasize it, she cut her hair short so that it hung just a little under her ears, and dyed it purple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently she was on a mission to take down a weapons dealing compound in the Australian outback. Some considered the hard part to be getting in and out of the country, but she felt the hard part was running out of enemies to beat up. Gotblub didn't train them very well, but she sure had a lot of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spent a lot of time swinging her fists around, knocking out soldier after soldier, and letting loose more brain numbing farts and belches. You see, the combat in the CC had taken some bizarre turns. Nowadays, instead of developing nukes, governments worked towards making supremely obese soldiers to devour the enemy, or food that caused toxic flatulence. Tash was one of these lucky soldiers. Unfortunately her platoon had been wiped out. Being a group of weapons dealers, these people were packing serious heat. In fact, the only thing stopping her from continuing her royal beatdown of the Gotblub Scum was the the explosion of a rocket launcher barely meters away from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rocket launcher? No fair! All I got is my booty and this pea shooter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tonight you die, Potbelly Scum!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you British folks supposed to be really polite. Oh right, this is Australia. You guys are alright too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking a dash for it, Tash found herself very thankful that the dealer did not have very good aiming ability, missing her by quite a bit each time. This also eliminated the problem of the soldiers and guards trying to kill her. But even she had to admit that the future didn't look bright for her, especially after ending up in a corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say good night!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSHNIRKb}\"Good night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTash looked up. What just happened? Standing behind the dealer as he fell to his knees from his now broken neck, was someone familiar. A fatty at two hundred pounds and a pai of breats, a belly and a booty too big for her uniform, there stood a fellow soldier for the Potbelly Alliance. She smiled with her chubby face and 'innocent but deadly' look, like a femme fatale from a Japanese action flick. She had also previously been thought dead by Tash due to gun shot. Turns out Tash wasn't the last girl in her platoon after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looked like you could've used a hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. But didn't they get you back there? I saw the, unload a few shots right into you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Into my chest. Fortunately we're all wearing bullet proof vests.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but what about all the blood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Capsules. A little trick I worked up. If they think you're dead, they're not going to expect you to bring back to life and kick their asses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems to have worked out nicely. Who had the charges?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Venice. I've already got them set.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet, you really saved the day here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well at least you got to see some action. I just got about six guys, and three of them were the guys who shot me. Let me tell you right now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBLEEP! BLEEP! BLEEP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit! The charges! I guess there's at least one guy we didn't get.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never mind that, let's get out of here! How long to we have?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Son of a bitch...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, the two soldiers made a run for the door. Leaping out would not be such a problem, had it not been for the fact that the door in question was intended for helicopters due to the compound being on the side of Ayres Rock. Nevertheless, they found themselves leaping through the air as the final ticks went off. Had they been able to turn and see it, the explosion would have been quite satisfying. Rubble and debris flew through the air, surrounding the rising fireball as it thundered into the sky. The noise was deafening for sure, but thankfully the duo were falling just out of range.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough jumping off of a small mountain was not a partciculerly good idea, their options had been limited. Tash began to ponder a possible escape from the situation. \"When did you say transport would be here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them began to groan. They were going to die on empty stomachs...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Incoming!\" Just meters from the ground, the two chubster commandoes found themselves latching onto the side of a Helicopter, quickly being pulled to safety by a pair of medics. Ah timing, a friend to all human beings. The two continued to groan and cough for a bit as the medics hauled them onto stretchers. Safe distance or not, that explosion definately took it out of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa...Well, that was fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Let's do this again some time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure...By the way...I'm Tash. Tash Forbes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kishi Moto. Nice to meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was about one year ago. Kishi and Tash were now not merely just acquaintences, but quite possibly the best of friends. Togethor they had helped complete seventeen successful missions against the enemy, and were even allowed to share quarters togethor back at their station in the ozzy outback. Though of coruse their missions had taken them out of the country plenty of times. In fact, they were currently reporting to their Commanders office on a matter such as this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that is to say Tash was. Kishi wasn't anywhere to be seen. It was quite troubling actually, where was she? Tash however was hurriedly making her way. In the time since she met Kishi, her weight had finally gone up. She was now quite the butterball at two hundred and sixty pounds. Kishi hadn't balooned quite as much, merely being three hundred and twenty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where on Earth is she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Tash! Wait up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTash turned to see Kishi charging through the compound towards her...wearing nothing but a towel and dripping wet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I slept in! I was in the middle of my shower when I got the news.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you did eat twice your usual rations yesturday, that probably put you out of it. Come on, hopefully our reputation will make up for your being half naked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey eventually found their way into the tent of Commander Dillon Carby. Carby was one of few male operatives in the PA's army, and one of VERY few skinnies; but his position was well deserved, being a Cold War vet and managing to walk fine despite having two prosthetic legs. He wasn't particulerly happy to see Kishi's current state, but as Tash suggested, he knew she was an excellent soldier and decided to give her a pass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forbes and Moto. You two have quite a reputation around here. You're generally just considered normal soldiers, but with your track record, you probably deserve a little more than that, what with all the special missions and that. Do you know why I've asked you here today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To talk to us about appropriate wardrobe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kishi, not now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not quite. You're services are required for another special mission. On out of the country. Seems the head honchos finally realized the secret weapons they have here. Here's the deal...\" </span></div></div>",

While we do not know if the Gotblub Empire is involved, this is a crime against our people and we must act against it. Are you in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTash seemed a little puzzled. While not all that much to take in, they were being asked to do this alone. \"Can we think about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.

So Forbes, what's the answer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese new uniforms were very comfortable, the two thought after suiting up. The green color and badges gave them a sense of authority, and the exposed flesh of their big bellies and skintight pant legs and sleeves allowed them to access their limimited flexibility. Not only that, but their flight was a dream! Catered to by some of the cutest waiters they had ever seen, and in large quantities, and the food was specially designed to add a little extra kick to their super gasses. It was official, this was a good call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kish hon, I'm feeling way too relaxed. Can we go through the plan again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too relaxed? Give me a break, Tash. Okay, we wait by the Cloverridge River for someone to show up with hostages, steal the outfits and enter the sub. Once we're in, we gather up as much info as possible, then depending on whether there's hostages or not, we either alert our superiors or set some charges and haul our glorious booties out of there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Set the charges huh? Just like our first date.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, yep. And remember the miniature snorkling gear. That'll be very important if it comes to that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Now, let's get ourselves some rest. I think we've only got three hours of flight left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sounds about right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two pulled themselves back in their recliners, closing their eyes and preparing to drift off happily. \"Sorry to bother you madames, but are either of you at all interested in a fourteenth course of ribs?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExchanging glances, the two smiled, \"Fourteenth AND twentieth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBellies bloated with gassy snacks, the two partners waited patiently under the bridge for the first sign of trouble. It had been deduced that this particuler area was the only one with enough space to house any regular arrivals of a sub of the size described. However, they had several days to try before it was expected that the sub would leave. It wasn't a particulerly unpleasant experience despite the cold night air. Like many equally gluttonous soldiers, the two had a particuler love for the fact that that since their main weapon was fuelled by gas build up, they were given large meals as snacks, and this was no exception.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Kishi, stop hogging the chicken wings!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ssshhh, you don't want to let them know we're here, do you? Besides, they're too divine to share.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite their feasting, both kept a watchful eye out on the area, though it was two hours before anyone showed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmfph, here we go! There's someone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking out, they saw two people. They were clad head to toe in what appeared to be black full body swimsuits, though much more technological, with red goggles attached to the face and what appeared to be a utility belt, holding items and oxygen. Both were obese, that was clear, but even with the liklihood of them being female, it was hard to tell. For one, it was dakr and their suits were black. Two, when you're fat enough, have large boobs wasn't a definate sign of being a woman. But what was more interesting was the person with them. But even MORE interesting was just ahead of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom below the water rose a silent behemoth. Indeed, it was a submarine, and indeed it beared the symbol of Gotblub. It was certainly awe inspiring; something that big capable of making such little sound. It was amazing! But they didn't have time to sit and watch, they had a mission to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, while I load the tranq guns, you identify who they've got with them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTash held the binoculars to her eyes and peaked out.

It didn't take long to see the tranquiliser darts pertruding from their backs, and the overweight soldiers heading her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you! Thank you!\" She said, grabbing the slightly inferior sized girls into a hug, \"I thought they were going to kill me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine...\" said Tash, barely able to breath, \"Really, we're glad to help. But do you have any idea why they were after you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman released the two from her grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Not a clue, actually. I'm gonna guess cos I'm fat? At first I thought they were hired by this girl whose boyfriend I stole, but once I saw the Gotblub signs, not so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTash leaned in slightly, \"You stole a boyfriend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm a bit of a...I'm very pra...You see...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like to sleep around?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's okay by me,\" Kishi shrugged, \"Right now, we've got a mission to do. I am very sorry, but if we ae to succeed, we're going to have to take you aboard. Do you have any objections?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman thought for a moment \"All my life I've been getting through life on my looks. I was fat before the war, and even then I found uses for it. Me, I'm a selfish beast, I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that an objection?\" asked Tash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I'd be happy to help in anyway I can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that makes things easy.

Except Morgan, who wasn't wearing one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morgan, stop smilingm you'll blow our cover!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My bad, sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce their bodies were inside the sub, the doors slammed shut and the three were covered in darkness... </span></div></div>",

The goggles almost distracted from his face, he was quite handsome, in a sort of professional manner, though he seemed rather young. Like hundreds of others, he was overweight, but his height made it seem like less. \"I trust she wasn't too much trouble to catch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKishi was worried.

They probably should have followed him down there, but they didn't want to raise much if any suspician, so they had to attend the feast. Fortunately there was a sign on the wall directing them here. Maybe food would help them think?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, yes it did,. All around them were other obese swimsuit wearers, each with the bottom of their mouths unzipped and greedily stuffing their faces with the feast before them. Themselves included.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnough food for at least eight families was strewn across the table.. Looking upon the biggest one there, standing at almost eight feet tall possibly two meters wide, they felt a little intimidated.

That's the ticket!\" Mei-Lin looked with bulging eyes as she looked upon the box of chips in front of her. Flavours galore, salty beyond belief, and she just salivated upon the thought of how many calories were contained in just one chip!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMei was a big girl with a big appetite. She was also known for being a moochful slob who had a habit of using people for her own needs. While she wasn't exactly a mean or cruel person, she was undoubtably not a nice one. She recalled moments such as going out with seven guys in one night for an epic free meal, and then never calling them back, and even changing her contact details so they couldn't find her (While she was in a solid relationship at the time).<br>\r\nAnother infamous example was when she moved into her parents house and turned them into her cooking slaves while she lazed about in bed all day. She was only kicked out when they found out she had not been working on her resume, but rather working on her birthday shopping list.<br>\r\nBut perhaps the best example would be almost torturous treatment of her on again off again boyfriend, Hikaru. The two got along very well and when not togethor were usually good friends, but at times Mei seemed downright sadistic. On more than one occasion she had stolen his wallet and emptied his bank account in order to treat herself to an epic binge. Other times she raided his family's houses for a snack because she felt she had a right as his lover. Of course she also just acted downright bitchy to any women he every intereacted with, but that was hardly the worst of her crimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the Corpulence Conflict broke out, many people genuinely believed she would be a prime candidate for duty. After all, a conflict such as this would have to shake some responsibility into her, finally giving her something she could actually help with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese people were wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, instead, Mei's thieving habits seemed to get worse, and her eating decreased. While some felt she was just freaking out, truth was, she was saving up for something deviously special. She was going to seclude herself in a bunker with nothing but food and a TV while the war raged on. She was already over three hundred pounds, and she was more than happy to pack it on further. Of course she had no idea what she was going to do once she ran out of food, but alas, she was a simple girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had invited Hikaru and some of her friends to dinner with her that night at an expensive restaurant, her treat. Few of them were surprised when she didn't show up. She had to do something to keep them away. She was packing the final rations into her bunker. She giggled and laughed to herself as she looked upon the daylight for what she knew would be the last time for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's time I said goodbye. I guess I should say something special...Hikaru, you're a nice guy and I guess I should be grateful that you keep coming back to me. Sorry I'm not taking you with me, but part of the plan is that the foods all for me. It'd kind of dampen it if there was anyone else. To mom...you're cooking was awful Screw this, I'm gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, she cealed the door. Finally she was alone. Nobody to bother her with complaints or responsibilities, and nothing to stop her pigging out to her hearts content (and pain). Ah, paradise.<br>\r\nSitting her blubbery rump down in her chair, she placed a bowl on her tummy and began to shovel the popcorn inside into her mouth as she clicked on the TV. She kicked off her shoes and smiled contently. </span></div></div>",

My god Gilligan's so dumb! I'd have eaten him by now. And the Skipper maybe. Prof, too...Man, I'd be alone real quick. Haha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued away, watching Gilligan's Island and chewing away at her snack, unaware of something very unexpected approaching her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mei? What do you think is going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped chewing. Gilligan vanished from her mind, she saw nothing in that entire direction. The only thing her mind would let her see was Hikaru, standing accusingly behind her. As such, she would do her best to remain blind, keeping her eyes shut and in the exact opposite direction to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not stupid Mei. What the hell is this about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe remained silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just locked yourself in a bunker with enough food for a hundred frickin' people without telling anyone! What the hell? This is unbelievable! What? Did you actually think you were going to have to fight? Nobody's said anything about drafting yet, and you lock yourself away! What the hell was I supposed to do? Just say, 'My girlfirned vanished off the face of the Earth, what's on TV?' You have way too many commitments to just leave!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true, as lazy and moochy as she was, she had a lot of things in her life. She helped pay the rent with Hikaru, she had jury duty that weekend, community service, plans with friends, a high position in the local David Bowie fanclub and a pet snake. Someone would notice she left eventually.<br>\r\n\"Baby! You really think I'm that stupid? I knew you'd show up! All part of the plan. I've spent so much time taking away from you that I felt I needed to prove that I really do love you. As such, here we are, just you and me togethor for as long as we want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard what you sai Mei. And I happen to think you're mom's cooking is pretty damn good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh great! After all the years I've spent sucking off your lips and actually giving you romance when I'm obviously way out of your league, you have the audacity to show up in MY bunker and yell at me about how I'm a bad person. What about you and my so called 'friends?' If you really cared about me, I wouldn't have had to steal your wallets to get this, you'd have pooled togethor to get it for me, as well as empty your fridges. All I have ever done is speak my mind and try to stay as close to you people as I can and this is how you repay me? Well to hell with you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh bullshit, you knew you were mooching off of us. You're dumb, but you're not retarded.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe groaned. Well trying a guilt trip wasn't going to work. How could she overcome this problem and once again enjoy herself? Hikaru was certainly going to be a hinderence. </span></div></div>",

Mei?\" he asked, looking up to get a great view of Mei's tonsils as her mouth descended upon his head! He was too shocked to think his mooching girlfriend would go so far for a free meal, so it was rather easy for her to move her mouth down his slim form. His legs began to kick as he realized his girlfriend really had turned on him, but by then his slight body was mostly bulging out her already rotund middle. His feet disappeared past her lips, finally joining the rest of him in her wobbling midsection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... There, no more distractions!\" She declared, marching her stuffed self back into the bunker. \"Though boyfriends are a good appetizer, I think I need a second, more filling course... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so the days passed, Mei generally focusing on being as lazy as possible... and with nobody around and enough food for several gluttons, Mei happily spent her time munching and growing, growing and munching. She decided, at first, to focus on just one kind of food at a time. The freeze-dried sweets got quite a dent in them before she moved onto the canned meats, then some salty snacks, then some cakes loaded with preservatives... eventually she got bored of everything, and not wanting to cut back (by that time, her stomach had decided that feeding time was whenever she was awake) she had begun to mix different foods together... dried nuts with syrup, for example. This allowed her body to continue to expand even after your average glutton would have begun to slow down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, as all good things do, her days of constant binging came to an end. She had outgrown every stitch of clothes she had, and every crumb was either in her stomach or added to her frame. Somehow, despite so much time of constant eating and rare movement, she managed to waddle her ponderous form to the entrance of her bunker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so ridiculous... why didn't I tell anyone I was here? I mean, after they'd gotten over me abandoning everyone... and eating my boyfriend... I'm sure they'd have kept me fed! I'm practically wasting away!\" she declared, her belly jigging violently in ironic opposition to that last statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweating and panting, she pushed the button that opened the door to her bunker, hoping against hope that there would somehow be a pile of treats for her. But her eyes went wide and her jaw dropped, which was quite a ways it could drop, as she saw what really awaited her! </span></div></div>",

Mei didn't understand at all what had happened. If only she had paid attention to all those News Reports, then maybe she'd know what was going on!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere's another one! Get her!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMei turned to see two women, both sporting enough fat to put her to shame, dressed in black and green military uniforms, and riding what appeared to be large, industrial powered electric segues. Had she not been terrified, she would have probably wondered where she could get one of those.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh, she's a real plumper! The Empress will be pleased with her!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd look at her clothes; what in gods name is keeping them on? All those rips!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer brain finally kicking in, Mei quickly turned around and made a run for it. Unfortunately, she had never ran in her life, and if you were to see her then, you'd have not noticed any change in this fact. With a click on the consoles, the segues each launched out a steel cable each, wrapping them around Mei's enormous body and holding her captive. And also quite bumpily dragging her along the road as they drove off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! Whatever you think I am, I'm not! You've got the wrong person!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you aren't a fat person? Could have fooled us!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat's happening!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the buildings began to leave their view, Mei saw something even more bizarre. A huge, quite undoubtedly HUGE woman in the distance. She was wearing a crown and green, royal looking robes. The bad guy! She remembered now! The bad guy of the war was who she could see. But... Why was she in China? Mei wouldn't realise it for some time, but the truth was: She wasn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she was gone, the war must have taken a turn for the worst. Knowing little other than everyone was getting fatter and there were less guns, Mei didn't know how this had happened. Gotblub was still in Britain. Her colossal form now smothered so much land that she was visible all the way from China. She had virtually outgrown Europe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe've got another snack for Empress Gotblub,\u201d one of her captors announced to another woman, standing just outside of a makeshift air base.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJolly good, pack her onto the plane. Next shipment's going out in ten minutes. Hopefully that'll be the last of the populace.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe segue drivers continued to drag Mei to the plane. Inside she could see other people, men and women, young and old, all tied up and bulging with fat, some silent, and others begging for freedom. Just as she was about to b e loaded onto the conveyor belt, a guard suddenly intervened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you want? The orders were to get every single one of the population to the Empress. And then a bad joke about her being hungry again in an hour.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry to hold you up, but I just felt that I should mention...\u201d  </span></div></div>",

One long row, big-screen TVs on one side and expansive... seating, on the other. Every 30 meters or so, there was something like a combination sofa/chair/bed, with an inhabitant whose fat easily dwarfed the pudgy Asian girl's own.

Shortly afterwards I saw him for the first time, Bastion. Bastion was my attendant; a handsome man who, while lacking in size, had a fairly athletic build. I would like to say he served as my father figure, but my eventual feelings towards him do not reflect as such at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe often talked to me, eventually teaching me speech and a plethora of information. I was fortunate to get someone so caring, as the people in charge did not find my mental capacity to be important whatsoever. You see, I was created as part of The Corpulence Conflict. Since warfare was sliding into ways of gluttony and bodily gasses, they needed ways to develop them. Enter: The Lindsey's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lindsey's were grown from ovums donated by hospitals into test subjects for their experiments, though with intense genetic tampering to decrease intelligence and brain power; they didn't really want to be testing on living, thinking people. And of course it'd be hard to ignore that physically we were born at age 16 and didn't recieve any changes until actually reaching 16. They didn't want to be experimenting on little kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBasically, the purpose is to eat insane amounts of food almost non stop, gain weight, occasionally take different serums or tablets, get exposure to special radiation, in some cases get gassy, and generally act as something to test on so the results can be replicated in troops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey #1 was specifically designed to only be able to eat and drink. This literally meant she couldn't breathe, so she was rather shortlived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey #2 was a vast improvement, giving her the mental capacity to survive, but still be based entirely around eating. This got her into trouble when her attendent accidentally got bit. She wasn't intelligent enough for him not to register as food and kept on eating him. Despite this setback, she was one of the longest runners from the program.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey #3 was the first to be utilized for Gas Combat testing. Her stomach was specifically designed to grind up all her food into intense bodily gas, at it's worst, enough to melt the skin off a human being. She sadly had no immunity to her own ability.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey #4 was developed at the same time as #3, though her Gas capabilities were to utilise flatulence. Though initially more succesful than #3, she required twice as much food and produced several times as much waste. Her fate is a little too disturbing, so let's just say her attendant was a bit lax on her hygene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey #5 was a triumph for the program. She was the first to be given more complicated intelligence levels, allowing her to develop mentally and create her own ideas and concepts. She was also an excellnt subject, eventually being responsible for the creation of the Mondo Serum, which causes intense weight gain. Though smart enough not to die, she eventually decided against developing all that much brain power and instead decided to sit back and stuff her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey #6 was even more triumphant than #5. Not only did she develop mental capacity beyond her predacessor, increasing the formula for Mondo and hungrily gaining her way upwards, but she was also the first to act be utilized in combat. She devoured six platoons of Gotblub Soldiers before they surrendered. She currently resides back in her facility, returning to her regular purpose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then there was me. Lindsey #8 was still in development, but I was apparently quite promising myself. Bastion often talked about how much I gained quicker than all the previous Lindsey's and how I was by far the cutest, but he was just flattering me. He taught me to be friendly, curteous, thankful and be considerate of others. From all that he did for me, I hoped I would follow #6 and fight for the country, though I'd prefer to remain in duty. I had never eaten a person before, but I was sure that it wouldn't be so hard once I was in the heat of battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, what happened next you might wonder? How did I go from someone whose reason for living was to help people end up in that ruined city, devouring all that I could see...? Well, it all spiraled out of control of my twenty sixth birthday. </span></div></div>",

An official representative of the Potbelly Alliance. She had a funny accent and was noisily eating jello the whole time, but since I myself rarely had an empty mouth, I was able to understand her. She explained that in recent years, the war had been pushing towards the Empires side. Even more of Europe had been conquered and Australia, while partially evacuated, has been harvested by the Empress for food, demolishing it into a small island. Desperate, they decided to try and repeat the victory experienced with #6.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course I didn't have a choice in the matter, but I was more than happy to oblige. Over the next few months, I was taught how to walk and was given my own uniform. Apparently creating it took more effort than my entire workout regime, making it stretchy enough for my size and making it too big for me in the first place were necessary. The day I put it on the first time I felt magnificent, like a real soldier. Bastion said it looked good on me, so who am I to disagree?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving was going to take a bit of effort. Even though I could walk, it would take a specially made truck to transport me around, and flying by air was going to be even harder, not to mention all the resources that would go in to feed me. I guess that was to be expected for a several thousand pound eating machine. But as eager as I was to get going, I was very sad to leave my home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBastion had frequently showed me picture of the outside world and told me all about it, but truth be told, I'd have no idea how to function without him. Of course I knew to go out, fight soldiers and report to base, but talking to other people? That would be a little harder. What didn't help was when he came in on my last day before shipping out. He did a good job staying just out of my sight, but on the occasions that I finally saw him, he was in tears. I was leaving the only friend I had ever had. What would he do after this? Return to a normal job? He had spent almost three decades looking after me, that would be hard to do. Maybe he'd look after Lindsey #8?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sat my truly immense form down next to him and places my hand on his shoulder. I tried to remind him about all the things we had done togethor and how I owed him everything. I even had a little idea; what if he came along to help me cope with the change? But no, he already tried for that. It didn't work out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, we spent some time just sitting. Hours even. We'd have sat there all day, if not for a loud groan from my empty stomach. This caused him to react strangely as he began rubbing it, cooing that everything would be alright. I asked him what was wrong. He looked up to me and said... </span></div></div>",

That wasn't something I ever expected to hear him say. My original reaction was to simply say 'What?' but I started to think about it. We were probably the only real people in each others lives, and I was grown in a lab. We needed each other, and couldn't bare to be apart. This way, we would finally be united forever and never leave each others sights, and at the same time I could actually move onto the next stage of my life. That actualy sounded a little... romantic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, I turned to him, held his hand and told him \"Okay.\" He looked up to me with an expression of gratitude and devotion, but asked if we could wait a few minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the time finally came, I decided to take it slow. He fit in my mouth pretty well, so he did a bit of the work, putting his legs down my throat. I licked his face for a bit, which made him giggle at first, and then burst out laughing. When I finally swallowed, I took care to let him slide down slowly. Finally, as his head was slowly disappearing down my oesophagus, he spoke his final goodbyes, \"So long Lindsey. Good luck, I know you're going to be the best soldier they've ever had. Make me proud.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I felt him plop into my pit of a stomach, I smiled, \"I will make you proud, Bastion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as I said, this is when things spiraled out of control. Nobody really wondered where he went, and the next day I was loaded into the truck. My first time visiting the outside world, and I barely get ten seconds to see it. Well, that would have been what my thoughts were, had it not been for my continuing thoughts towards Bastion. I barely even wondered what the future would bring. </span></div></div>",

The expression on his face was priceless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with my titanic size, I couldn't break through the walls. I was being held captive, and they gained my obedience through snacking. I could never see their faces, though, they kept those well hidden. And by that I mean they stood just of of my sight; I was always too tired to bother trying to turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few days I learnt that I was not the first of these experiments. There were other girls, or 'Lindsey's' as they liked to call us. Each of them had the same treatment, to varying effects. Lindsey #1 for example, went along with it nicely and accepted all the food that came her way. She was later taken to another facility. #2 became a demanding beast, and was taken away before she could bankrupt them. #3 refused the lifestyle and starved to death. #4 had a strange chemical imbalance and grew too big for any known facility too quickly, a new one had to be made entirely. #5 was too stupid to realise what was happening and just went along with it, expecting it to end shortly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n#6 was still here, and we were quickly friends. She was the one who told me all about this, and explained just who was responsible. The Corpulence Conflict was in its early stages when I was kidnapped, so I was completely unaware of any 'Fat Uprising.' Ironically, though I was oblivious to it, I was to become one of its strongest weapons. They were particularly amazed by my immediate rampage of gluttony; apparently I am the only Lindsey to devour the people working on her. #4 crushed all of them eventually, though. The Gotblub Empire had decided to spread the seeds of gluttony throughout America with the Lindsey Program. Unfortunately there were communication errors, and they ended up with entire facilities dedicated to fattening Americans with no real purpose. They are still apparently on the fence whether or not to feed us to that 'Empress Gotblub' or use us as weapons, then feed us to her. All I know is that she's apparently even bigger than all of us combined, which I find hard to believe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n#6 knows all this because of her 'keeper,' Johnathan apparently can't resist her and willl tell her anything. Unlike me, she loves this lifestyle. However, that was going to change. For me that is, not for her. </span></div></div>",

Yes, the world was a different place now for sure, but people still had to go to college. And in all honesty? Noelle was pretty damn certain she had aced that test.

Though, maybe that's just cos I'm huge.\" Ashley weighed seven hundred pounds, and while she did have genuine looks to go with it, she was a colossal bitch. \"You know, maybe I'd cut you some slack if you stopped trying to be so different and just gave in, slapped on the pounds like we did?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were fat before the war, back when people thought you were disgusting and gross?

Often, it was because they couldn't believe how sexy she was. Other times, like this one, it was because people were about to get beaten viciously by her. As such, she didn't notice that Noelle was actually stepping CLOSER to her. Reaching out her hand, she aimed for the poor girls jean pocket and removed her wallet. Flipping it open, she found her credit card, ID and at least two hundred dollars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, nice picture. Bet I can get my sis to photoshop it for you. Whose body do you prefer, Danny DeVito, or ...Jack Black...Why is my hand wet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking to her hand, Ashley's eyes practically popped out of their sockets. Noelle was swallowing her hand. The girl herself couldn't believe this was working, and judging by Ashley's freaked expression, it was all she needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...What the f*ck are you doing? Let go you skinny bitch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealising that the longterm bully was not so easy to frighten, Noelle gulped in fear, and in doing so, gulped down her hand all the way. As the confused Ash swung her fist out, she began to continue gulping. She barely even knew what she was doing now; it seemed to be all based on instinct. Finally coming to her elbow, she knew this was the end of the line, and so did her hefty attacker. That was, until her mouth got around even further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs those crimson lips came closer and closer to her head, Ash's fierce and confident demeaner began to slowly vanish. True, she had a gang of at least ten with her, but none of them could understand what was happening, and were quite frankly too scared to even try and help.<br>\r\nFinally, as Noelle's gaping maw converged on her bullies' head, she decided to screw the tough chick act and began screaming for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaargh! Get her offa me! Get her off! Don't just stand there, HELP M---\" she was cut off as her face vanished from view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her gang, the sight was actuallu quite horrific. Some of them were genuine friends to Ash, a few were just trying to avoid her wrath, at least one was secretly in love with her, and all of them had known her as an unstoppable bitch machine.<br>\r\nWhatever she wanted, she got, and nobody would ever dare say otherwise. Now they were seeing her being devoured before their very eyes by one of her most frequent and skinny victims! That's all Noelle was to them, a victim. They and Ashley knew little to nothing about her other than that she wasn't fat and was well behaved, and those made her the perfect target. They didn't know how personal their attacks felt to Noelle, who as stated before, considered Ash her arch enemy. Hell, it was a miracle the titanic woman even knew her name! And now, she was left kicking as screaming as she was forced down the chick's gullet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UuuuLPA! Oooh...arhhh...UuuuuUUUUURRRRAAHAHAHAHAHAHAP! My god...\" Noelle looked down upon her stomach. It bulged out hugely! In fact, quite easily it was several sizes bigger than herself. It was more than a little easy to see the struggling form of Ashley as she desperately squirmed for freedom.<br>\r\nShe couldn't believe it. Simply couldn't. It was bad enough that her belly filled up a good chunk of her view, but with the silence, she could also see the grotesque images of her pressing against her stomach walls. And with this awkward silence, she could vaguely hear her pathetic cries for help. She didn't mean to go this far. Just scare her! Now she was trapped inside her stomach as food...and had about ten friends in the area who would probably be ready for a little vengeance. Something had to be done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see what I just did? And guess what? I ain't even that full!\" she lied, \"Unless you want to end up like Tubby McLardbutt here, I suggest you piss the hell off!\"<br>\r\nThey didn't budge, too shocked to even think straight. Noelle shivered, what was she going to do n-\"UrRP!!\" Out from between her lips flew Ash's wristband. Flopping onto the floor covered in saliva, one of them took a closer look. With a bit of study, it seemed to have something red on it... It didn't even need to actually be blood, but whatever it was, it was enough to send them running for mummy. Noelle would have smiled, but she wasn't exactly happy about the current situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, she was happy she wasn't pulverised, but she wasn't a killer! And that's essentially what she had done here. And what a way to kill someone! A shot to the heart is one thing, but eating someone and digesting them? That was insane! But on the other hand...she actually tasted kind of nice. Not really like anything else she had ever eaten, but still very good! And this full feeling, it was painful, not helped by her constant movements, but in a good way. But most of all, she felt strong! Like she had taken on Superman and won, she had conquered something seemingly impossible! Quite possibly the greaNO! She just ate someone! And that's murder...</span></div></div>",

She loved her donut milkshakes, and even those who weren't fond of her had to admit they were heavenly. It was cooking experimentation like that which earned her five hundred pounds of body fat. Of course, the lack of physical activity helped too. Par the course when you're a bookworm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing her glasses back up from the tip of her nose, she happily forced the next slice into her smiley mouth, salivating ever so slightly at the prospect of more food. She would have recieved this, if not for her phone going off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, who is this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vicky! It's Noelle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey babe, how is-\"<br>\r\n\"HELP ME! I don't have time to explain, you just have to help me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh uh, sure. Where are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The alley next to McDonalds. Please hurry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanging up, the bulbous brunette didn't waste a second, her best friend needed her! She arrived by McDonalds in her car about fifteen minutes later. She quickly spotted Noelle cowering behind a trash can, scared for her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to you...?\" Rushing over to the trash can with surprising speed, Noelle clearly saw her, hoisting herself up for the friendly, if panicked embrace of her enormously huggable friend. \"Noelle! What happened? What happened to...you.\" Finally she saw it. The colossal belly was simply...colossal! Bigger than her, even! No wonder she was so scared. \"Oh my god! Did you binge on McDonalds or something? What on Earth happened?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not McDonalds...It's Ashley. I ate her. I didn't mean to, but I ate her up, and now I can't get her out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...You ATE Ashley? As in devoured her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Swallowed her whole. I just meant to get her arm, I wanted to scare her! Now she's stuck! Help me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big Fat Bitch Ashley?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES! Vicky, please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, it's just...wow. Okay, okay. I have an idea. We call an ambulance. I'm sure some quick surgery can fix this up no problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlipping out her phone, she dialled 911 and selected Hospital. She explained the situation, but left out the details about her eating a whole person. That may have scared them off. As the two waited, Vicky held her friend in her arms as much as possible, giving her belly a rub on occasion to reduce the pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything is going to be okay. Just hold on. Say, maybe digesting her won't be so bad, anyway. I heard Patrick's been looking your way for a while, maybe all you needed was a few extra pounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not funny, Vick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, just trying to lighten the mood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I appriciate that, but...Aaaugh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, don't speak, the ambulance should be here soon...\" </span></div></div>",

Vicky breathed as sigh of relief as Noelle began to calm down. \"See, everything will be fine. Ashley's gonna probably need some therapy, but she should be fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Vic. I really don't think I'd have coped without you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what are friends for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin moments, the paramedics hopped out of the ambulance, stretched in hand. Though they seemed confident and strong willed, the sight of Noelle's engorged, squirming girth was quite a shock. Nonetheless, they continued on to her rescue. Except for the new guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, she ate someone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And she wants her out. That's why we called!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's a trap! You're not eating us too, you monster!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky and Noelle'e eyes grew wide as the trainee pulled a gun from his pocket and aimed it for the unintentional glutton. The others rushed for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you crazy? She's in pain!\"<br>\r\n\"What is wrong with you?\"<br>\r\n\"Are you some kind of moron?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took their words into account. He had acted rashly, and he didn't even know at the time if that was indeed another person inside her. His thoughts were dashed away as he saw Noelle's dropped jaw. Big enough to fit him inside. As the others looked her way, their opinion suddenly changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OMIGOD, shoot it!\"<br>\r\n\"Kill it, oh fudge!\"<br>\r\n\"Make it bleed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is wrong with you? She's a victim, nit a maneater!\" Vicky held herself before Noelle's chest as the man prepared to pull the trigger, accidentally touching her tummy in doing so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BuuuuuuuuUUUURRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky looked back. All the paramedics were on the ground as a cloud of green smoke began to clear. Were they dead? No time to check.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, we need to get you out of here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Ashley's still inside me! The kicking is going down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, but considering the hell she's put everyone through, I think getting you back to the apartment with her as a few extra pounds on your butt is a small cost for keeping you alive! Come on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoelle groaned in pain as Vicky began to roll her. Literally roll her down the street and back to campus. She felt like throwing up once or twice, but the sheer size of Ashley somehow told her body that this wasn't a wise move. Before long, they finally arrived at the grounds. It was hard sneaking Vicky through all the halls and corridors, but luck was on their side as they made it without getting caught. Though of course, someone would question the wreckage around the door frames.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vicky! Vickyvickyvickyvickickycky...What am I gonna do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I've got a cover story. Weight gain pills. You overdosed and had an all night binge, perfectly believable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO! I don't care about that. I'm digesting a live person! I don't care if she was Ashley, I don't wanna be a murderer! I'll never live with myself! Vicky, help me!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had never seen her so distraught. It was actually a little depressing to see her like that, tears flowing down her face like a waterfall, just to land on her gurgling stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. Let's try some stuff to get you to throw up. I'm sure she's just tired of hitting your stomach.\" Vicky poked Noelle's belly curiously. Her finger sank in deep. Too deep. As if it was full of mush. \"Uhm...okay, never mind. How about we do something you like? Guitar Hero? You still like that right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't wanna play Guitar Hero...I want Ashley out of my belly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh...I guess I'm gonna have to work overtime to make you happy again then. I'll go break out the Star Wars boxset. I'm guessing you'll want the edition before Lucas tried to CGI two hundred extra pounds onto each character.\" </span></div></div>",

Nobody except Vicky had seen her since the day she ate Ashley. The school had actually improved with her gone and everyone was much happier. Unfortunately, the same could not be said for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough not a saint by any means, Noelle always prided her on being a good person. And good people didn't eat other people, regardless of whether they were bad or good. She was gained every one of Ashley's pounds and had exceeded Vicky in weight, though she wasn't too happy about it. She never had much interest in gaining weight, and now that she had, she was too depressed to even reap the benefits. She just laid in bed all day eating snacks supplied by Vicky, who had unintentionally developed into a part time slave. In a attempt to lift her spirit, she would feed her, play games and purposely lose, and at times even dress her into much more glamorous (though often tight fitting) outfits and have a two person dance party (Though little of what Noelle did could be considered dancing).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVicky was currently feeding Noelle her last slice of pudding. \"Come on big girl, you have to finish the whole thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just grunted sadly as she inhaled the puny desert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very nice. Now, I'm gonna rent us a movie. You wanted to see Scot Pilgrim vs. the World right? Oh, and this letter came for you. It's got one of those old school seals on the front too, so you know it's important!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't really think much of it, but she felt she had to be cheery about everything if Noelle's mood was going to improve. And that seemed rather unlikely so far. Nonetheless, the titanic woman ripped open the envelope and began to read as Vicky disappeared out the door. It read...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDear Noelle O'Connel, congratulations on your new discovery. Few are gifted with such prowess in consumption, but the ones who are can only be deserving. At this stage you have probably devoured seven innocent bystanders, your close friends and family and have basucally been reduced to a slavoring glutton who wants nothing more than to whet your enormous appetite. Well let me tel you, this gives you a place among my Chosen. Just Mail this letter to the address on the back and we'll find you, and you'll have all the food and people you can eat in our upcoming world takeover. The Adipose Organisation awaits you're notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Sincerely, Madame Consumer<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly scrunching the letter to dust, she threw it in the trash can next to her. It didn't bother her at all that someone seemed to know about her incident. In fact, she felt that it was an ill conceived attempt to cheer her up by Vicky. With a light belch she pulled her sheets over her head and dosed off to sleep. </span></div></div>",

She honestly didn't care. She just wanted to sit in her bed and die. She didn't care about herself; she took a human life and that was unforgiveable. With Vicky's dutiful feedings, she had gained at least a hundred pounds, bringing her up to about one thousand and making her sheets almost meaningless. Probably those Donut Milkshakes. But, in her depressed state she still had a few stems of heart left for her dear friend, and accepted the letter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Vic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mention it. Now, I know you're still feeling down, but I think I have the cure to your blues at last!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another dance party?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe. But there's something special about it this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Giving up already? Well, grab your bellbottoms and gel up an afro, cos we're going Disco!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome,\" she said with even less enthusiasm as usual, \"How about you get started without me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea, I still need to hang the disco ball!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the cupboard, Vicky began to search for her ball. She had at least two, she was a bit of a hoarder and could never have enough miscellaneous crap. Noelle looked upon her letter. It carried the same ceal as the last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDear Noelle O'Connell, did you recieve our last letter? In writing this, we do not mean to seem rude, but we've been eagerly awaiting your notice and have yet to see any such thing. Are we correct in presuming that perhaps you devoured the mailman along with the mail? Well in any case, you may mail this one back to the adress provided on the back and we shall inaugurate you into our ranks. Just imagine yourself, sitting atop a throne of gold, stomach stretched for miles with squirming victims, each of them screaming for escape or the safety of their loved ones to no avail, as they are torn apart by gastric juices... I'll stop there, I don't want to overexcite you, do I?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Sincerely, Madame Consumer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she had finished, the letter found itself scrunched into a pile and in the garbage. Vicky was just being annoying now. Speaking of, \"Aw, here we go! I'm gonna break out the ABBA records for this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Week After.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDear Noelle O'Connell, I am finding it a little hard to believe that you have eaten two mailmen carrying these particuler letters. But, nonetheless I cannot blame you if you did. These mortals always scream of laws and fairness, but we know the truth, we have every right to devour them BECAUSE we can, and soon the entire world will know of this. Gotblub and the Potbelly Alliance think this war is between them, don't they? Well, we will show them that the Adipose Organisation may have fled the picture, but behind the scenes, the strings are pulled all the tighter. Simply mail this letter to the adress supplied on the back and you shall officially be one of us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Sincerely, Madame Consumer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext Month.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDear Noelle O'Connel, this is just a friendly reminder that you have forgotten to mail the letter, I'm sure it's sitting at your table with a sticky note intending to remind you. This is just my attempt to help a fellow glutton with her destiny. I can relate actually, this is actually the third iteration of the Organisation. The first attempt was completely botched by my own laziness, so on the next two tries I remedied this, though fortunately most of my laze remains. I look forward to meeting you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Your friend,Madame Consumer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo Months Later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDear Noelle O'Connel, I see the problem now. We preds usually have to be a cautious bunch, if we slip up, everyone knows about it and we have to go on the run, I have been down this road myself. But let me tell you now that you can trust us, we have the same goals and interests. Alongside us, you will never have to worry about getting caught again, for you will have a whole organisation backing you up! With you, we shall be an unstoppable force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-See you soon, Madame Consumer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo Months Later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, you take an envelope and write the address we have supplied on the back of the letter on it. Put the letter inside and apply your tongue to the ceal. Close it and put it in a public letterbox. It's that simple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Sincerely, the ever helpful Madame Consumer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo And A Half Weeks Later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlright, seriously, we have in fact been counting these letters, and this is number fifty eight. I do not believe for a damn second that you do not know how to post a letter, so just hurry up and get to it! It's been almost half a year since we started doing this damn routine, and quite frankly we are sick of it! I am a woman of poise, power, elegance and I can tolerate a lot, but dammit, there's a limit! Either you send the damn letter or we'll just give the position to some other fatass!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-HURRY UP, Madame Consumer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater That Week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, my last message may have come across a bit harsh, but allow me to apologise, you see we are currently under a bit of stress and expected you're clarification some time ago. If you could maybe...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't bother finishing this one. It was getting rather tiring, like hearing a variation on the same joke over and over. It was the only thing that Vicky did that got Noelle to react with anything but faux excitement, and the way she tried so hard to keep her happy, it was hard to get mad at her for this one thing. And it was clear Vicky had indeed been trying, given Noelle's new size. We at about a minimum of one hundred pounds gained each two weeks, Noelle had become immobile at three thousand pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body positively filled the room, and her breasts were larger than people! Her clothing had long since snapped off, but that didn't stop Vicky from trying to make her new ones. They usually snapped the day after, or while being put on, but the sheer tenacity she showed was impressive. In her quest to make her friend smile, she had broken her own will and became a slave to a woman with no such desires. Infact, when Noelle did look at Vicky, she unknowingly wept, she wanted things back to normal, and now they were more fractured than ever. But there was no going back. This was life now. The only thing keeping THIS 'life' from crashing down was Vicky's silver spoon tongue, keeping the curious away and somehow making everyone forget about Noelle and managing to talk her way out of studying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Vicky measured Noelle's massive second chin of fat, preparing her for their upcoming Halloween Dance (they were going as Elvira and Harley Quinn, repectively) the colossal redhead surveyed her friend. She wasn't the fat blob she once was. Vicky was always a rolly polly butterball with a jolly attitude to match. She smiled, but didn't seem all that jolly. She wasn't quite thin, but fat? Most certainly not. And this observation was all she needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. That's the last straw, I can't take this anymore!\" </span></div></div>",

All she could remember how to do was feed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strangers finally returned, opening the door to find it covered by a wall of fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect! Consumer will be pleased with this result. She can finally retire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right into Noelle's belly! Hahahaha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't we going to double cross Madame Consumer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The hell are you talking about?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought Noelle was going to replace her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes! So she could retire and reap the benefits of the new fat world instead of hiding in a nuclear bunker! She may not be the Grand Digester after that, but we are still her loyal slaves!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, my mistake then, he said nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo late! You are clearly not loyal to Madame Consumer. We will feed YOU to Noelle!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHAT!? NO! YOU CAN'T DO THAT!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatch us, traitor. </span></div></div>",

Official looking uniforms with green coloring and the official emblem. Yep, they were with Prime Minister Gotblub. Yeah, Prime Minister; I ain't buyin' into that Empress crap. She's a corrupt politician, plain and simple. Just happens to also be gigantically fat and be more corrupt than most. I had half a mind to pop in a few jalapeno's and belch them into next year, but I business had been slow lately. In the old days, most of my clients came to me because of missing friends or family. Nowadays, if anyone's ignorant enough to ask where people are getting' to, the answer is obvious: Inside of the Prime Minister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut sadly, I was in no position to turn them away. I needed the cash. Bad. With a groan and a scowl, I asked the two men to take a seat. Or rather two seats each; they were almost twice my size! I was only forty pounds away from four hundred, while they seemed forty past seventy. Funny, even with all the extra food lying around, I didn't actually believe Gotblub left a crumb for her lackeys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDetective Blubber, your government is in dire need of your assistance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'd be happy to assist you in anyway I can, I lied blatantly. But I'm afraid in this economy, I'll be unable to give my services for free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe glasses bearing one groaned, Fortunately for you, Ms. Blubber, the situation warrants a low profile, so we are willing to meet your demands. Shall we say Half a billion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI almost choked on my electric-tobaccoless cigarette. I was most certainly not expecting a payout as big as that, and most certainly not offered by them, of all people! But I managed to keep my cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust half? Well, maybe I can help. What's your problem?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir eyes darted around the room. They didn't have much urgency to them, but they definitely didn''t want to be heard by anyone other than me. Mustache boy leaned in closer, Ms. Blubber, are you familiar with the tale of the Blob Woman?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlob Woman? Yeah, maybe. Could you refresh my memory?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tale would have sounded utterly and truthfully bizarre a few years back. However, now, it is merely bizarre.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see, even in the early days of Gotblub's rise to power, that is to say, her first few feedings, she wasn't interested in devouring skinnies. She had the kidnappings increased tenfold; she wanted enough to keep her fed while the other half her fed into obesity. Even if they were already obese, she had them fed into morbid territory. If already there...You get the picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing the glutton she was, she decided to start work on her 'Ultimate Snack,' and ordered a woman to be fed into such extreme obesity, that she would beg to be eaten. These days, the Empress herself surpasses the intended weight by at least three times. The orders were followed and the woman was fed with the most fattening products tax payers could buy. And once Bellyup was invented, she grew even more. She quickly surpassed her predicted girth, and we kept on going. Empress Gotblub would have been quite pleased. While she had forgotten the project, we intended to serve the woman as a celebration of her successful conquest of Australia. It is safe to say that this woman had been fed her way into the second fattest creature on the planet, next to the Empress. And then, it happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman vanished, without a trace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI raised an eyebrow, How is that possible?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt isn't, at all. All the security cameras were strangely blank that night, and the facility she was being kept in was under high guard. Nobody saw it happen. Somehow, almost one million pounds of woman vanished off the face of the Earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI see. And, you want me to find out where she went?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot necessarily, this event occurred years back. We had a full investigation. No, that is merely her origin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see Ms. Blubber, it was a mere month until the first sighting. During the first invasions of France, a lone lookout found himself stationed atop the Eiffel Tower. She reported bizarre slurping and sloshing noises despite nobody being allowed in the tower. She was eventually sent an escort after the third hour, as she had grown increasingly paranoid. She was never heard of again, but the escort reported finding saliva coating the floor, and all of them heard her scream over the walky talky as sounds of swallowing, gulping and moaning were heard. The loud sound of digestion played for eight minutes after that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreepy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA mere week after that, here in Gotblub's own city turned mansion, a street is reported to have children playing in it. Obviously this is because a number of our street patrols had gone missing. The wife of one of the officers is interviewed. She claims to have overdosed on her medication, because she could swear that she saw her husband devoured by a gorgeous woman, whose body filled the entire hallway as if it were just a door to another room. With a blink of the eye, the hallway was empty, and her husband was never seen again. Other families report similar incidents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA week after, the Gotblub Training Camp has a disappearance...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet me guess, this 'Blob Woman' apparently ate them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, actually, this person was merely in a food coma behind a Candy Bar. However, the soldiers were becoming increasingly disturbed by the walls apparently oozing saliva, and some of them reported seeing the face of an immense, yet pretty woman in the mirrors. One woke up feeling like her face had been licked. That was probably just another soldier though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur final victory of Australia, seven troops are put in therapy after allegedly being threatened by the image of a colossal woman on the moon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGotblub's personal assistants vanish without a trace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoldier decides to scare new recruits with ghosts stories. They come true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI get it! I knew the story, dammit! I actually did want a mere reminder. What do you want from me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey smiled. The one with glasses finally removed them from his head and places them in his shirt pocket, Figure out what the hell is going on, and if possible, stop it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo start out I recommend you check out the most recent Blob Woman sighting. A group of new recruits vanished in a local Candy Bar called the 'Swirled Blue.' A survivor was found. He's comatose. The girl in charge may know more than she lets on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut on the other hand, there's a town down in the country, recently renamed Gurgle River. Gotblub's Iron Law is almost non existent there because bizarrely, anyone recruited into their patrols mysteriously vanish. Same goes for anyone sent. As you may have guessed, there's a lot of saliva found. They're not complaining though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI did not want this job. I hated that gigantic bitch and all she had done to the world. The only remotely good thing to come from it was a world accepting of fat, bellies, gluttony and gas. And I was actually much happier as an outcast. But like I said, I had no choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, despite the grossly diminutive price you've offered me for my quality services, you have peaked my interest. You've got yourself a deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were happy to hear it. We discussed the current economy over coffee and cake (A keg of coffee each, and about two double sized cakes each), through which I lied through my enormous ass about how much I liked the new state of Europe. Once they left, I finally got to work on the case. Chasing Bigfoot basically. But nonethess, I didn't attend law school to do a half assed job on my first work in months. But first I needed to decide where to start.</span></div></div>",

My favourite. For those of you not in the know, a Fudge Roll is sort of like a roundish, rectangular cake full of hot melted chocolate. Except instead of the usual recipe, it was basically changed into vaguely cake tasting chocolate. I drooled onto my coat just watched her melt the chocolate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hungry, are you?\" she asked me. I looked to her name tag. Zelda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't we all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Undoubtably. Dangerous business, though. Get too fat, Gotblub's boys come in and scoop you up. Get too thin-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same deal. Yeah, sucks, don't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a needle and sucked up the chocolate, proceeding to pump it into the Rolls. \"Well, I guess it's a good thing we have stories like that Blob Woman ordeal to keep ourselves a little hope. Hope that Thompson can clear things up for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe handed me the ice cream and the Rolls. I took a bite and watched the overfilling chocolate pour onto my chest. \"Sure as hell'd make my life easier.\" I lifted the glass to my lips and started guzzling the ice cream down. Bleedin' ecstacy, I tell you. And if I solved this, it didn't have to be a treat. I could have one of these buggers with every meal. I tried not to get my hopes up and focussed on savouring each gulp and each nibble as much as possible. By the end, my face was covered in brown ice cream and sauce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UuuURp! That was nice...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, I headed out to my car, slowly lopping my tongue across my face, giving each taste bud a taste of the chocolate that stained it.

Many soldiers went missing after a long day of binging there, like she was waiting patiently for em'.

With the bom of extra food, believe or not, sometimes we have too much! There's just that much food these days. We didn't want to throw it in the trash in case we still wanted it later, so we just started taking it to this chunk of forest. It looks like Willy Wonka's Factory mixed with a garbage dump. A yummy one, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of driving, we were there. Josh was very happy about it, too. My car was pretty small, so my gut pressed him against the window. On the way I started thinking. How did he know so much if he had only seen her once? The Fatty Food Forest was definately a good guess, but why was he so confident she'd be here. And if he didn't know about the Corpulence Conflict, why did he take it in stride?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, now, we should probably set a trap of some kind.

I was tied up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, let me ask you, how many mystery monsters of legend can tie people up with rope?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI kept silent. Finally, she reemerged, The Blob Woman. I could see her clearly for myself now. She was huge, nearly bigger than anyone I'd seen, aside from the Prime Minister, maybe twenty feet tall and thirty five feet round. She had surprisingly super model esque looks, with the red lips described to me by Josh. My jaw dropped as I saw what was in her hands...A bucket of KFC.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Crap, you're awake! Crap, I thought for sure I had more time than this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time for what, Missy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...\" I was beginning to find her rather odd. This jibbering wasn't very menacing. I didn't believe for one second she could ever strike fear into the hearts of Gotblubs everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Out with it!\" She reeled back in surprise. Yep, definately not the real deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The name's Stacey Racers, but everyone around here calls me The Blob Woman!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing devouring the forces of Prime Minister Gotblub?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No, I'm a big eater, yes, but I'm not like her! I'd never do that to anyone, honest!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really? Then why am I tied up? Why all the disappearances over the years, you tell me everything right now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know anything about disappearances! I'm just a homeless woman! I've been homeless all my life, homeless and starving. When the Corpulence Conflict began I thought I was going to die from starvation just looking at all the fat people, but then they started dumping their food here and I just sort of moved in. I swear I'm not responsible for any disappearances!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even if that is all true, why am I tied up, and where's my companion?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" she was terrified of me. I was completely powerless, yet completely in control. \"You two were knocked out, so I just went back to eating that tasty sundae. A few hours later, he started waking up and tried to shoot me again. I wanted to scare him off, so I grabbed you and started yelling like an animal. He ran away, but then I had you, and I wasn't quite sure what to do. If I left you there you'd probably bother me again, so I took you to my home and tied you up. I was trying to figure out how to get you back into the city without anyone seeing me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI considered this. That was fear in her eyes, I could see it. She was telling the truth. \"Just one more question.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh hu!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's with the green skin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...they throw all kinds of junk food out here, even some glow in the dark Skittles. I ate all of them, and well, I guess I know why they threw them out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. You can untie me now and we can discuss things in better detail.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was very clumsy, in the end, she just bit the ropes open, god knows how she got them on in the first place. She sat at the end of the cave, filling it up completely as I sat comfortably on her belly, using her bellybutton as a seat for my rotund rump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So they just started yelling Blob Woman at you, and you liked the name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I thought it sounded cool since I've always been skinny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you realise that you are now likely the fattest girl on the planet aside from Gotblub?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously?\" Her eyes lit up. \"No freaking way! That is wonderful to hear!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And ou share the name with an Urban Legend that is terrorising the Gotblub Forces.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I guess that's less wonderful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you two are clearly connected. I'm guessing since you're both so huge, you were mixed up by a few people. But the Blue Swirl had a real Blob Woman sighting. Have you been there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lots of times, in the dark of the night of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very curious. I have an odd feeling that you have a strong connection to the real deal.

They were fortunate enough to be one of few couples who had indeed found their soul mate. However, they had only been working on this new invention for a few months now, and it was proving to be a much more mixed experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them were brilliant scientists even before the Corpulence Conflict; the war merely allowed the public to take them seriously with their weight gain pills and the still incomplete 'Immobility Ray' (I was almost done, but now you have to be a LOT fatter to be immobile). Their family had prospered in that time, allowing their children to study at the best schools and eat the best food. Of course the 'best food' meant stuff like 'A snack of six cheeseburgers.' Yes, like most in the world at this stage, the Hungersnaps were obese gluttons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust was big, just under three hundred pounds, but had that look that suggested he was quite a looker for the old world underneath his many layers of fat. He had grown into the fatherly type quite quickly and cared for nothing more than his family and keeping them as overfed as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBianca was the bigger of the two, at about four hundred and forty pounds. She often turned heads with her flowing blonde hair and sizeable (even for her weight) belly. Like her husband, she of course found her family to be the most important thing in her life, strongly believing that they were actually underprivileged compared to how they should be. She had a habit of mentioning this just as one of her kids devoured a tenth or twelfth roast chicken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaomi was their first daughter, though she had a friendly demeanour and did her best to be as polite as possible, she was deep down, quite self centred, only hinted to by her choice of black, almost Gothic clothing and makeup. She often showed annoyance at something as small as having to hold up a conversation during a meal, though when proudly at two hundred and eighty pounds, she at least had her reasons. Fortunately she had a heart big enough for genuine care for those around her, as little as it seemed sometimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicholas was their second child. Though he, like his other siblings, inherited his parents amazing intellect, as early as they could remember, he loved girls. Unfortunately, not all girls loved him, but the 17 year old chubster could certainly feel satisfied, currently being involved with fellow young genius, Lenora Jiggles, whose name wasn't only accurate in weight, but in the fact that she was an avid dancer. He'd probably do anything for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRamona was the youngest at about 14 (Turning on fifteen). Her favorite hobby of all time was probably surfing the web with a bowl of nachos. Despite being the youngest, AND being quite energetic, her tremendous weight could easily be noticed. She wasn't the fattest out of her obese siblings, but certainly much fatter than she should be at her age, and was well on her way to surpassing her PARENTS in a few years. Her gluttony mode was on almost non-stop, and her parents couldn't have been prouder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe project was an ambitious one. One that actually moved considerably far out of their usual field, being Bellyologists. But nonetheless, it would prove to be the most important event of their careers. And maybe even their lives. For better, or for worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after months of construction, research and design, it was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBianca! Call the kids! It's done! We've finally finish it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCan't believe it. I haven't been this excited in years! she squealed in the most respectable and professional manner possible. Flicking on the intercom, she pulled the microphone to her mouth, Kids! Our project is complete! Comeu p and have a look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaomi groaned. She was excited, yes, but this meant she had to get up and walk down to the lab. And their elevator was on the fritz. Nicholas and Ramona were a bit more polite about it, but perhaps that was because they were having an eating contest and were too busy stuffing pies into their mouths to feel any discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, the siblings found themselves in the lab. It was technically the Family lab, but with a project that their parents deemed so important, they were temporarily restricted. All of them had managed to obey that rule, though Ramona did try to stretch it when she wanted to use their super computer to calculate how many bags of nachos she needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, the secret project is done? Are you going to leave us hanging for another four months, or are you going to tell us what it is? snarked Naomi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlow and steady wins the race, Naomi, her father smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTell that to Mom's Eating Contest Trophies laughed Nicholas, quickly fanning at his family to let them known they could continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks son. Now, let me introduce you all to what is possible our greatest accomplishment since you three! The two titanic lovers stepped aside, their tummies no longer blocking the view of the workbench.</span></div></div>",

Conventional weapons couldn't harm her and neither could bio warfare, energy or nukes. She was unstoppable.

The Martians were a rather bizarre and divided race of genius, so when I say 'head,' I meant it. Unlike most other species, Martians gained weight mostly in their heads, meaning that their bodies were often well toned or curvy, while their heads swelled to tremendous size. Apparently upon first meeting them our ancestors believed they were wearing extremely large and round helmets, or blue afros. This has some strange reactions within them, such as enhanced intelligence and small psychic powers that allow the body to act mostly unhindered by the enormous head. It was also, oddly enough, the least vulnerable part of the body. Terra was a pretty smart cookie, with a head almost two meters tall and wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerra, what do you suggest as our course of action?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached up and stroked her forehead. Not sure, surprisingly enough. Never before have we faced an enemy like this. So...small, and insignificant. I honestly don't know whether we should blast them or take them on board and give them a lesson in battle tactics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA growl emitted from below my chest, and above her eye brows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI think I may have an idea. Bring them on board. Have you been honing your psyche skills?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery day, Ms. President.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVery well then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long after that we had a new Gotblub ship to study and an entire crew of full bellies. Delicious!</span></div></div>",

Today's world conflict is being fought for weight gain. The UK has been split into The United Republic, who are considered the TRUE new UK, and the Gotblub Empire who are out to conquer the world to satisfy their power (and food) hungry Empress Gotblub. She's already gotten her hands on Australia and a good chunk of Europe, so a new alliance between the UR, US and most of Asia has been forged to save the planet. Meanwhile, a secretive group known as The Adipose Organisation watches on, contemplating their next move... Also, somehow warfare now incorporates lots of weight gain and eating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this story you are allowed Weight Gain and stuffing (Oh, really?) as well as vore. <br>\r\nAlso allowed is gay and lesbian stuff, digestion, belching and scat if you feel like it.<br>\r\n Unrealistic weight gain (five hundred pounds after one meal) is allowed if you justify it in some way, such as a new super weapon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n What I don't want is intense violence (Unless you count digestion), and overly sexual moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Also, please do not do one paragraph chapters unless you find it necessary. On a minor note, I'd prefer to keep random appearances by magic and aliens out of it for the most part. Knowledge of how the military works isn't required (I'd be a hypocrite to sat it was), so just do what you think would work best for what you're writing at the time. In any case, welcome to The Corpulence Conflict</td>",
