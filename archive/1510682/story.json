She picked it up and stared at it for a few seconds. She looked on the table and noticed it was the last bottle. She wasn't really that drunk... yet,but just drunk enough not to make a good choice. She drank down the whole bottle and she let out a sound of pleasure. \"Man,that last bottle was great,although it tasted a bit different than normal. Oh well,it was still a fine last drink.\" said Rangiku happly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she stood up,she almost fell over. She giggled a little and corrected her posture. She left the room and as she walked down the hall,she began to feel a little odd. Suddenly her soul reaper uniform began to get a bit snugger around her hips and breasts. Rangiku's breasts started to expand a bit and she noticed that. She cupped her large breasts with her hands and she could feel them growing between her fingers!! \"Holy cow,my boobs are getting bigger!! Oh this is great,im becoming a even hotter woman.\" Rangiku said with total pleasure in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut this exciment wasn't going to last long. Soon rangiku's breasts stopped growing and her whole body started to inch upward. Rangiku gained 5 inches on her full height in just little more than 5 seconds!!! Her height growth didn't last that long,but it wasn't over yet either.</span></div></div>",

It feels like I'm on something, but that can't be; this hallway has always been empty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rangiku get off of me!\" she heard a muffled order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then she realized what she must be on top of was her cute little captain. She couldn't help but blush because her size (and bust size) had buried Hitsugaya deep into her cleavage. Not that this was something new to her, she tended to do it to me five times a week, but now he was completely swallowed by her boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Captain...\"</span></div></div>",

She walked out of her room and down the hallway she happly went. But as she was going to go and enter the next set of halls,she noticed a bottle sitting on the floor. She walked up to it and picked it up. She examine it and noticed it was the same bottle that made her breasts grow. \"Oh no way!! It's another one of those bottles that made my breasts grow.\" Rangiku said with pure joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly uncorked it,and chugged the whole thing down till there was only a drop left in it. \"Even bigger breasts,here they come.\" Rangiku said with eagerness. Not even a second passed before she started to notice the changes beginning. Rangiku was so excited,but her excitement quickly faded away. Her breasts weren't growing any bigger. \"All man,why aren't they growing!!?\" said Rangiku. But to her surprise,she felt her butt getting a tad bit bigger and the rest of her body inching upwards!! \"Wait...am I getting taller!!?\" Rangiku said in fear. She watched as the floor rose further and further away from her,and the walls beside her grow closer and closer to her sides. Soon rangiku could feel her whole soul reaper uniform starting to become extremely tight on her whole body. The pant's legs of her uniform stretched up her long beautiful legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sleeves started to grow tighter around her arms and they're splitting apart as they were being pulled up her arms. Then the bottle's juices,began to take effect again in her breasts,soon her breasts began to start expanding again!! The opening were her breasts are,was beginning to show more and more cleavage. Then suddenly Rangiku felt a sharp pain on the top of her head. She looked up and saw it was the ceiling!! \"Wha...what? Is that the ceiling!?\" Rangiku said totally shocked. Rangiku's soul reaper outfit was torn a bit,but ti still was in good enough condition for clothing. Rangiku was starting to regret ever drinking that second bottle,or even the first one to be honest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next to her?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
