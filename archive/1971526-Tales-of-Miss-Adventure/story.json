You can't believe you actually went along with this and fell for your sister's trick, you start to think of ways of getting yourself out of this as you don't want to hurt Maggie's feelings. When you arrive, Maggie takes your hand and you walk in together. You get looks as soon as you enter the mall, some people staring and whispering but also many boys pointing and looking at you both lustfully. Maggie is dressed less femininely than you in a jacket, skinny jeans and pink converse so you in your skirt and heels get the most stares which embarrasses you slightly. Maggie is at least five inches taller than you, even in heels so you feel safer beside her as you pass through the gauntlet of longing looks. Walking in the heels is a little difficult at first but you are soon walking in them like a woman would, taking smaller daintier steps and bringing one foot in front of the other. Maggie notices the stares you are getting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boys are such pigs. They see two girls on a date and think they are their personal eye candy\" she says shaking her head. \"Just ignore them Tina\". You continue walking to the main concourse and stop in the center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where do you want to shop Tina?\" Maggie says smiling at you. You look around at all the shops available and consider your options.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You are clueless what you should pick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou defer to Maggie \"I don't mind, why don't you decide?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks surprised. \"Are you sure? I said you could pick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I'm just spoiled for choice\" you say smiling at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In that case...\" she quickly scans the stores. \"How about there\" she points at a Victoria's Secret outlet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grow nervous now, if she gets you to try on something too skimpy she may see your bulge or notice that your breast are actually socks. You are also anxious about wearing even more girly clothes, since you are only just getting comfortable walking in public. \"Okay sounds good.\" you say not trying to disappoint her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both head on in still hand in hand. You are greeted by lingerie of all shapes and sizes but Maggie leads you straight to the boudoir collection. She lets go of your hand and starts looking through all the racks. You do the same and soon find yourself genuinely interested in your browsing. Maggie turns, holding a sheer pink baby doll, with g-string and stockings and holds it against your body. \"This would look so cute on you Tina.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about you, I'm sure you would look great in it too.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I'm not the kind of girl who dresses up too sexy for bed, I prefer to appreciate girls who do.\" she says with a wink. \"Why don't you try this on? It looks to be your size\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour stomach lurches. What if she wants to see you in it. You can't back out or you might offend her. \"Sure\" you say nervously taking the hanger from her hands. You head to the changing rooms full of dread. An attendant greats you. \"Hi their miss, there is a changing room free just at the end. Your friend can wait just outside if she wants\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I will\" Maggie says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk into the changing room. Luckily it is one with a lockable door rather than a fabric screen so you don't have worry about being exposed. Maggie takes a seat just outside as you close the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a deep breathe and start undressing. First the shirt and jacket and then the skirt and heels. You decide to keep your pantyhose on and just try on the baby doll itself, rather than with the g-string and stockings. As you pull it on you shudder slightly as the silky material rubs against your skin. You look in the mirror and gasp as you see how sexy you look. Even without the G-string and stockings on you look beautiful. Your sister really did a good job in making you look like a girl, anyone looking at you now would not think you were a boy at all apart from the flat chest.  You start making a few feminine poses, enjoying your situation perhaps a little too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does it look Tina? Can I see?\" Maggie's voice through the door makes you jump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm yeah it looks great.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice. Are you going to come out?\" You panic. If you go out she will be able to tell you are a boy. You need to think fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd rather surprise you in it later.\" you say sultrily. You slap your hand to your head. Why did you do that? That was a stupid move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really, you've got me excited now. Come out and I'll buy it for you, or should I say I'm buying it for me?\" You hear her say sexily though the door. Great, now your going to have to dress up for her and she will find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get dressed and pick up the lingerie and open the door. Maggie is already stood waiting with a hungry look in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets have another look around, there may be something else sexy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe both of you spend another hour looking through the racks. You find yourself drawn to more and more feminine lingerie and you start genuinely enjoying yourself. You are just feeling the material of a pink stocking and suspender set when Maggie turns to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you are not a girly girl? You have been looking at the cutest underwear all day. Plus you really do act like one, all your mannerism match. If your cousin hadn't told me you were a lesbian I would have thought you were just a straight prep.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't know how to respond to this, you may have gotten a little carried away looking for lingerie but overall you have been trying to act as masculine as possible. \"Yeah I guess I am\" you say unsure of what to say.\" Her expression lightens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thats great. I've always wanted to date an ultra femme\" she says happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot sure how to reply you just smile sweetly. You spend another half our browsing together before Maggie buys you the baby doll set and you leave the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for buying me that\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its my treat cutey, don't worry about it.\" You didn't think you were far enough along for pet names yet. \"Do you mind if we go to another store before we go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure lets go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leads you to another store.</span></div></div>",

Palm upward and open, she blows across it, sending powder into your three faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoughing, sneezing and rubbing it from your nose, eyes, and mouth. Sandy is laughing at your discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim pulls back his arm as if ready to punch her. But Jack steps in front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... You can't punch a girl.\" you tell him. Sparing a snarky smile for Sandy, as you score a point. Punching women is wrong. Taking the high moral ground, you walk past as if she's nothing. Jack pulls Jim until he falls into step with you. \"Yeah... If you were a guy.\" he mutters to himself, loud enough for Sandy to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or if you guys were girls...\" Sandy chuckled to herself, as she walked off in the opposite direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading home, you go your separate ways, and have a dull evening doing your homework, and watching TV. Too quickly the evening passes and you head to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour sleep is deep, but troubled, Sandy's words refusing to leave you in peace.</span></div></div>",

Reading their faces, you see the jealousy, envy and judgement.

Straightening up, you try to project a confidence you don't feel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the chill air of the tent works it's magic, you feel the effect.

You'd heard he was serious about the girl, really wanted to craft a life together with her, but as the saying goes she was trouble. She simultaneously objected and criticised the whole lifestyle her boyfriend was involved in, yet seemed to happily indulge in it when it suited her. Remember that jewelry store burglary? There was one incredibly ornate and unique necklace that you specifically passed on swiping knowing it was too distinctive to risk being caught with. Well, a few days later what do you think you saw the girlfriend wearing around her neck? She also seemed to get herself in a \"manager\" role on something, whatever that title meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were still a little unsure about the lies she'd told about you so that she could justify the breakup (both with her boyfriend and the organisation), but you knew whatever  she said, the guy in front of you had heard her say everything directly to him, probably in the midst of an emotional breakup. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped, and you felt queasy in your stomach. You finally start realising that to him, you're one of the people who took his whole world away from him. He's not going to let this go, and in a few seconds you are going to walk right past him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've come this far, you can make it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShit, you've heard stories about what happen to people who cross this mob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA step<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt usually involves abandoned warehouses and improvised sound insulation! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA step<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeep it together<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up, you see him, does he recognise you?

You duck around for a better view, but are way too close. Andre takes a step back towards you as he repositions, and suddenly pulls back his fist for a punch.

The chemicals changes his skin tone into a brighter Asian one, gets rid of all of his body hair, and genetically changes his ethnicity into that of a Japanese citizen. Long metal clamps grabbed onto Chris\u2019s arms and lower legs (hands and feet included), which then thinned them out and made them more dainty. Then a suction cup attached to each of Chris\u2019s hips, which then ballooned them into childbearing proportions. Then a bowl-like device attached onto Chris\u2019s private area, which then genetically transformed his crotch into a fully functional female one. Chris was now a she. A bunch of needles injected estrogen and other female hormones into Chris\u2019s body, intensifying her female biology even more. Then two suction cups attached to Chris\u2019s rear end, which then made it into a bubble butt. Then a large clamp attached onto Chris\u2019s sides, which then flattened out her stomach and gave her an hourglass figure. Then two clamps attached onto Chris\u2019s shoulders, which then made them more rounded. Then two large suction cups attached onto Chris\u2019s chest, which then gave her large, bouncy, and voluptuous E cup breasts (complete with nice perky nipples). Then a needle attached to her neck, making it much more thin and elegant. Then a face mask attached onto Chris\u2019s face, transforming it into that of a beautiful Japanese women. Then a second needle attached onto Chris\u2019s neck, giving her a much more feminine, cute, and high pitched voice (complete with a thick Asian accent). Then Emily washed Chris\u2019s hair; making it more straight and silky smooth, dying it black, and lengthening it out to her mid back. When all of the devices were removed and the water was drained, Chris had been fully transformed into a gorgeous Japanese woman with flowing black hair. \u201cYou turned out beautifully!\u201d Emily ecstatically chimed in. \u201cNow it is time for...\u201d</span></div></div>",

Then she presses some buttons on the back of a chair before finally pressing one larger button on the table in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll sorts of mechanical devices immediately spring to life around the chair. Firstly, the front and end clamp around your head and feet respectively, pushing them in to reduce your height to 5\u20195, a far cry from your old 6\u20191. Then, several bowl-like contraptions pop up, attaching to your crotch, hips, butt, and chest. Before long, you are sporting a pair of DD boobs, child-bearing hips, a bubble butt, and female anatomy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, mechanical hands spring up, massaging your shoulders to make them more rounded. While this occurs, several needles are injected into you to force your brain to begin producing the chemicals that a woman\u2019s brain would produce. This also gives you a much more feminine voice. Your hair and eyes both shift to become a boring, dull, poop brown in color, with your hair growing past your shoulders. Your face also shifts and morphs to become more feminine. Your ears are tugged on till they are a bit bigger, just big enough to be noticeably awkward. The same is done to your nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe changes aren\u2019t done though. A bright light is shone into both of your eyes, dulling they till you need glasses to see anything clearly. A spray bottle is then sprayed over you, causing lots of pimples to pop up, especially on your face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn comparison to Emily, you\u2019re downright ugly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut things still aren\u2019t done. A new device appears, looking similar to a bicycle pump, and the pump inserts itself into your side. A small screen pops up on in it with one question: what is the new desired weight?</span></div></div>",

Do you have any recommendations?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I think that's probably the best you'll get in Men's... Unless...\" Carol started. \"Nah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unless what?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chafing felt like it was getting worse by the minute, it probably warranted a doctor's appointment, but you needed new clothes in order to even function enough to make the appointment!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I know that uh... the clothing in the Ladies department tends to be much softer and easier on the skin. At least from personal experience.\" Carol said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At this point, I'll take it.\" you said. \"Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou made your way to the women's department and began to browse around, nonchalantly, picking up a few things in your size, and quickly heading into the men's dressing room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, this new batch seemed to be working fine. A pair of sweatpants that were mostly masculine as they were gray, with only a pink logo emblazoned on the front of the thigh, easily covered up. A few more pairs of women's pants, only lacking pockets to distinguish them from men's, a few blouses of blues and greens, and some camisoles for undershirts finished off your choices, and you quickly checked out, rushing home to change into something more suitable, choosing a camisole, a powder blue blouse, and a pair of dress pants that felt far softer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhhhh....\" you sighed as you wrapped yourself in a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe discomfort was gone! How wonderful! And just in time, you had to head out to the show!</span></div></div>",

Heading into the dressing room, Alfred was buttoning up his shirt and combing his hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Alex. Glad you made it. Ready to learn my secrets?\" Alfred asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. Let's get this over with.\" you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In due time, in due time. By the way, I like your new clothes.

You jumped, realizing you didn't remember coming home after the show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did I...\" you started, but were interrupted when a loud knock came from the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly leaped out of bed, and rushed to the door, checking the peephole. It was Sarah, which was strange, you hadn't remembered inviting her over... had you? You opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah! What an unexpected surprise?\" you asked, as you let Sarah in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex, sorry for dropping by unannounced, but I wanted to check on you after yesterday...\" Sarah started, then noticed what you were wearing, a pair of the sweatpants you'd bought yesterday and one of the camisoles. \"What are you wearing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I took your advice!\" you exclaimed. \"This fixed the problem right up. No more chafing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not quite... You know what? It doesn't matter. You said you felt better?\" Sarah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep!\" you replied. \"All thanks to you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't take all the credit. Say, how much did you get paid?\" Sarah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" you exclaimed. \"I almost forgot...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scanned the room, spotting an unfamiliar envelope on a table. You rushed over and picked it up, finding it opened, and pulled out the check, made out to you, for $200.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice!\" Sarah remarked. \"All that for just a few hours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so.\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you're okay.\" Sarah said. \"After the other day, I was worried. Be careful Alfred doesn't mess with your head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you stop worrying? It ain't real! And I'm <i>this close</i> to figuring him out.\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say so...\" Sarah said, reaching into her jacket pocket and pulled out her phone, checking the lock screen. \"Oh, I gotta run. Jane and I are getting manicures.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you felt a little self-conscious of your nails. You remembered how good it felt when Alfred complimented the professionalism of your clothes, but looking at your nails, they were ragged and dirty. Somehow, this never mattered before, but it mattered now. You felt the urge to do something about making them look better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's why...</span></div></div>",

I don't know, something about my nails are bothering me. You probably think it's weird.\" you replied. \"Forget it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! No, it's not weird, it's just... I didn't think you took that much pride in your appearance.\" Sarah insisted. \"Lots of guys do it, mainly high-society guys, but it's starting to become mainstream. We'd be glad to have you along.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not just saying that to make me feel better?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not!\" Sarah replied. \"As long as no one hypnotized you to get one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't even joke!\" you grimaced. \"I'll get my coat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA half-hour later, after getting into another blouse and a pair of new jeans, you were sitting in a salon chair in between Jane and Sarah, getting your fingernails buffed by a very nice nail-tech named Erin who didn't even blink when you walked into the salon. Sure, the clientele was all women, but you didn't feel out of place in the slightest. In fact, you felt welcomed. Nobody commented, even when you declined their offer to trim your nails down. You liked them a bit long, you found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I could get my boyfriend to let me do this to him. His are horrid.\" Erin joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just have to make a convincing argument for hygiene.\" you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clear polish, I'd guess?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guessed right!\" you smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stopped yourself from going, \"Although...\" After all, there was always next time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! I nearly forgot! We're doing a special today, pedicures are half-off with a manicure.\" Erin said, addressing all three of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane checked her watch and turned back to Erin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've got time. I know Sarah and I are in.\" Jane said, turning to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought about it for a moment, it's not like anyone would ever see it, and you'd probably do clear polish too...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\" you accepted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce your nails were dry, you took off your shoes and socks and your feet went into a basin of warm water, which felt heavenly. Where had this been all these years?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all was said, done, and polished, you and the girls headed off, meeting at the bar to hang with the rest of the gang. You realized that you hadn't ever really spent any time alone with Jane and Sarah outside of the others, and it was nice to have something special to do with them. It gave you the same warm feeling that Alfred's compliment had, actually. You'd have to do this more often.</span></div></div>",

I know you don't want to be here, but I'd say make the best of it, because you're here until camp ends.\" Carla said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you really don't get it. This is a mix-up, there must be two Leslie Daniels or something, but I'm not a girl. For all we know, she's at the boy's camp in my place!\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not going to say it again, get used to being here, and no amount of trying to convince me that you're a boy is going to work.\" Carla sternly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"This woman really is dense, isn't she?\"</i> you thought to yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd be better off trying to convince your cabin-mates, but you don't want to open that can of worms, since they might not be as forgiving as you wish they'd be. You went back to the cabin, and found the girls gathered around, talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Leslie! Come on, join us, we're talking about our favorite bands,\" Annie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe later.\" you said, climbing into your bunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and I have a spare pair of PJ's you can borrow.\" Nora said. \"I left it in your part of the dresser.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" you sighed.</span></div></div>",

At least camp food is universal. Most of the conversation revolved around the events of the day, and so you were reminded of the poison ivy incident a few times whenever a girl from the hike passed by to check on you, asking about the rash and itching. Thankfully, the lotion you got from Kendra was working wonders, and you didn't see any sign of a rash showing up as of yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce dinner was over, you headed back to the cabin. With a few hours before lights out, the girls started their nightly rituals. Nora was reading a book, Annie was putting on a face mask and Kendra was inspecting her toenails. You noticed her staring at you as you unpacked \"your\" suitcase, putting everything away in the drawers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I blocking you?\" you asked as you moved out of the way of the dresser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, I was just wondering if I could borrow that nail polish.\" Kendra pointed at a bottle of bright pink polish that you had left sitting on the dresser as you went through all the clothes. \"It's such a pretty shade.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, of course. I told you it was all up for grabs.\" you said as you handed her the bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKendra grabbed your hand before you could pull it away, and inspected it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Been a while since your last manicure, huh?\" Kendra asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been busy.\" you weakly smiled, hoping that this wasn't the end of your charade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sit down.\" Kendra pulled you over to her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should finish unpacking.\" you tried to pull away, but Kendra kept pulling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you gave up and sat down, cross-legged, on Kendra's bunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsk, tsk.\" Kendra giggled. \"Though I guess bird-watching will get your fingernails dirty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKendra pulled out a nail file and started to work on your nails as she started to make small-talk, mostly inquiring about your life outside of camp. Apart from a few embellishments, you tried your best not to lie, given that it would be hard to keep a story straight if you lied to everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Kendra finished rounding your nails, she started to paint them with the pink polish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe worst part was admitting to Kendra that you'd never kissed anyone. Boy, girl, you hadn't yet been so fortunate, and blushed furiously when you admitted it to Kendra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't be ashamed. There's nothing wrong with saving yourself for the right guy. Or girl.\" Kendra said. \"Or if you don't want to do it at all, but based on that blush, I think you do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess.\" you giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd never admit it to anyone, but getting your nails painted was actually relaxing, and talking with Kendra took your mind off your predicament. So much so, that you didn't resist as harshly when she offered to do your toes as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Annie and Nora joined in on the conversations, and they were giggling like schoolgirls, and you were giggling along with them. This experience stunk, but that didn't mean that you couldn't find enjoyment in small things. Once your nails were dry, it was lights out and for the first time since you got there, you slept soundly.</span></div></div>",

You pulled your Cabin 8 shirt back on and brushed your teeth, exiting the bathroom with barely enough time for Annie to quickly rush past you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What activity are you going to do today?\" Kendra asked. \"We're still doing softball if you're interested.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I think there's another hike today.\" Nora said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'll pass on any more hikes.\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably smart.\" Nora said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started looking for a pair of socks, but all the socks (the other Leslie's socks) that you had put into the drawers had vanished. And they weren't with the other girls' stuff either. Come to think of it, you couldn't find your sneakers anywhere either. The only footwear sitting out were a pair of sandals with a slight heel. Not your sneakers, not even a pair of other Leslie's sneakers. You started to furiously look around when you heard chuckling from the other side of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKendra was having trouble suppressing laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kendra? Would you happen to know where my socks and sneakers went?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me? Oh I...\" Kendra burst out laughing. \"Okay, okay, it was me.

After all, you weren't intending on doing anything overly physical anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the girls and you started to head out for breakfast, you suddenly remembered your intended plan. The letter to Mom!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, would any of you happen to have paper and a pen?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What for? A love letter to your crush?\" Annie asked in a sing-song voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, a letter to my mom.\" you replied. \"Phones haven't been reliable lately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got something you can use. Even have a few envelopes too.\" Nora started to dig through her bag, handing you a sheet of pink paper, an envelope and a pen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. I'll catch up with you in a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it.\" Nora said as the three departed for the mess hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got work writing furiously, explaining your predicament and all the salient details. You begged your mother to come rescue you and sealed the envelope up, writing your address on the front. You'd bring it to the main office later, but even then, you'd have to wait a few days for it to be delivered, so your main concern was food, and you quickly ran over to the mess hall for breakfast.</span></div></div>",

I was hoping you'd say that!\" Annie squeezed you in another hug and kept her arm around you as you walked back to the cabin, with her telling you all the fun stuff you'd be doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKendra and Nora just rolled their eyes as they followed along back to the cabin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the cabin, Nora and Kendra gathered up their things for their activities, while Annie went digging in her bag for something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I forgot to give these to you yesterday, but I made them during crafts.\" Annie handed something to each girl, and then to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bracelet made out of thread and beads. Looking closer, you realized that the beads spelled out your name. And the others spelled out the other girls' names. As much as you wanted to get out, your heart couldn't help but be warmed by Annie's gift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Friendship bracelets!\" Annie exclaimed. \"That way, we'll be friends forever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKendra and Nora thanked Annie and put their bracelets on. In order to not raise suspicion, and for no other reason, you also put your bracelet on. Your's was made of various pinks, and matched your nails quite nicely. That is, if you cared about such things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you later!\" Kendra said as she and Nora left the cabin to head to their activities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go, Leslie!\" Annie grabbed your arm and nearly dragged you all the way to the crafts area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday's activity was tie-dye, which you thought was pretty cool. You were all set to start when Annie offered you a pair of rubber gloves, to protect your nails, which you sheepishly accepted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you tie-dyed with Annie...</span></div></div>",

Everything was going well, and you were biding your time until a poorly timed turn caused you to collide with another girl and fall backwards onto the table that had everyone's dyed shirts and several open bottles of dye laying on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant, you were covered in wet, sticky dye from the neck down, mostly on your arms and legs, which were the most exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leslie!\" Annie shouted as she rushed to help you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she helped, several other girls tried to salvage the projects while asking you if you were okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah, I'm fine, just... crud!\" you shook your arms and blue dye dripped off of your elbow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla rushed over, and inspected the scene, and turned her attention to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're okay? No scrapes or anything?\" Carla looked you over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, just humiliation...\" you muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it, Leslie. It's not the first time anyone's done that just go rinse off in the shower cabin.\" Carla pointed towards an area that you had been intending to avoid during your stay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, you didn't have much of a choice given that if you didn't act fast, you'd be stained for weeks, and that would be much harder to get rid of than nail polish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly rushed to the showers, with Annie promising to grab you a change of clothes from Cabin 8 as you sprinted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting to the showers, you noticed that your sandals had fortunately survived, and you rinsed the clothes out in the sink before you walked into the showers and stripped out of your underwear. You glanced around to make sure no girl was hanging around, as you didn't want scare another camper if they figured out your real gender. No sense in causing trouble before you got out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hung the bra and panties, also un-dyed, right outside the shower, and without thinking, started to wash yourself with soap you had found lying there, probably left by another camper. Knowing how helpful and friendly everyone was, you didn't think they'd mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you rinsed off the dye, and the assorted dirt from the last few days, you found yourself feeling serene and relaxed. You just had to wait a few more days and your mom would clear this whole mess up. Just a few days...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, you were so lost in thought that you didn't hear Annie calling your name as she walked into the cabin. Nor did you realize until she pulled the shower curtain open and looked inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leslie! I brought you a new shirt and!\" Annie stopped in her tracks as you turned around, quickly covering up your crotch, but it was too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...\" you started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind started racing. What was gonna happen now? She'd tell Carla, definitely, then the other girls. Could you be arrested for this? You hadn't really thought through this far when you debated going to the nurse for a physical. You didn't ask to be here, but you didn't think that anyone would buy that. And you didn't know why, but what worried you the most wasn't legal ramifications, but the fact that now, Kendra, Nora and Annie were going to hate you. Why did they have to be so nice?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnie dropped the clothes and stepped back. You quickly dried off with a towel, wrapped it around your waist, grabbed another towel to wrap around your chest and ran through the camp, blowing past several confused girls as they watched a fellow camper sprint directly to Cabin 8.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly rushed into the bathroom in the cabin and locked the door. You sank down to the floor and started sobbing. You weren't usually this emotional, but given the last few days, this was a culmination of all your frustration and anger and fear coming out all at once. As you let your emotions out, there was a quiet knock at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leslie?\" the voice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go away!\" you shouted through your tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leslie, it's me,\" the voice started. \"It's...\"</span></div></div>",

Annie opened it a crack and passed through a bundle. Inside the bundle was another Cabin 8 shirt, that she'd likely gotten from Carla while you were showering, and a skirt, along with the underwear. You shut the door again and locked it while you changed back into dry clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't see much reason to keep up the charade with the bra, but you put it on anyway, along with the panties, skirt and t-shirt. You took a deep breath and opened the door, you'd have to face Annie eventually, and you didn't want this to happen with Kendra and Nora around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnie immediately embraced you in a hug.

I shouldn't have acted like that, it was just a bit of a shock.\" Annie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...\" you started to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In hindsight it makes so much sense, why you don't wear makeup, why you've been hesitant to be girly, you're still new at it.\" Annie continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thinks that you're transgender? That's... probably better for her, rather than find out that you got sent here by mistake and have been forced to pretend to be a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not mad?\" you sniffled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mad? Of course not! We're friends!\" Annie exclaimed, which made you feel really good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you gonna tell?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell who? Carla? No, if she doesn't already know, I won't spill. Kendra and Nora? If it's all right, I'd like to tell them, that way we can all help you in case something like this happens again.\" Annie replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can tell them. But don't tell anyone else.\" you requested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. Your secret's safe with me.\" Annie mimed locking her lips with a key. \"Pinky promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnie held out her pinky, and put your's up to it and linked them together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, let's go finish tie-dyeing.\" Annie said, handing you your sandals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled and quickly put the sandals back on, walking with Annie back to the crafts area.</span></div></div>",

You weren't offended, of course, because you were just a boy trapped in this feminine web, and desperate to escape it, but it at least provided some cover and might help you in the event that something... unbecoming happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDinner was uneventful, but fun, since you had started to pick up on how to converse with the girls, even subconsciously picking up on their speech patterns and using your hands more when you talked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're definitely playing softball tomorrow.\" Kendra told you as you walked back to the cabin after dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see.\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's only fair, you've done Annie's and Nora's activities. Tomorrow's my day to hang with you.\" Kendra said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say so.\" you giggled. Involuntarily, but it did feel nice to be wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the boy's camp, that you had spent every summer since you were 8, you made a few friends, but nothing substantial, and rosters rotated out year after year, so you very rarely had any lifelong friends. Meanwhile, you could tell from just watching, that lifelong bonds were being forged here at the girl's camp. It was a different experience to be sure, and one that wasn't as bad as the first day had made it out to be. Sure, you weren't happy to be here, and you didn't like dressing as a girl, but at least you were clothed and fed, better than being in a harsh environment with no one around who cared about you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leslie?\" Nora broke you out of your thoughts. \"Whatcha thinking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably her crush.\" Annie giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was not!\" you retorted. \"I was thinking about... how much fun I've been having here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed, you didn't want to have admitted that to yourself, let alone out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, that's sweet.\" Kendra hugged you quickly, before she hopped onto her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nightly rituals started once again, and Annie talked you into a facial, despite your objections. Skin-care is a gender neutral activity anyway, right? After washing it off, because of the excitement of the day, you again drifted off into sleep easily.</span></div></div>",

Finally!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bus quickly arrived at camp, and you were assigned to a cabin, the correct cabin, and you excitedly started to unpack your bag alongside your three cabin-mates.

They won't just toss them in, but you probably won't get them back for a few days. I'm really sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to explode at her, stealing your last vestiges of your masculinity, and then losing them, but... you knew she didn't mean it maliciously. It's not like anyone here was deliberately trying to trap you in a feminine web... it just sort of worked out that way because there were only girls here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay.\" you said. \"Just don't do it again or I'll have to go hiking barefoot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKendra smiled and you followed her to the mess hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another uneventful breakfast, you followed Kendra out to the softball field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Carla said as she checked her clipboard. \"Today's team Captains are... Kendra and Lauren.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got a sudden sinking feeling that you knew why Kendra had been so insistent that you join her today. The teams were chosen, and Kendra picked you immediately. You were a bit nervous, you were never the most athletic boy, and could barely play baseball, but you were worried about the prospect of being a cheerleader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, looks like we've got a few more girls than we've had in the past few days on both sides. Too many to field at the same time, so you can all go up to bat, but when you're fielding, a few of you will have to sit out.\" Carla said. \"Or cheer on the sidelines. I think we've got some pom poms in the storage shed, I'll go check.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, as Captain, I get to pick who fields.\" Kendra said as she addressed the team. \"Leslie...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKendra pointed at you and opened her mouth.

You were rather fortunate today, given that you found a pair of capris in Leslie's bag, so you didn't have to worry about a skirt or short shorts. You quickly pulled a hair tie from your pocket and pulled your hair back into a low ponytail, as Kendra assigned the other positions and you jogged to the outfield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one good thing about non-competitive sports, is that no one is really trying that hard, and so most of your responsibilities involved standing around, watching the in-field, or running after a grounder that got lobbed your way. Nothing major. That is, until the other team's captain, Lauren, got to bat in the fourth inning. As you'd find out later, she played competitively at home, and took the game seriously, so when Kendra pitched a fastball, Lauren popped it into the outfield, and straight towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Catch it, Leslie!\" Kendra shouted as Lauren headed for first base.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rushed underneath it, and tried to track its movements as it descended, but instead of landing in your glove like it was supposed to, it bounced out and smashed into your face, knocking you to the ground, and causing both teams to immediately rush the outfield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god!\" someone shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is she okay?\" another girl screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were fine, but your face was throbbing with pain.

Steph, take my spot.\" Kendra grabbed you and started walking you back towards the nurse's office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Second time in a week. I don't usually see campers this much in the first week.\" the nurse joked as she checked your eye. \"But nothing life threatening. You'll have a nasty shiner for a little while though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it.\" you held the ice pack to your eye as Kendra walked you back to Cabin 8.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed as you stared into the mirror, with the help of that calamine lotion from Kendra, the poison oak wasn't bothering you anymore, and the dye washed off, but this... this was worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is gonna suck, staring at this for a week.\" you sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you don't have to.\" Kendra started digging through the other Leslie's suitcase, before finding something. \"Ah ha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Kendra pull out?</span></div></div>",

You didn't realize you were such a klutz! Or maybe being forced to do this masquerade was throwing you off balance and you were inviting these instances of misfortune. Whatever the reason, you were hoping the softball to the face was the last misfortune you'd face. Maybe when you got home you could tell people that you won a fight! That would certainly help you regain all the masculinity that's been seeping out of you since you got here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning you woke up because you had been pelted with an article of clothing. You opened your eyes and sat up, finding a pink bikini had been thrown onto your bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Today's swim day!\" Annie chirped excitedly as she laid out her bathing suit onto her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Swim day?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once a week, instead of the normal activities, we all go swimming in the lake, over by the docks. Swimming used to be an activity, but I think they had a lack of lifeguards, and figured it was easier to let us all do it at once.\" Nora explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's great, but I'm not really a swimmer.\" you said, both attempting to get out of wearing the bikini, but also a truth. Swimming was an activity that you loathed, especially when you'd go swimming at the boy's camp and the older boys would hold your head under as a joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dressed in the same sort of outfit you'd worn in previous days, retaining the capris from yesterday, and went with the girls to breakfast. All of them had their suits on underneath their outfits, intending to get right in after eating. But of course, they escorted you back to the cabin and insisted that you change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I pack a different suit?\" you asked out loud as you dug through the suitcase, hoping to find shorts or one of those suits with the skirt or something of the like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with that? I think you'll look great in it!\" Kendra beamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just that... I have that thing... you know? Down there...\" you pointed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not a problem, just tuck.\" Annie said, almost off-handedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tuck?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I've seen it on TV, you just sorta, hide all that stuff down there.\" Annie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat kind of TV do these girls watch? You'd never heard of such a thing, but if you knew anything about these girls, it was that they were stubborn, and would wait until you changed. You did what she said, and it seemed to work, not revealing any undue information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter changing into the bikini, you slipped back into the sandals from the previous day, and followed the girls down to the docks where all the other campers were already having fun in the lake. Kendra, Nora, and Annie wasted no time jumping in while you stood at the edge of the dock, kicking your sandals off and placing them to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on in! The water's fine!\" Kendra shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know...\" you muttered as you wrapped your arms around yourself, still self-conscious in the bikini.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow do you get into the lake?</span></div></div>",

You wanted to be mad, but Kendra, Nora and Annie were laughing and splashing each other, and it was infectious. You smiled and joined in with the activities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurns out swimming was actually fun when you weren't being tormented and dunked against your will! There were some races that you took part in, you didn't win, but it was fun to try, and then there was a giant lake-set game of Marco Polo with the entire camp which was abject chaos, but the fun kind of chaos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour self conscious feelings vanished as you actually enjoyed the day more than you had ever enjoyed swimming at camp in your life before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that wasn't the only activity for the day, as not only was it \"Swim Day\" but it was also \"Bonfire Night\" and after dinner, the entire camp gathered around a bonfire roasting marshmallows. Carla remarked to herself how proud she was that the girl who spent so long trying to get out of the camp had finally come out of her shell and was enjoying herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe this camp wasn't so bad.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>One week later, you slowly opened your eyes as you heard the bustle of your cabin-mates getting ready. You stretched and got ready to greet the day. Your routine had gotten a bit faster, since you didn't have to brush your hair thanks to the help of one of the other campers, a girl named Izzy from Cabin 3, who had braided your hair during movie night into twin fishtail braids. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>As the movie played, you looked around for the popcorn bowl, which had last been in Nora's hands. Nora didn't have it, but she was preoccupied with another camper who was working her hands through Nora's hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Leslie, Izzy's gonna braid my hair, want her to do you when she's done?\" Nora asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so.\" you replied. \"I don't think my hair is suited for braids.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way! Your hair is so cute!\" Izzy exclaimed. \"And braids are even cuter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the faces of the two girls, you couldn't help but be swayed to accept the offer. After all, braids can be removed, right?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemembering movie night made you smile, since the braiding had been mostly convenient and you didn't have to worry about hair ties anymore. And you didn't get nearly as much forest junk stuck in your hair during hikes or bird-watching, which you had gotten better at since the last time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter brushing your teeth, you looked yourself up and down in the mirror. What a difference a week can make! You managed to not have any more accidents, and your black eye had almost completely healed, but you still applied a bit of makeup at the behest of Kendra who insisted that you do it to keep your skin even. The lip gloss wasn't strictly necessary, but your lips had been getting chapped, and you didn't have any other type of chapstick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting dressed, you had finally gotten back your old sneakers, but found the pink ones to be far more comfortable, so your old sneakers had been left under your bunk, untouched since their return. You quickly pulled on a pair of shorts and your Cabin 8 t-shirt, examining your nails as you pulled your shirt over your head. They'd gotten a tad longer, you might have to ask Kendra if she has clippers, though she'll probably want to do another manicure, which you weren't entirely against.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Leslie! Isn't this that letter you sent to your mom?\" Nora asked as she looked under one of the bunks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe letter! You had completely forgotten about it because of the shower incident! You never sent it! And so you had been biding your time for nothing! How could you have been so stupid? You smacked your forehead and sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I left it here and must have forgotten to send it, then it got knocked under the bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, that was probably me when I went to get your change of clothes on tie-dye day.\" Annie apologized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine.\" you said. \"It wasn't time sensitive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had been having so much fun... but maybe that was the takeaway. This was fun. You were enjoying yourself, enjoying being Leslie the girl and not Les the boy. This was going to take some deliberation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you go along to breakfast? I'll catch up.\" you said as you held the letter in your hands.</span></div></div>",

You weren't the most athletic, and preferred books to sports, but you were never unsure about your gender. Until now. You hadn't ever been unhappy as a boy, or felt like you were in the wrong body, but the past week had shown that you were missing something, and you liked all the camaraderie and support that the girls gave each other that boys didn't for fear of being seen as \"gay\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the clothes were comfortable, which you didn't think at first, but after a week, you found yourself not minding any of the more form-fitting items designed for a body you didn't have, even if you were unnecessarily wearing a bra for breasts that would never grow, despite how Kendra, Annie and Nora kept insisting they would once you started hormones. You had fallen so easily into the role, what if that was the role you were meant to fill? More importantly, what happened to the real Leslie? Surely, she'd want her things back at the end of the summer. And why hasn't she shown up? Was she at the boy's camp pretending to be you? You imagine that'd be a bit tougher, but who knows?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought back to the breakfast conversation you had with your cabin-mates a few days earlier:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You giggled as Nora finished telling a funny joke, and Annie held a napkin up to her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop! Milk is coming out of my nose!\" Annie cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should meet up after camp ends. I don't want to lose touch.\" Kendra suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're definitely exchanging numbers. A shame we can't use technology here. I'd want to friend you all before I forget to.\" Nora added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat technology ban was one of the reasons you were stuck like this. You'd be able to easily prove your identity with your cell phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where do you live, Leslie?\" Kendra asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Southtown.\" you replied as you took a bite of food. Not a lie, and it was a big place, though you worried that she might look you up after and find the boy you intended to return to being after you escaped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's only about an hour away from Weston, where I live, I can totes take a bus to visit! Or vice versa!\" Annie exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt bad about leading them on, but what else could you do? Leslie wasn't sticking around, at least, the girl Leslie wasn't, but without your phone number, you'd never have to worry about seeing them ever again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face fell as you realized what that meant. You actually enjoyed their company, and you wanted to remain friends, but you couldn't! Not as who you are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something wrong?\" Kendra asked, her face full of concern and worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing.\" you smiled. \"Just thinking.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had come to a decision. You knew exactly what you were going to do. You quickly marched out and headed for the main office. You had to call your mom.</span></div></div>",

You have been in there already, for 20 minutes. Some of the rest of us, girls need to be able to pee and get ready for bed too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe loud knock, is all it took to send you over the emotional edge, and you finally let out a cracking moan and then a sob. ' There is no way you can be a girl for summer, and when everything comes to a head, you are going to be punished for some something that was not even your fault. '<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on and let me in\" said Nora's voice though the door, \"I want to help you. What is wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, it wrong!\" you cry out, \"Beside, you will not believe me, no one else does.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will not know if you do not try and tell me.\"  Nora implored back<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, but I tried to warned you.\" Leslie opens the bathroom door, and tries to to leave<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, you are not going any where, Missy until you say what is going on, or you have had a good long cry with us.

After all my parents want me to engage more with other girls. Hence sending me to a camp, for girls\" Nora continues almost unperturbed of the effect she is having on Leslie <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie's mouth drop open some, with the surrealness of the monument, thereby stopping his crying. He quickly turn around to face the other way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, hearing about other people's problem has gotten you to stop crying. So how about we both wash up some at those sinks, and go talk about your issues, with the other girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie hears some sounds from behind him, like toilet paper being unrolled, some wiping, and a flush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on wash those tears away, and we can talk.\" then laughing \"I think Kendra, snuck some chocolate bars in with her luggage. Chocolate will make things seem better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora and Leslie, wash up and return to the main cabin area. Kendra and Annie are now leaning over a glossy magazine. Talking about famous people and fashions that they wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, umm.. I have to say..Girls there is some thing you should..\" Sighing, after a few false starts you get out. \"Annie, Kendra, while I was in the bathroom, Nora found me and I am was crying. I have some things you need to hear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why were you crying? What is wrong? Did a gal from camp 7 give you the business, do not worry, I will get her for you?\" Kendra says both protectively and a bit of gusto. \"No one messes with my crew of friends\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this about your lost bag? I told it is okay I have, more enough clothes, I do not mind sharing outfit(s) for a camper in need. It is what the camp manual, says we should do for a camper in trouble.\" Annie replies, with both kindness and compassion. Though the last little bit sound to Less, as more a <i>need</i> to follow the rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well girls there is some thing I have to tell you and when I told Carla when we got off the bus and again when we came back from dinner. Well, she did not believe me. In fact when I said I could prove it she said my file says I am known to be a trouble maker, that is just <b>not true</b>. In fact I rarely get in trouble with my parents or at my school before summer break.\" Leslie implores them to at least believe in their new cabin-mate and hopefully friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what is it? Secrets are for sharing.\" Kendra adds, sensing some deeply juicy gossip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora makes sure you know she is there for Leslie, by holding on to his right shoulder. \"I look out for my friends, we will clear things up between you and Carla, little sister\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a second, Carla is not here, and if they are fighting we need to hear both sides of the story. After all, Carla is the lady appointed by the camp to look out for us.\" Yep, Annie may be right brain creative and arty, but something says she follow the rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath this may blow up in your face soon after wards but you got to tell them it is only fair. <br>\r\nIf no one believes you from here on out, that is at least a point in your favor that you tried to make them aware of the mix-up, you are pretty sure happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before we get to what is an emotional story, Kendra why don't you break out some of those chocolate bars, you are famous for 'importing' in to the camp.\" Nora target a comment at Kendra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKendra puts out a separate small duffel bag from under her bed, unzipping it, it is fill to nearly over flowing with various sweets. She then hands out a few treats, to each of the cabin residence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I am not suppose to even be at this camp, I was sent to the wrong bus when I checked in at the busing, pick up center. The Lady at the desk the Director after asking my name told me bus #2, so I got on our shared bus and fell asleep. Just ask Kendra she saw me on the trip up on the camp bus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you clearly are at the right camp, Carla and the Camp Director both said your name was on the bus and camp lists, your parent must have switch your camp application and forgot to tell you.\" Annie adds<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Annie I wish it was that simply, and my bag is still on it way here. But, you see that is super unlikely to be the answer, because there is one other thing that you got to know if I am in this Cabin.\" -breath- \"<u>I am a boy</u>..and <u>this is a girls only camp</u>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my gosh that is a big reveal, are you sure you are a boy?\" 'Big Sister' (not your real sister) Nora asks in startlement<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Are you kidding me, this is one of the greatest prank ever pulled and the old ladies did it to them selves\" Kendra expounded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, definitely not, my mother and uncle would not approve, this is a female only zone, they do not even let men up to the camp to be non-cabin counselors\" Annie adds, in a broken fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said you can prove you are a boy, do you have some id or something?\" Kendra ask excitedly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, no I was just going to show Carla, my private bits, and tell her I have get to the other camp.\" You explain your (naughty) plan of action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this is so crazy, a story it must be true\" Nora comments sadly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what are we going to do about this? She is a boy. Just having her here could be trouble\" Annie moans<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we should keep this going for as long as possible\" Kendra adapts \"And I can watch 'her' back. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I think we should call Carla and/or the 'Madame' * to rug on a mix of this big a mistake.\" Annie's brain kicks back in to gear \"That or we will be the Cabin with a girl, that does not know how to be a girl and needs to taught how to be a girl, like everyone else at camp\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora thinks this over and does not seem put off of either idea, even Annie may not have meant it as a real suggestion. \"Well if we can not get Carla on board with what is going on, how about we each teach Leslie a few things about being and acting like a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, guys.. I mean ladies, don't I get a say in if I become a girl\" Leslie asked with some worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but we all are now in on this and it is likely you are going to get out voted.\" Kendra looks around and gets some nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So lets take a vote, for what we are going to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* nick name for the camp director</span></div></div>",

He's touching all of my stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, Francine,\" her mother said. \"This hasn't been our house for nearly a year now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care, it's not right. What kind of grown-ass freak just sleeps in a teenager's bed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Young lady, you watch your mouth. Ghost or not, I am your mother, you will not speak like that in front of me.\" Hannah said with an imposing whisper. She didn't know whether the sleeping men could hear spirits or not. She wouldn't risk it. Hannah wasn't going to let her family be exorcised. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancine huffed in begrudging acceptance. She was doomed to remain eternally sixteen years-old. She would always be under her mother's thumb. \"I want to haunt them. Can we haunt them, please? Scare them off like a Casper cartoon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've been over this, Francine. No hauntings. If nobody rents this house, they'll just wind up bulldozing it. Then where will we go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care. Anything is better than this. I can't eat, I can't sleep, I can't watch TV, or text, or chat with my friends. God knows where my phone is now. Probably scrapped for precious metals. And nobody comes by to mourn anymore. All I ever get to do is just hang around in the dark with my mom and my dork of a sister until the sun comes up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm sorry,\" Hannah said with growing weariness. \"Next time my family dies, I'll make sure it happens at the mall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancine pouted and folded her arms in a huff. Or rather, she would have, had she still possessed lips and arms. Hannah and her daughters were more ethereal presences than floating bodies. \"So that's it then? Just give up? Roll over and let three old guys move in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First,\" Hannah said, \"stop calling them old. They're younger than me. Or rather, younger than I was. Younger than I had been?\" Hannah had been dead for over a year, but never determined the proper grammar for her situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm getting distracted. Second, this house isn't a museum. I'm amazed the realtors didn't throw everything out once the house went back on the market. We don't need our stuff anymore, and we can't touch any of it anyways. Lord knows your sister tries. She's spent the last 14 months trying to play with her dolls. I had assumed you had more sense than her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it's all my old trophies, and my journals, and my uniforms!\" Francine protested. \"I don't need to touch them, I just need to be able to see them. Not even see them, just know they're there. Same with my yearbooks, all the photos of my friends, the love letters I kept from middle school, my homecoming dress, that sweater grandma knitted for me... and...\" she trailed off, trying her hardest to compose herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah hadn't seen her daughter's face since the night they died. She didn't need to see it now. She knew the stubborn, teenage attitude was a mask for a sensitive, loving girl. Hannah and Francine were dead. But the tragedy was the inability of a mother to wipe away her child's tears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, honey. I am. This is rough on all of us. But they're just possessions gathering dust. You need to let go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancine sighed. \"It's like I'm dying all over again. The first death was just my body. But the second death is everything else. Everything I ever was. I'm still a person right now. A dead person, but a person. Tomorrow morning, some stranger is going to take my entire life, and throw it into a garbage bag. I die again. First a deteriorating corpse, now a deteriorating memory. Mom, please. There must be something we can do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah paused, collecting her emotions and thoughts. \"There might be...\"</span></div></div>",

Normally, you roll out of bed at noon and eat cereal straight from the box.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff was fully invested in making a stack of french toast. For some reason, the craving seemed impossible to ignore. He rolled out of bed with the sun, ignoring his tired body. Breakfast was the only thing on his mind. Of course, french toast was mostly prep work; it was just as easy to make two slices as it was to make half a loaf. And if Jeff was up so early anyways, he may as well celebrate the occasion by making enough for everybody in the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just a little breakfast,\" Jeff said. \"Don't make a big deal of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are your plans for today?\" Ed asked, stacking up his plate with rich, delicious slices of bread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff shrugged as he fixed his own plate and sat down at the table. \"I dunno. Maybe see if I can't get the wi-fi up and running. Or at least the cable. How about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about me?\" Ed asked with contempt. \"I'm going to work. I have a job. Like most people are supposed to have. Especially people who just bought one third of a house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I may be unemployed, but I can pay my bills. Don't you worry about that.\" Jeff came from a rather well-to-do household. His parents were quite well-off, and granted him a weekly allowance that surpassed the wages of any entry-level job in the state. Jeff was gifted an easy and comfortable life. He was going to enjoy it. Still, not a day went by without somebody nudging him to take on more responsibilities and become a better person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you at least do some work around the house today?\" Ed asked. \"Maybe dust, or vacuum? Seeing as you got the big bedroom and all, you owe us that much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, I'll go to the store, pick up some cleaning supplies and some more food. But I'm not cleaning the whole place myself. You and Steve are going to help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah...\" Ed always resented his friend's rather lackadaisical attitude. He earned everything he had, and it wasn't very much. He'd love a life of easy leisure. He'd love to be free of responsibilities. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd took a sip of coffee as he shot his friend a cold glare. He had to fight from spewing it out across the table. \"Oh god, that's terrible. What did you do to the coffee?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" Jeff asked. \"I didn't do anything to it. It tastes fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's so bitter,\" Ed said, scooping spoonfuls of sugar into his mug. \"You really can't taste that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Steve and I drank half the pot before you even woke up. It's fine. That's just how coffee tastes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd tried another sip and made a disgusted face before pouring the contents of his mug down the sink. For whatever reason, coffee just tasted like gnarly, noxious mud this morning. \"There's probably soap in the mug or something. I'm taking off for work. Can I be excused, please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff looked at his roommate confused. \"Um, yes? What the heck, man?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd blinked, trying to get his head around things. \"I don't know. I'm tired. Thanks for the breakfast. It was... yummy.\" He grabbed his portfolio and headed out to his car, trying to make sense of his odd choice of words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weirdo,\" Jeff thought. He shrugged it off and went to work cleaning the dishes and stove top. Ordinarily, Jeff would have let them sit, covered in crust until the sink began to overflow. Now, as a homeowner, he felt an overwhelming sense of obligation. Like he should take pride in his surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd not just his surroundings, but his appearance. Jeff showered, shaved, and groomed himself until he deemed himself presentable. Rather than simply throw on the first shirt he pulled from his drawers, he took time to coordinate an entire ensemble. He even found an ironing board to press his garments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing his keys, he set off to the store, ready for a big day of shopping and housework.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jeff parked his SUV and walked into the supermarket. He loaded up his shopping cart with the basics, or at least what he considered basics: white bread, peanut butter, macaroni, and packs upon packs of Ramen. Looking down at the assortment of salt and preservatives, Jeff felt a twinge of guilt. He wasn't just buying food for himself anymore, but his roommates too. He owed them an obligation. He tossed some apples into the cart to round things out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stared at his groceries in disbelief. Why was this so hard? He wasn't exactly a gourmet chef, but he managed to live this long without dying of malnutrition. Surely he had been doing something right. But why was standard diet seeming so strange and unappealing now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff meandered aimlessly through the aisles looking for any sort of inspiration, as though it were shelved between the canned tomatoes and beans. Turning a corner blind, he bumped into the cart of a strange woman. She looked noticeably older than him, though only about ten or fifteen years. She didn't seem aged or decrepit, but experienced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm so sorry,\" she said. \"Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah. I'm fine,\" Jeff said. \"It's my fault. I wasn't looking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman purveyed the contents of Jeff's cart as she righted herself. \"How old are they?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Jeff asked, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your kids. How old are they? My kids used to eat like that too,\" she said, gesturing at all the junk food in his cart. \"They complained anytime I cooked anything without a microwave. They gagged at the appearance of anything green. They lived on pepperoni and chicken nuggets for a month straight. One night, I felt tempted to sneak into their bedroom and slip vegetables into their mouths while they slept.\" She laughed at her own joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, actually...\" Jeff couldn't bring himself to correct the woman. He had been living on his own for years, and he still ate like a slovenly, bachelor couch potato. Looking at it from another's perspective, it was downright shameful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe interrupted his train of thought. \"You know, this grocery store offers a bunch of cooking classes. If you need some inspiration on how to cook for the little ones, me and a few other parents could offer some insights.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, yeah. Actually that sounds like a great idea. I might have to--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great. Let me have your phone. I'll text you the details and we'll get everything set up with the other moms.\" Jeff reluctantly handed the stranger his phone. She added her name to his contact list and bid farewell. Jeff stared confused at the events which just took place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Madison Angstrom' read the brand new contact. Was this woman actually going to worm her way into Jeff's life? He was really just trying to be polite and humor the lady. And how long could he keep the lie up? He wasn't a parent. He didn't have kids. Jeff <i>acted </i>like a kid! He wanted to finish grocery shopping so he could go home and play video games. Eventually, Madison would figure things out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, the cooking class sounded like a good idea, but what the heck could Jeff have in common with some random suburban mom? Scratch that, what could Jeff have in common with a gaggle of suburban moms, all of whom were currently receiving his phone number and e-mail address? If they were all as 'friendly' as Madison, it would be a rough time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff took a deep breath and added some eggs into his cart. As he did, he noticed something strange was peeking out from underneath all the soup. He moved a few packets around and saw something red at the bottom of his cart. A bottle of wine had somehow found its way among his groceries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe considered putting it back on the shelves, but ultimately decided against it. If the next few days were anything like today, he may need it.</span></div></div>",

He was preparing frozen ravioli for him and his housemates. It wasn't haute cuisine, but it was a step up from frozen pizza bites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" Steve said sticking his head into the kitchen, \"I just got fired, all right? I'm angry!

He never took losses well, he didn't like to compromise, and he always took criticism as a personal attack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo say Steve was hotheaded was an understatement. As much as he craved the respect and admiration of those around him, he only cultivated an aura of fear. Ed and Jeff were his only real friends, and some days, they barely tolerated him. To put it simply, Steve did not play well with others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's just great,\" Jeff said. \"Now both you and Ed are out of work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ed got fired too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They downsized his department. The guy never saw it coming. And he's not taking it well either. I think he's crying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That guy's off his damn rocker.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" Jeff said, \"be nice to Ed. He looks up to you.\" To anyone else, such a statement may have sounded odd. But Steve was so conceited, he didn't see anything strange with such a revelation. Of course Ed looked up to him. Steve looked like he was carved from marble. Ed couldn't bench press fifty pounds. Ed was a shy software engineer. Steve could sell a boat to a Bedouin. Ed hadn't dated in months. Steve had thirty girls he could call right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And another thing,\" Jeff said, adding sauce to the pot, \"cool it with the potty mouth, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve was taken aback. \"What do you care if I swear or not? And why are you wearing an apron?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff stared at his roommate as though he asked why he was breathing. \"So I don't get food on my clothes? Are you going to stand there and sass me all night? Go get Ed. We need to have a discussion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve rolled his eyes as he left the kitchen. Jeff set the table and spooned out servings for him and his housemates. He felt a little twinge of satisfaction at a job well done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the three men began eating, Jeff broke the silence. \"So, we're in a bit of a sticky situation right now. We just bought a house, and now all three of us are out of work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One of us didn't have work to begin with,\" Steve said under his breath. Ed stifled a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff chose to ignore his roommate's snipe. \"My point is, we have thirty days to find a way to make our next house payment. Otherwise we're out on the streets. We can't get our old apartment back, and nobody will rent us a new place if we default on our loans. Ed, do you have any prospects?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the problem,\" Ed said. \"There was a non-competitive clause in my contract. I can't work for another software company for two years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's no good. But we'll fix this somehow. Steve, do you have any leads?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve rolled his eyes at what he perceived as an asinine question. \"Oh yeah, I got a whole briefcase full of job offers. I picked them all up on the drive home. I just don't know which one I'm going to choose: the job with the swimming pool or the job with the free ice cream machine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarcasm is not going to help us, okay? Listen, I know things seem bad, but they're not completely bad. I have enough money in savings for the next few weeks. But not enough for house payments. When you two get your first paychecks, we'll take care of that. Until then, we need to cut back on the frills.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?\" Ed asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Jeff replied, \"for starters, I don't think we can afford beer or pot anymore. In fact, I'm going to have to do all the shopping now. If you need anything, ask me, we'll budget it out. Second, Steve, you'll probably need to cancel your gym membership.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you get to decide what we can afford?\" Steve asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because it's my money. When you get a job, you can spend it however you want.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve crossed his arms in a huff and slouched in his chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can sell my car!\" Ed interrupted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd really do that?\" Jeff asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure! It's old anyways. It costs more to maintain than its worth. Besides, it's not like I have to commute anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see? That's the spirit we need.\" Jeff placed his hand proudly on Ed's shoulder. Ed couldn't help but smile, knowing he helped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally,\" Jeff said, \"and this is the one that's going to hurt, we're going to have to put off redecorating indefinitely. I know nobody likes living in a girl's room, but we can't afford new furniture or renovations right now. We can't even afford to have the old stuff hauled away.\" Ed and Steve nodded in solemn acceptance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's probably more we can do, but that's a start. Tomorrow, we'll hit the streets and find work. It doesn't have to be lucrative. It doesn't even have to be dignified. It just has to put money in the bank until something better comes along.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho will we follow on their job-seeking endeavors? </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Reluctantly, Steve did indeed cancel his gym membership. However, he had no intention of abandoning his physical fitness. He wasn't too keen on aerobics, but it was free and it was still exercise. The following morning, he grabbed a pair of gym shorts, a tee shirt, and laced up a good pair of sneakers. He left for the park early, ready to get a good workout before his demeaning job search.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first few miles were rather uneventful. It wasn't until a basketball rolled across his path that things became interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little help?\" came a voice from the nearby basketball courts. Steve obliged and chucked the ball towards the players. \"Nice throw,\" said the voice again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Steve said. \"Shouldn't you be in school?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shouldn't you be at work?\" she shot back. She laughed, lighting up the conversation. \"It's not even 8 AM. School doesn't start for another hour. You wanna play a bit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very funny,\" Steve said. He was a long ways away from his high school days. What would a bunch of teenagers want to do with him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl insisted. \"No, come on. We got an odd number of players. It'll be fun.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve shrugged off his hesitations. Running was getting boring; a little basketball would be a decent change of pace. Besides, being accepted by a bunch of teenagers was a boost to his morale. He may have been getting older, but he was apparently still pretty cool with the kids. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve ran up to the court, never noticing, (or at least not caring) the five other players were all girls. Steve felt happy to have made such an impression. All the girls exchanged phone numbers with him. His three opponents wanted a rematch. His two teammates weren't abandoning such a great player.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lead girl tossed her sweat-covered towel into her gym bag. Steve learned her name was Leslie. She was completely open with Steve, never talking to him like he was a strange adult, but a peer. Perhaps she needed a mentor, or a coach or something, Steve justified. \"Hey, we get out of school at three. Wanna meet up?\" Leslie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't,\" Steve said. \"I gotta hit the bricks. I gotta find a job, like, yesterday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh,\" Leslie said. \"My parents made me get a job at the mall last summer. It sucked. The customers are garbage, the boss spent half his shifts staring at my ass, and I'm only just now getting the smell of butter out of my hair. I never want to see another pretzel as long as I live.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was looking for something a little more professional anyways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you know, I think Grenada's is hiring. They had a sign there the last time we went shopping.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grenada's? That store that looks like a tiki hut? Isn't that place kind of...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Expensive?\" Leslie finished. The word Steve was searching for was 'fruity.' While Grenada's was a big hit in upper class teen demographics, the average man wouldn't be caught dead wearing anything they sold. \"Yeah. Their clothes are expensive, but they are *so* worth it. Oh, you totes need to work there. You could get such a discount, I bet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, all right. I'll check it out,\" Steve said. Sales were sales. Steve could sell cars, appliances, insurance, anything. How hard would it be to sell some silk shirts?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve bid farewell to his new friends and continued his run. It was boring before, but now it felt almost lonely. He just wished he had someone to run with.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jeff and Ed had been driving around, following up employment leads. Ed had sold his car that morning for a meager $800, and was now reliant on Jeff driving him everywhere. And today, the two were on a number of job interviews.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff hadn't worn a suit in nearly three years, and the one he owned was bought from a resale shop. It fit him well enough, but not 100% proper. The cuff of the slacks ended about an inch above where his normal pants stopped, exposing more of his ankle than he liked. The jacket was tight on his waist and shoulders, but surprisingly loose in the chest. He kept it unbuttoned anyways, trying his best to look cool and casual in an otherwise oddly-fitting outfit. He undid the top three buttons of his shirt to further accent this attitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd had worn a suit everyday to work since he graduated college. As much as he wanted to find a new job, he couldn't pass up the opportunity to dress more casual. He wore a cherry red sweater over a crisp white shirt. Jeff urged him to dress a little more formally today, but Ed resisted. He even threatened to dress Ed by force, but Ed still resisted. Jeff didn't have time to argue. The sweater would have to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a number of 'we'll keep your applications on file' interviews, the pair wound up at New Dawn Daycare. Neither had worked with children before, nor did they have any experience with social services. But the two needed employment, and the daycare needed employees. It seemed logical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello,\" Jeff said to the administrator. \"We're here to talk about enrollment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean employment?\" The administrator corrected him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes. My mistake. I don't know where my head is.\" Jeff laughed off his slip of the tongue. Ed, meanwhile, sat squirming in his seat. Maybe it was nerves, but he couldn't seem to focus on anything the administrator was saying. He just felt bored, but strangely energetic. He wanted to go home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe administrator looked over Jeff's resume. At least what passed as a resume. Aside from some hourly work here and there, he hadn't actually had anything resembling a career. He had no skills, no certifications, and his only education was a bachelor's degree in something called 'Independent Studies'. \"I'm sorry,\" the administrator said. \"You just don't have the relevant work experience.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's that, then. Come along, Ed.\" Jeff started collecting his things. He subconsciously reached for Ed's hand, as though he were trying to escort his friend from the room. Ed had been acting rather spacey today, Jeff reasoned to himself. He might just wander off if he didn't keep the man in tow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, hold on one second. You yourself don't have what we need, but Ed here is a different case. We just switched over to a new piece of enrollment software, and we're having a heck of a time adapting. Somebody with your experience in computers would be a valuable asset.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff sat down, pleased with the news. \"What do you say, Ed? Do you want to work here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd was busy watching a bunch of kids on the swing set outside the administrator's window. \"You mean I get to come here everyday?\" he asked, snapping back to reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe administrator told him, \"Well, not every day, no. You need to be here when the kids arrive and stay until the kids leave. That's a ten-hour day, which means you only need to be here four days a week. I think it's Wednesday you'll have off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure we can work something out for Wednesdays,\" Jeff said. \"I mean, concerning the use of the car. He can stay home, by himself, obviously.\" The words sounded wrong to Jeff, as though he were suddenly speaking French. Why wouldn't Ed by all right  home alone? By himself. With no one to watch him. Where he could get hurt, or kidnapped, or accidentally start a fire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe administrator paid no attention to the oddities around him. \"Although, understand, the computers would only account to roughly 15% of your duties. The others would involve helping with the children. Supervising them, cleaning up after them--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And playing with them?\" Ed interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that too. But remember, you're going to be older than them, so you need to be a role model, not just a playmate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd was bouncing up and down in his seat. He couldn't wait to visit tomorrow. This would be so much more fun than his old job. He'd get to play with kids all day. Ed couldn't remember the last time he got to simply play, with no obligations or other hang-ups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd felt like a kid in a candy store. And there was no candy store.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Hey, what's with the toilets?\" Steve asked. The toilet seats in both bathrooms had been secured to the porcelain bowls. No matter how hard Steve pulled or tinkered with the locks, he couldn't lift them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff was cleaning the windows as Steve asked. He replied without breaking his gaze from his task. \"Well, Steve, I don't want to point fingers, but somebody keeps aiming wide of the bowl. Since I'm the one who has to clean the bathrooms, I'm putting a stop to it. From now on, the three of us can do our business sitting down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gross,\" Steve winced. \"I was going to ask what's for dinner, but never mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you empty the dishwasher for me, please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make Ed do it. I'm meeting some friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ed is busy. I asked you to do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ed's just watching cartoons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ed is preparing for his first day at the daycare center,\" Jeff explained. The caretakers at New Dawn Daycare, advised Ed to familiarize himself with things kids are interested in. He needed to seem like less of a strange man, and more like a new friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve scoffed at the idea. \"He's a little dork, you know. All the kids are going to make fun of him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You be nice to him. He's nervous enough as it is, and I don't want him getting kicked out of daycare. I can't keep driving him around all day. Now go empty the dishwasher.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve stuck out his tongue at Jeff, but dutifully went off to finish his assigned chore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear, that one's got such a mouth...\" Jeff muttered to himself, putting away the cleaning supplies. Jeff took a little break before preparing dinner. Since Ed's cartoons were making the living room a noisy environment, Jeff recused himself to his bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bedroom of the departed Hannah Williams was cozy, and remarkably comfortable. Jeff felt eerie on his first night, sleeping in the bed of a strange woman nearly ten years his elder. All her clothing was still in the closet, hanging alongside his own. Her shoes were still on the rack, alongside his own. Her jewelry, and her cosmetics, and even her toiletries were just as she left them. The realtors wouldn't normally leave perishables behind, but they felt almost compelled to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no one to haul this stuff away, Jeff tried his best to shove it aside. Although, he conceded, it seemed awfully rude. He would simply have to share the space. He rifled through some of the items stowed in the closet, looking for some way to maximize the efficiency of the cramped space. Doing so, he came across a briefcase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCuriosity got the best of Jeff, and he opened the case, never wondering how he knew the code to the locks. Inside were some documents, some office supplies, and a file folder with a sticky note that said \"important.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf this is so important, Jeff reasoned to himself, somebody might need it. Even after however much time its been. Jeff continued looking through the case, finding a business card for Hannah's old office. He dialed up the business,  learning in the process it was a law firm. Explaining his situation, the office was happy to find the missing documents. The voice on the phone asked how they could repay Jeff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff explained his economic situation, and inquired if they had any open positions. Sure enough, they had an opening for an office assistant, and if he was interested, he could start tomorrow. Hannah, whose spirit was eavesdropping nearby, realized that Jeff was woefully unprepared for the duties of a law office. Even if he wasn't handling the cases, it required a certain level of legal knowledge. The firm would be in shambles if Jeff were to try and learn all the intricacies on his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps, Hannah thought, she could share her experiences as a paralegal? Jeff was certainly receptive to her influence already. In a few short days, he had nearly matched her proficiency as a homemaker and caretaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wouldn't be hard at all to make Jeff into the working mom Hannah knew he could be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid Steve ever get that job at the mall?</span></div></div>",

You got up to use the bathroom as you suddenly noticed something was wrong about your room....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything had changed! Your room looked like it belonged to a woman now! Not just any woman either a really hot one! You found really sexy clothes in the closet along with sexy underwear in the drawers. You found a bra that was for at least DD cup breasts maybe even bigger! This was the kind of room you wished you could wake up to, but obviously with the woman lying next to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking outside you saw your same old car, in your normal neighborhood, in your same apartment. You were obviously home so what happened to your room? Was this an elaborate prank by your ex? Your friends and family wanting to pull a practical joke on you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around for clues you suddenly saw a strange object on your dresser. It was a small blue stone. You had never seen it before and it seemed to have a small glow to it. Reaching out you touched the stone as the light began to glow brighter as the stone lifted off the ground several inches!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBacking up you were officially freaked out as you looked at the floating glowing stone. You heard voices that sounded like strange clicks coming from the stone...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere...is that better? Is the translator working?\u201d The clicks suddenly changed to sound like human voices as you listened to what seemed to be a recorded message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDear Human, my associates and I apologize for the recent trouble given to you. Our craft was conducting a routine observation of your species in secret when your vehicle collided with our craft. Your body was broken beyond repair and so to make amends we took you aboard and repaired your body and vehicle. We greatly apologize for the discomfort caused by our actions. In order to fully apologize we looked through your personal data device and discovered many digital photographs of females of your species. Most of which had greatly accelerated sexual qualities. You must greatly desire to be like this females to idiolize them so much. As such we changed your dwelling to make that of what earth females call \u201csexy.\u201d This recording stone will also emit a stream of specialized radiation Thay will reorganize your DNA and genetic code to best match this profile. Once again we hope this makes up for your discomfort.\u201d The voice suddenly ended as you stood there confused and worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWas....was that an Alien? Like a real Alien? Were you anducted last night?\u201d You began to wonder. You hoped this whole thing was just a huge hallucination or joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding around you saw the blue stone was still floating as it suddenly began to emit a humming noise. Your eyes widened for a sec before a beam of white energy shot into your body. The force of which sent you flying back on to your bed. The stone then fell silent before resting on your dresser again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up slowly you felt dizzy from the blast but you felt fine. That was until a strange sensation was starting to spread across your body. You felt a tingling in your fingers as you looked down. To your shock you could see your fingernails brining to grow in front of you! </span></div></div>",

And I don't mean a room with white walls and white floors, I mean, ethereally white. So white that you had at first assumed that you were in heaven. After your eyes adjusted, you tried to push yourself up, though your hands felt... daintier, when pushing against the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou managed to put yourself into a sitting position and a mane of auburn hair fell over your face when you leaned to look at your body. You quickly brushed it away, getting to see your hands, which were indeed dainty, with manicured nails on each hand. You immediately tried to rush out of the bed, but you ended up falling face first onto the ground, with your fall being cushioned somewhat by a new weight on your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to scream, but you found that nothing was coming out. You stood up and tried to find a door, frantically banging on the wall. As you did, a door opened on the other side of the room and one of the creatures walked in. It was humanoid, though it was purple and had antennae on its head. You stepped back into the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We mean you no harm, human.\" the creature said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tentatively stepped forwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your transport was damaged and we found that your body was nearly beyond repair. We repaired your body using reference from your cellular device.\" the creature said. \"Computer, activate mirror.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Reference? Oh no...\"</i> you glanced into the mirror and saw your face... or rather what it was transformed into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hadn't changed your phone background since the breakup. It was a photo of your girlfriend, that you had rather liked, with her wearing a skimpy nightgown, and your old Deadpool mask that you had lying around. Thankfully the aliens seemed to understand the concept of masks, so your face wasn't Deadpool's mask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou face was your own, though altered slightly, your lips were fuller, your nose smaller, your skin smooth. The rest of your body was similar to your girlfriend's. You looked in the mirror, you had a slim, slightly tanned, but also toned body. You had breasts, around a B-Cup and your male equipment had been replaced by the female equivalent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you unhappy?\" the creature asked, as it noticed you frowning at the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned and nodded profusely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you not... Oh, my! Your vocal cords must still be damaged. Allow me.\" the creature took out a device and waved it at your neck. It began to press buttons. \"Try speaking now and tell me when your voice sounds right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the... my voice... uh... testing...testing...\" your voice began fluctuating between many different tones and pitches before it came across one that sounded like a woman's. \"Oh!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alien stopped as it looked at why you had exclaimed. The device had given you a slight twinge of pain when it altered the cords.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the... oh my voice...\" you started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, now that you can speak, what is wrong?\" the creature asked.</span></div></div>",

I looked at my phone again and saw an email from a Jordan Rivers, CPA. I opened it and was shocked to find that I had a personal accountant managing my finances.

Yep, it was pretty good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally, you wondered how things would be going into the summer, but things hadn't been as hot. You both hadn't talked all that much since summer break started. You wondered if she was just busy getting ready for college or something, but that didn't sound like something she would keep a secret from you. Granted, there had been a few rocks in the relationship. Nothing big as far as you were concerned, just minor arguments that didn't really seem to lead to any major leak in the relationship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, the silence was worrying. You had hoped to spend more time with her before having to go to college.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I should try calling her again,\" you sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't want to harass her or anything, but you felt like you hadn't gotten to that point yet.

There was a small pool in front of an altar with a stature of Buddha on it. Holly looked to you with a glare as she handed you a coin with some ancient Asian writing on it, however you couldn't tell what language.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here take this, get on knees and toss the coin into the pool. Then I want you to say. I wish I could see life from Holly's perspective.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, sure no problem.\" You said just doing this to make her happy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou followed instructions and got on your knees. Closing your eyes you tossed the coin in the pool and repeated the words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I could see life from Holly's perspective.\" You said trying to be sincere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting up you looked over to Holly who seemed pleased with you. \"I'm sorry are we cool?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost....look into the pool it is supposed to tell your future now.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the water you saw the ripples in the water and your reflection as it suddenly began to change.

Then again, it was super important to your girlfriend, so you guessed you should bear it. Still, you had no idea on what exactly to do with this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, your reflection in the water began to change slowly but surely. At first you figured that it was just a trick of the light, but the more it happened the more it seemed to be a lot more than that. Your very male image began to contort and change. By the time the image seemed to become clearer...you weren't sure if you should be perplexed or shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an image of a very good looking Asian girl. She definitely had all the right curves, with silky skin and long dark hair. Her face was nice and cute, as were a lot of Japanese girls admittingly. However, two things immediately stood out. One was her huge breasts. They had to be insanely big, much bigger than Holly's for sure. The other thing was what allowed those breasts to be seen; her attire. Actually, could that even be considered attire?! Her clothes barely did enough to cover the essential parts like her vagina and nipples. Almost everything else was out in the open. It was...extremely off-putting to say the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter your mind eventually came back, you remembered that Holly was expecting an answer. She didn't seem to know what you were seeing, judging by her passive look. You wondered if you should really mention this. Then again, you already hurt her feelings once (albeit you still thought it was a slight overreaction) and you didn't want to make things worse. You wanted to be more understanding and not repeat this mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.....an Asian girl...\" you said. \"She...looks Japanese like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Holly asked, not betraying whether she expected it or not. \"What does she look like specifically?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um....long dark hair....all good curves...\" you blushed a bit, actually having to explain this to her. \"...Really big breasts....Not a lot of clothes either.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm.....\" Holly hummed, her finger to her mouth in thought. Again, whether she was perplexed or had been expecting that was something you couldn't figure out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So....was that what you wanted?\" you asked curiously. \"W-What...should we do now?\" </span></div></div>",

She wasn't saying anything but it was like she was trying to figure something out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside you took your shoes off as was custom for her family. You could also smell something cooking which smelled delicious to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly's mom was in the kitchen preparing a sushi dish it seemed. You normally didn't like sushi as you didn't have much of an appetite for seafood. It was always one of the things that bothered Holly the most. However as you walked to the kitchen the smell of the rice and fish was really good to you now for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there Kevin! Nice to see you again would you like to join us for dinner?\" Holly's mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes this smells amazing thank you!\" You replied much to Holly's surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce dinner was ready you sat down with Holy and her parents as you saw they had prepared a very traditional Japanese sushi meal. Normally you really struggled with chopsticks but when you picked them up it felt like you had been using them all your life. You had no problem using them as you ate the meal. To your surprise it tasted amazing! You never like this kind of food before which Holly seemed to take notice of: <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring dinner there was little small talk with her family as the four of you enjoyed the meal in peace. However during dinner the only thing that bothered you was a strange itching feeling in your scalp. Normally you kept your hair pretty short but you found yourself pushing it out of your eyes more and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Holly looked over to you she suddenly gasped dropping her chopsticks. Your hair was now much longer. It had grown pat your ears already. However her parents hadn't noticed or even said anything. You hadn't noticed yet either as you finished your meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile your shoes in the corner were also changing. Your normal tennis shoes were beginning to change shape as they reformed into very feminine pair of sandals.<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://is.alicdn.com/img/pb/470/879/731/731879470_932.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://is.alicdn.com/img/pb/470/879/731...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce dinner was over you helped with dishes as you got prepared to leave. Holly was strangely silent as she watched your hair continue to grow. It was now past your shoulders as it was getting darker beginning to match what you saw in the reflection. The weird thing was no one else was taking notice on she seemed to notice it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you got ready to leave you slipped on the sandals not even noticing the difference between your old shoes. Your hair now was just as long as the girls in the pool. It matched hers perfectly. Holly seemed really nervous as she said goodbye to you. It was like she wanted to tell you something but couldn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly knew if she told you about the changes it would break the veil currently over you and Make you aware to them. Otherwise you would continue to change unaware of what was happening to you. </span></div></div>",

Nothing she did betrayed her thoughts. Was she happy? Angry? Confused? Your guess was as good as his. She lightly paced back and forth from there, occasionally humming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um....\" you began, still confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, just then, she finally turned to you, still looking passive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....I feel a little better at least,\" she said, hands on her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that was better than nothing. Perhaps it was now the best time to reiterate your apology.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really Holly, I'm sorry,\" you pleaded. \"I'm sorry I made that stupid comment. I admit that I didn't realize how offensive it was, and I'm sorry. Can you please forgive me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could have gone on longer, but you felt like that got the point across. Again, Holly's face was unreadable. Sheesh, it kind of frustrated you when you couldn't figure her out. In fact, it was frustrating enough that it was making your head itch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally, you reached up to take care of that, though as you scratched, you couldn't help but feel something off. Was your hair slightly bushier up there? In fact, were your ears being ticked a bit? You reached around your head, lightly feeling hair around your ears, like they were covered at the least. Huh, maybe it's been longer than you thought since your last haircut. You should probably get that checked out later. There were more important things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....I at least accept your apology,\" Holly said, maybe a ghost of a smile at the edge of her lips. \"But...I think I'll need more time to completely forgive you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWelp, it was a start at least. You were willing to let her take things at her own pace. Just do what you can to smooth things over and surely things will work out on their own.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, from Holly's perspective, things were quite confusing. She wasn't sure what to expect when she commanded you to look inside. She perhaps figured maybe you'd see a reflection of herself, but she really didn't know. The shrine was somewhat of a mystery even to her. Looking up at the sky, she knew it to be around midday so far, to which she wondered if she should have you stick around longer.</span></div></div>",

Maybe tomorrow we can hang out again.\" Holly said to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, no problem.\" You said scratching your head again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way home you were curious as to what had really just happened. You know you saw that busty Japanese girl in the water right? You knew it wasn't an illusion or hallucination. So what did it mean? Holly said it was supposed to represent your future. Did that mean you would meet this girl soon? Was she your future? You had never even seen that girl before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce home you found yourself scratching your head again. You didn't notice yet but your hair had grown past your ears and was touching your neck already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile at her house Holly was getting a bit nervous over what you told her you saw. She had only heard legends and rumors about the shrine from her family. Never before had it shown such a clear image. She didn't know if it meant another girl was going to replace her in your life or worse...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got a text from Holly back home that asked if you wanted to help her with some photos tomorrow. Holly was the head of the photography club in school and was trying to pursue a career in it later.You agreed thinking it would be a fun date and give the two of you time to spend together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce nighttime rolled around you went to sleep hoping you had mended a bridge with Holly today. However as you slept a strange dream came over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were in a familiar place. It was a photo studio. Holly's studio she had set up in her basement. There were bright lights on you as flashes all over. You saw Holly with a camera snapping photos of someone. It was a girl, THE GIRL! The one from the reflection. She was wearing a bikini that showed off her amazing curves and huge breasts perfectly. It looked like she had several swimsuits to model.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look amazing Kimi! This will be your best one yet!\" Holly said excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw in the dream right before it ended  a  teen magazine with this girl Kimi on the cover. It said \"Kimi Akamai, new curvy Asian model blows us away!\" </span></div></div>",

Sure, the new Asian girl was hot as heck, but at the same time you felt strange about it. Why would you be dreaming of such a girl? Seriously, just who was she? Your future girlfriend?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat thought honestly filled you with dread. You loved Holly. Every girl was second to her. Why would you fall for some other girl? Ugh, there were way too many questions to answer this early in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd speaking of morning, the sun was leaking through your window, causing you to slowly wake up. Granted, you felt really groggy. That dream didn't do any favors for your attempts to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, that was weird,\" you groaned as you got up and stretched a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWelp, it was best that you get ready for the day and all that. Holly asked you to come around 10:00 or so, which was fair as she lived just a neighborhood away and you could easily drive there. As you looked around for some nice clothes to wear though, something seemed off...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\" you hummed as you happened to look down at yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were wearing your typical sleep clothes when you went to bed last night, but something felt really off. Like...were they a lot tighter now? Looking at your blue shirt and grey pants, both seemed to hug your body more, which was weird because they were the perfect amount of tight and loose before. Had you grown a bit or something? Actually, even that seemed a bit strange. Was it just you or was reaching up in your closet harder?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou actually had to jump up just a bit to get something, which would have been nothing for your usual 6\"0' frame. Just what was going on here? Your hair was at your neck just like before...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I seriously need to get my mind off this. It's gotta be nothing,\" you groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you went into your bathroom and stripped out of your clothes. Still, as you got the water running, looking in the mirror made it more apparent that you looked shorter, probably at least a few inches, more around the 5'8\" or so at the moment. And you seemed considerably thinner too. You looked thinner yet your pajama clothes were tighter. Nothing made sense anymore.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell....hopefully a nice shower would calm your nerves.</span></div></div>",

You weren't sure but you guessed it was a prank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you washed your hair you noticed it took a lot more shampoo than normal. Your hair definitely felt longer. You hadn't realized yet but had grown another couple inches in the shower now brushing your shoulders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind was still on that dream from last night. Who was that girl? How were you two connected? The questions were clawing at your mind as you tried to relax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you reached up to grab the soap you suddenly realized something. You were on your tip toes trying to reach the top shelf....You always had no problems reaching it before. Looking around the entire bathroom seemed larger now. <br>\r\nYou hadn't noticed but this whole time you had continued to shrink.

When your last apartment was condemned because the landlord was doing some shady activities, you had figured that you'd be homeless, but, as if by a miracle, you saw an online ad posting for a place not far from your old place that's in perfect proximity to your job. You immediately answered it and started to correspond with the person who posted an ad, a girl named Paige. You seemed to click and she agreed to a roommate interview.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFast forward to the day of the interview, where you were impatiently hitting the buzzer in the lobby. You were the only person standing in there, though there was a girl standing inside looking just as impatient as you. She was a redhead, with long hair and freckles. She checked her phone before walking towards the door, opening it, and pushing past you to get outside. After a few seconds she walked back in, looking exasperated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Waiting for someone?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she opened the door to the main lobby, she turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Oh yeah, I'm supposed to be meeting a girl for a roommate interview but she hasn't shown up yet. I figured I'd meet her in the lobby.\" she said. \"I take it, you have a similar story?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm waiting for a tenant to let me in.\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Usually I wouldn't do this, but I feel nice today.\" the girl said, holding the door for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked into the lobby with her and walked to the elevator. You got in and stood on the opposite side of the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What floor?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Third.\" you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right.\" she pressed the button and the car sped up to the third floor, where you got out, and so did she. \"I really should call this girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl took out her phone and dialed a number. As she did, your own phone started to ring, you looked at who the caller ID was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have got to be kidding me...\" Paige said as you picked up the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" you sheepishly smiled as you answered the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little while later, you were sitting in her apartment at her kitchen table. There was an uncomfortable silence that Paige finally broke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... you're Ashley.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ash. You know, like Bruce Campbell?\" you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't you see on the ad that I was only looking for female applicants?\" Paige asked. As you made eye contact you realize how striking her face really was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, no, actually. Must've been in the fine print.\" you said. \"Is that a problem?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've had bad experiences with male roommates. And I'm not keen to try again.\" Paige said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if I said I was desperate?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still no. Sob story or not, you're still a guy.\" Paige replied. \"It's a shame, cause we got on so well... if only...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was a girl, yeah, I get it.\" you said. \"I'll get out of your hair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood up to leave and walked towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you find the roommate you're looking for, though.\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm...\" Paige mused as you opened the door. \"Wait!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaige jumped from her seat and rushed towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not what I expected... but because we got along so well over email and you don't seem to be threatening at all... I'll give it ago. A 30 day trial period.\" Paige said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, really?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I might regret this... but you might be the perfect roommate yet.\" Paige said.</span></div></div>",

Mmmm!!!\u201d you mumbled impotently, as if you had been gagged, yet nothing was covering your mother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGods of chaos, release the anima of this man, his unconscious feminine form, and in return I will render unto you my blood...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaige took a small knife out of her pocket and began to cut her wrist, releasing droplets of blood onto the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking closely, you could see a weird occult symbol where Paige was dropping her blood onto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to scream, not just because you were being held against your will by a crazy witch, but that this crazy witch was mutilating herself and praying to the \u201cgods of chaos\u201d, whoever the hell they were(If they existed at all). But you had bigger things to worry about now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGods of chaos, I pray, transform this man in body and soul into his anima, I plead you!\u201d screamed Paige.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust below your feet, a chasm of red swirling light soon appeared out of thin air. Inside you were screaming. All you wanted was a roommate, and now you were being sent to Hell!? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucky you, Hell was not what you were seeing. It was energy from beyond time and space, from places that no mortal man had ever stepped in. The red energy soon raised from the floor like an elevator and enveloped your entire body. Inside the field of mystical, eldritch power, you continued to hear Paige chant for a few more moments. Her voice sounded close to you, yet distant. Physically, you were no more than five feet away from Paige, but covered in this energy, you may as well have been entire dimensions away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSooner than you had expected, the red energy simply evaporated like mist. You realized that the red bands were also gone, and you could move freely now. You were seriously pissed off at Paige and blurted out the first thing that crossed your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat. The. Fuck. Was...wait, what's wrong with my voice!?\u201d you asked yourself desperately. \u201cWhat did you do to me you bitch!?\u201d As you tried to run out the apartment door, frustated but not surprised to know that it was locked from the inside, you noticed that everything about your body was now different. Your clothes. You were wearing women's clothing. Your legs were encased in black yoga pants, and they looked much thinner and more toned than they had but moments ago. Your feet now had tiny looking black ballet flats on them instead of your trademark orange high tops. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrightened beyond belief that you had been tricked by a witch was now trapped in her apartment like this was some warped fairy tale, you ran to the large windows and tried to open them to scream for help, but you found you could not open them. You also took a glance at your thin, dainty arms. You had recently taken to going to the gym, and you had developed a respectable physique there, with arms that would place well in any gun show. That was all gone now, replaced by a body that couldn't harm a fly and was only good for showing off how sexy you looked. You were wearing a blue tank top with spaghetti straps, with a visible bra underneath. So you had been turned into a woman. Just great.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the idea of calling 911 reached your mind, but you quickly discovered that you no longer had any pockets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ran all around the apartment, driving yourself crazy looking for a device that had evaporated with Paige's magic. Speaking of Paige, the redheaded witch had just been standing there, holding onto her forehead the entire time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa that took a lot out of me\u201d muttered Paige as she combed back her hair nervously, her entire body shaking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving up hope of finding your phone, you eventually found Paige's bathroom and stared at yourself in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god, that bitch did turn me into a woman!\u201d you yelped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo make things worse, you were undeniably attractive and hopelessly girly. You thought that you looked a bit like Anna Kendrick now.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/6e/bc/12/6ebc1259e469b51c535dc326760eedc8.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/ori...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In the bathroom you were staring at your new undeniable sexy female body. Your dark brown hair cascaded down your shoulders going to your mid back. Your arms and legs were thin but also toned like you worked out and did yoga every day. Your butt was nice and round pushing out the tight yoga pants you were now in. Looking down you saw two mounds blocking your view as a large pair of breasts pushed out the tank top you were wearing. They were at least D-cups by their weight which was a new strange feeling tugging on your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShocked and stunned by your new appearance you didn\u2019t even know how to react. Even your clothes had changed as you went over to your bag. All those clothes had changed too. You found panties, thongs, flip flops, high heels, skirts, dresses; makeup, and all manner of girly products. You even found a purse on a table. Opening it you found your drivers license that said \u201cAshley\u201d on it now. It was like your entire life had been changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were freaking out trying not to have a panic attack. How was this even possible? Was that crazy light show you saw actually magic? Your heat was pounding as you tried not to scream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere a sudden knock on the door as Paige entered slowly holding her hands up. \u201cHey it\u2019s me, let me explain before you freak out.\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to tell and scream at her but after what just happened any violence or threats was probably a horrible idea for you. Taking a deep breath you stopped to hear her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t warn you. My magic works best if the subject doesn\u2019t know it\u2019s coming. I performed a full body transformation spell with minor reality alteration. Basically You are the female version of yourself had you been born a girl. Honestly I\u2019m really impressed. You turned out quite pretty and really sexy. I\u2019m actually quite jealous of your tits and ass.\u201d Paige said with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCovering your body a bit with your hands you blushed a bit as she continued to explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen I changed your life to where you are still yourself just female. Your name and basic family history has been altered to reflect the changes but you are still yourself. I can\u2019t stop yourself hormones however. Don\u2019t be surprised if you start becoming bi-sexual. You will still be attracted to women but also men as well. I also managed to set you up with an interview at my job. It\u2019s a coffee shop here in town where we wear lingerie and bikinis all day to serve customers. The tips alone I bet make more than your current job. With a body like yours you will do just fine.\u201d Paige said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut....WHY? Why did you do this? I don\u2019t care about the how as much as the why?\u201d You yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy mom....she is even more powerful then me. She has forbade me living with any guy unless we are engaged or married. She is old school like that. Honestly the thought of her hexing another boyfriend and turning them into frogs is too much for me to deal with now. I figured this was an easier way for both of us to get what we want. You get a place to live, I get a roommate. The spell I cast is good for 30 Days, I cant undo it until then but afterwards if you want to move out I won\u2019t stop you. Until then enjoy the body! Oh....and I\u2019m sure this goes without saying but if you mention a word of any of this magic to anyone I don\u2019t mind turning you into a house cat for the rest of your life....anyways I\u2019ll take you to work tomorrow morning have fun unpacking!\u201d Paige said with a wave like everything was no big deal. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After Paige left you alone in the bathroom, you just stared at yourself in the mirror, aghast and shocked that this was your new life. Your heart was racing. Your mouth tasted dry. You thought you were going to vomit because you were suffering your first anxiety attack ever in your life as you gazed upon the beautiful girl in the mirror, which you seemingly had no choice to accept was now you...at least for the month anyway, if Paige was being honest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot just that, but also accepting that magic and witches were real, which was just as mind blowing and hard to believe, if not more so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne step at a time\u201d you slowly tell yourself, still coming to terms with this bizarre new reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only after the last visage of your male gaze had taken a good long look at yourself, at your piercing blue eyes and flawlessly smooth skin, your deep cleavage and gorgeous legs that you finally realized something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly shit, I've got to go to work!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rushed out of the bathroom into your new bedroom for the foreseeable future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou showed up at the apartment with your stuff at 6:00 A.M because you had to be at work by 8:30 A.M. Paige apparently worked from dusk till dawn at the...sexy coffee shop, or whatever it was, so you both figured that if you didn't get along with one another, at least you wouldn't have to see each other too often. Going inside your new room, you searched for your work clothes, which you kept efficiently in the cardboard box marked \u201cCLOTHES\u201d, written hastily with a black Sharpie pen. You opened the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrowing your clothing aside to and fro, you went \u201cugh\u201d at realizing that your t-shirts, jerseys, jeans, and athletic wear had been replaced by feminine tops, blouses, leggings, and more skirts. All of them were colorful and relentlessly girly. You rolled your eyes. When you reached the bottom of the box, and you sighed with relief, realizing that at least your uniform was still in tact...for the most part. You pulled it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying on your work clothes made you realize that they were now smaller and cut for a petite sized, busty woman such as yourself, which overall wasn't too bad, just weird. It was just a dress shirt and dress pants, anyway, no big deal. It was weirder seeing that you were wearing a bra and panties now underneath now. While changing, you were terrified that Paige would burst through the door at any moment and snap a picture or take a video, maybe show it too all of your friends and family. You were afraid that they would think you were transgender or something. You had nothing against transgender people, but you weren't one yourself, and you didn't want the social stigma associated with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you were finished, you started to sniff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that bacon?\u201d you asked in your new voice as you grabbed your bag and new purse, and went outside into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the kitchen, Paige had laid out two plates with scrambled eggs, toast with jam, and two glasses of orange juice. She was wearing an apron, currently at the stove cooking something else up. You went on your tippy toes and took a little peek. Just as you suspected, strips of bacon were frying inside the pan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou coughed to get her attention, and she turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, hey! Feeling at home yet?\u201d she said merrily, as if she had already forgotten about transforming you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrying to buy me off with breakfast, huh?\u201d you said dismissively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you may look like a girl, but you're still a man deep down, and my mom always said that a way to a man's heart is through his stomach. Just don't  get carried away and eat too much. You have a smaller body now which means you don't need to eat as much. I don't want to see someone with a perfect body like yours get all fat\u201d teased the witch who just irrevocably changed your life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf this is your way of asking for forgiveness, I don't forgive you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaige lowered the heat on the stove, put down her spatula and looked quite dejected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u201d she said sadly. \u201cWell, good luck at work, Ashley.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBye\u201d you said, leaving the apartment without even waiting for Paige's reaction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n**<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou worked as a busboy at an upscale Mexican restaurant named Casa Hermana(Although if Paige was any indication, that may not be for very much longer). The reason you picked Paige as a potential roommate to begin with was because her apartment was so close to your job, it was located just three short blocks away in fact. You normally had to commute in by the subway to get to work, which girl or not, you're glad that you don't have to do anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you exited the apartment building, your arms folded, in a daze at what had happened to you, you barely noticed the random male pedestrians as they stopped to stare your backside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDat ass, tho\u201d said one of them loud enough for you to hear, but in your anger and frustration, you weren't paying attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reached Casa Hermana in less than a minute and walked through the back entrance to put your belongings in your locker. You praised God when you realized that it was still your locker, and the combination was still your combination. With trepidation, you walked up to your manager Mr. Reta to officially clock in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Ashley\u201d said the middle aged Mexican man casually as you signed in for the day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRemember to tie your hair back\u201d he said, not really paying attention to you, instead focused on his phone as he watched a football game. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing, boss\u201d you said dejectedly, still wincing at your chirpy voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCrap\u201d you thought. \u201cDo I have any hair ties?\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if by magic(What else?), when you reached into your pocket, you found one, although it was pink. You tied your now long hair into a sensible ponytail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then grabbed a bus full of linens and utensils and went inside the restaurant proper to set up the tables. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you were finished, you saw a couple of waitresses, Diane and June who had just clocked in to work wave politely at you, which you reciprocated. You entered the kitchen and waited for guests to arrive while you mostly just shot the shit with the kitchen staff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept for one of the cooks, Roscoe something or other, who you thought was a jerk anyway, you were the only white person who worked in the back, with most of the jobs mostly being filled by Latinos and a couple of black staff members. You didn't care. You got along with them just fine as a guy. What you were worried about was how you were going to treated now as a woman. You recalled the often vulgar but hilarious sex stories you all traded back and forth with one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your shift cleaning up tables began like any other. New body or not there wasn\u2019t anything glamorous about picking up dishes and wiping down tables. It was simple work and you enjoyed it because it allowed you to drift off in your mind. However with this new body every time you bent over or kneeled down to pick something up you felt the eyes of horney and lustful men and even jealous women staring at your perfectly rounded butt outlined nicely in your tight slacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple hours it was almost time for your lunch break when you heard a loud  whistle come from the managers office. Juan the manager here was the biggest pig you had ever known as a guy. He was very overweight but played it off like he was buff. He had long hair he kept in a ponytail to look young and a really ghetto looking goatee. You always thought he was a jerk especially to the girls over at his nightclub next door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight next door to the restaurant was a nightclub and bra called La Chica Azul. It was a real popular bra and club mostly because Juan only hired the sexiest girls in town to work there. They all had to wear sexy blue mini dresses and golden heels and jade necklaces. He called them \u201cBlue Jays.\u201d Most girls took the jobs for the tips and money but as a guy you remembered girls always complaining about the sexual harassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuan whistled again and called you into his office. Pointing to his chair you sat down as he threw his feet up. Reaching into his desk he pulled out a shiny blue piece of fabric and tossed it to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCongrats Chica you are a Blue Jay now....Tina quit this morning so I need someone to fill her spot.\u201d He said smirking showing off his yellow teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were a bit stunned as you looked at the dress. It was a bright blue on the side but had slots cut into true sides to show more skin. The front part was also mesh to show off more cleavage. Obviously not a subtle thing to wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm...thank you? It\u2019s just....I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m comfortable.\u201d you tried to say in protest as he held up his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen girl...I know your hot....so does all the staff here. That\u2019s all they talk about. I can hire any gang banger off the street to wipe tables. If I\u2019ve got a young girl with big perky tits like you I\u2019m gonna make the most of her. So you either take this job...or find another....\u201d He said firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulping you couldn\u2019t afford to be unemployed right now. Holding the dress tightly you nodded trying to hold back a tear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, now go see Lisa. She will finish off your outfit and start your training for tonight. Word of advice....don\u2019t wear a bra, they tip better.\u201d He said before slamming the door in your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to look on the bright side. This was an evening job that paid really well. If you could learn to fake being sexy and flirty for a few hours rent and bills would be no problem. You sighed realizing your other job too. Paige would now have you moved to the morning shift with her. Lingerie and bikinis in the morning and mini dresses and skirts at night....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou called Paige after changing into the dress. You took Juan\u2019s advice and ditched the bra. It definitely made your boobs stand out more. Looking down at your hand you noticed something a bit off. Your nails seemed longer then they did this morning. Your boobs also felt a bit swollen and more tender as well. Maybe side effects of the change?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Paige answered you informed her of what happened at work and asked if she could switch you to the morning shifts at the coffee shop. There was a brief pause before historical laughter dame ringing through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn girl! Off to a fast start! Of course I can switch you we can work together this way! Don\u2019t forget at the club to always sit next to guys when taking their drinks they love that!\u201d She said laughing at your situation which only made you feel worse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down your nails were definitely longer. Also much more manicured than before. You brushed it off for now as you went inside the club. </span></div></div>",

You were going to get positively faded on spiced rum there, and hopefully forget about the fact that your entire life had been stripped away from you. Guess that's out of the question now, unless one of the recklessly horny idiot guys there decided to treat you to a drink while on the job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were actually friends with a couple of the waitresses that worked La Chica Azul. You knew that a lot of them came from rough backgrounds like yourself and were just trying to make their way through life the best they could. They were treated like sluts by some of the patrons of the bar, but for the most part they were good people. You're not going to pretend that you hadn't gotten boners from them, particularly a Blue Jay named Angela whom you've had many nocturnal emissions over, but you treated them with respect. You just prayed that in this new reality there wasn't going to be any other weird surprises and that you could survive this experience unscathed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMentally preparing yourself with some deep breathing exercises, your hands wrapped tightly around the sink counter, you accepted that you were now ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou entered La Chica Azul and walked up to the greeter, an Italian girl with beautiful brown eyes named Karen, who you knew for a fact was a prostitute on the side, not that it mattered. She was dressed in a Blue Jays dress just like you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm here to see Lisa the manager\u201d you said to Karen politely. \u201cI'm inquiring about a job.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you the girl that's replacing Tina?\u201d asked Karen with a hint of enthusiasm in her voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I am\u201d you said, trying to avoid eye contact. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you're going to make a lot of money, hun. You're the hottest girl I've seen in this place by far. Come on, follow me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh...thanks\u201d you answered uncomfortably as you followed Karen. Both of you walked past the bar, the dancing hall(Morrissey was currently playing on the loudspeaker despite no one being here this time of day), and a room full of tables. It was actually a pretty nice place if you didn't know that asshole Juan was the owner of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa's room was already open, so Karen didn't need to knock. Both of them simply stood in the doorway and waited for her attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Lisa, I think this is the new girl we're hiring...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren turned around to look at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat's your named, sweetie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAshley\u201d you said flatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...This is Ashley.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa, who was sitting down, rolled over in her swivel chair to shake your hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou're the busgirl that everyone next door has the hots for, I'm guessing. Nice to meet you. Take a seat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren shut the door behind her and went back to her station at the front of the club.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa was around thirty-five years old and was distinctly not dressed in a Blue Jays outfit. You had met Lisa a couple of times as a man. She was a really smart lady, with a good head for business. You didn't have any clue why she was involved with a piece of shit like Juan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo...\u201d asked Lisa as you sat down in front of her on a loveseat that was in her office. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After taking a seat Lisa looked over to you as if examining you like a piece of meat. She stared at your chest, legs, and butt for a bit before saying anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, Juan wasn\u2019t kidding you are pretty hot. You remind me a lot of myself at your age. I used to be a server like the blue jays. It was different course back then. It was an hold 80\u2019s metal bar. We wore cut offs and band t shirts cut to show off our mid drifts.\u201d Lisa said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou politely nodded back not sure if that was a compliment or not. Honestly sitting here in this dress made you feel exposed enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen....you seem like a nice girl so I\u2019m not going to sugar coat anything or lie to you. The bar is going through some changes. We are upgrading a bit and changing things around to meet our customers desires. This means a new uniform and new...Well...boundaries. Tina wasn\u2019t comfortable with the changes and left. If I bring you on I need to know that you can be flexible.\u201d Lisa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d You asked a bit nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell here is the new uniform for starters. That one you have on is an old one we use just for testing.\u201d Lisa said as she stood up and walked to a closet. She pulled out a blue dress and showed it to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was similar to the one you had on but a bit different. This one a bright sky blue rather than dark blue. There was no mesh in the front but instead had its front split all the way down to the bellybutton. The two straps would cover your breasts barely and leave your navel exposed. The back was almost totally open showing as much skin as possible. She also pulled out a pair of sexy four inch open toed heels. They had elastic bands attached to them designed to wrap up your calves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe are moving towards an even sexier market. To put it plainly the competition is getting too rough. Our girls have to stand out more than any cute waitress and the sports bar. You will also wear these elastic bands around your thighs. That\u2019s where the customer can slid a tip if he wants. We of course still have a no touching of the hands....but...sometimes stuff happens.\u201d Lisa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bit your lip at the idea of being this exposed to strangers. You were terrified, but what choice did you have? You could only agree and do your best to get through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood. Now go get changed and see Angela. She is going to do your hair and makeup, then she will be your trainer for tonight. Listen and learn well and you will make a lot of money.\u201d Lisa said sending you out with the new uniform. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading off to the locker room you began to change as you saw other girls there getting dressed. As a guy this was probably your dream now as a girl it was your nightmare...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slid on the dress which cling to your body like a second skin. You couldn\u2019t wear a bra with it so your breasts were very visible and exposed. The straps only covering part of them. Your butt pushed out the rear of dress nicely giving anyone a nice view of your rear. You slid the tip hands up your tighs and put the heels on. This was most challenging part getting the elastic parts wrapped around your calves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the first time you had worn heels as a girl and it showed. Taking a deep breath you walked as best you could without falling but you stumbled for quite awhile. Strangely however you only seemed to stumble for a few minutes...Once you did several laps in the locker room your body seemed to somehow adjust as you even found your hips swaying with a seductive movement as you walked...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren\u2019t sure why but your body almost seemed to adjust based on your outfits. You were going to have ask Paige about this. You had no idea how this magic was going to affect you more.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You were now officially a Blue Jay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am a walking slut bomb\u201d you said quietly as you broke in the scandalously skimpy dress and learning to walk in heels. You asked some of your...well, your new coworkers where Angela was, leading a giggly blonde with piercing green eyes who seemed like every bimbo stereotype you could imagine to point  rightbehind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou must be Ashley. Nice to meet you\u201d you heard a voice say, leading you to turn around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment you stood there breathless with butterfly's in your stomach. You had been an adult for a few years now and had overcome schoolboy crushes a long time ago, but all of that maturity melted away whenever you were in the presence of Angela Torres, perhaps the most gorgeous woman in the world. Her body. Her voice. Her hair. Her eyes. Her lips. The way she walked. Everything screamed that she should one day be your future wife.   You extended your well manicured hand waiting for her well manicured hand to shake it. You were positively shivering the entire time in your nervous stupor. Angela took it in her warm and welcoming grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome to the sisterhood\u201d she said merrily to the fresh recruit that you now were. \u201cI'm sure this wasn't your first choice of job, but we Blue Jays look out for each other. If anything ever happens to you out there that makes you uncomfortable, and I mean <i>anything</i>, you come to me. Lisa may be the manager, but I'm actually the one running the show around here. Lets just get you all pretty for the big show tonight, OK?\u201d she stated more than asked, and began to glide gracefully into another room. Like a lovesick puppy dog trailing behind, you followed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought you heard one of the other Blue Jays whisper \u201cLesbo\u201d before the group of them started giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cReady, sweetie?\u201d Angela asked, directing you to a seat in front a large vanity mirror with multi-watt lights dotting the perimeter of it. Reluctantly, you sat down in the chair, which reminded you of the times you went to the barbershop. You had been growing your hair out somewhat shaggy ever since your main barber, Ken, retired six months ago, but you had been planning to get a haircut tomorrow before all of this gender swap crap happened and your life felt like Alice going down the rabbit hole. You were half expecting Angela to put a cape on you as to not cover yourself in any loose hairs, but instead, Angela grabbed some foundation, blush, mascara and other make up items from a nearby shelf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow I'm going to help you out with putting all this makeup on for the first week or so until you're used to doing this yourself\u201d said Angela as she began applying your eyeshadow, \u201cbut I can't baby steps you forever, so try and pay attention, OK?\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing\u201d you gulped. Angela gave a warm laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot used to putting on makeup, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-no.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, you seemed like the type. Were you a tomboy growing up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKind of\u201d you said. You had forgotten until now that your entire history had been rewritten by Paige, so you weren't quite sure what your \u201cnew\u201d past had been like, and you tried to give Angela vague, non-committal answers just in case they might contradict the new reality. \u201cI just have my own style.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaha, I feel you, girl\u201d continued Angela as she moved on to other parts of your face. \u201cSo I hear you used to work the tables and stuff next door.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yeah. I was a busb-girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCool. So what made you decide to become a Blue Jay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I was kind of forced into it\u201d you said. \u201cMy boss said that I was too distracting to the kitchen staff. That I was a young girl with p-perky tits, so I should be working here instead.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngela sighed as her brush coated you with bright red lipstick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFucking pig\u201d she said. \u201cI really hate that guy and his ghetto beard. It's weird how such a lowlife could be running such a nice restaurant.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know, right?\u201d you tried to say, but sounded all garbled with your mouth open, which reminded you of when you went to the dentist. Angela giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Angela continued to exchange small talk while she finished on your makeup and then worked on your hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn girl, I wish I had hair this nice\u201d you heard her say as she applied a curling iron to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think you look gorgeous, Angela\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUh oh. You were so lost in your small talk that you thought. You just admitted your crush out loud. How would Angela take it? Through the mirror reflection, you saw Angela give a mile wide grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww, thanks Ashley. You're so sweet. I think we're going to be best friends here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI certainly hope so\u201d you said meekly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Angela was through, Angela asked, \u201cSo what do you think, dollface?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou...you were stunned. Earlier this morning, you would have lusted furiously after the girl in the mirror. Her brown curly hair, her sweet smile, her gorgeous body and luscious curves. You looked astonishing...positively ravishing. Except for present company, you were the girl of your dreams. Literally. <b>You</b> were the girl of your own dreams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI love it\u201d you said quietly. Angela smiled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat, so on with the hard part, and that's training you to be every guys fantasy woman.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cSo...you\u2019ve never seduced anyone I take it?\u201d Angela said with a cheeky smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head shyly. \u201cNo...um....I only filled out recently. I didn\u2019t have boobs until a short time ago.\u201d You said in a misleading but also truthful manner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow....talk about a late bloomer! It\u2019s okay, honestly it\u2019s really easy once you know how to use your goods. Here let me show you.\u201d Angela said with a smile leading to a table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe trick is two things...eye contact, and light touching. Never touch a customer below the waste. That leads to very uncomfortable discussions later. Focus on their shoulders, their arms, maybe even tease the back of their neck.\u201d Angela said as she said her hands up and down your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was almost impossible to hide your arousal as your nipples were very visible through your dress. As a man this was your dream to be touched like this as a woman it felt strange and alien but still amazing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow never touch someone below the belt with your arms but your legs are a whole other story. For wealthier customers who can afford booths you sit next to them. Once you gauge the crowd if you feel safe throw your legs up on one of their laps. Laugh and joke with them, even if their jokes are terrible. Now we have a three strike rule here. If someone touches you and you don\u2019t like it give them one strike, if they do it again another and with a warning. However if they do it again you yell for Pablo and he will toss them out.\u201d Angela said to you as she pointed to Pablo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the corner was the bouncer Pablo. He was huge...over six foot and built like a tank. Very intimidating. This made you feel a little safer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow for you since you belong to what we call the C and D club you have a few advantages to focus on.\u201d Angela said as you struggled to understand what she meant until she pointed to your boobs...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBusty girls here have the advantage of letting customers tip their cleavage. Let them slid the dollar bills right between your boobs but only if they have been nice or what we call good boys. If they misbehave and become bad boys they we boot their ass out hard. Also your butt, thighs, and mouth. The sexier you can take their money the more they want to give it to you.\u201d Angela explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLastly remember this is just a job....everything we do is for a profit. Just because we act like total sluts and bimbos here doesn\u2019t mean that\u2019s who we are out there. If you ever are struggling or need help please just ask. I think you will be great.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few hours were spent learning how to take orders, deliver drinks, walk and move as seductive as possible, etc. Once night had fallen the doors to the club finally opened...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When Angela was done showing you the ropes, you were already quite exhausted before your first shift even began. Getting your life rewritten by your roommate, your gender flipped around, being fired by your asshole boss and being rehired for a job that you had absolutely no experience in within less than a day will do that to you. Giving out a big yawn, you quickly covered your mouth with your hand, reminding yourself that yawning wasn't very ladylike. Thankfully you would only have to do this until Midnight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou waited by the front entrance with the rest of the other waitresses, all of you clad in your uber-sexy Blue Jays outfits until like a dam burst, a horde of various men and a smattering of women came pouring through the door. Karen the greeter had a devil of a time organizing the ones who were here to eat and drink to their seats, while the ones who wanted to bump and grind on the dance floor were burdened to find their own way.  Angela grabbed your shoulder from behind you, and said \u201cYou're up, Ashley.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKay, thanks\u201d you said nervously. Slowly, you walked up to a table filled with four guys, and once you realized who they were, you gulped with dread. How could you have not recognized them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey sweet thing\u201d said Hector coyly. Hector was the dishwasher from next door at Casa Hermana. He was a quite well built and handsome dude, even managing to pull off the shaved head look well. Just the day before you were having a debate with him over which Emma was sexier, Stone or Roberts, with you arguing in the former's defense. Now you were on the other side of that debate, the piece of meat who was being lusted after. He gave you a look of recognition, but you realized that this Hector had never known you, the former Ash Kuhn, the twenty something white guy still trying to figure out what he wanted to do with his life. He knew Ashley Kuhn, the sheltered brunette bombshell completely naive to her own beauty and power over men. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there, big fella\u201d you responded in kind, trying to keep the conversation light and friendly. If you could avoid having to play up the seductress role for a while, that would help you cope with this gonzo new road in your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe couldn't miss our favorite girl on her first night\u201d he replied to your response. \u201cWe just wanted you to know that the boys next door are still thinking about you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT-thanks\u201d you stuttered. Absentmindedly, you began playing with your hair, a habit that you didn't have as a man, but the magic spell must have subconsciously decided that you have now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting next to Hector were Eddie, Tomas, and Floyd, who also worked in the kitchen. You were very nervous at how they were going to treat you based on what Juan the manager earlier. That you were all they talked about, which implied that all that they talked about is how much they wanted to fuck you. You grabbed your notepad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-so what will you lovely guys be having?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, we'll start off slow\u201d said Hector. \u201cJust four Irish Car Bombs please. If that'll be OK with you, Ashley?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wrote down their order. \u201cPerfectly fine. Anything to eat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCurly fries for me I guess\u201d said Tomas absentmindedly, who was the fattest of the group, but not extraordinarily so. He was just a little chubby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou got it\u201d writing down Tomas's order as well in the shorthand scribbles that Angela had taught you to write in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I'll take a hamburger with some mustard and onions\u201d said Eddie, who was eyeing you up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI like you with curly hair.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you\u201d you said quietly. \u201cSo that'll be everything then, gents?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four men nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKay, I'll go fill that out for you, and I'll be back shortly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you began to walk away, you heard a comment being made about you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGod damn, you walk in heels so well, it makes me sad you never wore them next door\u201d said Floyd. \u201cThey really show off that sweet ass of yours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou craned your neck around and smiled at Floyd, your white teeth highlighted by your ruby red lips. You gave him a little wiggle of the junk in your trunk, causing all four men to hoot and holler uproariously. You saw in the corner of your eye Angela smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked up to the bartender and the short order cook in the back kitchen and placed their order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Ones, fives, even a twenty from one guy who slid the bill right between your breasts. At first you felt humiliated. You felt like a piece of meat for this horney pervs to fantasize about. The irony that you used to be just like them wasn\u2019t lost on you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever once you started started to count the dollars it began to sink in. You just made more on that one table then you would have all day bussing tables...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at yourself in the mirror. All dressed up an sexy, the money in your hands. It was then a thought crossed your mind. Maybe....just maybe you could use this body to hit advantage?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a job....it\u2019s just a job....it\u2019s just a job.\u201d You whispered to your self. If they wanted a sexy flirty girl...then why not give it to them?\u201d You thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Walking about out it was like something clicked...You began acting just like the girl you looked like. You flirted, batted your eyes, wiggled your ass, shook, your tits...you did everything you could to impress and it showed. After just a few hours you had more money stuffed in your clothes then you knew what to do with....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the locker room room you were counting your tips when Angela came around. \u201cWow....I\u2019m impressed...most girls don\u2019t pick it up that fast. Just be careful...if you get too much into it you could start to become what they think you are...\u201d She said with a rather cryptic warning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did that mean? It\u2019s just a job right? Like she said how we act in here isn\u2019t who we really are.\u201d You thought to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill...as you stared at yourself in the mirror a strange thought crossed your mind....\u201dI wonder how much I could make if I was even sexier?\u201d It was just a passing thought....but one you would later regret...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour break was almost over when suddenly you felt a strange tingling in your chest...An odd heat and pulsing feeling that was getting stronger and stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing over to the mirror your breasts felt like they were even more tender then before as you slid your dress off for a moment to examine them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere they hung, natural, tear drop shaped, healthy breasts. You lifted and examined them wondering where this feeling was coming from. The feeling bit you again....this time stronger....You looked down again to see your breasts were beginning to....change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were pulsing....bubbling....the flesh beneath changing. You watched as their shape began to change. They began to lose their natural tear drop shapes as they got rounder. They grew rounder and more perfectly shaped. Much more than natural intended. They rose higher off your chest getting perkier with each second. You tired to hold them back but to no avail as they grew larger. At least a full cup size larger before stopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanging from your chest now was a pair of perfect DDs. Not natural anymore but the kind of perfect only doctors could make and adult movie stars  have. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShocked and stunned you weren\u2019t sure how to react until you heard a voice come from behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn...I was afraid of this.\u201d The voice said as you turned around to see Paige standing there. She was wearing a sexy red dress and was looking like she has been partying at the club for some time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell just happened? Why did my boobs change?\u201d You asked cupping them as you felt their increased weight and sensitivity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI put in a flexibility clause in the spell I cast. It was to make sure whatever your profession your body was up to the task. Your body will change and adapt based on your surroundings, needs, and desires. Being here, doing this job, you must have said something to trigger a change.\u201d Paige said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began to think for moment as you recalled you thought of looking sexier for higher tips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh...well I said something but it was just a passing thought.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell some part of you must have really desired it. Listen you have to be careful, doing this job more will only cause you to become sexier. Eventually you may lose yourself, old memories will start to faid as new ones replace them. If you forget your old life completely you will be stuck like this forever. The spell will become permanent.\u201d Paige said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I have to have job...this is the only thing I have right now.\u201d You said in anger and protest. You didn\u2019t ask for this body. You didn\u2019t ask for any of this...right?</span></div></div>",

Hearing this news about a \u201cflexibility clause\u201d, meaning that you were basically a walking mood ring, puts several ideas in your mind of how this newfound power could be utilized, some of which were scary but othersquite  intriguing. After being treated like everyone's plaything for the entire day, you thought that you may finally have a way out this crazy, mixed up life yet. You finally had a new card to play with, and you were aiming to play it to your best advantage. You you decide to rationally analyze this epiphany at a later date, probably just after you check out of work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe number one concern you now had was that now you had to be VERY careful about how you let other people affect you on an emotional or mental level, because having someone provoke or groom you into acting a certain way could trigger another change. You were going to have to learn to muster much greater emotional self control than you were used to wielding, lest you lose agency over your personality and body.  You might even have to start keeping a journal just to be 100% sure that memories you had matched up with the ones you recorded down in a notebook. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, so it's nice meeting you here\u201d you tell Paige, \u201cBut I need to get back to work. Talk to you later at the apartment, OK?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaige looked at you oddly, perhaps noticing the wheels turning in your head, but she seemingly decided to ignore it for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I'm just glad that you're finally coming to terms with being a girl. See ya on the dance floor Ashley\u201d said the red headed witch as she made her way out the door before falling on her heels. You grinned like the Cheshire Cat and helped pick her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like you've just had a bit too much to drink, young lady\u201d you inform your roommate sardonically before pushing her away into the darkness of the club.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continued waiting tables and flirting with horny guys all night. It seemed that reality had changed to compensate for your larger boobs, because that's all anyone talked about for the rest of the evening, about how you were the waitress with the biggest knockers there. However, that just meant bigger tips. Ones, tens, and twenties, and even a crisp Benjamin Franklin from a drunk Texan with too much money(Who asked you too grab it with your teeth) gathered in your thigh side money clip. In your mind, you figured that you must have close to five hundred dollars in tips, which left you swooning and daydreaming about how you were going to spend the money come the weekend. You notcied that there were moments during the flirting and playful touching that you were beginning to lose yourself in the character you had created for yourself, the coquettish young maiden who finally let her inner slut out when the sun went down, but just as you began to feel a tingle in your body, you regained control of yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then when you realized something, and you weren't exactly sure how to feel about it. All of this: the money, the guys, the flirting...was the most fun you've had in your life in a long, long time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Your first night on the job finally ends. Angela asks you out for a late night celebratory drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: You head home and get a good nights sleep</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When the night finally ended and the bar closed you sat at a table counting your tips. When all was said and done you hade made over 500 dollars in one night....The number seemed to sink in like an anchor weighing you down. You had made more tonight then almost an entire paycheck before... The other girls did well too but you were clearly the winner. Your new tits had obviously made you the crowd favorite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was easy to see the jealousy on the other girls faces too and it was easy to see why. Some new girl shows up with big fake tits and cleans house. Even Angela wasn\u2019t nearly as kind as she had been earlier. Heading back to the locker room to change back into your clothes you tried not to brag or say anything, even if deep down your pride and confidence was higher than ever...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuess those things really do pay for themselves.\u201d Angela said with a rather sharp tone as she changed back into her street clothes. Angela had perfectly healthy and natural C cups but she felt really intimidated by your huge perfect DDs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm...Yeah. I didn\u2019t really plan on getting them but I guess.\u201d You tried to say as humble as possible without offending her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust watch yourself....It\u2019s easy to become lost in your role here.\u201d Angela said slamming her locker shut before walking out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing you were a bit sad because you really wanted to become friends with Angela. Maybe it would just take a bit more time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho cares your sexier than all them...soon you will be running this place...\u201d The thought suddenly entered your mind out of nowhere as you had to pause for a moment. Shaking it out of your head you changed back into your street clothes before hearing back to your apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you were back into your apartment Paige was back but dead asleep already. You quietly went back to room and undressed before falling alseep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever a good nights rest was the last thing your new body would allow...You decided to sleep nude for comfort reasons as you tried to doze off. However every time you closed your eyes images of tonight would flash in your mind. Images of your sexy body....all those other sexy girls. Your male mind still reacting the way it normally would as you found yourself getting turned on. However there was more. You also fantasized about....men? All that flirting....teasing. Sitting in guys laps, whispering seductively to them....it was making your body hot and....well...horney...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t even realize you were doing it at first. One of your hands groped one of your large breasts, the other stroked  your new womanhood gently. The new sensations of pleasure were unlike anything you imagined. Your mind seemingly split between fantasizing between other girls and guys. It seemed you were going to be bi like Paige said...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you embraced your sexual nature for openly for the first time you felt an amazing climax building within you. However in the darkness of your room the spell cast on you began to react again. Your surroundings were changing in the darkness all around you. What started as a simple room for an avaerate girl was quickly changing into a sex bomb luxury room...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour clothes began to change. Simple panties turned into lacy sets, thongs, g-strings. Your average bras became push up lacy bras, designed to create maximum cleavage exposure. Pants turned into skinny jeans, skirts into mini skirts, shirts into low cut blouses and halter tops, etc. almost your shoes had some kind of heel now as high heeled sandals became the primary shoe of choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven the other parts of the room changed. Heavy amounts of make up and lipstick appeared on your dresser and scented candles topped almost every desk. There was even a new drawer filled with sex toys and lubricants....Even the sheets of your bed turned a deep blood red silk...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn\u2019t stop yourself as you suddenly screamed YES! At the top of your lungs as your first female orgasm filled you with pure sexual bliss causing you to pass out....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen morning came your eyes opened slowly to your new surroundings as you found yourself a bit confused as Paige was standing there looking at you disappointed....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI warned you...I warned you not to get lost in this monster. You crossed the line last night. I heard your little self-exploration mission. Now the spell has finally settled. It thinks you want to be as sexy as possible. Now that is the only thing it cares about, it can\u2019t reverse itself anymore....If you continue down this path your body will only get sexier and soon your mind and memories will start to change with it....\u201d Paige said with a scowl <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m....I\u2019m sorry...\u201d you said not realizing the full gravity of things yet. However you noticed something odd. As Paige stood there in just a sports bra and yoga shorts her hands would drift to her breasts every so often and she was biting her lip softly looking at you. You saw this same look from guys and girls at the bar last night....If you didn\u2019t know better you would say Paige was....getting turned on by you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood up only using a sheet to cover yourself as Paige looked even more uncomfortable....\u201dPaige....you Okay?\u201d You asked giving her a seductive look....</span></div></div>",

Like a dam bursting free, Paige's lust for her creation, you, was too much to handle for the young witch. She began kissing you, violently sticking her tongue down your throat, her momentum forcing you down onto the bed, your head resting on your ultra soft feather stuffed pillow. Paige began to grope your breasts while sticking her hand down to your vagina to rub your clit, causing you to scream in pleasure.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is so much better than masturbation\u201d you thought dreamily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about a minute, Paige realized what she was doing, and just as suddenly as she had pounced on you, she let go of you. She scrambled out of your bed as quickly as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god. I just raped you. I can't believe I just raped my roommate. I'm going to Hell. I'm...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaige began hyperventilating. She was holding her hands to her red face as she suffered from a panic attack, and when you realized that she needed help, you got up and held her gently, looking into her eyes platonically to let her know that everything was going to be alright. Something in your sooth, satin voice seemed to have an affect on her, and she eventually calmed down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPaige, it's OK. You didn't rape me. I didn't mind it. In fact, I'm kind of flattered. A woman has never initiated sex ever since I first started having sex. It hurts that I had to switch teams for that to happen, but if it had to be anyone, I'm glad that you're my first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wondered off-handedly if Paige was a lesbian or whether your sexual magnetism was just THAT powerful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she had calmed down, she began profusely apologizing to you. In the midst of her twentieth \u201cI'm Sorry\u201d, you began to notice an accent in Paige's voice slipping through that you hadn't heard before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you from the South?\u201d you asked her casually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. G-Georgia\u201d she stammered. \u201cI-I guess I try to hide it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I  guess I don't want to be reminded about my past. I moved here to get away from it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour past?\u201d you asked her gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaige, still shaking, sits down on your bed with you. You were still naked, so you wrapped yourself in your bedsheets and listened to Paige tell her story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell...like I said, I c-come from a long line of witches...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: The oppressive small town where Paige is from literally burned witches at the stake, and she ran to the big city to escape persecution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Something else</span></div></div>",

She looked at herself in the mirror as you could see something odd. Her bright auburn hair seemed to be getting darker and longer....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShit.....shit shit shit shit! Fuck I\u2019m screwed! I\u2019m totally Screwed what have I done?\u201d  She said panicking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? What are you talking about?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaige was biting her nails as she sat down besides you. Her eyes staring at you more and more lustfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess you have to find out sooner or later.\u201d She said as she left the room for a moment and came back with a painting in her hands. Pulling off the cover she showed it to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe painting was of the sexiest woman you had ever seen. Her breasts were massive, yet perfectly round, no sag. Her body was a total hourglass shape. Her skin was sun kissed tan, her legs went on for days, her butt totally round however you also noticed something odd. In the painting she was laying naked beneath a tree. She had firey red hair that was longer than her body. It reminded you a bit of Rapunzel as her hair was at least seven feet long. She also had blood red finger and toe nails which came to sharp points like claws...Behind you firey red lips you could also see the smallest sign of fangs....This woman was beautiful but also a monster....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is me....This was made on my 18th birthday. Listen the truth is...witches like me...we aren\u2019t really human. We are cursed, born with what they call the devils gift or magic. In manifests in all sorts of different ways in us. This was mine. Once I hit puberty my hair started growing. Every time I cut it I would wake up the next morning with it longer than it was before. The same went for my nails and body. I kept getting sexier and more demon like as I ages and the more I tried to cover up and hide the worse it got....The small southern town I grew up in was a religious town where witches were persecuted. My mother thought we would be safe there if we concealed ourselves enough. The hunters would never look for us there.\u201d Paige said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHunters?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah...witch hunters, or magic hunters, their official name is Paladins. An ancient order descended from knights. They see magic as an abomination against god and try to purge it wherever it hides. They use magic weapons and amulets to track us and kill us. We thought in this tiny town we would be safe but....but...I couldn\u2019t control it...a group of zealots came for me one day and well. My true self finally came out.\u201d Paige said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding up her hand Paige touched your forehead as a sudden flashback memory flooded into your mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw the girl from the painting. Her long red hair flowing behind her as she sat under a tree reading a book. She wore a very thick white dress and gloves and thick boots. To hide herself it seemed. Behind her a group of boys her age appeared rocks in their hands....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey monster girl\u201d one of the yelled throwing the rock at the back of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rock hit her sending her falling back blessed as young Paige stared up in horror begging them not to hurt her. The boys clearly had other intentions as the leader began unbuckling his belt....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then it was like something snapped. Paige\u2019s eyes began to glow a bright emerald green. Her hair began to darken turning jet black....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys began to get worried as suddenly a growl came from Paige as her hair came alive. Moving like it had a mind of its own the hair wrapped itself around the necks of all three boys strangling them. The boys tried to free themselves but the hair was too strong. Within minutes they lay there lifeless....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears filled Paige\u2019s eyes as she got up and ran. Her jet black hair following her as it released its victims. She fled deep into the wood finding a stream as she stared at her reflection. It was continuing to change as Paige cried out for it to stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlames began circling her body as her clothing began to change. No longer old dresses and boots to hide herself. Red silk tooknit place as it formed an outfit that barely covered her huge breasts and sexy body. Her skin began to turn color turning a deep rose color. Her nails grew longer and turned black like her hair really looking like claws. Her ears grew long and pointed and horns grew from her temple. A long tail sprouted from her body as her human appearance melted away revealing the true demon within herself.<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/c1/3f/8a/c13f8a5eab0ff5835456470b9a240069.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/c1/3f/8a/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe memory soon faded as Paige pulled you back. You should see her hair was turning black and her skin was turning rose color again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey came for me soon after. The Paladins surrounded our house. They couldn\u2019t never allow a monster like me to survive. My mother, she did the only thing she could. She gave up the last of her power to create a seal within me to hide my true form. She then teleported me away right before....right before they stormed us and killed her. I awoke in another city in this body. I did the best to hide myself but over the years the seal has weakened. Sexual energy weakens it which is why I avoided boys at all costs. That was why I had to turn you into a girl. I thought my temptations would be less but....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs there no way to put the seal back on or use magic to disguise yourself?\u201d You asked <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot anymore. My demon form has grown to strong over the years. My curse is too strong. If I turn back there is no going back for me my only option is to run and hide and wait for the Paladins to find me again.\u201d Paige said crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere has to be another way! You are the only one who can turn me back!\u201d You said pleading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere is only one other thing I could do and you would never agree to it....\u201d Paige said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat! I will do anything!\u201d You pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI....could..::transfer the curse to you. You would become a demon. That would give me the time I need to find a counter curse to cure you and return you to normal. However I know you would never go for that. You would be a monster like me. Driven by lust and sex. Your body would become even sexier and any clothes you wore would change into their sexiest form possible. While you could learn to hide your true form during the day at night your demon form would be trying to come out.\u201d She said with a hopeless tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf I did agree to this...how long do you think it would take?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProbably six months...I\u2019ve been researching anti-demonic spells for years now but I\u2019m still several pieces away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe was the hardest choice of your life. If you agreed your condition would only get worse. You would be even more female but also a monster....If you disagreed you were doomed to remain female forever....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine...I\u2019ll do it. How do we transfer it?\u201d You said nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre....are you sure?\u201d Paige said tears in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded nervously as Paige smiled. Stripping down naked you saw her demonic tail had returned. \u201cI have to make love to you. So just relax....\u201d she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were terrified as Oiage climbed on top of you. Her long tail sliding up between your thighs as you suddenly felt her enter you.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pleasure was unlike you had ever felt as you suddenly cried out in pleasure. Your nails were already growing and turning black as they ripped the sheets. Your hair was turning black and growing longer and longer. It was already longer than your body as it continued to grow as Paige began the transfer ritual...In your mind you knew what you were going to looks like in the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/c1/3f/8a/c13f8a5eab0ff5835456470b9a240069.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/c1/3f/8a/...</a></span></div></div>",

You celebrated your good fortune by having a night in. You invited Paige, but she had other plans with some friends of her's, you had the apartment to yourself. It gave you time to ruminate on your good fortune, and try to think about what you could do to make sure she didn't toss your ass out at the end of the month. You figured that you could start by keeping yourself clean, and by cleaning up the apartment a little. Not much, but noticeably. You did that before heading into your room and going to bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou woke up the next morning and walked out to the kitchen, planning to heat up a frozen breakfast sandwich. What you didn't expect, was for Paige to be walking into the apartment, covered in sweat and wearing nothing but a sports bra and yoga pants. You immediately averted your gaze, between the fact that she was a conventionally attractive woman, the fact that she was dressed like that made it so you'd look like even more of a creep if you stared. You studied the breakfast sandwich box very intently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaige only giggled in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ash, it's all right. I get enough stares during my morning run, I'm used to it.\" Paige said as she took her hair out of the ponytail it was in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... sorry.\" you said, looking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was your night?\" she asked as she unlaced her sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. Nothing special.\" you said. \"Tidied up a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I noticed.\" Paige said. \"Someone wants to make a good impression...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaige went into the fridge and grabbed a bottle of water.

That didn\u2019t make much sense either....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to go work out for a bit you looked for your gym shorts but you couldn\u2019t find them.

Who\u2019s were they? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily you had another pair of shorts in your gym back that you were able to change into. After you got dressed you walked down to the street to begin your run. You were beginning to get hungry too as thought of what sounded good for dinner. As you passed one of your favorite burger places you suddenly felt ill at the thought of eating there....Tur near thought of greasy food made you queasy as you suddenly had a strange craving for....salad?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe this was a good thing? You shook off the feelings for now as you jogged. You found yourself tugging at the shorts more as they felt tighter than usual and shorter as well.</span></div></div>",

Curious, you went downstairs to get it. As you took the piece of mail, you saw the return address. Say, wasn't this the company that sponsored the contest you entered?

Still, you needed to get out in the world somehow. What better time than now to do that? You wanted to take the chance to show some independence and really do things on your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you spent the rest of the day and night getting everything packed. You weren't entirely sure how long you'd be gone of course, so you made sure to pack accordingly.</span></div></div>",

While on the boat you noticed a few other guys around your age dresses in similar vacation clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou guys win too?\u201d You asked looking back to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m Chad, This is Barry.\u201d One of the guys said shaking your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry the other guy was a little less friendly as he just waved a bit before checking his watch. \u201cDude, there better be some hot chicks on this trip is all I\u2019m saying and they better not be trying to sell me stuff.\u201d He said with a skeptical tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to stay optimistic as you saw the island in the distance. It wasn\u2019t huge like it\u2019s own country. It was small enough to walk around over the course of a day. However it was still beautiful. White sandy beaches, palm trees, a small mountain that looked easily climbable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the boat dropped the three of you off you saw signs posted guiding you to the center of the island. Following the signs you walked until you saw the an arch with a sign that said \u201cWelcome Winners!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking through you saw what you had hoped to see. A beautiful tropical resort. Several different huts all lined up with different things. There was a full service bar, a massage lounge, Steam room, hot tub, pool, volleyball, etc. everything you wanted.....except....well...girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw Chad and Barry coming up behind you as several other men walking around checking out the resort. There was only supposed to be 10 of you here and the ad specifically said \u201cSingles Only\u201d when you applied. This was going to be an awkward vacation with only guys...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking around the resort you saw the living quarters, a group of nice rooms put together. You saw names posted above each one as you found yours and went inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a nice room, cute, with a nice bed, shower and closet. You placed your bag on the bed and opened the closet to find it was already full....of women\u2019s beach clothes. Bikinis, short shorts, tank tops, and flip flops. Also high heels and several nice dresses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid I get the wrong room? Or am I sharing?\u201d You thought getting a bit nervous at the idea. You looked around the room and saw no one else but something strange on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a photograph of a girl. A beautiful and sexy Asian girl by the looks of her. She had huge boobs that definitely weren\u2019t real. Long flowing black hair, tan skin and a nice figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/lmiYR6IsftM/V0rlmPKOKuI/AAAAAAAAACo/t8x64nLOjb4kvMjhi9mfYVuj67EBVRpEgCLcB/s1600/tumblr_o3l5t8XJiO1r6eyr0o1_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://3.bp.blogspot.com/lmiYR6IsftM/V0...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs this my roommate?\u201d You said picking up the photo to look at the girl. She was beautiful but normally way out of your league.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou noticed there was something on the photograph as you touched it. A white powder almost like dust. It had no smell and no taste as you licked a small amount of it. You figured it was just dust. You were thankful it wasn\u2019t drugs or something bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to turn on the TV in your room but there seemed to be only one channel. It was just an Ariel view of the island panning slowly. You shrugged it off as you were about to turn it off when a message appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDear Guest please report to the central hub for an important announcement.\u201d Was all it said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou figured the contest people were going to say something so you just shrugged and went outside. All the other winners were gathering too as you noticed still no girls anywhere...It seemed to be the topic of discussion as many of the guys were complaining. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs everyone gathering by the pool a nearby intercom came on as a loud male voice echoed throughout the resort. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHELLO WINNERS! Welcome to Paradise Island! My name is Mr. Shadow and I want to take this moment to congratulate each of you for winning our little contest. I\u2019m sure by now you have noticed that there are no females currently here on this singles retreat. Well fortunately we have a solution to that but first I must apologize for our deception.....You see you won\u2019t be staying here for just a week, you will all be staying here for the next 30 days.\u201d The voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes suddenly widened as several of the other guests looked over at each other wondering what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe boats will not be returning to the island for 30 days so I suggest you all make yourselves comfortable. All cell service is disabled here as well. Fortunately everything you need is here on the island and everything is free of charge! Food, drink, entertainment! All of it is here for you!\u201d The voice of Mr shadow explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about girls? I\u2019m not about to hang around a bunch of dudes this whole time!\u201d Barry the rude guy from earlier said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you Barry I was just getting to that! Fortunately for you and 4 other guests that won\u2019t be a problem! As I\u2019m sure you noticed several of had photos of beautiful women in your rooms. These photos were all different and specially generated from all over the globe, there was a white girl, black girl, Asian girl, Hispanic girl, and Indian girl. The five of you who received these photos will be spending your 30 days in the bodies of these girls....\u201d The voice said as everyone froze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry looked down to his photo of a beautiful Hispanic girl and three other guys looked over to their photos. You stared down at yours again realizing you had gotten the Asian one! However he couldnt be serious....right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe powder on those photos is actually a powerful nanotechnology that is currently rewriting each of your genetic codes to match the image in the photos. The transformation will be a bit rocky so I recommend those chosen to find a private place. Also for those chosen I\u2019m sure you noticed female clothes in your rooms. Those are for you to wear for this vacation. Your regular bags have been removed and will be returned after the 30 days. Thank you so<br>\r\nMuch for agreeing to partake in our new social experiment, I look forward to meeting you all again in 30 days.....\u201d the voice said before going silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs this for real?\u201d Chad said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is bull crap...who the hell does he think he is?\u201d Barry said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not some kind of pawn...\u201d another guy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll 9 other guys were busy arguing with each other for the next several minutes as you began to panic. You were really going to change were you? You had no idea how to be a girl let alone a busty Asian one! Not wanting to get involved in this debate you went back to your room to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw your bag had been taken like Mr. Shadow said leaving only the female clothes in the room. You wanted to believe this was all fake and some kind of joke as you paced around the room trying to think. However your concentration was sudden broken by an intense stomach pain....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClutching your sides you suddenly fell over onto the bed as an intense pain and wave of heat began hitting your body....</span></div></div>",

It was like...everything was wrong inside, an intense fire eating you from the inside out. You twisted and turned on your bed, arms wrapped around your stomach tightly. Honestly, part of you wanted to just close your eyes and not witness whatever was happening to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, a different part of you had a somewhat sadistic curiosity that lead to you looking down in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour stomach area was visibly transforming, with access fat slowly trimming away, likely heading towards another location. With how internal your pain felt down there, you had to guess that it likely had to do with new organs, which explained how it felt like your stomach and everything else was being pushed or something. It had to be....a womb....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUgh, just the thought made you want to hurl. To think that you would ever have such a thing: to have reproductive organs like any other woman. This whole thing was just crazy. You wanted to wish you were dreaming, yet it felt way too real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, your extreme discomfort continued around your torso, specially your waist. While your stomach area was becoming that of a woman, your waist was also trimming out, as well as the twisting feeling of your back trying to arch. You yelped out as your body forced you into that motion, arching your back as it completely formed, small waist along with it. Of course, all that excess fat had to go somewhere, and you could feel that further down...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no....!\" you cried out as you rushed to pull the shorts and underwear you had down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPressure was already beginning to form when you did that, and it wasn't a moment too soon. You groaned as you began to feel your hip bones crack and reform, shaping into something wider and ideal for childbirth. The fat that was coming down from your torso began to accumulate, making you wince as your butt began to inflate. Your hands went right to them, feeling the soft flesh balloon up right underneath your hands. God it was getting so big. It would have shredded your underwear and shorts easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe changes continued to flow down, starting to lengthen your legs into something long and smooth. The light muscles you had weren't immune to this either, making you groan again as they changed. Your thighs became more prominent, yet still remaining smooth, as did your calves. You feet crunched a bit, causing another yelp of pain, as they got smaller and daintier...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god.....\" you groaned, almost to tears by this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was just your bottom half of the moment, and this was too painful to bear...</span></div></div>",

You tried to resist the changes moving up your body but it was too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hands cracked and popped as they shrunk and became dainty. Your fingernails began to grow longer and became perfectly manicured. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour arms grew thinner as your body hair disappeared. Your torsos shrunk and pulled in. However you could see all the remaining excess fat on your body moving and shifting all heading towards your chest...:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerrified you knew what this meant. Your nipples began to grow and expand as the tissue underneath began to swell. The flesh began to rise as your new breasts began to grow. They swelled past B cups in seconds heading into Cs. They quickly grew past that range hitting D range as it was now difficult to see your body looking down. They still continued to grow hitting a full DD cup before stopping. Their huge size weighing you down as they finished rounding out in shape and definition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly your face began to change as your Adam\u2019s apple vanished and your voice got higher. Your brown hair got darker turning a deep black as it grew longer cascading down your shoulders until it touched your mid back. Your face reformed into that of a beautiful Asian girl as the change was finally complete..:.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laid there for several minutes exhausted from the change. It took quite the toll on your body which demanded you rest for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometime later.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe TV in your room suddenly came on as a familiar voice came through. \u201cWAKE UP! Wake up Akane! It\u2019s time for your personality profile!\u201d It was the voice of Mr. Shadow from earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly you woke up as you sat up. The heavy new weight on your chest pulling you down. You had thought for a moment that this was all a horrible nightmare. You wanted to stand up and shout, yell at your TV and demand to be changed back but considering your situation you were in place to make demands. You figured if you played along for now you might understand the purpose of this game Mr. Shadow was playing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreetings Akane! Yes that is your new name. In the deck to your left you will find your new identity and personality profile!\u201d Mr Shadow said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching over you grabbed the envelope as you saw a picture of yourself with information listed near it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Akane Mishima<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBorn: Tokyo, Japan <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge: 19<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoved to United States at age 10. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSiblings: None<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParents: Moved back to Japan last year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersonality: Shy, playful, innocent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSexual Orientation: straight <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurse: \u201cThe late bloomer\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last line confused you as Mr Shadow was quick to speak up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow that you have been assigned a new body you have also been given a new background and backstory. This affects your personality, how you talk, act, and even feel towards others. Your job is to assume his identity to the best of your ability. If you do so and by the end of the 30 days we are convinced in your role, we will change you back if you desire.\u201d Mr Shadow said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo I just have to become this Akane girl? Act like she would? Basically become her?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExactly! The nanotechnology in your system will also assist with that. You will notice how you act and feel towards other people will begin to change. We will also provide you with backstory on your character over time. Here is yoUr first sample.\u201d Mr shadow said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe TV suddenly began to show images of what looked like flashbacks of Akane\u2019s life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAkane Mishima was brought to the U.S and a child and lived her most of her life l. Fully fluent in both English and Japanese she considered herself a citizen of both cultures. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkane was raised to believe her best chance at a good life was school so she was forced to study and train daily. She got straight As in school and made Varisty swim team and tennis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever even through all her success in school Akane struggled with someone, herself. She was teased for looking too much like a boy. Her shirt hair, flat breasts, and no curves made her an easy target. This made her self-esteem much lower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever all of the changes the day she graduated high school. On that day a boy she had liked for years but never spoken to approached her. He signed her yearbook and asked her a question. Whether there was anything that she wished for in life. Akane  sighed and simply. \u201cTo be seen like a real woman\u201d The boy then smiled and planted a small kiss on her lips. Akane was shook by the reaction by smiled. It was the first tome a boy had really paid attention to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever after that night something awoke in Akane...Nobody really knows what happened but every morning after Akane would awake to find her body changing....Getting more and more sexual. Her urges and desires growing with her body. She would have lust filled dreams and wake up in hot sweats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the course of a year her breasts more than doubled in size, her body developed real curves and she got the body she always dreamed of. However this new body and desires didn\u2019t help her shy and timid nature. She felt awkward dressing in anything sexy and even talking to boys made her incredibly nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe told herself that kiss was cursed. It gave her the body she wanted but not the tools to use it. That\u2019s when she discovered that kiss truly was a curse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe TV showed a another flashback. In it Akane looking very similar to how you are now was struggling to fit into a bra that was clearly too small for her. The bra suddenly snapped as she cursed as there was a knock on the door. Throwing a sweatshirt on her answered the door and gasped...It was the boy who kissed her at graduation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see your wish is coming true...\u201d he said with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is happening to me? What did you do? I keep growing and changing! Every time I cut my hair it comes back longer! \u201c Akane asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s because it is a curse silly...You know for the smartest girl in our class I would think you could have figured it out.\u201d The boy said with a wicked laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou cursed me? How....why?\u201d Akane asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was groomed to be our valedictorian and head of the class. However every time you swiped that honor away from me. Always turning in better papers and projects. Always getting the attention from our teachers. You got the scholarship I deserved! I just decided to give you the one thing you never really had...a true woman\u2019s body.\u201d The boy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease make it stop! I will do anything!\u201d Akane pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry too late...Curses play on Irony. The only way to stop it is to embrace the thing it is playing on. In this case your crippling social awkwardness. Every morning you will get more and more sexual, unless...you can find someone who loves you just for you. They care more about your personality than your body. If you need help here...A card for a group that can help.\u201d The boy said handing her a card before leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkane looked at the card which said paradise island....The same island you are now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what brought Akane to this island. The hope to find a way to end her curse. The only way to do that is to embrace herself and body, fight her crippling shyness, and Find someone who loves her just for her. That is your job...Your task here.\u201d Mr Shadow explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo not only am I a girl I\u2019m cursed!?\u201d You said terrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes...all the girls here are cursed. You think you are alone? The other girls here have their own unique backstory and cursed which brought them here. They are all seeking help in some way.\u201d Mr shadow explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo...I have 30 days to end my curse or what?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen you stay Akane forever. Your life ends and becomes hers....oh and one more thing you are forbidden from mentioning your curse to anyone. Doing so will forfeit your chances at returning to normal. Also be aware your curse is still alive. Each morning you will awake to find new changes to your body or mind.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe TV went black as the message ended....Whay a situation you found yourself in. Not only a new body but a ticking clock as well. You could feel the crippling shyness already affecting you as you stared at all the clothes available to you. They were all sexy in some way, bikinis, skirts, dresses, and heels. You had to decide how to greet the other guests. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Seriously, what kind of sadist teacher has a paper due in their first period class in the middle of the week? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet's back up for a moment. Your name is Justin, and you were a senior at Thurston Valley High School. At this stage of the game, most people weren't worrying about their grades, but the paper was a huge part of your grade and you couldn't risk a bad grade, lest you be forced to attend summer school and graduate late. So you stayed up all night working on it, hoping for a sliver of sleep, but you finished with only a few minutes until your alarm went off, so it wasn't worth it. You had a coffee before school, but once you got to second period, your body started to crash and you fell fast asleep on your desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich wasn't a problem because your teacher was out sick, so it was basically a free period. However, as a free period, it meant that everyone was doing their own thing. Some people did work for other classes, some read books, some simply left the room, and some followed your example and slept. But for a group of girls, they spent the period on the most worthy of causes. Doing their makeup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr at least one of the group did. Stephanie Wheeler was the queen bee of the school, head cheerleader, homecoming queen, probable prom queen, you name it, she was it. Her two best friends were Kathy Andrews and Lara Miller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ever going to finish that masterpiece?\" Kathy asked. \"Or are you going to be fixing your face up until it sags?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up, Kath.\" Stephanie said. \"Just because I take pride in my appearance...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Taking pride is one thing, this is crazy. You were just doing it at your locker.\" Lara added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I want to even out my lipstick. Plus my eyebrows are dreadful.\" Stephanie started to tweeze her brows. \"You should let me do you next.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll pass. I don't trust you with sharp objects near my face.\" Kathy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You remember the haircut incident of Sophomore year, right?\" Lara remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, it was one time! I'm more careful now!\" Stephanie insisted. \"I'll prove it. I bet I can tweeze your brows and you won't even notice!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still not doing it.\" Kathy covered up her eyebrows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, I'll do...\" Stephanie started to look around the room, until her gaze landed on you. \"Justin!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave him alone, he's asleep.\" Lara said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if he doesn't wake up, I win the bet.\" Stephanie started to drag her desk over to yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you lay there snoring, Stephanie began her diligent work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bell rang at the end of class, startling you awake. You yawned as you slowly awoke to see the rest of  the class filing out of the room, including Stephanie Wheeler who was looking at you funny for some reason. Had you been drooling? You quickly wiped your mouth with your sleeve to be sure, before grabbing your bag and heading to your next class. As you passed, you noticed Stephanie and Kathy exchanging something, but didn't pay it any mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn your next class...</span></div></div>",

This was supposed to be the best and most fun time of your life and so far you hadn\u2019t done a great job living up to that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe that\u2019s what pushed you to enter that contest. The desire for excitement and adventure. You had never won anything so you never thought twice about entering that contest at the local pub. They had a large jar filled with sand from a beautiful remote island. Whoever could guess the closest to the number of grains of sand in the jar would win a free plane ticket and week long stay at the paradise island hotel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou guessed 10 million. A nice simple round number. An easy guess. To your shock when the announced the correct number your name came up as the closest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was probably the happiest moment in your life when they called your name. Never had you won anything before.

A modeling agency had reserved the island for the week to scout for new potential bikini models to show off a new line of swimwear for a large company. All the women attending the island this week were potential new models.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour ticket was useless....at least for you. The only hope you had was to maybe sell it to a female friend for cash. However wasn\u2019t really an option either. The plane for the island left in less than 24 hours and while you knew some women who might like to go, none of them would pay you for the ticket.

Your stories were good, but the material you were finding was lacking and the editor was planning on dropping you, unless you could find a big story to break. It was just luck that you happened to overhear a conversation between your girlfriend's roommate and your girlfriend when you walked up to meet her after class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's totally not fair. He gives the boys better grades, despite some of them being dumb as a stump!\" your girlfriend's roommate, Sandy, complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there even any way to prove it?\" your girlfriend, Erica asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\" you asked as you walked up to the table they were sitting at in the dining hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey, Francis!\" Erica exclaimed. \"We're just talking about Professor Burgess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's the philosophy professor right?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Sandy sighed. \"He's a hardass though. And he's a total sexist...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know a few other girls who took his class, and guys who barely showed up got the same grades, or better grades than those girls who showed up and did the work the whole semester.\" Sandy replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's horrible!\" you remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't prove it though. Plus he's got tenure...\" Sandy sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If only there was some way to show him. I'd say get a guy to write a paper for you, but that'd get you kicked out.\" Erica said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat clicked into your brain and you started to get an ingenious idea. One that would solve both these problems with the same stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I have a solution to your problem, Sandy.\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Sandy and Erica asked at the same time. \"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" you started.</span></div></div>",

She was dressed in a stereotypical Hawaiian style, with a bikini and pareo but wore a pair of high heeled sandals with them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCome to think of it...there was supposed to be a Hawaiian bar of some sort here.

At the same time, his legs were being removed of his pants, shoes, and even underwear. The machine pulled his loose short ponytail free, the hair tie caught up in his shirt as they, along with the rest of his clothes disappeared down a suddenly appearing chute.

There was nothing he could do as the nozzle sprayed shaving cream over him and the razor left him hairless everywhere below what was on his head.

The clamps had gently lifted him off the ground as a matching bikini top with a gold hoop connector latched around his chest, the padding around the chest giving the impression of small breasts. A white pareo wrapped around his hips, leaving much of his shaven leg slightly exposed as a pair of black high heeled sandals were slipped onto his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa whoa whoa!\u201d Simon tried to struggle but the bonds held tight as a pair of golden bangles were put on his right hand and a necklace with a seashell was placed around his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFinishing touches initiated.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFinishing...?

Do you need any bus boys or dishwashers?\u201d Simon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh...I see...you would be shocked if I told you how many young guys like you I\u2019ve seen over the years. Well I hate to disappoint you but unfortunately I\u2019m not looking for anyone like you at the moment.\u201d Magister said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease! I\u2019ll do anything! Any job! I don\u2019t care how messy it is!\u201d Simon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnything? Well...I am aware of an opening at one of restaurants here in the hotel. It\u2019s called The Secret Garden. The manager Gaia might be willing to bright you on but I\u2019m telling you she is a hard lady to impress.\u201d Magister said stroking his chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease I\u2019ll do whatever she wants no worries!\u201d Simon said showing a lot of enthusiasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell...if you are sure.\u201d Magister said as he took Simon by the hand and began walking him through The Grand Hotel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon was even more impressed with how amazing the hotel looked on the inside. The luxurious design was matched only by the wild and fantastic decor everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Grand Hotel is one of the finest resorts in the world. We own this private island we are on. We have our own casino, restaurants, shopping centers, pools, spa, and even a golf course and racing track. Pretty much if you can imagine it, we have it.\u201d Magister said showing off the opulence of the Grand Hotel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis truly seems like a magical place...\u201dSimon said a bit overwhelmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have no idea...\u201d Magister said with a smile.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>On the elevator ride up to the shopping district Magister spoke a little to Simon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe cater to those with all sorts of wild desires. The more they pay the more we go out of our way to make their dreams come true. We do whatever it takes to maintain our reputation and most importantly our customers privacy.\u201d Magister said as they took an elevator up several stores.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagister took Simon up to the shopping district of the hotel as Simon was shocked at how big it was. Like an indoor shopping mall inside the hotel. Shops of types lined up next to each other as Simon was taken to a very Fancy looking restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon looked up to the sign \u201cEden, The Secret Garden.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside was beyond anything Simon could imagine as a restaurant. It was covered with exotic looking plants and flowers to give it a real garden decor. There was also a live band playing classical music and even a waterfall they led down to a secret pool. The servers were all beautiful girls who all seemed to be wearing some kind of exotic floral clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagister took Simon inside as they went into kitchens were Simon saw many chefs all cooking really fancy looking meals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey continued back until they reached an office. Knocking on the door a very strange looking woman opened the door. Her hair was braided into long dreadlocks. She had flowers all throughout her hair. She was dark and thick glasses and wore a tank top and mini skirt. Her arms and legs were also covered in tattoos. Most of which seemed to be flowers of some kind. She had large rings on almost every finger and even her toes as she was barefoot in her own office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMagister.....How many times have I got to tell you to stop bribing your gutter rats here.\u201d She said putting out a cigarette and blowing the smoke at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoughing a bit Magister smiled and tried to save face. \u201cGaia! It\u2019s wonderful to see you too! Please let me introduce....oh...wow...this is embarrassing I never asked your name.\u201d Magister said looking to Simon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s...Simon...Simon Green.\u201d He said reaching out to Shake Gaia\u2019s hand only to get a cold stare back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe answer is no Magister. The last little rat you sent me ran off remember!\u201d Gaia said frustrated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease Gaia, that was so long ago! She never wanted to be here anyway. She was just paying off someone else\u2019s debt. Simon here came to us. He wants a job. A fresh start right?\u201d Magister said looking to Simon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Ma\u2019am. Whatever you need. Dishes, wiping tables. I\u2019m in for it.\u201d Simon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou here that energy! He\u2019s going to be great!\u201d Magister said with smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaia looked Simon up and down and sat back in her chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou ever serve tables before kid?\u201d She asked Simon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes ma\u2019am. My mother owns a restaurant. I started working there when I was 15.\u201d Simon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? Well....Maybe...\u201d Gaia said thinking for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine...I\u2019ll write up a contact. However if he breaks it I\u2019m coming for you both!\u201d Gaia said giving Magister a stern look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagister smiled and took his leave as Gaia reached into her desk and pulled out a large stack of papers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo...did Magister explain everything about this place to you?\u201d Gaia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell...sorta. He said you did special things for your customers and this was a magical place where dreams come true.\u201d Simon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis ain\u2019t Disneyland kid...This is serious business. My top server Rose. She left us awhile ago and filling her spot had been a real pain. You will be taking her spot you understand? Now with working here comes some privileges but also debt...\u201d Gaia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDebt? What kind?\u201d Simon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe kind you have to work off. You are given a free room, food, and clothing. All that must be paid off before you can voluntarily exit your employment contract, understand? You sign this and you are stuck with me for at least a year.\u201d Gaia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s totally fine I was hoping to stay much longer.\u201d Simon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what they all say...Now...If you want to join the garden and become one of my flowers, sign here.\u201d Gaia said handing him the contract.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon thought that sounded a bit weird but it was probably just the name the servers got with the whole garden decor...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Gaia slid over the contract to Simon who looked over all the words on it not really making any sense of it. Like any contract is was wording so deeply that only someone really committed could have any hope to make sense of it. Simon didn\u2019t think twice about it anyways. He was simply excited to get to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaia handed a long green pen. It looked like the branch of flower, it was even covered in thorns. Simon took it carefully as he tried to sign his name but no ink came out for some reason...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh...it\u2019s not working.\u201d He said confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have to prick your finger on a thorn. Trust me...\u201d Gaia said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bit confused Simon touched one of the thorns as he felt a small singe pain as he noticed his finger was bleeding. The pen suddenly felt a bit heavier right afterwards as he began to sign his name again. This time however blood red ink seemed to come out perfectly as he signed his name. As he did he even noticed the small prick on his finger disappeared...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied Gaia took the contract and pen back. She rolled up the contract and put it away in a safe near her desk. Meanwhile Simon was still looking at his finger confused as to how that pen worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome to the garden...Rose.\u201d She said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh...thank you.\u201d Simon said a bit confused. She was committed to this whole flower thing wasn\u2019t she? He thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow follow me. It\u2019s time for the ceremony and to introduce you to the other flowers. Once the ceremony is complete I will have one of those brainless ogres Magister uses for security show you up to your new room. Training begins first thing tomorrow, understand?\u201d She said looking back to him with a stern look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes ma\u2019am...\u201d Simon said a bit nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaia took Simon farther back as they reached a large black door that had the heading \u201cDressing Room\u201d on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the door Gaia took Simon inside which as suggested seemed to be a large dressing room. There were wardrobes and mirrors, makeup and almost anything a woman would need to make herself look as beautiful as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they reached the center of the room however Simon suddenly froze as he began to blush. Sitting at each of their respective wardrobes was a beautiful girl. Engraved in each of the wardrobes was a name that seemed to match the flower that were named after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Iris, Marigold, Daisy, Jasmine, Lily, and finally the empty wardrobe which had the name Rose, written on it.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally seeing a bunch of girls would make most young men nervous but what made Simon truly blush was each of the girls was totally naked....They didn\u2019t seem to care or mind either. They were busy chatting and hanging out when Gaia and Simon entered and they suddenly fell dead silent...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach of the girls sitting at the wardrobe was stunningly beautiful in their own way. Each of them had a very unique and distinctive appearance that helped them stand out. From their race, hair, body style, etc, each one of them was special. The only thing they seemed to have in common was each of them had a similar looking lower back tattoo. The tattoo for each of them was similar in design. It was the flower they were named after surrounded by thorny branches in a beautiful yet almost sad looking design.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFlowers welcome! I come with wonderful news! We finally found our new Rose!\u201d Gaia said clapping as the other girls joined in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh...Hi...\u201d Simon said waving as he still felt a bit embarrassed around all these naked ladies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou sure about this Mother Gaia? He doesn\u2019t look ready for such a heavy task.\u201d One of the girls said speaking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon saw it was Iris. She seemed to be Asian, probably Japanese by what he could tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow now..:We all know better...None of you were any different from this Rose at one point.\u201d Gaia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm...Miss Gaia...My name is Sii....Rose....My name is Sssss....Rose....My....Name....is....Simmm........Rose.\u201d Simon kept saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo matter how hard he tried Simon couldn\u2019t say his name for some reason. It was like his mouth wouldn\u2019t let him. Every time he tried to say his name he could only say it was Rose...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with me? Why can\u2019t I say my name?\u201d Simon said getting a bit scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh she\u2019s starting to get scared! That\u2019s so cute!\u201d One of girls said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou gave up that name. You are now Rose. One of the flower girls of Eden. Trained in the art of lust and seduction.\u201d Gaia said with smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m a guy though! I thought I was gonna be like a dishwasher?\u201d Simon said backing up slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease...I would never waste a soul contract on something so trivial...You are one of my girls now...so...shall we begin the ritual?\u201d Gaia said looking to the other girls as they began to stab up and form a circle taking each other by the hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon now terrified tried to back away and run but the door outside was locked and wouldn\u2019t budge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the girls began to form as circle as they began to recite a strange chant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlant the Seed, Blossom and be reborn. Plant the seed, blossom and be reborn.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese words they began to chant over and over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon suddenly began to feel strange. It was like his body wasn\u2019t listening to him. He found himself drawn into the middle of the circle where he stood frozen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of no where Simon\u2019s clothes began to disintegrate. They turned to ashes right in front of his eyes leaving him totally nude...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe would normally try to cover himself but he found his body frozen. He could fee everything but he was powerless to move or do anything about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA mirror suddenly appeared as well right in front of him allowing Simon to see his body as he noticed it was changing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt started with his hair. Simon\u2019s short and dark hair began to grow and turn color. It was turning a deep blood red color as it began to grow longer. The hair was perfectly straight with no curls or tangled as it cascaded down his shoulders. It grew longer and longer down his back until it finally rested by his waist and hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext his skin began to change. His body hair seemed to vanish. Retreating away inside him as long perfectly smooth skin was left in its place. Blemishes, birthmarks, acne, and any other imperfections vanished as well. When it was done the only hair left was that of his eyebrows and head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext his fingernails began to change. They grew longer and longer until they were about a half inch in length. They were also pointed and rather sharp looking. Their color also began to change. Turning a deep blood red color matching that of his hair. His toenails also changed color as well to match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon tried to call out for this to stop but he was powerless...trapped by whatever magic was binding him to this circle...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon could feel his bones and body begin to shift next as he wanted to cry out in pain but couldn\u2019t...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis body began to shift next. He lost several inches in height going from around six foot to just around 5\u20197.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis body and muscle mass began to shift next. His masculine body frame and muscles were vanishing as a more petite and feminine body structure took its place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis arms and legs grew thinner as his hands and feet became smaller and feminine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis stomach lost his masculine abs as a flat and sexy but very feminine tummy took its place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis shoulders narrowed as his chest and ribs shrank. He was starting to look more and more like a girl now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears fell from Simons eyes as he stood there frozen looking at himself just wanting this to end...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final changes began to take over. His hips began to pop out and widen as his butt began to sell and grow. It took on a perfect tear drop shape as his wide hips gave him a perfect hourglass frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pressure began to build in his chest next as Simon dreaded what was to come...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis nipples began to grow and expand as the flesh underneath began to swell. Rising and emerging from his chest as if from a long slumber two new breasts began to rise and form on his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey quickly grew past A cup...Then B cup...Then C cup. At this point they looked like perfectly healthy and normal female breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever they still continued to grows they swelled again moving into D cups...then again...DD...and finally one last time moving into the large E cup range.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey also changed shape as they grew. Losing their natural tear drop shapes and becoming rounder, former and perkier. When they were finally all done they looked like the kind of perfect rounded tits only a porn star would have. When they were done his breasts were by the far the largest of all the girls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final changes were rapidly approaching now as the most important part of Simon began to vanish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis member and balls began to shrink and slither away. Slowly shrinking and disappearing up inside him as a new warm and wet female slit began to form. As his manhood vanished a new set of ovaries and a womb formed inside his body as a new perfect female vagina formed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last changes hit Simon\u2019s face. His Adam\u2019s apple vanished as his voice got higher and very soft and feminine. His lips began to plump up and turn a deep red color. His face reformed and became a sexy and soft female face as his eyes slashes grew out and his features reformed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe changes finally began to settle as the only thing left of Simon was his bright blue eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the spell ended the new Rose fell to the ground. Her body fell limp still recovering from the agonizing transformation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome Rose...I will give you time to get acquainted.\u201d Gaia said as the ritual ended.</span></div></div>",

Marigold looked hurt by his display.  Forcing himself to his feet he lost his balance with his wobbling weights on his chest.  Marigold attempted to catch Rose but Iris barred her way saying, \u201cShe needs to learn.  Rose you aren\u2019t special.  You are replaceable.  Thank whatever you pray to that you are working here with Mother Gaia.  There are worse fates, Magister might of delivered you too.  They can be yours if you are stubborn.

She turned to dressing in a floral sarong and fixing up her appearance in a mirror.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is what passes for conversation with Jasmine till you get to know her.  I am Lily.\u201d  A woman with a light mocha skin tone said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRose, I guess because I can\u2019t say anything else.\u201d  Rose said.  \u201cWhy did you all participate if you knew what would happen to me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is a place of choosing your battles and you might not win the ones you attempt.\u201d  Jasmine said morosely not turning from her mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t as bad as all that.  We get time off and we could be far worse off.\u201d  Marigold said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe boys are nice and the girls too.  They pat your butt without you needing to ask.\u201d  Daisy said and about to continue when Lily interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily said, \u201cYou sure you have enough makeup on Daisy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are right!\u201d  Daisy exclaimed swearing on another layer of slutty red lipstick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily faced Rose, \u201cRemember who you are.  Remind yourself whenever you can and you might get through this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, you are Rose and you need to please Mother Gaia.  Think on that and we will get along fine.\u201d  Iris said intimating a threat.  \u201cDaisy fought hard once but now look at her.\u201d  Instinctively eyes turned to Daisy who flounced about a dire warning to all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are a bitch.\u201d  Rose stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you forget it.\u201d  Iris said.  \u201cI think that is enough girl time.  Let\u2019s get you settled into your new life.\u201d  With that she summoned a couple primitives.  Guiding him past a casino with the sounds of clinking coins and cries of success and failure echoing from it.  A man begging for one more roll of the dice to make up his losses being dragged away.  A guard laughingly, telling him Magister could arrange a way to pay his debt.  They led her to a small back room.  A metallic key that felt warm in his hand.  Intricate undecipherable etching on the key he turned it in the locket producing an unnatural number clicks and grinding of gears.  The swung open and only after entering did he notice the guards silently abandoned him.  He entered a room with a small kitchen that appeared dated with a communal living area at the center.  What struck him though was the attached rooms plated with each of the flowers names gracing one of them.  Great even here he couldn\u2019t escape them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis room certainly lived up to his name.  Rosewood furniture hand carved.  With numerous rose covered garments in the closet.  Flower pots with the titular plant growing from them.  Rose petals littered across the bed.  A note written in calligraphy saying, \u201cSoon you will bloom.\u201d  He tore it up tossing it in the trash.      </span></div></div>",

Like she was trapped inside of someone else, but couldn\u2019t escape. However the transformation had been such an exhausting process that Rose could do little but pass out dead asleep once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHorrible dreams plagued Rose that night. Images assaulting her mind. Forcing her to relive the transformation. Watching breasts erupt from her chest as her old manhood slithered away from her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen morning finally did arrive Rose stirred awake. Her eyes opening to the the site of two large mounds of flesh blocking her view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh god...it wasn\u2019t a dream...\u201d She said with the faintest hope she was just stuck in some kind of nightmare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly stirred and got out of bed.

From her chest, to her hips. Her new body just didn\u2019t seem to want to obey her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes of stumbling around using everything she could find to balance herself Rose finally managed to start walking around okay. She even managed to use the restroom with little difficulty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose spent the next several minutes exploring her new room. It was rather nice looking, taking the Rose theme a bit to the extreme but that was sort of to be expected. All those clothes in her closet seemed to match her body perfectly. They were all the same deep red color that matched her hair and every single outfit seemed to be some really sexy outfit of some kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrowsing through the outfits she couldn\u2019t believe how sexy and slutty some of them were. She couldn\u2019t believe she was expected to wear this kind of clothes let alone to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she looked at her new surroundings there was a sudden knock on the door as Rose heard a voice telling her to open up.</span></div></div>",

It can be a bit daunting.\u201d  Marigold with a perky lilt to her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess since there are no signs of waking up, come in.\u201d  Rose said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me help you pick something darling out.  I love this one and this might be nice evening wear.  A dress that accentuates without going to far.  The trick is to entice without inviting.\u201d  Marigold said revealing a dress that showed too much skin for Rose\u2019s liking but she figured it could be worse.  \u201cYou already bathe?  Mother Gaia wouldn\u2019t not be happy if you weren\u2019t clean.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes I took a bath.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI figured with your wet hair, that is too bad.\u201d  Marigold said without explanation but images certainly popped in her head.  \u201cYou should of blow dried it.  It will set nice either way so it don\u2019t matter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDressing with Marigold\u2019s help.  Sliding the dress across her smooth sent a tingle through her.  Marigold zipping up the back encased her in the soft fabric.  Stepping in front of her full length mirror.  Rose twirled sending a wave of jiggles through her mammoth mounds.  Brushing her hair behind her ears she smiled in appreciation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it.  Enjoy the skin your in.\u201d  Marigold said with a weak smile to Rose.  Trying to fight the internal force causing her to conform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlinking a few times Rose tried to recover herself.  Her name began with an S.  She remembered that she thought.  A nervous feeling she felt at the loss of her former name.  What else would be taken from her.  With no identity all she would have is street walking, she needed a plan.  If this all happened in a day what about a week, month, or year?  \u201cWhat does this job need me to do?\u201d  Rose said leery with her smooth legs and chest exposed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are a waitress and are expected to flirt and please the customers to the best of your ability.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSex?\u201d Rose asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt happens.\u201d  Marigold said noncommittally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose stepped into a set of leather heels with roses stitched into the leather.  Instability for a few minutes as she strutted about the room.  It became intuitive quicker than nature should allow.  Another worrying sign for Rose.  They built on each other adding to his concerns till it almost equaled near panic.  \u201cCan I get some breakfast before work?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarigold felt relieved at an easy question said, \u201cAbsolutely follow me.  You want something light like a yogurt or an actual cooked meal?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll start with a yogurt to remove my pangs.\u201d  Rose said.  For all his normal ravenous hunger a yogurt fit the bill and with it they headed to the restaurant for practice.  They drew lustful looks from customers on their journey.  Marigold helped her finish her makeup in the dressing room.  Then out on the floor to the early morning customers shadowing Marigold.  Balancing trays while running a gauntlet of select eager men and women.  Lily worked alongside them a holdover from the night shift.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily said, \u201cI like the mornings.  Nice and slow, not to many wolves chasing after you.  A few holdovers that are sopping drunk and can\u2019t raise the flagpole.  Wait till you get a Friday or Saturday night.  That is where real danger dwells.  Calls to have you drink with them.  Have the bartender fix you a flower power.  It is a virgin drink with caffeine so you won\u2019t get drunk and stay alert.  You don\u2019t want to be drunk.\u201d  Rose tried to memorize the advice figuring that she\u2019d soon be doing nights.    </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rose learned the basic ropes of her job rather quickly. Even Mother Gaia who stopped in to watch had to express that she was impressed. Rose was quick at taking orders and didn\u2019t even need to write them down. She was quick on her feet and good at getting refills and remembering her tables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are pretty good at this.\u201d Marigold said observing her progress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy mother owned a restaurant. I worked there for years. I learned really quick how to wait tables.\u201d Rose said taking a small break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose continued her shift as she began to notice several things about the restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first was all the customers paid in coins. Not typical currency either a strange currency she wasn\u2019t familiar with. There were small bronze coins. They were about the size of a quarter. There were medium sized silver coins. They were about the size of a half dollar and by far the most common currency she saw. Most meals were paid for with one or two silvers. Lastly there were the large gold coins. They were rather big, almost twice the size of the silver and quite heavy as they were made of pure gold it seemed. Rose had only seen one or two of these used and every time it was either to pay for a large banquet or party, or a large amount of silver was given back in change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are those coins?\u201d Rose asked Marigold as they sat at the bar together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThose are the Hotel\u2019s Currency silly.\u201d Marigold said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe hotel doesn\u2019t use regular money?\u201d Rose asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell sort of...Magister takes money from all the customers who visit the hotel and converts it to coin. Only he knows the exact exchange rate apart from the cashiers. The customers get the coins from the cashiers and use it on everything here at the casino. From food and other services to gambling. It makes money management easier for the casino.\u201d Marigold said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow much are each coin worth?\u201d Rose asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell..:to be honest I\u2019m not sure in terms of dollars....I know a bronze is something close to a dollar. The way it works here is a silver is worth a hundred bronze and a gold is worth a hundred silvers.\u201d Marigold explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo...that means a silver is like a hundred dollar bill and a gold is like a thousand?\u201d Rose asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah something like that...\u201d Marigold said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose was a bit surprised at how much things cost here. However considering the luxury of the hotel it shouldn\u2019t come as much of a surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose tugged on dress a bit as her massive boobs always felt exposed and risked popping. She also tugged a bit at the g string she was forced to wear underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow come I wasn\u2019t given any bras or normal underwear?\u201d Rose asked a bit annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause silly! Bras are forbidden for us. Except for bikinis and lingerie we never use them. They hide out breasts which are beautiful and meant to be seen. The same goes for underwear. We always wear thongs or g strings, or other sexy kinds of panties to show off our beautiful booties!\u201d Marigold said like that was the silliest question she ever heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose sighed a bit realizing this body she was in was much more than she realized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaia had explained a few perks to her at the beginning of her shift which did help. She never needed to worry about shaving, she couldn\u2019t get pregnant or catch STDs. She would never even get sick or even age supposedly. All she really needed to do was eat and take care of her personal hygiene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flower girls also had free access to all the hotels offerings. This included free food and drink whenever not working. Free use of any facilities. The only thing that wasn\u2019t free was gambling. Any gambling would have to come from tips she earned at work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose soon had a table as she got back to work. It was a middle aged man and his wife and it was clear the man was taking special interest in Rose. He was letting off creepy vibes as he had Rose sit next to him and bend over multiple times to pick up something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose hated ever second of it and the man\u2019s wife was clearly disgusted but powerless to stop her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the meal was over Rose was cleaning up the table when she felt something come up from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou were exquisite...If not for my wife I would buy you for myself tonight...\u201d The man said whispering into her ear as his he suddenly licked her neck as his hands cane up and began groping her large breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally this kind of act would be frowned on but here it was welcomed a Rose had no choice but to pretend to like it. Her body also seemed to force the issue as when her breasts were touched a sudden almost electric feelings swarmed through her body as a new type of pleasure suddenly shot through her body. Unable to resist the pleasure Rose let out a very soft and feminine moan as her butt began pushing back into the mans hips where she felt a bulging erection in his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good girl.\u201d He said as she slowly slipped a silver coin down between her cleavage and left giving her large butt a nice slap as he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose felt ashamed...Her body reacted in ways she wasn\u2019t prepared for and it caught her off guard. The tip was nothing to gloss over however. Most tips were a couple bronzes this was the first silver she had been given.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Escape didn\u2019t strike Rose as easy but as mother said, \u201cNothing in life is easy.  Especially that which is precious.\u201d  Freedom is incredibly precious.  After getting off work she began to explore her surroundings.  She entered the casino or more accurately swayed in.  Her body an instinctive seduction machine.  Laying down no bets only carefully taking in the action.  People feverish playing what they named as games of chance but with the direction most of the bets went it didn\u2019t feel that way.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking past a sharply appointed man as a dice roll favored him from his expressions of joy.  The corner of his eye catching a shapely figure.  Beckoning Rose he said, \u201cI think that you are good luck.  How would you like to earn a silver coin?\u201d  He held one up for emphasis.  \u201cAll you need is to do is stand next to me.  Possibly blow on the dice.  No funny business.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose saw no harm in it.  He might be able to buy his way out of his contract if he earned enough.  \u201cI suppose I can manage that.\u201d  Brushing a stray hair from her face as she got cozy next to him.  She didn\u2019t know if his following success had anything to do with her but she found his arm wrapped about her welcome.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose learned of the wealthy gambler beside her.  His name Robert Wellington and that he was single.  That fact titillated her beyond what she thought decent.  He enjoyed winning but a love to call his own is what he sought.  Robert\u2019s dark soulful eyes drew her in.  They continued their evening in a nightclub.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose grinding her hips into his, leaving as little separation as she could between them.  His lips pressing into hers caught her off guard but she didn\u2019t fight it.  Closing her eyes drifting off with the sensation.  Rose opening her tongue at the ready to continue the interplay with her partner.  One of Robert\u2019s hand at the back of her neck massaging it.  His other arm about her waist.  Her own hands gripped tightly at Robert\u2019s back fearful that he might separate from her.  Time became all mixed up for Rose.  At once an eternity passed while only a moment simultaneously.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an almost dreamlike state Robert walked with her back to her room.  Leaving her only at their arrival to the employees entrance to the hallway leading to her room.  Hands together they he leaned in and they kissed in a deep affectionate fashion.  Rose meandered back to her room with his card pressed into her hand.  She couldn\u2019t believe the butterflies in her stomach.  Refusing the silver piece from Rob because she didn\u2019t want to cheapen their evening together.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFalling back on her bed after stripping her of her outfit.  Drifting off to sleep with pleasant memories of her night.  The dreams that came to her pleasant ones of a life with Rob.  Being his and only his.  White fabric encasing her body as a veil blurring her vision till Rob lifting it away with a priest pronouncing them man and wife.  Telling him that he may kiss his bride.  What a kiss it was.  Then fading into a scene of a hospital room.  She wondered at her presence there when a painful contraction hit her.  The swell of her belly clearing away all mystery.  A concerted push drove it all away.  Into a maternal setting with a baby on her teat.  Lifting the baby to burp when she recognized the face.  Her own male face looking back to her.  Rose jerked awake to start another day of this waking nightmare.  </span></div></div>",

She went and opened the door slowly only to find one of the flower girls bursting through her door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had long platinum blonde hair down to her ankles and boobs almost as big as Rose. She jumped up and down excited like a kid on Christmas as Rose rubbed her eyes to see it was Daisy standing there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh...good morning?\u201d Rose said still waking up confused as to why Daisy was here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMorning! I\u2019m so excited! Mother Gaia assigned us both pool duty today! It\u2019s gonna be sooo much fun!\u201d Daisy said jumping up and down as her boobs bounced freely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s pool duty?\u201d Rose asked not sure what that meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt means we get to dress in super sexy bikinis and go down to the pool and flirt with hot guys! We are there to attract customers to the garden. We are like walking sexy billboards!\u201d Daisy said like this was the most fun thing in her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have to go flaunt ourselves to get people in the restaurant? Why is that fun to you?\u201d Rose asked feeling this task was demeaning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCause we get to just hang out by the pool and be around all the cute guys! If you are lucky some of them even pay you to hang out or they might even off you a bunch of coins for sexy time!\u201d Daisy said twirling around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose groaned a bit at this task. It was humiliating enough to have this body but now the entire hotel was going to see her wearing almost nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose got showers and ready as Daisy eagerly waited for her. Rose was worried, out of all the girls there Daisy seemed the most far gone mentally. It was like she was totally fine being nothing but a blonde bimbo. Would that happen to her eventually?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting ready the two girls through on bath robes and went down to the pools to get their outfits. Upon arriving at the changing room one of the ogre like security guards handing each of them a small package as they went into the ladies changing room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose opened her package and saw it contained a pair of red heels that were little more than sole with a couple straps to hold her feet in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt also contained a red bikini if you could even call it that. The top was little more than a couple small pads that barely covered her nipples and strings attached to them. The bottoms were just as skimpy with a patch that barely covered her vagina and string that disappeared into her large tear drop butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwww! You are so lucky getting the string bikini....I wish we could just be naked it\u2019s soo much easier....dumb hotel rules...\u201d Daisy said as she was putting on a much more modest looking blue bikini and flip flops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose couldn\u2019t believe she had to wear this in public. She was practically naked walking around with this! She had little choice however. If she refused it would only add to her debt and prolong her stay in this place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was \u201cdressed\u201d Rose took a deep breath heading out to the large outdoor pool where she was expecting to flirt and help attract attention to the Garden Restaurant.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Floating in the water as only real breasts can, even if they are only real due to magic.  Rose\u2019s globes proved quite capable of their own gravitational pull.  Men orbited around her in a circle.  Taking in all of her topographical features.  She directed them to the garden.  A few took the direction but the ring around her grew.  Many having propositions of their.  Discussing positions they\u2019d like her for.  Few of them job related.  She played it off best she could.  She found strength in thinking about Rob.  His touch, his lips part of her quivered thinking on him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose and Daisy took a break of sorts.  Daisy slathered sunscreen lotion on Rose.  The sensual display did nothing to decrease the number of men surrounding them.  For coins Daisy auctioned the opportunity to coat her in lotion.  Nipples pointed out as she dropped her top shamelessly.  The winner scrambled over beside her on the lounge chair.  Daisy oohed and ahhhed to his wandering hands.  Rose admitted the man did a thorough job to the delight of Daisy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose abandoned Daisy to her fate of sneaking off for something in the changing rooms with the winner.  No great imagination needed there.  Rose found herself caught between her lusts and desire for coins.  Versus her self dignity and a faithfulness to a man she met only yesterday.  In time her faith rewarded with Rob\u2019s arrival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert addressed his attentions to her and she received them with eager willingness.  Grazing him with her cushiony breasts.  Beginning a dance in the water as they swam about starting a a game of Marco Polo that drew in multiple participants.  The prospect of being able to freely a beauty creating excitement.  Easy enough to aim for the feminine voice when it.  Rob suspected that when it that running in full on into Rose\u2019s breasts was purposefully allowed.  Other men only caught glancing blows through her careful avoidance.  Daisy upon finding out about the game became an active participant.  Allowing time for Rose to lounge with Rob.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy took both sides with relish.  Lunging at any movement and groping with fervor beyond that of the other participants.  Her abilities as an avoider lackluster.  Swishing about giggling anytime she surfaced.  She often aimed her sensitive areas to her pursuers.  For all the games they played their antics enticed multiple people to seek out the garden wondering at what other flowers might be plucked there.  Too much competition over the two beauties.  One enamored of a man and disinterested in others.  Despite her best efforts Daisy couldn\u2019t fulfill every pursuers lusts.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose took one from Daisy\u2019s playbook leading Rob to the changing room for alone time.  Rob became flustered from the assault Rose hit him with.  Kisses and roving hands that familiarized themselves with his taut muscles.  Rob returned the affection sensually playing with her soft flesh.  A serious case of blue balls followed with Rose being called away by Iris.  A \u201cTo be continued\u201d from Rose further increasing pressure on his bathing suit.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose felt worked up as she redressed herself in curve defining dress.  Fixing makeup and her hair as she prepared for work.  They needed more wait staff so they decided to take Rose away.  Iris\u2019s snide comments she did her best to ignore.  Iris took delight in spoiling her fun.  Rose felt tempted to slap her but the punishment that would follow would ruin her joy in it.  Her heart leaped seeing Rob at one of her tables.  Flirting shamelessly with him as she worked.  Never before did she feel like a wanton woman but his looks and charm went right to her head.  Along with other places.  A dampening feeling within her nether regions developing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFocusing on her work proving difficult.  Iris scolding her at every misstep.  Spilling a drink needing to dab it dry while the man leered lustfully.  Getting an order wrong sending Iris in a rage.  The customers proving more forgiving.  Her sincere apologies with a tight hug squeezing her breasts into them dissipating any anger they held.  Iris didn\u2019t appear eager to hug it out.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob invited her to another evening together.  A private night of the two of him in his room.  No alarms went off in her formerly male head.  Privacy sounding wonderful to her.  Rose\u2019s mind drifting to enticing lingerie for the occasion.  Time to break a truly lurid outfit.  Something easily removed she thought as bumped into Iris on her way back to the kitchen.    </span></div></div>",

He is a customer but so what? I have this body now and I\u2019m allowed to explore myself if I want to!\u201d Rose said defiant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy child! I\u2019m offended...If you think I would ever oppose you running off to get screw some guys brains out then you are sorely mistaken. What I take issue with are those other feelings...The much more dangerous ones...Love.\u201d Gaia said with a glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking about? We just met...I don\u2019t love him, and he doesn\u2019t love me....I think...\u201d Rose said a bit unsure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy dear...our kind is not meant to love. We are made for lust and pleasure. Desire and passion, but never love. Especially with a human.\u201d Gaia said in a weird tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuman....what are you then?\u201d Rose said a bit worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean what are we? You and I and the rest of the girls are cut from the same cloth my dear. You really think you are still human and it was my magic that turned you female? Please...The power comes from Magister...His contract is what really transformed you. My little ritual just creates a nice covering to make us look more appealing to the less...well informed customers. Our true forms are a bit beyond what they can accept.\u201d Gaia said laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell are you talking about? I\u2019m not human? What am I?\u201d Rose said looking at herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are beauty and sex incarnate my dear. There can be no room for love however I\u2019m afraid.\u201d Gaia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo..:I can\u2019t go out with customers?\u201d Rose asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can go out all you wish. You can indulge your sexuality all day and night if you want. Just be warned. If you confess true feelings for a human my spell will break and your true form will be revealed....Magister doesn\u2019t like it when that happens. I\u2019ve run into this problem with my girls before so I\u2019m warning you now.\u201d Gaia said leaving Rose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose went off to her room. Gaia\u2019s words ran deep but Rose didn\u2019t think she would need to worry. Rose just met Rob. She didn\u2019t love him and vice versa. It was true she was starting to feel things she never did before but that didn\u2019t mean it was love right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at her room Rose got ready for her date. She picked out a new outfit. A black dress and heels that hugged her body tightly. Her hair and makeup was done up nicely and for the first time Rose had to admit she looked beautiful for once, not just sexy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe headed off to Rob\u2019s room knocking on the door. She would just let tonight be about fun. She wasn\u2019t worried about these growing feelings yet. </span></div></div>",

Expressing her emotions felt more important now.  Especially with her warm feeling to Rob increasing.  Her head spun thinking of him.  His strength and good looks combined with moist lips.  Sex the physical act of love could that be enough to convey all in her heart.  She certainly longed for her body next to with not a stitch of cloth between them.  Undulating in mutual affections given and returned.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaiting anxiously for Rob to open the door.  On a precipice of indecision Rose allowed herself a step back.  She didn\u2019t love him so she needn\u2019t worry about confessing.  Then the door opened to the pearly white smile of.  \u201cShall we be off my dear.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA brief pause taking in his figure she said, \u201cLead the way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob guided the beautiful woman on his arm to an awaiting carriage that took them on a slow ride to a secluded scenic beach setting.  An picnic laid out out with care.  An assortment of fine cheeses and meats all carefully sliced for ease.  Chilled champagne strawberries dipped in chocolate with whipped cream for dessert.  Rob talked of his work and home vividly describing them to Rose who intently listened.  She constructed an image of him that painted a portrait of a man who threw himself into his work.  Finding only recently that money lacked the luster that it once shown him.  Not that he disliked it for it brought him to Rose.  A kismet meeting that continued to bring him joy.  She blushed at the compliment.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob attempted to push for details on her.  She found deception to him abhorrent.  Telling the truth to the best of her ability, \u201cThere isn\u2019t much to tell.  I came here as I had no where else to go.  My family gone and not many prospects for me.  Signing a contract here transformed my life immensely.  This place strikes me as having a dark underbelly.  I would love to break the contract but I fear the consequences.  The greatest perk is meeting you but I sadly anticipate your eventual departure.  My plan is to enjoy our brief time together and not think on that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRob\u2019s arm wrapped about Rose tightening the distance between them.  He said, \u201cI lament our possible parting as well but I hope to be close for our time together.\u201d  Lifting her chin up to taste of her lips.  They laid on the blanket petting each other locking lips and figures together.  Rob positioned himself atop her as she lay back eagerly taking in all his attentions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose parted her thighs as her legs worked to encircle her man.  Her hands broke from him briefly to shimmy off the top of her dress exposing her breasts for him.  His right hand took hold of the breast fingers stimulating her stiff nipples.  Rose hooking her fingers beneath her panties sliding them across her silky soft thighs.  Then she released his engorged manhood aching to nest inside Rose.  They passionately connected till their stamina ran out.  Rose safe and warm in his arms they drifted off to sleep together.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaking they took a few minutes to straighten their clothing before calling for a carriage.  Rob took the opportunity to hand feed Rose a couple strawberries dipping them in the whipped cream.  Wiping stray cream from her lip.  She took the chance to suck on his finger.  Helping Rose into the carriage and snuggled up to her.  They continued back too Rob\u2019s room for intimate evening continuing the picnic activities and beyond.  </span></div></div>",

The time had finally come for him to find out what she had been hiding all these years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor years it was always just Andy and his mom Lauren. He never knew his dad, all he knew was his name was Thomas and he took off when Andy was a baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy grew up quite privileged compared to most kids his age. He lived in an upscale apartment in the heart of the city and even had a maid who cleaned and helped babysit him when he was young.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy was a good kid and smart student. He had friends, played racquet sports and loved running in track. He had just turned 16 a couple months ago and was thinking about asking out this girl Serena from school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll this aside there was something always bothering him...His mother. Her job was a total mystery to him. She worked long hours, sometimes all night. He hardly ever saw her and when he did she would hardly pay attention to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMultiple times of the years he tried to understand her work and why it had to be secret. For years he thought she was CIA or some secret government. However that seemed unlikely because his mom always hated the law and would do nothing but complain every tax season or election.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis morning however had been the straw that broke the camels back. He was tasked with writing an essay for an English class about one of his parents careers. When she refused again to give him anything Andy blew up and a huge argument ensued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne day you will understand...Not until you are older!\u201d Lauren screamed as she took her keys and slammed the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy had enough...He took the stairs using his stamina to raise the elevator and beat his mom to the parking garage. Using his emergency key he let himself in the SUV and hid away in the trunk concealed by the spare clothes his mom left in her car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his mom drove away Andy had his smart phone with him and planned on taking pictures to finally get his answers. He was tired of all the lies and deception.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout 30 minutes passed in the car before it finally stopped. He heard his mom exit the Car, her heels clicking on the concrete as she left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy waited for another 15 minutes to pass before he got out of the trunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw he was in another parking garage. Unfamiliar with the building he looked around for a logo but found nothing. In fact the only thing he could find was a single elevator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing to the elevator he opened it and saw no floor buttons...Just a single button that was a down arrow. There wasn\u2019t even an emergency system or anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bit nervous Andy pressed the button. The elevator closed as he felt the elevator going down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe garage he was in seemed like it was already ground level. Was this place underground?\u201d He thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout a minute passed before elevator opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately Andy\u2019s eyes were assaulted by a deep heavy red light and loud music. It took him a second to adjust as he realized he was the entrance to some kind of club...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe followed the loud techno style music and bright red lights that lit up the place. This reminded him of movies where the hero must infiltrate the evil club owned by the main villain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe finally saw a name of something when he came around the corner. Above him was a name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Devil\u2019s Den.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy could hear footsteps behind him as Andy hid in a dark corner out of the lights to stay hidden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApproaching him from behind were two wealthy men probably mid to early 30\u2019s. They were wearing nice suits and obviously had money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrust me, the girls here are out of this world...They aren\u2019t your typical hookers, these are classy and seriously worth it.\u201d One of the guys said to his partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you say so. For the price and reputation this place has it better be worth it.\u201d The other said a bit skeptical. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy followed the two men down the hall until they reached a podium with a young woman standing behind it. She was very pretty, probably early 20\u2019s and dressed in all black. Her skin was milky white and her hair jet black along with her fingernails and toes which were pointed,  and even her lipstick was black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome gentlemen, I am Shade. Servant to the Madame. I see your appointment here. Would you like to head to our club and bar first? Or would you like to be brought straight to the girls?\u201d She asked them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow...they are serious here?\u201d One of the guys said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike I said...all professional...\u201d His friend said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s skip the party, show us the ladies.\u201d One of the guys said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShade gestured the gentleman to her left, to her right Andy could tell led to the source of the loud music and lights, which seemed to be a dance club of sorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her left however was a spiral staircase that headed down. Shade led the gentlemen down and down. Not realizing Andy was right behind them tagging along. He had to see this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe music grew quiet as they came to a large and very former looking room. It had large couches, a large fireplace behind glass. A very elegant and nice looking room replaced the high tech bar above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy almost froze however when he saw who was greeting them...It was his mom....only...he barely recognized her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was dressed not in her typical suit but an elegant black dress. Her hair and makeup were all done. She looked like she belonged at a fancy party. She was even holding a glass of red wine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome gentlemen...I am the Madame of the Devil\u2019s Den. I protect my girls and this establishment. I know your time is valuable so I will be quick. Here we have three rules...Plain and simple....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRule one. No violence, spanking, bondage, and rough play are all welcome but no closed fists. Any bruises left on girls will lead to your exile from here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRule two. No Freebies. This is a place of business. You pay for your visits and time EVERY TIME, no exceptions. We have no loyalty program or discounts here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Rule three....No love...This is a brothel, not a dating website. I don\u2019t care how much you like a particular girl this is her job and you are her client. If I catch any hint of asking one of them to leave with you that\u2019s it for you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny questions?\u201d Andy\u2019s mom said to the gentlemen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither of the men had questions as Madam Lauren snapped her fingers as the door behind her opened up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComing out of the door were several woman that had to be the sexiest Andy had ever seen. They were each unique in their appearance but each one more beautiful than the last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was here that Andy really began to see this place for what it was. Some kind of high end and probably illegal club and brothel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVery slowly Andy raised his phone up to take a picture of the girls as he hid at top of the stairs when suddenly...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ever since you were a kid, you wanted to follow in the footsteps of your family. Your parents had met at the same university that your father's father, and his father had attended, all being part of the same fraternity, Kappa Alpha Delta. You were now attending the same university, even carrying on the legacy of the name, that you shared with your great grandfather, grandfather and father, Sidney Hadley IV. Though you usually went by Sid, because it was easier. Your first and to you, only mission on campus was to pledge KA\u0394, everything else be damned. So that's why you were so crushed when you were given the letter that you had been cut. You immediately went to go confront the fraternity president.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, man. We had a lot of people make it through this year, and we had to make cuts.\" the President said. \"Try again next time, kay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm a legacy!\" you pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's sort of the problem. Greek life's been getting a bad rap lately, so we sorta want to distance ourselves from the past of the frat. So...\" he shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stormed out of the frat house. You were beyond mad. This was your one goal for college and it was dashed because other frats were doing stupid hazing stuff? It's not fair!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning you woke up and found that a pink envelope had been passed underneath your door the night before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" your roommate, Evan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not sure.\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe envelope only had your name on the front in cursive. You opened it up and read it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\"><i>\"Sid,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI heard what happened at KA\u0394. We still think legacies are important. Please see Melanie Simmons at Tau Beta Gamma.\"</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...?\" Evan asked. \"Don't keep me in suspense!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure. It says that Melanie Simmons wants to see me.\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Melanie Simmons? The president of the Tau Beta Gamma sorority? Wonder what she wants...\" Evan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too.\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou approached the sorority house hesitantly and knocked on the door. When it opened, you were confronted by a bubbly-looking blonde girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Yes?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou held out the envelope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Right this way.\" she motioned her manicured hand into the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou followed her down a hallway, before coming to an office, which she led you into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can take a seat right there.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments, another girl, with medium length brown hair walked into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Sidney. I'm Melanie.\" she held out her hand, which you shook. \"I'll cut to the chase, since you're probably confused.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could say that.\" you laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, so you're a legacy. Not only on your father's side, though. This sorority hasn't been around nearly as long as the others on campus. This chapter was only founded in the last twenty years. One of it's founding members was Erica Madison.\" Melanie held out a vintage photo showing several women holding a Tau Beta Gamma banner. And you recognized one of them. \"But you probably know her better as Erica Hadley.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom?\" you asked, looking at the photo. \"I never knew.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would you? It's not like sororities matter to the next heir of Kappa Alpha Delta, right?\" Melanie asked. \"They made a mistake. Misguided attempt at fixing problems that are beyond their control. I disagree.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want from me?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you, Sidney.\" Melanie said. \"I want you to rush Tau Beta Gamma.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you asked. You were shocked to hear that. \"I'm not a girl! And I don't want to be!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't matter. Gender roles are looser now, and having a legacy would be good for us, and you'd get to keep your title.\" Melanie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even if I agreed... no one else would.\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll handle that. Now, there is the one small issue that because we've already started pledge season, you'll have to undergo the exact same circumstances as the other girls, for fairness sake, but once you're in, you can dress however you like and we'll figure out how to fit you in for participation in events.\" Melanie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought of how much torment it might cause when others got wind. The guy rushing a sorority? You'd be ridiculed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know it's a risk, but this is a moment that can cause change. You can open it up for sororities and frats to be gender neutral, and of course, carry on family tradition.\" Melanie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I'm not sure.\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think about it. I'll reach out to you tomorrow.\" Melanie said, handing you a sheet to write down your phone number onto. Which you did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went back to your dorm room and explained the problem to Evan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a tough one.\" Evan said. \"On the one hand, it shouldn't matter, but on the other hand... yeesh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" you sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, you came to your decision.</span></div></div>",

Around a dozen or so. As you walked to the pledge area most of them looked to you were an odd stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm...What are you doing?\u201d One girl asked as she looked to you. She was a very cute redhead with a nice athletic build and figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm...I\u2019m pledging. I\u2019m actually a legacy. It\u2019s part of the whole gender equality thing this year.\u201d You said still a bit embarrassed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh....uh.... I didn\u2019t know that was a thing. If you don\u2019t mind why aren\u2019t you pledging a frat?\u201d She asked again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s....uh...complicated.

The next few weeks will decide if you are Tau Beta Gamma material.

They returned to their pledges and handed the bundles to them. Melanie handed her's to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is your assigned apparel. You are to wear this every day for the next few weeks. To class, even if you leave campus.\" Melanie said. \"Barring circumstances of damage beyond your control, you must wear every item in this bundle until you are made a full member. Do you understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" a chorus of feminine voices and your own rang out in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, now your assigned sisters will fill you in on the rest.\" Melanie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled you aside and into a room off to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry about this Sidney, but it's in the by-laws.\" Melanie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About what?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Open the bundle.\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did so, and your face dropped. You were expecting a t-shirt or something like that, maybe it was hot pink. The clothes turned out to be something resembling a school uniform. A white blouse, a blazer with the sorority's crest emblazoned on the right breast, and a pleated skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't be serious.\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am.\" Melanie said. \"And I'd totally understand if you wanted to drop out now... it's sort of why I didn't tell you. It's a relic from when the sorority was started. A lot of the sororities back then were looser with dress codes, and Tau Beta Gamma wanted to keep a very tight definition of femininity. Back then it was just skirts but it eventually became a whole outfit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't there be an exception made?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I looked. It says specifically that exceptions are not to be made in the case of legacies. I can propose a change, but it wouldn't be changed until after pledging is over.\" Melanie replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tossed the idea around in your head. It was only a few weeks, and it's not like it's forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right.\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\" Melanie exclaimed. \"We're going to be re-meeting in there in a few minutes after I explain the rules, and the other girls... the girls are dressed in their outfits, you can get dressed in here and I'll wait outside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded and Melanie walked out.

It's not a rule, but it might be more comfortable.\"</i> the note read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought of how uncomfortable the skirt was all bunched up the previous night and then back to the package...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walked over to the Tau Beta Gamma house, you had to admit that the panties were a lot more comfortable with the skirt. After all, it's just a different style of underwear, right? As you approached, you saw Sarah walking down the path and went up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Sarah exclaimed. \"I figured you'd have bowed out after the skirt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm dedicated to this legacy thing.

After all, if this was just temporary, then it was a small price to pay, and part of you really wanted to stick it to the frat guys who denied you entry. But was a petty squabble worth it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you mused upon your current situation, Melanie was quickly working to transform you into the picture of femininity. She filed and buffed your previously ragged and dirty nails, before placing fake nails on top and painting them in what you recognized as french tips, but instead of white, it was the sorority color on the tip, a glittery blue. Your toenails were also shaped and polished, which you spoke up about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't that overkill? I mean, who's gonna see my feet?\" you asked, wiggling your separated toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By-laws.\" Melanie shrugged. \"At the very least you're learning how to properly take care of your nails.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing that, Melanie turned her attention to your face, plucking your eyebrows, before using a combination of several cosmetics that you recognized as foundation, concealer, eyeliner, eye shadow, mascara, lipstick (thankfully in a neutral color), and several other things that you didn't recognize, before she walked across the room to get a long blonde wig, which she secured to your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Consider yourself lucky, usually we have to go through a whole hair washing and styling portion, but it's just easier to do a wig with you.\" Melanie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter fussing over the wig for a few moments, Melanie allowed you to re-dress in the full outfit, before producing a shoebox. Inside were a pair of white women's sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew...\" you muttered. \"No heels?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet...\" Melanie started. \"Can't tell you what's in store but... be prepared.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great...\" you sighed. \"Is it too late to back out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd think so.\" Melanie pulled a sheet off of a full-length mirror and waved her hands towards it. \"Voila!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking yourself up and down, you were shocked by the transformation. You were still you, obviously, and still had your flat chest and bulge, but you didn't look too out of place in the outfit otherwise. This was definitely far more than you'd bargained for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get downstairs, they're probably setting up for...\" Melanie started.</span></div></div>",

No girls were interested in you, and the boys wanted nothing more than to torment you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a day of being teased and bullied, you were walking alone, when you heard a thud behind you, and in the corner of your eye, you saw something land on the ground. You rushed over to see what it was, seeing a pink notebook, about the size of a composition notebook. It was facedown. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou picked it up, flipping it over to see emblazoned on the cover in white ink, in a strange font were the words, \"<span style=\"font-family:verdana, sans-serif\"><i>Fem Note</i></span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were intrigued, but you also knew anyone seeing you with a pink notebook would just be extra icing on the bullying cake, so you tossed it into your bag and hurried towards home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walked down the street, you spotted him. Ken Ortiz and Tyler Sullivan, your two lead tormenters, and two of the most popular guys in school. Ken was the head quarterback and Tyler was his best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where you going, Turner?\" Ken asked. \"Forgot about our agreement?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Home.\" you replied. \"I don't want any trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you've got it Louie, boy.\" Tyler said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Louis!\" you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's whatever we say it is!\" Ken said as he pushed you down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make sure you've got our homework tomorrow!\"  Tyler laughed as they walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rushed home, running straight up to your room. Neither of your parents were home yet. You put down your bag and opened it up, taking out the pink notebook. You looked it over, it had like... a strange aura to it. You opened the book, finding a regular notebook, lined pages and all. But on the inside cover were a list.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:impact, fantasy\"><font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><div align=\"center\"><u><b>Fem Note</b></u></div><br>\r\n<font class=\"size25\" style=\"\"><div align=\"center\"><u><b>How To Use It</b></u></div></font></font></span><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0- The man whose name is written in this note shall be transformed into a woman.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0- This note will not take effect unless the writer has the man's face in their mind when writing his name.

He was a bit worried as he had been letting his grades slip this semester and been relying on nerds like that Louie kid to get him through class. However he worried if that Louie kid ever grew the balls to turn him to the teachers things could go badly for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of no where Ken\u2019s heart began to pound....At first he thought it might be a heart attack...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou okay son?\u201d Ken\u2019s Dad said after Ken dropped his fork suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI....Uhh....be right back!\u201d Ken said racing off up towards his room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRushing up to his room Ken felt like his whole body was pounding and  burning. He raced to his room locking the door as he turned around and gasped. Right before his eyes everything was changing....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis entire room was shifting. His posters, clothes, sheets, everything was becoming feminine....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d Ken shouted before the pain in his body rose again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen doubled over as his whole body began to shift and pop as it changed size and shape. Long nails grew from his hands while his black hair began to grow and cascade down his shoulders. His hips began to widen as his butt began to swell. His skin became smoother as his features became softer. Two mounds began to pulse and grow from his chest forming into decent C-cup breasts. A tightness grew in his crotch as he felt his manhood slip away. Lastly his face reformed into a cute feminine equivalent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up Kendra saw her clothes had changed too. She was now wearing short shorts and a tank top. Her mind began to feel fuzzy as new memories began to swarm her mind as old ones began to fade away. Within minutes Kendra didn\u2019t even remember what had happened as she checked herself out in the mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Kendra your dinner is getting cold!\u201d Her father called from downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry daddy!\u201d Kendra called out.

That\u2019s when you got the idea...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMarco Yates-Shy nerdy bookworm.\u201d You wrote down as you looked to the clock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExactly 6 minutes 40 seconds later you saw it....Something you would never forget.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarco was eating lunch with his jock friends when all of a sudden he grabbed his chest. He began sweating and panting like he was having a heart attack....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weird thing was no one else but you seemed to notice it. Marco was panicking as he watched his hands began to shrink right before his eyes. His clothing was changing into a long black skirt that went past his knees and his shirt became a button up button up blouse. His hair grew past his ears forming a very plain hairstyle. Glasses appeared on his face as black stocking appeared on his legs along with black female dress shoes. Marco while Brody changed getting much smaller as B-cup breasts grew from his chest. Within minutes Marco was gone and a new shy looking awkward girl was sitting where he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey...Mary what did we say? We don\u2019t care you help do our homework you can\u2019t sit with us.\u201d Josh, Marco\u2019s former best friend said to Mary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh...sorry.\u201d Mary said blushing and almost holding back tears as she left her lunch table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat there frozen for a moment watching what you had done....Marco was gone. Vanished like he never existed. The whole world just seems to adjust around them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe immediate satisfaction you felt was replaced with a sudden amount of guilt...:Should you be doing this? What gave you the right to change their lives? However....Both Kendra and Mary seemed to be better people now right? Doesn\u2019t that mean you made the world a better place? What if.....What if you only targeted bad people? Made them into nicer girls?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again... You saw how the world changed around Mary. Why should you be stuck in your body if you didn\u2019t have to? You had to admit the idea crossed your mind. You could become the sexiest and most popular girl in the school....Whatever your fantasy was it was possible...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLong flowing hair, perfect round DD breasts, round bubble butt, hourglass figure,  perfectly smooth tanned skin, incredibly sexy and popular, but also smart.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n You began to write down the transformation notes in the book but you didn\u2019t write a name...</span></div></div>",

You needed more than just these two to check, you had to make sure that there aren't any side effects that you haven't observed yet. Plus, you had no idea if the book would stop working if you transformed yourself. You can't give up this type of power this easily. You packed your things and walked out of the lunchroom, stopping in an empty classroom. You checked to make sure no one was coming around and took the book back out, looking over it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem to have taking quite a liking to my book...\" a feminine voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jumped and turned around, seeing a tall woman with long white hair, down to her ankles standing... no... floating before you. She had pale white skin and was wearing a tight silver dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh!\" you screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No reason to act surprised. I'm the Joseigami, Rina.\" she said. Then pointed to the book. \"That used to be my notebook. I take it you already know what it can do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joseigami?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God of femininity. It's Japanese. Goddess really, but I prefer direct translation.\" Rina said. \"Anyway, enough about me, let's talk about you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe floated down and sat on top of a desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dropped this in your realm. Fell out of my hands while I was observing something.\" Rina said. \"How do you like it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's... interesting.\" you said. \"And strange. Why only men? And how does it work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's magic, and it's only men because it's imbued with feminine power. There's a Mas Note or whatever to do the opposite. I don't control that though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have other people used it before?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that exact one. Once a human uses it, it becomes bonded to your realm. It's your's now... unless you decide to relinquish use to someone else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you here, then? If you can't take it back...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wanted to check in. I like what you did out there... but you're only scratching the surface with it's abilities. I can help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there a catch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No catch, I just like to mess around with the human world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you heard the door to the classroom start to open. You dove behind a desk in the back of the room and hid, while Rina stayed put where she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get down!\" you whispered, but she ignored you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened and Jennie Boland, a classmate of your's, walked in, followed by a teacher, Mr. Edwards. He was a relatively young teacher, in his mid-twenties. Neither of them seemed to notice Rina. Maybe only you can see her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are we doing in here, Mr. Edwards?\" Jennie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, call me Dane.\" Mr. Edwards replied. \"And you said you wanted to know how you can pass this semester.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" Jennie asked, clearly apprehensive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh oh...\" Rina giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Edwards started to unbuckle his belt. Jennie rushed to the door, Mr. Edwards made it there first. You were speechless and horrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Edwards stop!\" Jennie screamed, but Mr. Edwards covered her mouth. She started to struggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If only someone could save her...\" Rina sighed. \"Oh, and if you want the transformation to happen faster, you can write that in too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a deep breath and pulled out the book, opening to a new page, and took out your pen. You started writing furiously. You wrote down Mr. Edwards and started putting in specifics. Once you were done, you wrote the word \"Immediately\", and looked up from behind the desk.</span></div></div>",

Humans are so much fun and fragile to play with. I\u2019m here not to help you or hurt you, just keep that in mind. I\u2019m not going to tell you anything you don\u2019t need to know. Where would the fun be in that?\u201d Rina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell can you at least answer some quick questions?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I guess...\u201d Rina said with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happens if I use the fem note on myself?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe same thing that would happen to anyone else. You would become whatever type of woman you wrote, lose all your memories and become that person. Unless of course you wrote down that you keep your memories. Than only your body changes. The same applies to anyone else too\u201d Rina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cInteresting....what happeneds if I lose the fem note or it is stolen or destroyed?\u201d You asked next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf the note is stolen or lost it is still considered your property until you recover it so nothing would happen, except the thief will be able to see me and write into the note as well.  If you willingly  relinquish ownership than all your memories of it would disappear. If the note is ever totally destroyed then you still keep your memories but nothing else will change. Those changed by the note cannot be changed back....There are consequences to using that note ....\u201d Rina said with a wicked laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey you said no strings!\u201d You said in protest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI meant no strings for you! Outside of the choices you make. There are always consequences for the choices we make. Whether it be Spirit or Human, you cannot simply undo what you don\u2019t like.\u201d Rina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess that makes sense...\u201d You said feeling guilty now. You had hoped to eventually turn some of the people back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe note is yours...you chose how to use it, just be prepared for the changes to your own world your choices bring.\u201d<br>\r\nRina said handing you the notebook.</span></div></div>",

You truly had all this power at your fingertips? It felt as close to divine intervention as humanly possible, though I guess that was the case all things considered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought back to the changes you had made so far. Kendra was not a bully anymore and even made Tyler into a more level-headed individual. Mary was obviously smarter now and less confrontational, as well as more helpful towards others. Now, you had even made a teacher who would have committed rape into a kind elderly woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust thinking about it and taking it all in....wow....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you done thinking?\" Rina giggled. \"You've been standing there for a good few minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoy, did it really take that long? Guess the minutes roll by when you're in deep thought. In any case, there was an appeal to this. You looked back at the note, even looking at the unfinished entry you had made for yourself earlier. Honestly, perhaps it wasn't the time for that. If changes were permanent, perhaps you should hold off on that. No rush after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah....I think I'm good,\" you smiled. \"Better to use this to finally deal some justice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds rather corny, but if you insist,\" Rina giggled again before she began to fade. \"Just be careful...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sounded as teasing as ever as she left, leaving you alone. Well, guess you should finish your classes for the day. After the craziness with the teacher, you could use a little break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><i>Some time later</i></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of school went by normally. You got to see more of your transformees in action. Kendra and Tyler making goo-goo eyes was a little nauseating at times, but still an improvement. Mary on the other hand was quite the improvement. You had a class with the old Marco, even sat next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd boy...she was insanely helpful getting through the class assignment. You became all the more appreciative for your decision. Mary was like a total sweetheart now. Heck, perhaps you could talk with her more in the future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, you finished school and went back home, feeling more satisfied than ever now. You got home as usual, walking inside and walking by your little brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Louie!\" Nick, your younger brother, said to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheesh, you really hated when Nick used that name for you, even if it wasn't as malicious as when bullies used it. Nick was 10 years old, and a huge anime fan on top of it. Heck, sometimes you had to cover for him just to make sure your parents didn't catch him with really mature anime. Still, it wasn't all bad. You liked the occasional Japanese stuff as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be honest....a small thought went through your mind about using the note on Nick. With all that cool stuff on Japanese girls and such, perhaps you could give him the life of one....then again, that would be a considerable risk too. Was it best to just save this for the evil people in the world?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, the choices.</span></div></div>",

It only took a few seconds as his body and appearance completely changed. Standing in his place was now an incredibly cute ten year old Japanese girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was wearing a white blouse and blue school skirt with stockings and school shoes. Her hair was a long and glowing and her black. However it also had streaks of blue in it that she added. Her backpack was now a pink hello kitty and in her hands was a Manga book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the change happened your head began to hurt as new memories poured into your mind. Nick was now Suki, your adopted younger sister from Japan. You still remembered Nick but now you seemed to have all these new memories of growing up with Suki as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLater big bro!\u201d Suki said giving you the peace sign before heading out to meet up with her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBe back by Dinner!\u201d You called out almost instinctively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou seemed really happy with the  change at first until it just hit you....Nick is gone....What have you done?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo....not just a dispenser of justice are you?\u201d Rina said appearing behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up....I think his life is better now. Look how cute and happy she is.\u201d You said trying to convince yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? I wonder about that? Maybe you should check again...\u201d Rina said with a laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking outside you saw Suki walking when all of a sudden a boy on a bike about her age rode past her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey nerd!\u201d The boy yelled as he rode past Suki slapping her Manga book out of her hands and  into a dirty puddle on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt the anger build up in you. You wanted to teach that boy a lesson but you just realized....You didn\u2019t know his name....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs there a problem?\u201d Rina said laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know his name. I was going to turn that boy into Suki\u2019s new best friend.\u201d You said angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI might be able to help you with that. There is a special deal we Josigami can make with humans who have a fem note.\u201d Rina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat kind of deal....\u201d You said sounding suspicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe Josigami have a special gift. Our eyes, we see the names of everyone above them. Just looking at you now I see your birth name above your head. This means we never have to learn a humans name to change them. I can grant this gift to you...for a price.\u201d Rina said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were surprised at how much this idea interested you. With those eyes you wouldn\u2019t have to learn names anymore. Just look at their face and you would know their name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the price?\u201d You asked nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh it\u2019s nothing....just a token really....50% of your masculinity is all.\u201d Rina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat does that mean? Are you gonna change me into some kind of femboi or herm?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease....No you would give up your male life 50% of the time. Starting at midnight you will transform into a female and remain that way for 24 hours. You will retain your memories and eye powers but like the fem note your world will be adjusted during your female time.\u201d Rina explained <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do I have to pay this price? What do you get out of this?\u201d You asked wondering why. This sounded so strange to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou humans are always so funny. You have no idea how we Josigami live do you? We sustain our bodies not with food and drink like You humans but with feminine energy. Every time a fem note is used and a male turns female  we sustain ourselves a little more. This deal is almost like you buying me dinner every night....\u201d Rina said with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs there any catch to the payment?\u201d You asked wanting a bit more info.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust one...If you relinquish ownership of the fem note you will lose the eyes. You will also stop changing but whatever form you were in at the time will remain your new permanent form.\u201d Rina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stopped to think about the deal. Giving up your manhood didn\u2019t sound great but it was only 50% of the time. With the eyes you could disburse justice even easier and shape your world how you wanted....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

However, just looking at it gave the impression that it was so much more than that, like you could just feel something was up. Granted, you did hesitate for a bit, wondering if this was truly a good idea. Then again, you supposed you could adjust to such a life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, with that in mind, you reached out and grasped Rina's hand with your own. At that, a huge shock went through your body, making you cry out a bit in slight pain. Thank goodness your parents weren't home yet otherwise they'd be rushing in to know what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And there, all done,\" Rina giggled. \"Needless to say, I'm quite looking forward to this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll bet.....\" you groaned as you slowly got up, smoking just a bit from the blast. \"So....what will I even look like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who knows?\" Rina shrugged, giggling again. \"Perhaps you'll be Japanese. You can better relate to your new sibling that way!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just giggled more at her taunting, making you groan a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know about that,\" you said, fully up now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm Japanese as well, so who knows what could happen,\" Rina shrugged again. \"It's a mystery we'll see together. Enjoy your new eyes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, she faded away. That actually reminded you about the whole eyes thing. Granted, nothing felt too different, even if you did have to rub your eyes a bit. Just out of curiosity, you flipped the TV on, turning it to a news station. Looking at a politician currently on screen, you blinked at what you saw. There is was! Their name right above their eyes! Oh my gosh, you could actually see them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah!\" you cheered. Boy this was going to make things so much easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo that end, you decided to rest for now. It had been a long day after all. You lounged around in your room, hearing your parents eventually come home and get dinner started. Eventually, you heard the door open again, and your parents really did address Suki the same way as they did Nick. It was kind of strange to see things so different yet similar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, as she passed by your room, you could see how sad she was. Her manga was partially ruined after all. It reminded you of how angry you felt at the boy. You were going to get him someday for this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Suki!\" you called her, getting her attention. \"How about this weekend, you and I go shopping for a new book? My treat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat instantly made her face light up. Boy, you had to admit she was quite cute. Kind of made you feel a little better about changing your former little brother. At that, she ran up and gave you a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Thank you!\" she smiled. \"You're the best!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that certainly made you feel more satisfied. Yeah, you wouldn't those sorts of things happen again. You wouldn't tolerate injustice to you or to the people you really liked.</span></div></div>",

Would you be able to get used to swapping genders every day for the rest of your foreseeable life? He\\<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing your homework, you watched a little bit of TV and did a quick gaming session on Twitch to a small but loyal audience. During all of it your mind was focused elsewhere, eyeing your alarm clock with nervous impatience, and your concentration faltered. After only a half hour, you announced the live stream was over for tonight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, it was time. 12:00 A.M was about to hit in thirty seconds. You gulped as you stared at your wall clock ticking away. You counted down with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c5...4...3...2...1...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust on time, you immediately doubled over in a fit of pain. Your face was turning red, and you were sweating profusely, feeling like you were about to have a heart attack. Bending down to the floor from your chair, you felt your body painfully shimmering into a mass of flesh, muscle and bone. You shut your eyes, afraid of seeing this process take place, thinking that you might be witness to your body transforming into some Cronenberg like monstrosity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, this was not to be, and the ordeal was over as quickly as it came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, you opened your eyes as they drifted up to look at the clock: 12:07 A.M. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExactly 400 Seconds. Same as the Fem Note gave to its victims. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, you noticed some slight adjustments to your bedroom. Nothing major, just some cosmetic changes. Your bedspread now possessed slightly more vibrant colors to it, you noticed a bottle of teal nail polish sitting on your bed stand, and overall, something about the room seemed warmer. Maybe it was slightly neater too, but it was really nothing to speak of. But then you looked down...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body was now wearing pink pajamas. You groaned as you realized that you now had noticeable breasts, and that your cleavage could be seen poking through the top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groaned deeply, immediately recognizing that your voice had gone up a few octaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a door opened. It was your Mom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLouise, what are you doing up so late?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing!\u201d you lied. \u201cI...I just got lost in thought.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom gave you an odd  look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you can think while you're laying in bed. Please, sweetheart, you need to start keeping a schedule again. No more going to bed at 3:00 A.M in the moring. Do you think you'll be able to pull all nighters in college?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh...isn't that what a lot of students in college do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot the good ones\u201d replied Mom. \"It may be boring to go to bed at the same time every night, but at least you'll never have to worry about missing an important test because you overslept.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess you have a point\u201d you said, conceding to your mom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGoodnight Louise. See you at breakfast.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn off your bedroom light, just to make her happy, and eventually you decide that maybe she's right. Despite swapping teams and being in an entirely new body(And apparently a new reality), maybe you need to sleep on this. <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

You yawned and rolled out of bed like normal until you felt the unfamiliar weight and bouncing sensation coming from your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only took you a moment as you blinked looking down seeing the two mounds coming from your chest. Your eyes quickly widened as your rushed over to the mirror as you took your clothes off and saw your new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://orig00.deviantart.net/c9d9/f/2014/279/b/1/hajnalka_schwartz__hajnina__hajninaa_schwartz_by_hajninafanpage-d81swti.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://orig00.deviantart.net/c9d9/f/201...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god...\u201d Was all you could say. You had turned into a Busty Asian girl! You couldn\u2019t be more than 5\u20192 now as you noticed how short you now were. You were very skinny with a petite frame yet you had very large and perfectly rounded breasts. Your long dark hair cascading down your back like a water fall. Your nails were much longer and painted a bright pink along with your toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went back to your room and saw all your outfits had turned into very sexy and revealing clothes. Short shorts, Mimi skirts, tight dresses, low cut tops, push up bras, high heels etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what do you think?\u201d You heard a familiar voice saying as Rina appeared behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t what I had in mind! Did you do this?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRina laughed at that response. \u201cPlease....No YOU did this remember? I have no control over what body you will be given. This body is a reflection of your use of the fem note.\u201d Rina explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d You asked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have used the Fem note in various ways. Most recently you have used it to turn an innocent boy into an Asian girl and several boys in to very feminine women. This body is a reflection of those traits in you.\u201d Rina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you knew I would get a body like this?\u201d You asked a bit mad now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot exactly...but I could have guessed. Don\u2019t get mad...It\u2019s not like I would have told you anyway. I\u2019m not your enemy remember but I\u2019m also not your ally.\u201d Rina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh....what\u2019s wrong with me all of sudden?\u201d You asked feeling a bit strange. Your body felt odd and you started noticing odd new desires in your mind. Very feminine desires....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRemember in this reality you are Louise now. With that comes off all the perks and privileges of this new body. You will feel the way Louise would feel and know what should would want. That means all the feminine desires you experience as well.\u201d Rina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at yourself in the mirror you felt yourself staring more and more at your body. You felt...sexy.

There would have been an embarrassing thud, if Louise could physically interact with Rina. Instead, Louise saw the incomprehensible and quickly put it out of mind for the sake of her sanity. The droning \u201cUhhhhh\u201d escaping Louise\u2019s lips was the only remnant of this trauma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you have a question girly,\u201d Rina said with a tone of snark, growing impatient waiting for her meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh, what?

Barbershops were always kind of slow on a weekday, but this level of inactivity was downright disheartening. Herbie thought people may appreciate an old style barbershop in their neighborhood, maybe think of the good ol\u00e2\u0080\u0099 days when their barber was their greatest confidant. Instead, business was hoarded by the newfangled \u00e2\u0080\u009chair stylists\u00e2\u0080\u009d. In Herbie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mind, today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s youth valued a flashy haircut over a true haircut experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0In the midst of his self-pity, Herbert failed to properly greet his first customer of the day, a petite and busty Asian girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cUm, excuse me mister,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Louise interrupted, \u00e2\u0080\u009ccan you help me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Herbie finally noticed Louise\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presence, \u00e2\u0080\u009cEr, sorry girly. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not much with woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hair. If yer lookin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 for a cut, best find yourself a salon or somethin\u00e2\u0080\u0099.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fine,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Louise said stifling a giggle, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was just looking for somewhere to sit down.

Cause I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m apparently too old fashioned.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Herbie resumed his self-pity, further pushed by his new position as \u00e2\u0080\u009clounge attendant for young brats\u00e2\u0080\u009d, while Louise pulled out her notebook. Herbie heard a bit of rumbling and looked in the mirror to see what was making the noise. To Herbie, she just seemed to be scribbling in her diary or something, but the smile on her face was a bit unsettling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Herbie gave the girl a grace period, but he could only stand loiterers for so long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cHey, girly, how long ya going to just sit there?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cStylish, confidant, youthful, friendly.

Herbie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s whole body was burning up, and could feel odd popping all over. If Herbie could keep his eyes open, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d see all the changes going on around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Herbie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s barbershop began morphing and shifting. The bottles of aftershave were replaced with haircare products. Various cosmetics were popping up on the workstations. Reclining chairs in the back transformed into hairdryers. Herbie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s red leather seats shrunk, slimed, and turned white. Shiny black and white tiles replaced the wood flooring, and the wallpaper shited from green to pink. The mirrors stretched until they were full body. The large window facing the street, which acted as the store sign, changed as well. The sign no longer said \u00e2\u0080\u009cHerbie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Barbershop\u00e2\u0080\u009d in thick bold print but rather said \u00e2\u0080\u009cBarbie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Salon\u00e2\u0080\u009d in a light cursive font, and, to add insult to injury, the \u00e2\u0080\u009ci\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00e2\u0080\u009d were now tubes of lispstick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Herbie suffered a similar fate to that of his prized barbershop. Herbie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s broad shoulders and thick arms slimed and shortened. His legs did the same. Herbie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s thick barrel chest, which stretched his shirt to its limit, reformed into D sized breasts which stretched out his new top in a similar manner. Curves began to grow in all the right places. Nails and eyelashes stretched out and were coated in cosmetics. Pink nail polish and light eyeliner appeared to cover their respective sections. His lips plumped and were coated a bright red. Herbie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s thick black hair fell off his body, and only the hair on his head grew back, except the new hair was a bright blonde and curls extended down his back. The final changed to Herbie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s body was a slight retraction which resounded with a pop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The final shifts to occur were to Herbie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s outfit. His jean legs combined and shortened and formed a pink skirt. His wife beater shrunk and became a tight tank top. Herbie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sneakers morphed into to pink open toed heels. Hoop earrings materialized and dangled from Herbie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s earlobes. Random bracelets and other assorted accessories appeared to round out Herbie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s transformation.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cBarbie, are you feeling alright,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Louise said as the touched the newly minted woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shoulder.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, what?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Barbie said as she slowly pushed herself off the back of a chair. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, yes I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m fine sweetie.

You try to remind yourself that its just for a few hours and that you can deal with the embarrassment. You make your way to the living room, noting how cold the floor is on your bare feet.

You didn't recognize any of the titles but the bright colors and cutesy characters told you it was going to be a long night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo get off the floor, you plop down on the couch and become very aware of the dress.

You take a sip of the sugary drink realize that Bella is going to be bouncing off the walls from a sugar rush, but at least she will probably fall asleep after. You lick your lips and keep drinking and watch the movie with her. She occasionally looks over to talk about what just happened and you notice how the drink has stained her mouth red in a way that only kids know how to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe movie was pretty boring by your standards and you found yourself nodding off a few times. At one point you wake started after hearing a crash. You see that Bella isn't with you but the movie is still running. You get up and run in the direction of the sound which you think may have been the kitchen. Stepping in to the room you are relieved to see that Bella just broke a glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nods but doesn't say anything. It's clear she is upset and you've gathered by now that she is a very sensitive kid. Before the waterworks start you tell her its okay and that it was just an accident. You ask her to step out of the room and to get your shoes so you don't step on glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey aren't done yet,\u201d she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDone?\u201d you ask confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey are still in the wash,\u201d she tells you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course she put them in the wash with your clothes, you think in frustration. She says she will get you something else for the moment and runs off. Soon she comes back with a pair of smooth looking black shoes and hands them to you. You stair blankly at a pair of her mother's heels and begin to wonder if she is doing this on purpose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy dad doesn't have anymore shoes, just the pair he wears,\u201d she says sensing your concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith little choice, you figure you will just wear them until you clean up the mess and then take them off. You sit and slip both on your feet, feeling the heels arch your feet in an unfamiliar way. You also notice they both have a little strap with a tiny buckle which Bella leaps at the chance to help with. She buckles them both for you and you mince into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's not a hard job but it is annoying with the heels. You squat down, knees together and hover over the the mess as to not get juice on the dress or glass in your knees. Soon enough the mess is clean and the floor is safe to walk on barefoot. You head back to the living room and sit on the couch to take the shoes off. Unfortunately for you, your can't get your fingers to manipulate the tiny buckles. For the moment, you are stuck wearing heels until Bella can undo them for you.</span></div></div>",

If you had seen a girl that looked like you, you would have asked her out immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay Bella, you've had your fun,\u201d you say as you pull at the wig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wig, however, doesn't budge. You pull again and feel pain on your scalp as you attempt to remove the girly hair but it still won't come off. Giving up on that for now, you go looking for Bella to get the heels off and hopefully your clothes are dry enough to finally wear.</span></div></div>",

The two new articles of clothing changed how the dress sat on your body. The stuffed bra and the cincher filled it out and caused it to cling tightly to your upper body. This lifted the skirt up and outwards. It now ended two or three inches above your knees. Still cute and appropriate, but a bit more daring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared at yourself in the mirror, wondering how you got yourself into this situation. With your new \"breasts\" and figure, the last vestiges of your masculinity were gone. \"Finally, Brianna, just to make sure you don't go back on our deal...\" Bella approached you from behind, and touched something to the upper part of the back of the dress. You turned around to see her holding a bottle of quick-drying glue in her hands. \"This will make sure your pretty dress stays on all night, Brianna. Don't worry, I have the solvent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarlier, you would have been furious, but now you were just defeated. You put on your best girly smile and said, \"Thanks a lot, Bella! You're one of the nicest friends a girl could have! I wouldn't want my favorite dress to come loose!\" Bella smiled, and said, \"What else are you thankful for, Bri?\" She gestured to your new assets.

Her hand ever on the phone, you couldn't do anything but participate in her twisted game. With all the practice you'd had earlier in the evening, this hour of intensive focus went very smoothly. By the end of the hour, you were moving naturally in your new footwear, slightly swaying your hips, and talking in a soft and subservient voice that oozed pleasantness. Your vocabulary was also littered with ridiculous things teenage girls might say. Your jaw was starting to hurt from smiling so much, but Bella wouldn't have anything less than you acting like a \"nice, pretty girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then the phone rang. The caller ID showed Bella's parents. You sashayed over to the phone and put it on speakerphone at Bella's insistence. So as not to arouse suspicion, she let you talk in your normal voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Brian! This is Mrs. Reynolds. Is everything going okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, of course, Mrs. Reynolds! Bella is an absolute angel!\" you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful, wonderful. I just wanted to let you know that something has come up and we'll be out much later than anticipated, and probably won't return until tomorrow morning. Would you be able to stay and watch Bella overnight? I've already cleared it with your parents.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart skipped a beat. You gulped. Bella grinned mischievously at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded. \"Of course, Mrs. Reynolds. I'll see you tomorrow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you hung up the phone, Bella looked at you expectantly, and you instantly slipped back into the role of Brianna. \"O-M-G Bella, looks like we get to hang out for the rest of the night!\" You clapped your hands together with false excitement. Bella was happy too. \"I can't wait to stay up so late!\" she squealed. She ran over and hugged you. \"You're, like, the best babysitter ever, Brianna!\" You muttered, \"Yeah, I guess I am...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With Brianna hugging you, it was finally Jane's time to act. She had been at the back door for the last hour. She had watched everything Bella put you through. At first she didn't really believe your insane story, but after seeing you and also watching the continued psychological abuse from your young charge, she was determined to help you. The back door was unlocked--Bella's parents didn't think it needed to be locked with a babysitter present--so Jane's plan would work easily. She sneaked in through the kitchen, and burst into the living room, startling both of you. In the confusion, Bella dropped the phone! She and Jane scrambled for it, but the older girl easily overpowered Bella. Soon, Jane was holding the phone, and Bella had lost all her leveage! You were saved!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane said, \"When I came to the front door, I didn't believe 'Brianna' here was actually having fun. And then I watched what you were doing for the past hour! Shame on you, Bella!\" The young girl's eyes were starting to become clouded by tears. Genuine or not, soon Bella was bawling and blubbering. Through choked back tears and sniffles, she tried to explain how she was just playing a fun game, and it maybe went too far. You still stood there, not a hint of masculinity about you. Even you felt a pang of empathy for Bella. She was just a kid, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsure of what to do, Jane sent Bella to her room. Her wailing could be heard all the way up the stairs and into her bedroom before she shut the door. After she left, the two of you sat down to talk. You instinctively smoothed out your dress and crossed your legs. \"I have to admit, you definitely have the movements down! And you look very pretty!\" Jane was the first to speak, breaking the awkward tension with a bad joke. You smiled and blurted out \"Thanks!\" in the ridiculous voice you'd been practicing for the past hour, before coughing and saying, \"I, uhh... Yes. Thanks? Thank you for coming to help me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane just nodded. \"I have a change of clothes for you.\" Eagerly, you jumped off the couch and took the clothes. You tried to remove the dress ... only to remember that Bella had glued it shut. It was also too tight to just pull up over your head. With a sigh, you flopped back down on the couch with your legs spread out. \"I forgot that she glued the dress shut,\" you explained. \"I'm not sure where she put the solvent. It's probably in her bedroom.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella's wailing could still be heard upstairs. Jane asked, \"What do we do about her anyway? She seemed to take this pretty hard. Maybe she was just having fun and got carried away?\" You shrugged. \"Honestly, I just want to get out of these clothes,\" you complained. Jane smiled and said, \"Well, we can at least start by deleting the stuff on the phone.\" She started swiping through all the photos and texts, deleting them one by one. She laughed at a few where you had posed like a girl. \"You're really convincing, you know!\" You scowled at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane had thought of a plan about what to do with Bella. \"So, I know you won't like this idea, but what if you stay like this for tonight? Show Bella that you're a good sport, but we also clearly explain the limits of personal space and games like this? She seems really traumatized by this experience, and I'm sure she didn't mean for it to go this far.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour first instinct was to blurt out \"Absolutely not,\" but you decided against it. Bella did seem traumatized, and maybe she was just having fun. Were you just a poor sport?</span></div></div>",

You eventually decided that Bella just got carried away, and while she needed a clear lesson on personal space, she was ultimately just having fun. You stood up and smoothed out your dress. You returned your voice to that of Brianna, and said, \"Alright, let's go talk to her!\" Jane smiled and put a hand on your shoulder. \"That's the spirit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you went upstairs to Bella's room. It was completely silent now, so she must have stopped crying. Jane knocked softly on the door. \"Bella? It's Jane.\" There was no answer. \" ... And Briana,\" you said in your best girly voice. After a slight delay, you heard Bella roll off her bed and walk across the room to open up her door. Her face was red and puffy. She had clearly been crying a lot. You felt sorry for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we come in, Bella?\" you saked. She nodded, and the two of you entered. Jane took a seat on the computer chair, while you sat on the bed with Bella. Jane said, \"Bella, I think you should apologize to Brianna for what you put him--err, her through. You should ask permission before doing these kind of things.\" You nodded. \"I'm not mad at you any more Bella... but please, just ask next time.\" The girl muttered, \"If I asked, you wouldn't have done it.\" You nodded in agreement, but said, \"That's probably true, but now I'm here. And I'm willing to stay dressed up for tonight, provided you give me the solvent now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you said you planned to stay dressed up, Bella's eyes lit up. She hopped off the bed immediately and ran to her closet. She dug through it and pulled out a bottle of clear liquid. Placing it in your hands, she apologized. \"I'm sorry, I've always... I've always just wanted a big sister.\" You hugged her and said, \"Well you'll at least have one for tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took the solvent from Bella and handed it to Jane. A few minutes later, the glue was dissolved and the dress's zipper was working again! You had almost gotten used to the secure tightness of the dress, bra, and body shaper that you were encased in, and it felt weird to feel the fabric of the dress loosen. But soon, Jane zipped you back up, and it felt \"normal\" again. At the same time, you couldn't wait to get out of these clothes later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane said, \"I unfortunately have to leave. But I'm sure the two of you will have good fun! Bella, you can have your phone back in the morning.\" She handed the phone to you. Bella was clearly not happy, but she accepted Jane's decision. And then, Jane left! Once again, you were alone with Bella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sooo,\" you said in your cutesy voice, \"What should we do now?\"</span></div></div>",

You followed as quickly as you could in your dainty heels. Bella had already setting up the game when you arrived. You sat down on the ground next to the table, covering your bare legs with the skirt of your dress. Bella sat down across from you, and said, \"The goal of the game is to collect as many points as possible as you move around the board!\" You looked at the game box. It was some simple rolling dice and move game. There was very little, if any, strategy involved. Smiling, you said, \"Alright, let's play!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella defeated you quickly. She was halfway around the board with twice the number of points at the end. You lost handily. \"I'll go get us some drinks and snacks, and we can keep playing, Bri!\" You nodded to her, and re-read the rules of the game while Bella went to the kitchen. She brought back two sodas and some chips, and the game continued! After reading the rules again, you figured out that there was a trick to the game. You easily beat Bella in the second round.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe said, \"We should up the stakes. If I win, you have to do whatever I say. If you win, you can take off the outfit!\" That didn't sound fair, as you had no idea what Bella would ask you to do. \"What would you ask me to do, exactly?\" You eyed the girl suspiciously.

But do you want out of the outfit or not?\" You your eyes at her, jokingly. \"It's on!\" you exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelieve it or not, you were actually having fun.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You thought about Bella's point for a minute. You did like Jane, but if you looked like a girl, you definitely should act more like one. You put the thought of \"a boyfriend\" out of your head for the moment. The first step was to make more girl friends: that is, friends who are girls. You had Bella take a stunning picture of you, and then you sent a message to Jane: \"Hey, we should be besties and hang out some time! XO -Brianna\" Your manicured finger hesitated for a second over the send button, but finally, you hit it. It took under 30 seconds for the phone to ring. You answered it immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane was on the other end, practically screaming, \"Did she take the phone again?!\" You assured her that, no, it was definitely your decision to send the message. You even told this to her in your normal voice, to reassure her. Bella also jumped in the background, shouting, \"Hiii Janeee!\" Although Jane found the whole situation very weird, given the earlier debacle, she said that she was open to hanging out with Brianna at least once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the awkward phone call ended, you returned your focus to Bella. You said, \"Okay, now I'm ready to practice more acting like a girl!\" Bella clapped with delight and the two of you spent a few more hours practicing everything. She started with the way you send text messages. Soon enough, she had you talking like a teenage girl both verbally and in writing. Then, it was time for the big test: how to flirt with a boy over text.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella said, \"Just pick a celebrity you find attractive, and write a fake message to him!\" It was very difficult in the beginning. First, you had to actually pick someone you could objectively judge as an attractive male. You didn't think you were wired for liking men, but you followed Bella's advice to the letter. You did manage to finally compose some cute, flirty fake text messages to your chosen celebrity, but you felt kind of disgusted afterwards. Bella asked, \"What's wrong? You don't like creating the texts?\" You slowly shook your head no. \"Well, I'm sure you'll get used to it! You're doing great!\" That made you feel good, oddly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing to go over was more practice of body language. This came much more naturally to you, as you had been practicing it all night. Now that you were not under a threat, you excelled. You sort of felt like you were in a land of make-believe. No one was judging you, and no one was going to expose you. It just felt fun. Maybe also natural, but you weren't sure about that yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe practice continued late into the night. Eventually, it was time for bed. Bella said, \"My parents come back tomorrow. But you can keep the outfit. My mom has a lot of clothes, and she won't notice these go missing.\" She then ran upstairs, eventually coming back with super-casual pajamas that were clearly made with women in mind. They were blue short-shorts and a white tank top. If you wore them, you'd need to keep wearing the bra, panties, and waist cincher for them to fit properly. You also didn't have your own pajamas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella held them out to you, \"You have to sleep over! You might as well get the full experience, right?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You decided to go all the way, and just keep it up overnight. You took the outfit from Bella, and then went to a separate room to change. You shimmied out of the dress and shoes. The now-familiar tightness of the dress vanished when you removed it, but it was soon replaced by a similar tightness from the tank top and shorts. The shorts reached about 30 percent down to your thighs, and the tank top held you secure. With what you wore underneath, it looked like you had breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Bella saw you, she giggled and said, \"You look great!\" You shrugged, and tucked her into bed. You went to sleep yourself, very confused after such a strange day. You dreamed yourself as a woman, taken by an undefined man. You wore a beautiful dress, similar to the one Bella had trapped you in the day before. Except this time, the dress was long, a gown that swept the floor. You danced with the man, lost in his arms the whole night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, you woke up. You had set the alarm quite early so that you could avoid Bella's parents. You changed out of the pajamas, the underwear, and then finally back into your own clothes. They felt scratchy and itchy. But you knew that it was required. You squirreled the clothes away into a bag, and woke up Bella. She was visibly dismayed by your appearance, but didn't say anything about it. The morning proceeded normally, and eventually Bella's parents showed up. You accepted their payment and left, taking a new set of clothes and a very confused mindset with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next days were strange. You planned to hang out with Jane as Brianna, but otherwise you existed sort of in a limbo. You didn't feel at ease acting as yourself, nor as Brianna. You toyed with the idea of practicing your girly mannerisms by writing more fake flirty texts to celebrities, but also delving more into your normal hobbies. Hanging out with Jane was scheduled for the end of the week, but until then, you had free time.</span></div></div>",

It's just an interest meeting to recruit people for next year, so just defer the questions to Emma.\" Anna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And who is Emma?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll know.\" Anna replied. \"Let's go, I have to get to my date.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got into her car and drove to the meeting as she chattered on about how romantic her boyfriend was. You stopped at her school gates and you got out of the car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good luck, Anna.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" you said and walked into the school. You were walking through the lobby slowly and unsure, when a girl, approximately the same size as you with fiery red hair walked up to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Anna! You're almost late for the meeting!\" the girl who you surmised was Emma said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, I was just getting there.\" you said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go.\" Emma said.</span></div></div>",

You remembered that Anna had mentioned that due to budget cutbacks the boy's school across the street had their debate team merged with theirs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Anna.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi...\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go away, Frank.\" Emma said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why should I?

She must have Irish roots, because she has deep green eyes... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer feminine figure was defined quite well in the school uniform, especially seeing her chest through her blouse. Her legs were pretty shapely and looked attractive under the pantyhose. Now you know why Frank was attracted to your legs, if those pantyhose make Emma's look so attractive, it probably did wonders for yours. All this thought about her attractiveness was causing some problems in the groin area, as you feel yourself getting aroused by Emma. You try to shift to ensure that nothing, unbecoming of a lady happens down there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You alright there?\" Emma asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, just getting a little wedgie.\" you said, blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then...\" Emma said, returning her attention to the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet's see how we're holding up down there...</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately, not enough girls tried out, and you were made an understudy for the lead female role. The director assured you that it was just a formality, and would get you your credit for being in the play, all you had to do was learn the lines. You figured it was going to be painless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow wrong you were. The lead actress, Katherine, got sick with the flu, the week right before the play was scheduled to open. You knew the lines, sure, but you can't go dressed as a girl in front of the entire school. Which is what you were attempting to explain to the director, Ms. Hanson. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, Ross, I am in a bind. We need someone who can act, and knows the lines. No one can do either of those things as well as you. Well, Katherine can, but you know why that won't work.\" Ms. Hanson said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't there any other way? I'll never live it down! I still have a year left at this school!\" you shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry.

Your parents called someone to drain the water, however many houses were affected and your house is at the bottom of the waiting list. For now, all your parents could do was offer the family couch for the time being, they even offered some of the nice sheets from their bed to make it easier. You are disgruntled, but not ungrateful to the gesture and accept the offer hoping you can return to your own room soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, sleeping on the couch proved far more taxing on you then you could have imagined. The couch was old and hard to sleep on, since no really complained about it they hadn't bothered to replace it. What was worse was that every slight noise would stir you awake and the night would to go on forever until morning, leaving you with little to no sleep at all. As the nights went on, your grumpiness from the lack of sleep turned to relaxed and slow disinterest, with you just wanting it to end.

'A shot?! I hate needles!'  You thought as you passed through the doors. 'How am I going to get out of this one?' You thought as they approached the receptionist and suddenly had an idea. \"You know Steven, I think I could go without the shot today, I'm feeling pretty good today.\" You said trying to talk yourself out of the situation, but Steven wasn't having it. \"In that case, we better see her and tell her the good news!\" He smiled proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of desperation, the thief tried to slow his walking to a full stop, but both because of his ankle and Steven firmly leading him, they reached the desk. \"Oh hello Agnes! You're hair looks so nice today!\" The girl who's name tag said \"Amanda\" and was only about five years older than you smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thief subconsciously smiled back at her and replied \"Thank you very much.\" in his grandma voice. She gave Steven a list of names, and signed his name by Agnes's, then guided the thief to the waiting room and sat him down. As they sat, the thief suddenly had another idea. 'The bathroom! I bet they have a window I could crawl through!' You then told Steven that you needed to go to the restroom and was helped up and guided to it, thankfully Steven chose to stand outside and wait for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside, the thief saw his exit, which was much higher than he expected, but you were determined to get out. You walked over to the wall just below the window, and couldn't reach it on your tip toes, even when you jumped for it you didn't even make it half way. 'Damn my body for being so small!' Just when he was about to grab the trash can, stack it on top of the sinks counter top and clim out to freedom, the door opened. \"Oh good your finished, time to go see the doctor!\" Steven held the door open for you and you limped out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I don't even know what the shot is for, other than for an old lady! Which I am most defiantly not! I'm a nineteen year old guy! But they don't know that.' You were lead into a room and was helped up into a medica table. He hoped for Steven to leave, but he stood by him as they waited for the doctor to enter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, a female doctor with the name \"Dr.Patton\" stitched into her coat and looked about fifty entered with both medical charts and shot in hand. \"Hello Agnes, how are we feeling today?\" She asked as she placed the shot by the thief and put on gloves. \"I feel perfectly healthy! As I told Steven earlier when we walked in, I don't think I even need the shot today.\" He tried one last time, but the doctor just chuckled and grabbed a alcohol wipe and started cleaning the suits arm, prepping it for the needle. \"Oh we couldn't have that, especially if the treatment is working!\" The thief slumped in defeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr.Patton instructed you to take a deep breath and to be ready for the bee sting, but it never came. Thankfully, she stuck the suits thick foam, injecting the suit with whatever drug was meant for 'Agnes' instead of you. She quickly put a bandage onto the spot. \"Alright, we're good to go! Anything else you need before I let you go?\" Dr.Patton asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thief thought about his ankle. Should you tell her about it and get it fixed so you can be faster when you escape? Or let it fix it self, it's just a twisted ankle after all. Plus it helps with the disguise right?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Valerie was the love of your life, and when you two married you believed that you would be together forever. And then, suddenly, in a blink of an eye she was taken away from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThank goodness for the support of friends and family to get you through this. Without their help you don't know what you would have done. They managed to get you out of your funk and convince you to move on with your life. That's what gave you the idea to move to another city. This way you and Susan could make a fresh start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan...You sigh to yourself. It was terrible losing your wife, but you can only imagine what your daughter must be going through. Losing your mother at such a young tender age, it was truly heartbreaking. Not having that bond that all young girls have with their mother...it is truly a shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only thing you can do for her is to let her know that you will always be there for her and that you will never go away. You hope that Susan can try to move forward like you are trying to. The move was a bit hard for her but she will be starting a new school in the fall and hopefully soon this will feel like home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan is truly your world at this point. You would do anything for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn off the last light in the apartment, but not before reading the framed wedding announcement you kept of you and Valerie's wedding. \"We invite you to the wedding of David and Valerie Leeves\".

You walked down the runway, looking at the judge's table, and scanning the audience to see if anyone was looking at you with anything other than spectating eyes. Your gaze came across Cain, who was not, as you feel he should be, wondering where you were, he was instead cheering and whooping as you walked down the runway. You couldn't hear him, over the music and the distance, but you knew he was cheering your name... or Elizabeth's name, rather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got to the end of the runway and stopped to pose, smiling at the judge's table and stood in place.

Yuck. Once you finished, you took a bow... actually, you curtsied, because of the way the skirt of the dress settled around your waist, and you walked back offstage, putting the balls down and exhaling out a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was pretty good, girl!\" one of the other girls, you think her name is Sally or something, exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even so, I'm still a shoe-in.\" another girl laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl after you walked backstage to more applause.

Be ready to go out in five minutes!\" the woman shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't believe it. The other two girls went over to the dress rack and you idly followed them, still dazed by your performance actually winning. You looked over the dresses, still confused, but resigned to your fate. There's no way that woman was letting you vanish now. She was keeping a close eye on you three.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on!

Being able to fly, feel the wind rush in your hair, it would be really fun I think. And it would make life easier. Why give someone a lift when you can literally lift them and take them where they need to go?\" you asked. \"Plus you get to wear a fun costume!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe judge nodded and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you think you should win this pageant, Elizabeth?\" the third judge asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hesitated for a moment, but after thinking, the words just poured out of your mouth,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't think I should win. I'm not the most qualified, and I've never done this before.\" you said. \"The other girls are much more qualified and probably want the crown more than I ever will. Trust me, Sally and Jessica have probably been trying for years. I'd rather one of them win than me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very astute and extremely modest, Elizabeth.\" the judge said. \"That will be all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked over to your place next to Sally and posed, hoping that all this will soon be over, once one of them is crowned. After Jessica finished, the pageant was nearly done and the host walked up to the microphone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've seen a lot of smart young women today, but only one of them can take the crown and sash.\" the host said. \"Now...\"</span></div></div>",

When you got closer, he held it out, a pink sundress with a flowing skirt that would probably go down to your thigh. Your shock must have registered with Cain because...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I figured you might need something to wear over your bikini... or whatever other bathing suit you might wear tomorrow.\" Cain said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... that was... very thoughtful of you.\" you said.

It fit perfectly... say what you want about Cain, he paid attention to sizes... you nearly gagged when you realized that he probably got it right because he was staring at you all day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stepped out of the fitting room and Cain was standing nearby, smiling when he saw you exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How bout you do some of those moves you did up on stage?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laughed and shook your head, but decided to humor him. You started walking towards him, only to turn around, like you had done at the end of the catwalk, when you got near Cain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut instead, you lost your footing, the store's floor being carpeted in that area, and one of your heels having gotten stuck. You almost fell to the ground, but Cain grabbed you in the nick of time, saving your head from smashing onto the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up into Cain's eyes as he lifted you back up and helped you regain your footing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you should get some lower shoes while we're here.\" Cain remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I should.\" you responded. It was a good idea, maybe get some flat sandals, since these heels have been murder all day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But the dress looks great.\" Cain said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" you replied, blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked back into the fitting room to change back into your other dress and came back out carrying the sundress.

At first, the slide was tame, a short drop, a right turn... and then it got crazy.

I mean, she's still going but... this is a long kiss...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the ride attendant cleared his throat and broke up the kiss, and Cain and Elizabeth walked off the ride, with Lizzie seeming almost dazed by the experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never thought my kissing was THAT good...\" Cain giggled to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walked off from the ride, hand in hand, Cain led you over to a bench, where you sat down next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay?\" he asked, holding your hand and caressing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" you said. \"That drop was a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" Cain looked into your eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen...</span></div></div>",

What happened to you yesterday? You went to the bathroom and then you vanished!\" Cain started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I uh... got sidetracked and decided to go home. How was the pageant?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good uh... I met a girl. She was beautiful, I think she goes to school here, I dropped her off by the dorms last night.\" Cain replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did things go well?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. We hit it off last night, spent the day at Splash City together and made out, went back to my place, but after we finished she seemed fine, then she just got up and ran out.\" Cain said. \"I have no idea why.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it was too overwhelming for her.\" you suggested. \"After all you just met yesterday. Just give her some space.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the thing, I don't know where she lives, I don't have her number...\" Cain sighed. \"But she was perfect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet she knows how to find you when she's ready.\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you're right...\" Cain said. \"Mind if I come over and hang out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" you looked around the room with the strewn feminine items, down at your still artificially lengthened nails, into a mirror at your made up face. \"Can you give me like an hour? There's something that I have to do first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No prob. See ya soon.\" Cain said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hung up the phone and regained your composure. The first step was removing the wig, then the outfit you were wearing, the mix of lingerie and dress. Then you went over to the bag of makeup and found some makeup remover that you used to remove all the makeup on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodbye, Elizabeth.\" you said as you changed back into your regular clothes and tossed all of Elizabeth's stuff into a bag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shoved the bag into the back of a drawer and grabbed your gloves again, before making a quick trip out to a drugstore to get some nail polish remover. Once you got back, you were able to use the nail polish remover to loosen the nails, restoring your hands to their former, unmanicured form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nails went into the bag and it went back into the drawer, as you scraped all evidence of Elizabeth Pemberton from your dorm room before Cain showed up and you sat down and waited to see your friend.</span></div></div>",

Here he was, a 19 year old guy living with his 43 year old girlfriend. The age difference didn't bother either of them. She was tall blonde and beautiful and he was a slim, short good looking long haired rocker. He had been the guitarist of a Bon Jovi cover band which has since broke up. In fact it's where he had met Ashley when she came to one of his shows. They were both big Bon Jovi fans.<br>\r\nFor eight months they spent all their time together. But Ashley who was a divorced woman wanted a better paying job. The job she had now had no advancement opportunities. So, her sister lined up a job for her at a top named ad agency in California, where she lived.  Ashley jumped at the chance at a new start in a new state but she desperately wanted Sam to come with her.<br>\r\nSam's only job was the little paying gigs his band got, and he flipped burgers at Burger King. So he jumped at the chance to be with Ashley.<br>\r\nThey left Arizona in March and here they were 2 months later in California.<br>\r\nAshly enjoyed her job and liked everyone there, but she remained very quiet at the office and didn't reveal much about her life. They only knew that she was divorced. She didn't say anything about living with her 19 year old boyfriend for fear of looks she would get and she didn't want people talking behind her back.  She was hoping that would change today at her company picnic where everyone would meet Sam.<br>\r\nAshley opened her eyes and saw Sam staring at her. \"morning.\" She smiled and then wrapped her arms around Sam.<br>\r\nShe completely covered his body with hers. She was 6' 1\" and Sam was only 5' 9\"<br>\r\n\"Morning beautiful.\" He replied looking up at her as her long hair fell into his face. She put her hand through it and pushed it back.<br>\r\n\"Sorry\". she replied.<br>\r\nSam just smiled. \"Are you ready for today?\"<br>\r\nAshley bit her lower lip. \"I'm still so nervous, but I want everyone to meet you so I can finally talk about you.\" She kissed him and continued. \"Maybe put some pictures on my desk of you\" She kissed him again. \"Maybe come and take my to lunch some days\" <br>\r\n\"I'd like that, and who cares what people think. I'm in love with you and I want to be with you forever. Age is only a number.\" Sam explained.<br>\r\n\"I know, it's all in my head, and everything is going to be great\" She replied then looked at the clock on the nightstand. \"You better get in the shower. This thing starts at noon.\"<br>\r\nSam got out of bed. Ashley watched him as he made his way to the shower. He closed the door and then the door opened up again and Sam stuck his finger out and pointed at her to come in with him. <br>\r\nAshley laughed and then made her way into the shower.<br>\r\nThey fooled around a little in the shower but knew they had no time to really get into anything. Sam was the first to exit the shower and to go back into the bedroom to get dressed.<br>\r\nAshley took a little longer but when she exited the bathroom, she saw Sam was already dressed.<br>\r\n\"Um, babe? Are you going to wear that?\" She asked.<br>\r\nSam had on...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ashley looked at Sam with her mouth open. Sam had his hair blown out and frizzy. It was really long and reached the middle of his back. He wore 2 diamond earrings. He wore his sunglasses.  He had a Bon Jovi concert tshirt on. It was a half cut shirt that revealed his flat hairless stomach. He had white shorts on that showed his short hairless legs.<br>\r\nAshley didn't want Sam dressed like a kid at her picnic. She at least hoped he wouldn't try and glam himself out like he was getting ready to preform in his band.<br>\r\n\"Sam, can we tone it down a little for the picnic?\" Ashley nervously asked.<br>\r\n\"It's cool Ash, I was thinking..I could bring the guitar and maybe I could play a little for some people while we were waiting for bugers to cook and stuff. You know, maybe someone there would like what they hear and want to hire me.\" Sam explained.<br>\r\n\"Honey, I do love you but we definitely can't have our first outting together at my company picnic with you looking, uhh...looking, this rocking.\" Ashley tried to watch her words and not hurt Sam's feelings. \"Can I just try something when I'm done getting ready?\" She asked nicely.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess so\", Sam replied.<br>\r\n\"Ok, I'll be finished in a litle while then when I get things set up, I'll call you in the bathroom, ok? <br>\r\nSam waited in the tv room. He sat next to the ashtray and lit a cigarette while he put his feet up and watched MTV until Ashley finished 6 cigarettes and 45 minutes later she was finally done.<br>\r\nShe finally called Sam into the bathroom.<br>\r\nHe walked in and saw Ashley dressed in a blue breezy sundress. It looked beautiful on her. Her face and hair looks as gorgeous as always.<br>\r\n\"Wow! You look great!\" He said.<br>\r\n\"Well thank you. Now it's your turn.\" She replied.<br>\r\nShe had Sam sit on the toilet seat. He sat down and noticed some stuff lined up on the bathroom counter.<br>\r\n\"What are we doing?\" He asked.<br>\r\nAshley smiled and turned toward him holding something that was plugged in.<br>\r\n\"Well, I was going to flat iron your hair a little. It takes the frizz out and makes your hair look more relaxed and  you could do more with it. I promise you'll like it.\" She explained.<br>\r\nSam looked disappointed. \"I\"ll like it, or YOU'LL like it.\" <br>\r\nAshley kneeled down to get to Sam's height. Even while he was sitting she still came up taller than him. \"Aww, honey. I just want to make a good impression. This is the first time my work people meeting you, and I just want everything to go perfect.\"<br>\r\nSam looked at Ashley and knew this was important to her. He knew their age difference showed in certain situations and there were times he had act and dress a little more mature. Like meeting Ashley's sister Debra  for the first time.  Debra was very hard to impress. He really tried and dressed nice but Ashley never really took to him. He knew he had to try again today with her work people. He gave in. <br>\r\n\"Ok babe, do what you gotta do.\"<br>\r\nAshley smiled, \"Thank you  honey, this means a lot to me.\" She started right away sectioning off Sam's hair, she worked at it for awhile until everything was perfect. She approached him with the flat iron and did the first section in the front. <br>\r\nSam grabbed at his danggling hair and couldn't believe how flat and straight it was.  \"Are you sure about this Ash?\"<br>\r\n\"Positive, I promise it will grow on you.\" SHe replied.<br>\r\nSection by section Sam felt her run the flat iron through his hair until after about 30 minutes she announced that she was finished.<br>\r\nSam stood up and looked in the mirror. In the first time since his hair has been so long, he had long straight hair. His hair reached his mid back before but wit the less frizz it looked even longer. He thought it gave him an androgynous look.<br>\r\n\"Babe, I look like a chick.\" He said finally removing his sunglasses.<br>\r\nAshley looked at his face and saw that he had black eyeliner on. \"OH man Sam!! Well, with the eyeliner on you do. What were you thinking? This isn't one of your gigs. This is important to me.\"<br>\r\nShe looked at the time.\"We're going to be late now, so lets just get moving, but we gotta talk about this later.\"<br>\r\nAshley cleaned up the bathroom a little and grabbed the apartment key and her car keys. She told Sam not to forget his cigarettes.<br>\r\nSam grabbed them but realized that he had no pockets in his white shorts.<br>\r\n\"Here just throw them in my purse, and lets go.\" she replied.<br>\r\nTHey headed out to the car and drove off in Ashley's Ford Focus. <br>\r\nThe ride was silent. Ashley was really pissed that Sam was dressed the way he was. <br>\r\nSam knew that Ashley was upset but was more worried about his hair and what she did to it.<br>\r\nFinally after about a 30 minute ride, Ashley pulled into a large park. There were balloons and signs that lined the entrance to the park. Her company had rented out the whole park for their picnic. She drove to the nearest parking lot and got out.<br>\r\n\"Babe?\" Sam said as Ashley started walking away from him.<br>\r\n\"Can I have my cigarettes being you won't let me smoke in the car?\"<br>\r\nAshley threw the purse at him and said, \"I have to check us in, I'll be waiting by the bbq area\" As she walked away.<br>\r\nSam knew he screwed up but throught that he was going to make everything perfect. <br>\r\nHe leaned on the hood of the car and unzipped Ashley's purse. He dug for his cigarettes, found them and took one out of the pack and put it up to his lips. His long hair kept getting in the way of his face, so he put his hair behind his ear. He continued to dig through the purse but couldn't find the lighter.<br>\r\nSuddenly a lighter sparked and a hand leaned it forward towards Sam's cigarette and lit it for him.<br>\r\nSam inhaled smoke and immediately began to cough.<br>\r\nHe turned and saw a tall muscular man. He extended his hand and said, \"I'm Patrick Stevens. I'm the owner of Images advertising.\"<br>\r\nSam still coughing said his name, S-Samm.\" He put Ashley's purse down on the car hood and shook Mr. Steven's hand. He couldn't believe how tall and big this man was next to him. He looked so little  and thin.<br>\r\n\"Who are you here with?\" He continued.<br>\r\nSam finally controlling his cough, couldn't raise his voice so he spoke in almost a whisper. \"Oh I'm sorry, I'm here with Ashley. She wanted everyone to finally meet me.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh that's great, well we are glad to finally meet some of Ashley's family. I know everyone is meeting over by the bbq area. I'm going to make a quick speech and then there's all kinds of things for the kids to do and I'm sure there's some other girls here your age.I'll see you over there.\" and then Patrick walked away.<br>\r\nSame continued to smoke his cigarette recapping the conversation he just had over again in his head. He thought about it and said, \"other girls my age?\"<br>\r\nMeanwhile Patrick made his way to the bbq area. Everyone clapped as he waved to everyone. He was a popular boss. He was very down to earth with his employees. He was generous, always having a theme for work like Ice Cream Day, or Pretzel day. Everyone like him so they greeted him with a warm welcome.<br>\r\nHe walked around and shook people's hands, made a little small talk. Then he came to Ashley.<br>\r\n\"Ahh Ashley, I'm so glad you came, and I just met your lovely daughter Samantha by the car.\"<br>\r\nAshley stood and looked at him with her mouth in shockand said...</span></div></div>",

She didn't have a lighter so I helped her.....\" Continued Mr Stevens as he imitated the smoking charade. <br>\r\n\"Oh smoking? Oh I know, her friends started smoking and so she did. But what am I going to do, if I make her stop, I know she'll just sneak around and do it.\" Ashley continued. She thought in her head a way out of this. But how could she. That would be too embarrassing for her and for her new boss who had just mistaken her boyfriend for a teenage girl. Sure, the way Sam was dressed today didn't help and both Ashley and Mr Stevens were the same height and they towered over Sam. It did look like Sam was a young girl.<br>\r\n\"Oh good you know. I didn't want to narc her out and be the one that tells mom, that her daughter is smoking. We have an excellent dental plan though. If she sets up continuous cleaning appointments, those teeth will stay beautiful and white. How old is she, 17?\" Continued Mr. Stevens. <br>\r\nAgain Ashley heard the conversation but wasn't really a part of it because she was trying to figure out what she was going to do. She nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n\"Wow 17 years old. Did she graduated this year? Is she working?\" He continued.<br>\r\nBehind Mr Stevens Ashley spotted Sam walking from the car across the long field towards them. He did resemble a young girl, especially with her purse clutched in his hand. She had to end this conversation.<br>\r\n\"Yes, she is graduated, but hasn't found a job yet. What time does the food go on, I am so hungry.\" Ashley hurried through her answer.<br>\r\nMr Stevens looked at his watch and realized the time. \"You're right, we gotta get this party started. I would like to continue this conversation a little later if you don't mind.\" He said as he backed away and then turned and walked over to a group of supervisors.<br>\r\nOne woman, handed him a microphone which was connected to a karaoke machine that had a large speaker. \"Check, check!\" He spoke into the microphone. Can everyone hear me?\" he begain. <br>\r\nEveryone in the crowd clapped.<br>\r\n\"Welcome everyone to the company picnic!\" He continued as Ashley drowned him out and walked the other way towards Sam.<br>\r\nAs she came upon Sam, he held out her purse for her.<br>\r\n\"Hang on to it for me hon, please\", she said excitedly as she clenched her stomach. \"I think I'm going to be sick.\" She continued.<br>\r\nSams face grew with concern. \"You ok, Ash? Here, lets sit.\" They were next to a picnic table in the back of the crowd and Sam guided her to sit. \"What happened?\" He asked.<br>\r\nAshley started to panic. She couldn't come out and tell her boyfriend what had just transpired and how now everyone thought he was her daughter. So again, she lied, \"I'm just not feeling that well, we might have to go.\" <br>\r\n\"Aww babe, I'm sorry. Do you want me to get you something to drink? Maybe I could find a ginger ale?\" Sam looked around.<br>\r\nShe had to get Sam to sit and stay out of sight but Sam was already walking over to the line of coolers that were set up. He started going through them to find a ginger ale.<br>\r\nAshley watched as Sam looked through the coolers and then noticed a young man with short buzzed hair walk over to Sam. <br>\r\nShe again started to panic.<br>\r\nMeanwhile over by the coolers. <br>\r\n\"Hi!\", said the young man.<br>\r\nSam turned around and said \"Hi!\"<br>\r\nThe boy continued. \"We're starting up a volleyball game before the food goes on, if you're interested.\" The boy spoke as he watched Sam continue going through the can filled coolers. Finally finding a ginger ale.<br>\r\n\"I love volleyball, sure.\", Sam replied.<br>\r\n\"Great! Come over to the field when you're ready.\" The boy said as he walked away.<br>\r\nSam approached Ashley with the ginger ale and opened it for her. <br>\r\n\"Honey, I really think we should just go.\", she immideately said.<br>\r\nSam gave her the can. \"Well try the ginger ale first and see if it settles your stomach a little\"<br>\r\nAshley thought, \"the only thing that is going to settle my stomach is to get the hell out of her\" She sipped the can and turned and looked around. <br>\r\nShe saw Mr. Stevens finishing up his speech and everyone was clapping. Her head was in a cloud. Mr. Stevens again approached the group of supervisors and their familes.<br>\r\nSam broke the silence, \"Some guy asked if I wanted to play volleyball. I said yes, but I won't if we're going to go.\" Sam removed his sunglases and sat them on the picnic table.<br>\r\n\"Oh, honey I don't think that's a very good idea.\" She tried to stay low so that people didn't notice them too much. She also was trying to keep an eye on where Mr Stevens was so that he didn't see her. She had to keep her boss from talking to Sam again.<br>\r\nShe spotted her boss still witht he group of supervisors but having a personal conversation with one of the female supervisors. While he spoke, he looked around the crowd like he was looking for someone. Finally he spotted Ashley and Sam and pointed them out to the supervisor woman that he was speaking to. <br>\r\n\"This doesn't look good.\" Ashley mumbled.<br>\r\n\"What's that babe?\" Sam replied.<br>\r\nShe thought quickly, \"Well, if you're going to play volleyball you should put your hair up.\" She stood up and dug through her purse. She spotted a purple hair scrunchie and a brush. She started brushing Sam's hair and pulling it all back into a ponytail. <br>\r\nShe looked up through her glasses and spotted her boss and the other woman watching what she was doing and obviously still talking about her.<br>\r\nAshley ended up putting Sam's hair into a high ponytail, just like a girl would wear it. His dark blonde hair still reached his shoulders.<br>\r\n\"There that should be more managable as you play.\" She thought.<br>\r\nShe looked down and saw his sunglasses on the table, she knocked them with her purse onto the grass just by her feet and then stepped on them. They both heard the crunch.<br>\r\n\"Aww, Ash, my glasses! Shit!\" Said an upset Sam.<br>\r\n\"Honey, I'm sorry, I didn't see them. Oh but why don't you wear mine?\" She took off her purple rimmed women's sunglasses and put them over Sam's eyes before he could answer. \"There, those look good.\"<br>\r\n\"I promise, I'll buy you a new pair the next time we're at the mall.\" continued Ashley. She looked around and saw no one looking at them anymore and quickly fished in her purse for her lipstick tube.<br>\r\nShe popped the top of the lipstick tube and brought up the pink frosted lipstick. Even though she had lipstick on, she put more on her lips and then she pursed her lips together to make sure they were both covered. She again surveyed the area and saw no one looking their way. She leaned down and pressed her lips against Sam's lips, for a good 30 second smack.<br>\r\nShe pulled away, \"I love you honey!\"<br>\r\nSam looked up at her having just enjoyed a quick kiss. \"I guess that means I'm out of the dog house now?\" <br>\r\nAshley saw that her kiss left Sam's lips with a slight coating from the lipstick. It in fact looked like his lips were just applied with the same lipstick. She ran a tissue around his mouth to wipe away any stray lipstick until his lips looked good.<br>\r\nShe stood back and looked at Sam. <br>\r\nThere before her stood what looked like a teenage girl.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sam stood up and Ashley could see her handywork. It could definitely work, until he started talking to people. Again, she thought quickly. She reached into her purse and grabbed a piece of bubble gum that she had. <br>\r\nShe opened a piece and handed it to Sam.<br>\r\n\"What's this for?\" He asked as he took the gum.<br>\r\n\"Your breath is pretty bad honey, here maybe you need a couple.\" She opened two more pieces. <br>\r\nSam put the gum into his mouth and started chewing. With 3 big pieces of bubblegum in his mouth it was hard to bite down on, but even better for this masquerade, it was harder for Sam to talk.<br>\r\n\"Thanks babe.\" mumbled Sam through the gum.<br>\r\nShe just about closed her purse when she spotted something else. She quickly thought, could she get away with this? Has she already gone too far with this? She had to try.<br>\r\nShe took out some of her Christian Dior perfume and wrapped her arms around Sam and as she hugged him, she sprayed his back twice with the purfume and then dropped the purfume back into her purse.<br>\r\nSam jerked quickly as he felt the spray on his neck. \"Aw, babe, I think *Sniff* *sniff* Yeah, I think your purfume just exploded on my back.\"<br>\r\nAshley pulled away and watched as Sam tugged at the collar of his t shirt and smelled of Chrisitan Dior perfume. Her boyfriend now looked, sounded and actually smelled just like a normal teenage girl. This is good she thought.<br>\r\n\"Oh honey, I'm sorry. Well as you move around playing volleyball, the smell will disappear.\" Ashley explained. \"It looks like they're getting ready to start, why don't you go.\" Ashley saw Mr. Stevens once again approaching her.<br>\r\n\"Are you feeling better? Cause you definitely look better.\" Sam asked as he backed away.<br>\r\n\"I'm good now, go play. I smell the food being cooked so I'll grab you something in a little bit\" replied Ashley<br>\r\nSam turned one last time and said, \"I love you\" Just as Mr Stevens arrived at Ashley's table. So she replied very loudly, \"I love you too sweety, now go play!\"<br>\r\nThey both watched as Sam ran towards the field for the volleyball net. His ponytail moved from side to side as he ran and the smell of his purfume was still lingering.<br>\r\n\"She looks like she's having a blast!\" Mr Stevens observed at what looked like a mother telling her daughter to go play with the other kids.<br>\r\n\"Oh, she loves her sports, like I said, it's the tomboy in her.\"explained Ashley. \"But don't get me wrong, she does clean up nicely and can really be a girly girl too.\" Ashley thought in her head, \"why did I say that? Just stop talking about her....I mean him!\"<br>\r\n\"That's nice, it's really nice to finally see a part of you that we didn't know existed. You've been such a wonderful new hire and in just your first 2 months at the company you landed the \"Dazzle Me\" ad campain that we've been working on getting for almost a year now. I don't like to bring work up at a recreational function like this but I just didn't want to wait until Monday. We want you to head the \"Dazzle Me\" campaign. You're in charge, it's your baby.\" Explained Mr Stevens.<br>\r\nAshley's eyes lit up. \"Oh my gosh, Mr. Stevens. Thank you so much. That's amazing! I will not let you down.\" <br>\r\n\"Please, call me Patrick.\" continued Mr Stevens. \"We already told the Dazzle Me representitives that we put you in charge and they are very pleased with that decision. I don't know what you did, but Melissa Avery really likes you and can't wait to work with you.\" Mr Stevens continued to talk as Ashley noticed the volleyball game behind her boss.<br>\r\nShe saw the teams consisted of mostly guys and only 2 girls, one of which was Sam. It seemed like the guys were playing fast and rough and a lot of spiking. Almost like they were trying to impress the \"girls\" <br>\r\nShe watched as Sam was also shorter than the other guys. As Sam tried to put the volleyball over the net, one of the guys on the other team jumped up and slammed the ball back down at Sam making him fall to the ground.<br>\r\nOne of Sam's teammates extended his hand and helped Sam off the ground, he put his hand to Sam's back and wiped off the grass that was on the back of his shirt. Sam high fived him and the other guy held onto his hand. Sam took that as he was tryiing to lock fists and shake but it looked really different from an outsiders point of view.<br>\r\nMr Stevens finished up and said, \"Is that ok? Cause I don't want to go forward with anything, if you're not completely positive about it and see the vision that me and the other supervisors see.\"<br>\r\nAshley agreed and nodded. She hadn't listened to the whole conversation for fear that Sam had broken the disguise and maybe mentioned her as his girlfriend. But by the look of how the other guys were treating Sam, she believed that this plan was working. <br>\r\nShe would be happy when this picnic was over and her and Sam could get out of there and never have to worry about this nightmare of a lie that she had created.<br>\r\n\"I agree and I'm ready to take on this project the way you see fit.\" replied Ashley.<br>\r\nMr Stevens smiled and said, \"That is amazing! We will get the paperwork set up, and have a contract set up Monday, then we can go forward with everything. I'm so glad you're on board with everything. We're so excited to be able to work with you both. I'm going to put my apron on now and start grilling. See you in a bit Ashely.\" said Mr Stevens and then he walked away.<br>\r\nThis was going to be amazing, Ashley thought. I'm in charge of the Dazzle Me ad. <br>\r\nI can't wait to tell Sam. She looked over as the game had somewhat ended. The guys were just sort of kicking the balll around while Sam and the other girl stood next to two other boys. The boys were tall and looked slightly older than Sam and the other girl. Sam was totally playing off the part of the girl without anyone even knowing, including himself. She watched as he blew a bubble with the bubble gum and one of the other guys pop it in his face. He was being flirted with.<br>\r\nShe said quietly, \"I better go save him.\"<br>\r\nShe walked over to the group of kids and motioned to Sam as she got closer to come over to her.<br>\r\nSam said, \"gotta run\" and ran towards Ashley.<br>\r\nWhen he got closer he said \"I could really use a cigarette.\" as he removed her sunglasses and put them on top of his hair.<br>\r\nAshley handed him her purse, as he unzipped it and took out his pack. He opened it, took out a cigarette and put it between his lips. He handed the purse back to Ashley.<br>\r\n\"I forgot I didn't have a lighter as he removed the cigarette from his mouth, he looked at the tip and noticed a lipstick ring around it.<br>\r\n\"Oh shit, you should have told me I had some of your lipstick on from that kiss earlier.\" he discovered.<br>\r\nAshley quickly replied. \"well, you ran off so fast, I didn't even notice. <br>\r\nAshley handed him a tissue as he wiped all the lipstick from his lips. <br>\r\n\"Let grab some food, I'm starving\" Said Sam as he put the glasses back over his eyes and walked next to Ashley over to the bbq area.<br>\r\nThey grabbed paper plates and walked over to the grills where the grillers were making hot dogs and hamburgers and chicken.<br>\r\nThe woman grilling asked the two what they would like. <br>\r\nAshley ordered for them, \"I'll have a hot dog\" The woman put a hot dog into a bun and then on Ashley's plate. \"This one will have a 2 hot dogs, a cheese burger, and 2 chicken legs.\" <br>\r\nThe woman's started to bulge out. \"Wow, how do you keep such a slender figure?\"<br>\r\nSam just made a weird look as the woman loaded his plate up. They grabbed some other stuff, and some drinks and made their way back to the picnic table and began to eat.<br>\r\nMr Stevens got over the speaker again and announced.</span></div></div>",

Sam didn't finish everything on his plate, but he did make a good dent.<br>\r\n\"Guess what honey?\" started Ashley.<br>\r\nSam looked at her waiting for the answer.<br>\r\n\"I got put in charge of the Dazzle Me account. I get to work with the company and come up with thier whole advertising campaign.\" She explained.<br>\r\nSam's eyes widened. \"That's great Ash! I knew you could do it. You really worked at getting the account for the company so it was only fair to put you in charge.\" He leaned over and kissed Ashley. <br>\r\nAshley pecked his lips and looked around to make sure no one saw that. She continued talking to not make Sam suspicious as to why she kissed him so quickly. \"Mr Stevens says he's lining up a contract on Monday that I'll sign and go over some other stuff, and then I'll be in charge, thsi is definitely going to lead to bigger things.\"<br>\r\n\"I have no doubts, I'm really excited for you babe, we will have to celebrate tonight...when we get home. Kind of finish what we started from the shower this morning.\" Sam started raising his eyebrows up and down.<br>\r\nAshley smiled.<br>\r\nSam stood up and grabbed Ashley's purse again and pulled out a cigarette. He also grabbed her car keys. \"I'm going to use the car lighter, I really need a cigarette,babe.\" He started to walked away.<br>\r\nShe quickly grabbed two more pieces of gum and called to Sam. <br>\r\nAs he turned around, she threw it his way again and held her nose. \"From the onions on the burger.\"<br>\r\nSam smiled as he opened the gum and put it in his mouth.<br>\r\nAshley started cleaning up the mess on their picnic table and walking to a nearby trash can when again she met Mr. Stevens.<br>\r\n\"Hello Ashley.\" he said.<br>\r\n\"Hello Patrick.\" She said as she tossed the trash away.<br>\r\n\"We're just getting started with some relays over here.\" He explained.<br>\r\n\"Oh I see that, it does look like fun.\" she replied.<br>\r\nHe smiled. \"Seeing as we are the same height and all, I was wondering if you would be my partner for the 3 legged race?\" <br>\r\nThat really threw Ashley off, sure she was all set to watch the relays and maybe participate if Sam wanted to but now here she was being asked by the manager of the company to be partners with him. She couldn't say no.<br>\r\n\"That would be lovely\" She replied. He held out his hand and Ashley grabbed it as he helped her up. They walked over to the relay section.<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Sam was purched on the hood of Ashely's Ford, leaning back with his sunglasses on smoking his cigarette.<br>\r\nHe didn't even hear the guy approach. <br>\r\n\"Hey there you are.\" Said the boy.<br>\r\nSam was startled, as he grabbed his chest. \"Oh, you scared me. I'm sorry but I forgot your name.\" Sam said as he took another drag of the cigarette.<br>\r\n\"Pete.\" He replied. \"Do you have another cigarette, mine are back at the picnic area?\" <br>\r\n\"Mine too\" Sam replied. He handed the cigarette to Pete. He took a drag and handed it back to Sam.<br>\r\n\"Is this your ride? Pete continued.<br>\r\n\"Oh man, I wish. I don't have a car, or even a job. A lot of companies won't hire young people, even this company. I've been trying to get in for awhile. Hopefully something will come up soon\" Sam explained.<br>\r\n\"Well, my uncle is Patrick Stevens the company owner,, he's offered me jobs but I don't want to work with family. You should try the mall, that's where I work. I'm at the sporting goods place. It's over in the corner by Macy's and across from Dazzle Me, the dress store for teenaged girls.\" Explained Pete.<br>\r\n\"Wow! I didn't know you were Mr Stevens Nephew, thats' cool. Yeah, maybe I'll try the mall soon. I have to really step up my game and get some kind of income.\" Explained Sam.<br>\r\nHe handed the cigarette to Pete again as he took a drag and handed it back again.<br>\r\n\"Do you like baseball Sam?\" Pete asked.<br>\r\n\"Love it!\" replied Sam.<br>\r\n\"Well I happen to have Giants season tickets, if you'd be interested in going to a game with me?\" Pete asked.<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding? I'd love that! Thanks a lot man\" replied Sam.<br>\r\n\"How does next weekend sound?\" Pete continued.<br>\r\n\"Saturday? Great! I've been wanting to see a game\" <br>\r\nThe conversation was interupted by an announcement from the distance. It was Mr. Stevens announcing that the relays were about to start and that all partners were to line up to be tied together.<br>\r\nThe two finished the cigarette and then walked back together towards the playing field.<br>\r\nWhen they got there Sam saw all the relay racers having their legs tied together and right in the mix was Ashley being tied to Mr. Stevens.<br>\r\n\"Haha, look at my uncle, what a goon.\" said Pete.<br>\r\nThe crowd was thick and Sam was having a hard time seeing over everyone. So Pete suggested they get a closer look. He led Sam through the crowd towards the front of the relay line. He almost lost him, but quickly grabbed his hand and pulled him through.<br>\r\n\"Thanks man\", Sam said.<br>\r\nThe race was about to start as the racers lined up. Ashley was laughing at something Mr. Stevens was saying and then the starting gun fired. The racers took off. All the couples started off together, but some teams broke away fast, one was Mr. Stevens and Ashley. But again, they were really laughing hard and  other teams started to catch up to them. The crowd cheered as they watched. <br>\r\nThey were all coming to the home stretch. It was still Mr. Stevens and Ashley in the front with two other teams right behind them. Ashley was really laughing so hard she couldn't stand anymore and she fell down laughing. Sam watched as Mr. Stevens grabbed her waist to help ease her fall. When they were both on the ground they continued to laugh as another team won the race.<br>\r\nSam laughed at the sight but thought it was kind of strange that everytime Ashley tried to stand up Mr Stevens pulled her back down because they were tied together.<br>\r\nJust then Sam felt something. It was...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sam felt something being placed over his shoulders. He looked at his sides and saw that it was a large grey hoodie jacket. That swallowed him up.<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\" He looked and saw Pete behind him<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I didn't mean to startle you, but when I pulled your hand through the crowd it was really cold, I thought you might want someone thing a little warm since it's a little later in the day.\" explained Pete.<br>\r\nSam was a little startled by it but he was getting chilly. \"Thanks man, that was cool.\"<br>\r\nHe thought how everyone accepted him today, and that Ashley was worrying for nothing. He had met Ashley's boss when he got here. Played volleyball with some of her employees' kids,  Met a cool kid Pete and even got invited to a baseball game for next weekend.  I hope Ashley was having as much fun as he was he continued to think as he pulled the jacket a little tighter around him.<br>\r\nBehind him Pete began to smile. He watched Sam cuddle in his hoodie and thought. \"This is the coolest girl I have ever met.\"<br>\r\n\"I have to make her mine.\"<br>\r\nSam looked back towards the relay races and didn't see Ashley or her boss anywhere. He saw the next relay which was a potato sack race lining up but he didn't see her in that race. He lifted his sunglasses off and put them up in his hair. Being it wasn't as sunny as it was.<br>\r\n\"Pete, I'm going to take a walk to find my girlfriend. I don't see her anywhere.\", Sam explained.<br>\r\nPete thought Sam was talking about the other girl that they had played volleyball with and he saw her across the field. \"I see her, she's over there, follow me.\" said Pete.<br>\r\nSam followed Pete through the crowd of people once again. They walked past the roped off area for the relays until they got to another group of young adults. Here is where the other girl was, smoking with other guys her age. <br>\r\nSam didn't realize that this is where they were going to stop, he thought they were going to find HIS girlfriend Ashley, but was easily distracted by the cigarettes.<br>\r\nSam stopped in front of the girl, who was about the same size and height as Sam. \"Can I please have a cigarette, I don't know where my pack is.\"<br>\r\nThe girl opened her pack and pulled out 2 cigarettees and handed them to Sam and Pete. She pulled out a lighter and lit them both.<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, I'm terrible with names, what was yours again?\"Sam asked.<br>\r\n\"I'm Tiffany\", she replied. Tiffany finally took a close up look at Sam's face. \"Whoa! What happened to you?\"<br>\r\nSam looked at her surprised and had no idea what she was tallking about. \"Why what's wrong?\"<br>\r\n\"Your eyeliner is running from having your sunglasses on all day.\" She explained.<br>\r\n\"Oh man, that's right I forgot\" replied Sam<br>\r\n\"Come here, I'll fix you up.\" Tiffany explained.<br>\r\nPete stood talking with the other guys as he watched Tiffany pull Sam away.<br>\r\nShe pulled Sam by the hand to a picnic table and stood before him.<br>\r\nShe sat her burning cigarette on the end of the table top. She dug in her purse and pulled out a comb.<br>\r\n\"First I think this hair needs a comb run through it, let me reset your ponytail.  She brushed Sam's hair a few times, and got behind him, She pulled his hair back and again tied the scrunchie around the ponytail and again it sat high on his head, looking much neater. \"You should get your hair done and put a little body and style into it. My sister has a salon in town, I could set something up\" Tiffany explained. Sam hadn't really thought about getting his hair done and didn't really want to go to women's salon either. Tiffany quickly changed the subject., \"I love your earrings.\" <br>\r\n\"Thanks!\", replied Sam<br>\r\nShe then dug in her purse and took out a cleansing pad. \"Close your eyes.\"<br>\r\nSam closed them and she wiped away all the eyeliner streaks under Sam's eyes. Sam took a drag from his cigarette and blew the smoke away from the girl. \"I appreciate you cleaning up my eyes, I hope I didn't get smoke in yours.\"<br>\r\n\"No problem, I couldn't leave you looking like that out there in that crowd.\" She was pointing to the crowd of guys they were standing with but it went right over Sam's head. <br>\r\nThen she took out her eyeliner and told Sam to look up. Sam obeyed as he felt her put eyeliner around his eyes.<br>\r\nShe didn't stop there and dug in her purse again and pulled out black mascara. She twisted the wand and pulled it out. She began to coat Sam's lashes. <br>\r\nSam knew what she was doing and commented on it. \"Wow! I haven't worn anything on my eyes since my last gig.\"<br>\r\nAfter she finished and inspected her job, she took a drag of her cigarette again, \"Your last gig?\" She asked.<br>\r\nSam also took a drag of his cigarette. \"I played guitar in a band. Actually I wish I were still in a band.\" <br>\r\nThe girl's eyes lit up. I have a band too. It's a bunch of girls I've known for awhile, we do cover songs of older girl rock bands. Some Lita Ford, Joan Jett, Pat Benetar. We play at a local pub every other Friday. This must be something that we met cause we're looking for a guitar player.\" Tiffany explained.<br>\r\nNow Sam's eyes lit up. \"Oh man, that's great! I'd love to jam with you guys.\"<br>\r\n\"I'd love to hear your sound, I have my guitar in the car, but no amp. Can you do some acousitc for now?\" Tiffany continued.<br>\r\n\"I'd love to, I was going to bring my guitar but was talked out of it.\" Sam explained.<br>\r\n\"Oh I know what you mean, my mom didn't want me bringing mine either.\" replied Tiffany.<br>\r\nLet me run and get it.  She grabbed her cigarette and ran towards her car.<br>\r\nPete watched Tiffany run towards the car and approached Sam and sat next to him. \"Did you scare her off with that dripping mascara? Pete smiled<br>\r\nSam smiled and punched Pete in the shoulder.<br>\r\n\"OW! Damn, you pack a punch!\" Pete replied.<br>\r\n\"See, I may be small...\", replied Sam.<br>\r\nPete got a good look at Sam's face after Tiffany worked on it. \"Wow! You look much better.\"<br>\r\nAll in all Sam thought Pete was a cool guy and he thought this was going to be a good start to a good friendship.<br>\r\nIn a matter of minutes, Tiffany returned with a guitar case. and put it on the picnic table. She opened it and put the guitar that was inside on Sam's lap.<br>\r\n\"Oh sweet! You're going to play?\" Pete said. The other guys heard and came over, as did some of the other employees.<br>\r\n\"Alright, lets hear.\" Tiffany said as she lit another cigarette.<br>\r\nSam set the guitar on his lap upright and set his fingers in place.<br>\r\nHe immediately went into what he knew and did some Bon Jovi songs. He went into Bad Medicine. Then mixed it up with a little Dead or Alive.<br>\r\nTiffany was impressed as were the other guys. <br>\r\n\"This girl can do it all, She plays guitar, loves sports and is super cute.\", Pete thought.<br>\r\nSam continued to play as some more people crowded over and listened to the teenage girl play.<br>\r\n\"Who's daughter is that?\" one woman asked.<br>\r\nOne of the guys in the group the they played volleyball with replied, \"It's the woman, Ashley's daughter. <br>\r\n\"She plays really good. \" She continued.<br>\r\n\"Yeah and I hear she's only 17\", he again replied.<br>\r\nAnother woman chimed in, \"I saw her with Mr. Steven's nephew. I think we have a match here at our little picnic.\"<br>\r\n\"That's a 5 year difference in age cause isn't Pete 22?\" she continued.<br>\r\n\"She's not that young though.\" the women continued to talk as Sam played not hearing any of this.<br>\r\nFinally Tiffany stood up and said.\"Well, I'm impressed. Not that I didn't think you could play, but you're relaly good.\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\" Sam replied.<br>\r\n\"So do you want to play in our band? We've got a gig on Friday night, I'd love it if you could play then..\" she asked<br>\r\n\"I would love to!\" Sam was excited. He put the guitar back on the table and Tiffany gave him a hug.<br>\r\nOne thing though...</span></div></div>",

This way you could meet the rest of the band and then we could go to one of the band members brother's house. He can get you a fake ID. He's got the whole setup, camera, laminator, the works. All we would have to do is fix you up a little and give you an older look.\" Tiffany explained as she pulled Sam's hair back a little more. \"I think this could work.\" She continued. \"Take my phone number down and let me know if it's ok with, you know who.\"Tiffany continued. <br>\r\nTiffany had made that reference to Ashley who Tiffany thought was Sam's mother. Sam knew who she was talking about, \"Oh, she won't mind. She's been working a lot lately and might even have to work that night. I can get out. \" Sam replied innocently enough. <br>\r\nTiffany took out a piece of paper and wrote her phone number on it and gave it to Sam. \"If anything changes, let me know.\" <br>\r\nSam smiled from ear to ear. \"This is great! I've been wanting to jam again. Thanks a lot Tiffany!\" he replied.<br>\r\n\"My pleasure\" she said as she grabbed for her guitar back, she rubbed Sam's hand during the exchange. <br>\r\nSam didn't think anything of it and didn't even notice. He was happy enough that he was going to be playing again and even have a gig set up already. \"I gotta go find... you know who?\" Sam winked at Tiffany. Tiffany bit her lip and smiled.<br>\r\nPete saw Sam was ready to walk away and called to Sam. \"Hold up Sam, I'll walk with you.\" He said.<br>\r\nThe two made their way through the crowd. The relay races looked like they were finished and a group of older office workers were near the food area drinking. Sam still had the hoodie on and as it was getting later, the more chilly Sam got. He had both hands in his pockets and hugged the large hoodie tight. <br>\r\n\"Isn't that hoodie warm? It's my favorite.\" Pete said.<br>\r\nSam stopped and turned around. He realized that Pete was stilll only in a tshirt and faced him and started to take it off. \"I'm sorry dude, I'm hogging your hoodie and here you are getting cold.\" <br>\r\nPete stopped Sam from removing his hoodie. He pulled his arm back through the sleeve and pulled at the neck of the hoodie for Sam to keep it on. He held it there for a few seconds and looked into Sam's eyes. \"No, it looks better on you anyway.\" he said. <br>\r\nSam looked up at Pete .<br>\r\nPete thought they were sharing a moment, but Sam was looking elsewhere and finally spotted Ashley. \"There she is!\" he exclaimed as he looked past Pete's stare.<br>\r\nHe broke away and started walking through a clearing of the crowd Sam had seen Ashley at one of the picnic tables. Mr Stevens and her sat on one side of the picnic table and another couple sat on the other side. Sam and Pete approached the table.<br>\r\nAshley saw Sam coming over. \"Hi sweetheart!\" She said aloud.<br>\r\nEveryone's attention turned to Sam who stood at the end of the picnic table.<br>\r\n\"Hi Sam, hi Pete.\" Said Mr.Stevens. He took the lit cigar out of his mouth and blew smoke the opposite way. \"Are you guys having a good time?\" He asked<br>\r\n\"Yeah it's really a lot of fun.\" Said Pete. \"A lot my people near my age this year.\" <br>\r\nMr Stevens knew that his nephew meant Sam. He was glad that they had hit it off, and he saw that Sam had been wrapped in Pete's hoodie.<br>\r\n\"It's pretty good\" added Sam \"I met a lot of cool people too.\" <br>\r\nAshley got a good look at Sam's face and hair. \"Sam must have redone everything.\" she thought. \"He's got his hair recombed, and it looks like he's wearing makeup on his eyelashes as well as liner on his eyes. \"this is going better than planned,\" Ashley continued to think in her head. \"Once were done here, no one has to see Sam again, so she'll be in the clear with this lie and that will be that.\" <br>\r\n'Uncle Pat, can I have next saturday's lower level seats, Sam is going to go with me, if that's ok with you.\" Pete asked.<br>\r\nMr Stevens took another hit of his cigar and shook his head up and down. \"Well next Saturday I already have a client taking those. I do have tomorrow nights game free if that's ok? It's fine with me, It has to be ok with Ashley though.\" he continued.<br>\r\nAshley's eyes lit up wide again. \"Tomorrow?, for a game? Just the two of you?\" She asked in a trance like state.<br>\r\nIf Mr Steven's nephew got alone with Sam, he would surely try something. The kid has followed Sam around all day and clearly thinks that Sam is a teenage girl. A 17 year old teenage girl at that.\" Ashley thoughts scrambled about a mile a minute. \"Oh why didn't I just clear things up and correct Mr. Stevens at the start of the day.\" She continued. to think.<br>\r\n\"Is it ok Ashley?\" Mr Stevens asked.<br>\r\nAshley shook her head not even thinking or knowing what she was agreeing  to.<br>\r\n\"There  you go, You guys are going to have a great time. Those are great seats. You just keep an eye on Sam, ok Pete.\" Mr Stevens said.<br>\r\n\"Definitely!\" Pete said as he put his arm around Sam and pulled him close.<br>\r\nSam's face scrunched up against Pete's chest.<br>\r\nAshley saw that Sam was about to say something and jumped in to change the subject.<br>\r\n\"Do you want your cigarettes honey?\"  Ashley opened her purse and started to dig through<br>\r\nSam pulled away from Pete, and pulled back his fist again being playful. \"Don't make me give you some more of what I did before\" He said with a smile.<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, damn, Sam can pack a punch.\" Pete held and rubbed his arm. \"I'm still feeling it\" Pete replied back playfully.<br>\r\nSam grabbed at the pack of cigarettes but realized they were empty.<br>\r\nThe ohter woman at the table saw this and asked Sam if he wanted one of her Virginia Slims. <br>\r\nSam looked at the pack. That was always considered a \"woman's cigarette\" But He didn't care, so he reached into her pack and pulled out a long cigarette.<br>\r\n\"Can I please have a light Mr. Stevens.\" Sam asked as he held the end in his lips.<br>\r\nMr. Stevens' reached for his lighter and lit the flame and put it to the end of Sam's cigarette and lit it. <br>\r\nAshley stared at Sam with one hand on his hip and the other holding a woman's cigarette very feminine like. He didn't realize it, but that's what he was doing.<br>\r\n\"Comon', want to go down to the pond, I bet the flireflies will be coming out soon.\" Pete asked.<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Said Sam, and the two started to run off.<br>\r\n\"I have a fireworks show that will start in about an hour, so come back around that time.\" Said Mr. Stevens<br>\r\nThe couple ran off.<br>\r\n\"I don't know Ashley. My nephew really seems to like  your daughter. That's a five year difference, but this might be the start of something special.\" Mr Steven's joked.<br>\r\nThe ohter woman at the table commented too. \"The chemistry they have is amazing. You might be wedding gown shopping in a few years.\" <br>\r\nAshley's eyes grew once more with fear. <br>\r\n\"How am I going to keep this going.\" Ashley's mind raced. \"Pete just had his arms all over Sam, he's dressing in his hoodie,  how can they possibly go to a ballgame together? Sam thinks it's a ballgame and everyone else sees it as a date.\" <br>\r\n\"Well, the thing is, Patrick. Sam doesn't date much and I would hate for a guy to be all over her.\" Ashley started to explain. \"Not that your nephew wouldn't be the perfect gentlemen. She just hasn't kissed a boy yet and I just don't think she' s ready.\" <br>\r\nMr. Stevens understood what Ashley was thinking. \"I get it Ashley. I will have a talk with Pete and he will be on his best behavior and keep his hands to himself at all times.\" He explained.<br>\r\nAshley thought, \"it might work, but getting him out of the \"Date\" all together would be the best\" \"Maybe he'll catch the flu\" She continued to think.<br>\r\nThe other couple at the table excused themselves to go talk to other people and left the picnic table leaving Ashley and Mr Stevens alone.<br>\r\n\"Well now that's settled, seeing that the kids are going out tomorrow night,\".....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"How about this\", Mr Stevens began as he turned to face Ashley on the picnic bench. <br>\r\n\"I can come over tomorrow night whien the kids leave for the game, I'll bring take out. We can eat and then we just crunch out a plan that we can bring to the Dazzle Me group and I could set up a meeting with them and then you could show them your talents and why were the number one ad agency, with the number one woman.\" He explained as he put his arm on Ashley's shoulder.<br>\r\nAshley knew she had to get started on the ad for the Dazzle Me group right away, but she  thought it would be later in the week.<br>\r\nHer mind was still racing frantically to think of a way to get Sam out of the \"date\" that he was going on tomorrow. Her plate was full already but now she had to worry about entertaining her boss and work on a project while her boyfriend was out dressed as a teenage girl on a date with a 22 year old boy. <br>\r\n\"Ughhh, this spiraled out of control so quickly\" she thought. \"I just have to tell him the truth. I'll tell him and we'll laugh and everything will be ok from this point forward.\" She resolved in her head.<br>\r\nAshley stared blankly while she was thinking all this.<br>\r\n\"I see the concern in your eyes Ashley. I promise you,  I will have that talk with Peter.  Samantha will be perfectly safe going to the game with my nephew. I'll make sure of it. I know you worry about her and that's really nice to see a mother take an interest in her daughter's life.\" Mr Steven's explained.<br>\r\nAshley turned to Mr. Stevens and smiled. \"Tomorrow night is fine with me for you to come over but right now there's actually something I wanted to discuss with you.\" She began as she took a deep breath. \"This was it\" She thought. \"I have to tell him\"<br>\r\nMr Steven's smiled. \"Actually, I think I know what where you're going with this.\" Mr Steven's interupted.<br>\r\n\"No Mr. Stevens I don't think you do, you see..\" she started again.<br>\r\nAgain Mr Stevens interupted. \"Well I wasn't going to tell you this until all the paper work was ready on Monday, but remember those papers I spoke about when I told you about the account earlier? The ones I have to have you sign? Well, I talked the Dazzle Me executives to hire Samantha as one of the models for the new mailing brochure and also for a spot in the catalog in the under 20 year old group.\" He explained.<br>\r\nAshley stared in shock.<br>\r\n \"I knew you were worried about her not having a job so I looked into it and  one of the Dazzle Me executives was here earlier for a brief time as the picnic begain. I asked her if she would use Samantha in her layout and she agreed.  So not only do you get to design the whole ad, you get to work with your daughter. Isn't that wonderful?\" He was really excited explaining this to Ashley, but she still didn't seem that excited.<br>\r\nInside Ashley was freaking out. This is too much and I'm in so deep and the lie just kept growing,\" she had to tell him the truth, she thought to herself.<br>\r\n\"She'll get a 500 dollars for every picture they use of her.\" Mr Stevens finished. <br>\r\nAshley's eyes lit up. Mr Steven's smiled.<br>\r\n\"I thought you might like that, and it would probably help you gals out with 2 incomes coming in. Also, She gets a $2000 clothing allowance. Dazzle Me not only has formal dresses, but  a huge selection of teen girls clothes, shoes, accessories and makeup too. You would  be set for awhile.\" He continued. <br>\r\nAshley couldn't believe what Mr. Stevens was proposing but he just kept talking about it. \"This could never happen\" She thought. \"It might have been easy to fool Sam to dress androdynous for a day, but theres no way he would ever wear girls clothes on purpose, especially at a job. The money would be good, but still I can't see anyway that this would work. she continued to think.<br>\r\n\"Mr Stevens I appreciate this offer, but I'm not sure if I want Sam to get involved in modeling.\" Ashley explained.<br>\r\n\"Well, why don't you tihnk about it. I'll still have the contract drawn up and I'll give it to you Monday and you look it over\" Mr Steven's said. <br>\r\nAshley didn't want to discuss this, she wanted to end this now.<br>\r\nMr Steven's saw a woman wave over to him. \"Oh look they're going to start the fireworks. Lets make our way to the field.\" Mr Stevens grabbed Ashley's hand and helped her unwrap her legs from the picnic bench. He held her hand through the crowd and made their way to the area with the microphone and big speaker. He picked up the microphone and flipped the switch on the speaker.<br>\r\n\"Attention everyone, grab a blanket and a loved one, fireworks are set to begin in 10 minutes.\" He announced and then shut the speaker off again.<br>\r\nHe leaned down and picked up a blanket that he had next to the speaker, along with a blue cooler that read P. STEVENS across the top. Again he grabbed Ashley's hand and made their way to the field area where just hours earlier they had the relay races.<br>\r\nHe walked for a little while and decided on a spot deep on a hilly area. It was further than the other people but it was nice and secluded. <br>\r\nAshley watched as he laid out the blanket and put the cooler on top of it. He laid down on the blanket and reached up his hand. <br>\r\n\"Ashley, would you watch the show with me?\" He smiled.<br>\r\nAshley continued to stand. \"thank you Mr. Stevens but...\" <br>\r\nMr Stevens again interupted, as he popped open the cooler. \"I've got wine coolers.\" He smiled even larger.<br>\r\nAshley finally smiled and kneeled on the blanket. \"Well, maybe just one.\" She agreed.<br>\r\nMr Stevens twisted the cap off of a wine cooler and handed Ashley the bottle. He twisted another one for him and then clicked bottles for cheers.<br>\r\nMr Stevens reached into his shirt pocket for a cigar and his lighter. \"Do you mind if I have a cigar?\" He asked.<br>\r\nAshley really didn't mind \"I love the smell of a good cigar.\" She replied.<br>\r\nSecretly she did love the smell.. Years ago she worked as a bartender at a high end cigar bar. It was an exclusive club that served a lot of Arizona's high rollers.<br>\r\nMr Stevens clipped off the end and lit the cigar. Ashley took a sip of her wine cooler.<br>\r\nShe felt guilty sitting alone on a blanket with her boss, while Sam was being hit on by a young guy. She did like Mr Stevens from the beginning. He was the first one she had met at the office. Even before being interviewed. They rode the elevator up on the day of the interview and gave her a pep talk about the boss Mr Stevens and how he was a pushover but a nice guy. Then how surprised she was when she found out that Mr. Stevens  was the guy from the elevator. They both had a good laugh about that and from there their friendship grew.<br>\r\nMr Stevens was a single, confident man, and a year older than she was. He was very attractive and if she wasn't with Sam, she definitely thought about dating Mr. Stevens.<br>\r\nMr Stevens surprised her by reaching around Ashley and placing the lit cigar at her lips.<br>\r\nAshley turned and smiled. She put the cigar in her mouth and puffed. She blew the smoke away from them.<br>\r\n\"That brings me back to a few years back in Arizona.\" She thought. She leaned in on the conversation as they both used the medium sized cooler as an arm rest.<br>\r\n\"It's hard to find a good woman, who can appreciate a good cigar.\" Mr Stevens replied.<br>\r\nHe puffed the cigar again and once again handed it to Ashley.<br>\r\nThey both were distracted by a large boom<br>\r\nThe fireworks had begun. They continued to smoke the cigar together and drink their coolers as the fireworks show was in full bloom. It seems, they talked more than actually watching a fireworks show. <br>\r\nThat went on for practically the whole light show. Until about 25 minutes later when the finale started and the whole sky was lit up with fireworks.  The watched and as the cigar got smaller, the show came to a close.<br>\r\nEveryone clapped, and the whole field got loud with lots of applause and cheers. <br>\r\n\"I had an incredible time Mr Stevens.\" Ashley said.<br>\r\n\"Please, enough with the formalaities. call me Patrick.\" He replied.<br>\r\n\"Well, again, thank you Patrick.\" She said as she started to get up.<br>\r\nMr Stevens got up and helped her to her feet.<br>\r\nThey both turned and there stood Sam and Pete. Sam was soaked, clothes, hair, and everything.<br>\r\n\"Sam! What happened?\" Ashley asked.</span></div></div>",

He was freezing.<br>\r\nAshley felt bad for Sam who stood there with his hair a mess, makeup running down his face and still in the wet clothes.<br>\r\n\"How did this happen?\" She asked.<br>\r\nPete took over the storry as Ashley wrapped her arms around her smaller boyfriend. <br>\r\n\"Sam was jumping on some rocks, it was like a path of rocks that crossed the pond. I followed almost a step behind. Well, it must have been a wet rock cause I really slipped off it and...\" He told the story only Sam interjected the rest.<br>\r\n\"Grabbed me around the waist and took me down with him.\" Sam sneered a little but laughed.<br>\r\n\"Aww, man I said I was sorry.\" He replied smiling back.<br>\r\nMr Stevens listened to the story and at first was mad that Pete had grabbed onto Samantha, but then he saw that they were being playful with each other, He thought to himself, \"This boy really likes Samantha. I'll have to have that talk with him before the game tomorrow. I definitely want to stay on Ashley's good graces. This way Pete will end up with the girl and hopefully I'll end up with the woman!\" He startied smirking too.<br>\r\n\"Well, the picnic is jjust about winding down, so why don't you take the keys and walk to the car and maybe get it warmed up a little.\" Ashley handed Sam the keys.  <br>\r\n\"I'll go with you Sam, until you're ready to go.\" Pete followed.<br>\r\n\"Try not to pull me into any lakes along the way\" Sam said sarcastically laughing<br>\r\nPete just mocked Sam's laughter and the two ran towards the car.<br>\r\nAshley turned around and saw Mr Stevens putting away the wine coolers into the cooler. <br>\r\n\"here let me grab an end, and we'll fold it together.\" She said as she grabbed the blanket that they sat on.<br>\r\nThe two folded the blanket together.<br>\r\n\"So tomorrow night, are we still on?\" Mr Steven's asked.<br>\r\nAshley thought about it more and she really couldn't have her home life and work life mix anymore. She almost had a heart attack tonight trying to keep her work people away from Sam. Not to mention she never used a single pronoun when talking about Sam tonight, there's just no way she could do another day of this.<br>\r\n\"I will call you tomorrow.\" She told him<br>\r\n\"Ok, fair enough\" As they folded the last part of the blanket, the two were close and as she handed the blanket to him. Mr. Stevens rubbed at her hand. \"I hope you call\" He smiled.<br>\r\nIt caused Ashley to also smile, but then quickly remembered Sam was waiting in the car.<br>\r\n\"I have to go\" She told him as she walked away.<br>\r\n\"Goodnight Ashley.\" He said as she crossed the field.<br>\r\nMany of the other eomployees made their way over to Mr Stevens to thank him for a good time. <br>\r\nBut Mr. Steven's stare never left Ashley as he watched her walk away.<br>\r\nAs Sam and Ashley pulled out of the park, Ashley saw Sam was a little warmer with the heat on. He had turned it up full blast, and she couldn't take it anymore finally turning it down to low.<br>\r\n\"Did you have a good time babe?\" Ashley asked him<br>\r\n\"It was a blast! I didn't realize a lot of people my age would be there. Which reminds me, you weren't mad that I didn't hang out with your work people all night, were you?\" He asked.<br>\r\n\"No babe, I'm just glad you had a good time\" She replied.<br>\r\nSam was really smiling. \"I met a lot of cool people AND, just like your amazing news about The Dazzle Me project. I might be joining a new band.\" He finally told her.<br>\r\nAshley again got that feeling of strain on her chest. \"What?\"<br>\r\nSam replied, \"Yeah, the chick Tiffany who was there? She brought her guitar out for me to play and she liked my sound so much, she asked me to play in her girl band this coming weekend. Can you believe that? I'm going to be rocking in a band again.\" He continued.<br>\r\nAshley started to freak out again. \"Are you sure that's a good idea honey? Shouldn't you be looking for a job?\" She knew Sam was going to freak out about her bringing up a job, but she had to get his mind off doing these things with people who thought all along that he was a girl.<br>\r\n\"That's the best part. It's a paying gig. If they like me, which I think they will it could lead to other gigs.\" He replied too excited to be upset about her comment.<br>\r\nAshley started freaking out internally again. She thought about everything the rest of the ride home as Sam conintued to talk about all the people at the picnic that he met.<br>\r\n\"This is going to be a great week. I get to see a ballgame tomorrow and then later in the week I get to jam in a band.\" Sam said. He left out the part about the fake ID that he would need to play in the bar. He was still underage even though the other girls were over 21, but they would help him get in. He thought.<br>\r\nThe couple arrived home got inside the house. Ashley went into the bedroom and stripped out of her clothes and slid into some PJ's.<br>\r\nShe heard the shower go on and knew that Sam was jumping in. She shut the light out and slipped into bed.<br>\r\nAbout 15 minutes later as Ashley still lay there thinking about her lie and and what Sam was involved in, she heard the water shut off. <br>\r\nMinutes later Sam was slipping into the bed. His small body held onto her. His arms reached around and he started caressing her breasts.<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, they two made love and then fell asleep.<br>\r\nThe next morning, Ashley's eyes opened and faced Sams side of the bed. Only it was empty.<br>\r\nShe sat up and pulled her hair back.<br>\r\n\"Babe?\" she called. <br>\r\nSam entered the bedroom doorway and Ashley gasped.</span></div></div>",

I thought a shower would help, but I feel even worse. I don't have much of a voice either.\" Sam explained in a raspy nasaly broken voice.<br>\r\nAshley propped up some of the pillows and helped Sam lean back on his side of the bed. She put the cup of tea next to the bed and pulled up the covers to Sam's chin.<br>\r\n\"Well babe, I'm sorry to say that you won't be going to any ballgames like this.\" Ashley said.<br>\r\nSam didn't like the sound of that. \"Well, I figured the game isn't until late afternoon and if I slept the afternoon away, I would wake up alright for the game.\" Sam explained.<br>\r\nAshley smiled but knew that there would be no way for Sam to go to this ballgame. She finally felt a little relief after the day before being in a constant panic mode. Now she could tell Mr. Stevens that their work/dinner plans were off for the evening and that the \"kids\" wouldn't be going out that night. After a few more excuses and cancellations by her and, Samantha will be a distant memory from her office friends.<br>\r\n\"Well, lets see how you feel later\" Ashley said giving Sam a little hope. <br>\r\nAshley got up from the bed and went into the bathroom. She opened the medicine cabinet and saw a full bottle of NyQuil cold and flu Nighttime. She took the dosage cup and filled it to the rim, giving Sam a double dosage.<br>\r\n\"This should do it and put him out for the rest of the day.\" She thought as she carried the dosage back to Sam.<br>\r\nShe again sat on the edge of the bed near Sam and handed him the dosage cup full of the medicine.<br>\r\n\"Here, take this.\" She said handing him the medicine cup.<br>\r\nSam didn't argue, he just took the cup and downed it quickly. Then he made a yucky medicine face as she handed him the cup of tea again. Again she ran her fingers through his hair and took the cup of tea back after his sip. She guided him back down to the pillows.<br>\r\n\"I'm going to jump into the shower babe. Get some rest.\" Ashley said as she left him and entered the bathroom.<br>\r\nAfter her shower and when she was finished getting dressed she peeked into the bedroom again and saw that Sam was out like a light.<br>\r\nQuietly she closed the bedoom door and went into the kitchen. She grabbed her cell phone and dialed her sister Pam.<br>\r\nPam was the older of the two sisters but they were very much the same build. Both very tall attractive women, and they had always been very close except recently as Pam didn't care much for Sam. It wasn't so much the age difference. She saw him as a slacker, who had no direction. He was a long haired musician. She knew het sister liked the badass musician guys growing up but now thought it was time to find the guy who was going to be in it for the long haul. Sam didn't seem like that guy to her. She did want to start having a better relationship with her sister like they used to have so she continued to be there for her and support her choice in men.<br>\r\n\"I was wondering if I was going to hear from you. How was the picnic?\" She said as she answered her phone.<br>\r\n\"Oh my God Pan, do I have a story to tell you.\" Ashley began.<br>\r\nThat's exactly what Ashley did. She explained the whole picnic and the whole misunderstanding and everything that went down at the picnic. A few hours later and Pam was in hysterics after hearing everything.<br>\r\n\"Oh God Ash, I don't know how you get pulled into this craziness, but I swear the kid causes you more headaches\" She replied. <br>\r\n\"So what time is Mr Steven's coming over?\" Pam asked.<br>\r\n\"Pam, are you serious? There's no way I can meet with Patrick today while Sam was out with his nephew. I can't do another day of this.I\"m just going to have to cancel tonight and then hopefully we can figure something out Monday morning at the office.\"<br>\r\n\"No way!\" Pam yelled. \"I'm coming over\"<br>\r\nJust a little before 3 pm Sam stirred in his bed. He turned over and faced the clock that was on the nightstand and saw that It was 4 pm. He had slept the whole afternoon away. He heard voices in the other room and slowly he got out of bed. He opened the door of the bedroom and entered the living room area and saw..</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sam crept towards the bedroom door. He was just about to open it when he realized there was something  that was different, and that difference was him.<br>\r\nHe remembered going to sleep in a robe but that's not what he had on now. He could only see by looking down because there wasn't a mirror in the room. <br>\r\nFirst of all he felt a ballcap on his head. He did try to remove it but realized that his hair was in a ponytail and it fed through the back of the hat.<br>\r\nHe looked at his shirt which was a grey hoodie with the San Francisco Giants Logo on the front of it. The peculiar thing about the chest area where the logo sat, it pertruded out in the front. It felt like he had on something under the hoodie around his chest. He tried to pull the zipper down but it was stuck. He looked down at it and it had a bunch of material jammed up together, so it wasn't going to zipper down.<br>\r\nThe hoodie sat on his hips in an almost hugging way and on his lower half was a pair of white short shorts. They were really short. Finally on his feet were a pair of open toed sandles.<br>\r\nHe heard a group of people on the other side of the door and he heard Ashley say, \"I'll go check if Sam is up yet\"<br>\r\nAfter he heard that, the door slowly opened and Ashley peaked her head in. She was in shock to see Sam there on the other side of the door. <br>\r\n\"Oh, you're up? How long have you been up?\" She asked nervously.<br>\r\nSam tried to reply but all that came out was a high pitch screach. Sam had lost his voice.<br>\r\nAshley smirked and thought. \"Oh this is perfect.\"<br>\r\nSam grabbed at his throat.<br>\r\n\"Oh baby, I'm sorry, you can't talk.\" <br>\r\nSam motioned at his clothes and mouthed, \"what is this?\"<br>\r\nAshley explained. \"Oh I'm sorry babe. Mr Steven's and Pete called while you were sleeping and said they were coming over at around 3. I tried a few times to wake you up but you didn't budge. My sister and I finally decided to start getting you ready ourselves. I even did your eye makeup that I know you like to have the \"rockstar\" look\", she continued.<br>\r\nSam's eyes opened widely and he mouthed, Your sister?\"<br>\r\nAshley laughed, \"No, my sister didn't dress you. I did. She bought you the new clothes. She heard you were going to the Giants game and got you some new gear to wear. Does it fit ok babe?\" She asked.<br>\r\nSam made a motion that it was tight in the chest and then he made his hands symbolize breasts.<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah. I have another layer under your hoodie. Just because youre going to the game doesn't mean you're 100 percent well, you were really sick and I don't want you catching more cold, so I wrapped you up warm.\" She explained.<br>\r\n\"Comon', everyone is waiting for you, lets go out there so you can get to the game.\" Ashley said as she walked out of the bedroom. Sam followed behind her.<br>\r\nEveryone smiled as they came into the room. Pete, who was sitting on the couch stood up and smiled at Sam. Sam smiled back at his friend.<br>\r\nOnly Pete was smiling at Sam because he looked like a beautiful girl.<br>\r\nAshley wasn't entirely honest with Sam. It was true that her sister and her got him dressed while he slept, but they dressed Sam up like an attractive teenaged girl.<br>\r\nWhat Sam couldn't see, was that a pink Giants hat sat on his head. The two sisters had done his hair in a striaight ponytail and fed it through the back of the hat. His top was an ash colored women's front zippered Giants hoodie. The two sisters  jammed the zipper intentionally so that Sam couldn't see that underneath the hoodie he had on a woman's bra with two of Sam's socks stuffed into the cups. His chest pertruded enough to give him a small B cup. On his hips were white women's shorts and on his feet was an opened toe women's sandle with a slight heel.<br>\r\nAshley did put eyeliner on Sam's eyes but she failed to mention that she added a light foundation, light eye shadow and pink lipstick.<br>\r\nPam also thinned his eyebrows slightly just to give them al ittle shape.<br>\r\nAshley knew Sam wasn't one to stare into a mirror. He usually got out of the shower and put his hair in a ponytail and threw on his clothes. So she knew he wouldn't  see himself. Now she felt even better that Sam couldn't speak. <br>\r\nPam took her phone out of her purse. \"You two kids get together so that I can take your picture.\" <br>\r\nMr Steven's took his phone out of his pocket also and set it up for a picture.<br>\r\n\"Get close you two!\" Pam insisted.<br>\r\nPete stood facing her ready for a picture. Sam just wanted to get going, but finally stood next to Pete.<br>\r\nPam couldn't believe the difference in height and build between the two boys. Sam came up to Pete's chest and his small frame was nothing compared to Petes athletic toned body.<br>\r\nPete put his arm around his \"date\" and both smiled as the IPhones snapped a picture.<br>\r\n\"Now one more, but this time both of you yell GO GIANTS!\" Pam continued.<br>\r\nSam posed and put a snarl on his face. With the makeup on and his outfit, he looked like a cute girl Giants fan pointing to his shirt. Pete also pointed to his shirt which was a Giant's Jersey. Both of them yelled, \"GO GIANTS!\" In unison.<br>\r\nAshley came over to Sam with another dosage cap full of Nyquil cold and flu. \"I know you still don't feel 100 percent but lets keep up with the medicine, take this.\" <br>\r\nSam downed the cap of medicine and made the face. While he did that, Ashley tied something around his waist.<br>\r\n\"I couldn't find your fanny pouch so you'll have to use mine. I put your cigarettes, a lighter and sunglasses in there. There might be some things of mine in there, but I didn't have time to take them out.\" Ashley explained as Sam made a face.<br>\r\nEveryone thought Sam was upset about not having his fanny pack, but he was really making the face because Ashley's was pink.<br>\r\n\"We better get rolling, Sam I have some friends we're meeting there, and I want them to meet you before we sit at our seats.\" Pete explained.<br>\r\nThe two exited the apartment and walked to the driveway where Petes blue convertable Mustang sat. The top was already down.<br>\r\nPete opened the car door for Sam, and after Sam sat down Pete closed the door and went around to the driver's side.<br>\r\nSam unzipped the fanny pack and saw that there were sunglasses in there, only they were Ashley's women sunglasses. \"Great!\" Sam thought. He pulled them out and put them on. He saw everyone standing in the apartment doorway watching them leave and he pointed to the sunglasses with a frown on his face. <br>\r\nEveryone just waved to them as Sam pulled out a cigarette and lit it  as Pete backed out of the driveway.<br>\r\nThe pair looked just like a young boy and girl out on a first date.<br>\r\nThe others walked back into the apartment.<br>\r\n\"I' had that talk with Pete, he is going to take real good care of Samantha tonight.\" Mr Steven's explained.<br>\r\nPam laughed as she heard that. \"Oh she's a big girl. I have to tell you, I see a future for those two. They're so cute together.\" Pam continued<br>\r\nAshley nudged her as Mr. Steven's back was turned. <br>\r\n\"Well, I should be going.\" Pam started.<br>\r\nMr. Steven's went to a briefcase that was on the kitchen table and opened it and took out some papers. \"Actually Pam, I was hoping you could help me pursuade Ashley here to allow her daughter to model for the Dazzle Me project. I have a new contract right here all you have to do is sign and Samantha could make a lot of money.\" He explained. <br>\r\nPam grabbed the contract as Ashley's sighed. \"Oh Mr Steven's I thougth we went through this, I don't want Sam involved in any of this.\" <br>\r\n\"I know, and I swear I'm not pushing but I didn go back to the Dazzle Me people and told them that Samantha wasn't interested, and they actually upped the ante.\" He continued. \"It would still be cheaper for them to offer Sam more money than it would to pay for another professional model. These people are good too, they work with the models and it's all very positive.\" <br>\r\nAshley thought, Here it was happening again. She was getting pulled into a lie and it was dragging out farther. There isn't anyway this would work. Sure, she got Sam to go out again tonight looking like a girl without a hitch,but this was definitely the last night. She couldn't keep doing this to her boyfriend, plus he would eventually get his voice back and once he found out what was going on, he would be furious with her.<br>\r\n\"Sam would never go for it anyway, you saw how she is getting her picture taken. She hates it, so there would be no way that she would pose in dresses and heels. She's too much of a tomboy.\" Ashley explained.<br>\r\n\"TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR A TWO WEEK JOB?\" Pam screamed as she read the contract. Ashley came over and started reading over Pam's shoulder. <br>\r\n\"I got them to offer 10 grand, 500 per photo used, a two thousand dollar clothing allowance and free madeovers at the Dazzle Me Spa for 6 months. That's a lot of money they're offering a nobody.\" Mr Stevens expllained.<br>\r\nAshley looked at her sister.<br>\r\nPam asked if she could talk to her sister for a few minutes in the other room.<br>\r\nMr Stevens agreed.<br>\r\nThe two women exited the living room and went into the bedroom and closed the door.</span></div></div>",

I\"m going to hell\" Ashley put her hands to her face and covered them walking around the room in a panic.<br>\r\n\"Oh stop, it's harmless.\" Pam tried to justify what they did.<br>\r\nAshley looked at her sister. \"Pam, we dressed my boyfriend up in women's clothes and sent him on a date with a young guy, I'm a terrible girlfriend. I'm soooo going to hell.\" She continued.<br>\r\n\"Well to be honest, the clothes were more androdgynous than women's.\" Pam smiled.<br>\r\n\"We put him in a bra while he slept, and I let you pluck some of his eyebrows.\" Was her reply.<br>\r\nThis made Pam laugh even harder. \"Hey! I straightend some stray hairs for him.\"<br>\r\nAshley picked up the contract that Mr Stevens brought over. \"And this, I have no clue what to say about this. I've told him no, but he keeps insisting that I sign it.\"<br>\r\nPam looked at her sister with a little smirk. \"I think he's got a crush on you, and is trying to do anything to be able to work with you and your daughter.\" She explained.<br>\r\nAshley put on a \"You're crazy\" face and said, \"There's no way, you're crazy. He just wants Sam and I to be able to work together, and that if Sam took this modeling job it would help out with some of the bills.\" <br>\r\n\"Well, say what you like, I think he likes you and wants to do things that will help you out and to make you happy.\" Pam explained.<br>\r\n\"That's very nice of him, but I am with Sam and he is my boyfriend.\" Ashley replied.<br>\r\n\"Who's out on a date right now with his nephew.\" Pam threw in.<br>\r\nAshley laid on the bed and covered her face in the comforter.<br>\r\nPam picked up the contract. \"I better get going so you two can have some time to do some work. So what are you going to do about this contract?\"<br>\r\nAshely spoke with her face still in the comfortor. \"Can you tell him no for me, please. He won't take my \"No\" for an answer. Tell him, I'll be right out, I want to freshen up a little.\" Ashley stood up from the bed. and went into the bathroom.<br>\r\n\"I'll take care of it. See ya later, sis.\" Pam said.<br>\r\n\"Bye Pammy\" Ashley said from behind the bathroom door.<br>\r\nPam walked back out to the living room area. Pam walked over to the table and picked up a pen. She brought the contract over to Mr Stevens and signed Ashley's name on the contract for Sam to model for Dazzle Me.<br>\r\nShe whispered to Mr Stevens. \"Ashley says no, but I know that she really needs this. Call me, I put my number at the bottom of the contract. <br>\r\nI'll get Samantha to the photo shoot, but we can't tell Ashley until after the fact. Sam is going to be reluctant so that's why Ashley nor you can be at the shoot.\" Pam explained<br>\r\n\"That's fine, my brother, Peter's dad is the photographer. He'll take good care of her.\" Then Patrick smiled. \"He is also very single, maybe I could tell him you're stopping by and you two can get to know each other better. Then maybe the four of us could have dinner soon.\" He proposed.<br>\r\nPam smiled, \"Well, if he is as cute as you, I'm in.\" <br>\r\n So we have a deal?!\" Mr Steven's asked.<br>\r\nPam shook his hand, \"Deal.\" <br>\r\nPam left and before Ashley came out of the bedroom, Mr Stevens put the contract into his briefcase again.<br>\r\nMeanwhile at the Giants game.<br>\r\nSam and Pete finally parked. Pete had parking passes which was really good because it allowed them to park right outside the entrance gate.<br>\r\nThey wouldn't have to walk far, when the game was over, but Pete really didn't mind walking especilly next to Sam.<br>\r\nThe two walked to the trunk of the car and Pete opened it up. He pulled out 2 foldable chairs. Both in Giant's colors. He opened Sam's seat for him and patted it for him to sit down. <br>\r\nSam smiled and sat on his chair. It was a large chair and because Sam wasn't that big, he curled up his legs into the seat.<br>\r\nPete noticed how cute Sam looked especially sitting like that as he opened his chair. <br>\r\nHe dug back into the trunk of the car and took out two beers. <br>\r\nHe twisted both tops off and handed one to Sam.<br>\r\nHe sat down in his chair. <br>\r\n\"That sucks that you lost your voice.\" Pete said after he took a sip from his bottle.<br>\r\nSam shrugged his shoulders. <br>\r\n\"I wanted you to be able to interact with my friends that are coming..\" Pete continued.<br>\r\nPete pulled out two cigarettes and lit them. He exhaled the smoke and then handed one to Sam. <br>\r\nSam smiled and took the cigarette and a sip of beer.<br>\r\nBoth turned when they heard a car horn honking approaching and turned to see 2 more cars pull up.<br>\r\nIn one car were 2 more couples and in another car was another couple. Pete thought this was great. It was going to be 4 couples if you count Sam and him.<br>\r\nThe other groups all got out of the car and came over and greeted each other. There was Mike and Rebecca, Steve and Gina, and Rob and Darlene.<br>\r\nSam waved to everyone as Pete explained that Sam had no voice. He laughed when he said they fell in the pond last night together. <br>\r\nSam, pushed Pete in the shoulder, playingly.<br>\r\nSam noticed the other guys were all big guys too. He was probably the smallest guy in the group. The girl Gina was really tall also.<br>\r\nShe was the same height as the other guys and her guy Steve. He was the same height as Rebecca, but taller than Darlene.<br>\r\nHe felt a little self conscious but everyone was really nice and it didn't take long before everyone started talking. <br>\r\nThe other guys started unloading chairs out of their car trunks and coolers with beers.<br>\r\nGina had unfolded a small table and Rebecca opened a dip and put it on the table. Another guy came over with 3 different chips.<br>\r\nThey filled plastic bowels with chips as everyone made a circle of chairs around the table and dug in.<br>\r\nRob came over with a large cooler from his trunk and set it next to the table, while Darlene handed out paper plates to everyone. <br>\r\nRob opened the cooler and took out a long submarie sandwich for everyone. It was cut into pieces so everyone dug in.<br>\r\nEveryone made small talk and seemed to focus the conversation a lot around Sam. <br>\r\nSam of course could only answer the group's questions by shaking his head yes or no. Like when they asked how long he's lived there. Sam could only hold up the number of fingers. Pete did a lot of the talking about Sam. He told everyone about the mean guitar Sam played and how there was a gig coming up on Friday that the band was going to play in. Everyone right away asked where and if they could come see the band play.<br>\r\nSam nodded. <br>\r\nPete said, \"When we find out where the band is playing I'll get in touch with everyone mid week.\" <br>\r\nEveryone liked that idea.<br>\r\nThe tailgate party went on for awhile, and the beers seemed to start hitting Sam hard. He was really feeling loopy and kind of dizzy, but he didn't want to show it.<br>\r\nTHen he remembered the NYQUIL that he had taken before he left. He mixed that with alcohol and that's why he was feeling weird.<br>\r\nSam paniced a little cause he was feeling a little drunk and really didn't know Pete or his friends that well.<br>\r\n It did seem like Pete's friends were getting a little buzzed from the alcohol too. The girls were laughing a lot, but it was Darlene who was getting loud and more obnoxious as they partied.<br>\r\n\"Oh my God, I have to pee!\" Darlene announced. \"Come to the port a john with me Sam.\" She yelled.<br>\r\nSam wondered why she wanted him to go with her, but he figured maybe they could help each other out.<br>\r\nAs Darlene and Sam walked away everyone commented on how pretty Samantha was.<br>\r\nRebecca said, \"I think you two make such a cute couple. I hope it works out.\"<br>\r\n\"Two things might be a problem though, one is that she's only 17. The other thing is her mother is very protective of her. She works with my uncle and she made him have a talk with me about taking care of Sam tonight.\" Pete explained.<br>\r\n\"Well, she seems to really be into you and that's reallly not a major age difference between you two. Just treat her right and her mom won't have any reason to worry.\" Rebecca replied.<br>\r\n\"I will, I could definitely see a long term relationship with this girl.\" Pete said.<br>\r\nThe whole group of friends in unison gave a dragged out and sarcastic, \"Awwwww\"<br>\r\nPete smiled but then realized the time. \"We better get packed up and get the other girls to go in.\"<br>\r\nSam and Darlene were making their way back to the cars and they were walking slowly. They were both leaning on each other for support to walk. Darlene was really drunk and Sam had a few beers but he was really loopy, lightheaded and things were getting a little blurry for him.<br>\r\nThey approached the other friends at the cars and saw they were ready to go in.<br>\r\n\"It looks like the girls could use a little help.\" Rob noticed.<br>\r\nPete ended up hanging on to Sam as Rob grabbed Darlene.<br>\r\n\"Comon guys we have to go in.\" Pete said. Drunken Sam leaned up against Pete's chest.<br>\r\n\"Oh no, Sam. Are you going to be alright.\"<br>\r\nSam shook his head yes but he was feeling very intoxicated. Whether it be from the beers or the Nyquil. He was going to have to take it easy for the rest of the game and let this buzz wear off.<br>\r\n\"Sam took some Nyquil before we left, so that and the beers aren't mixing well.\" Pete explained to his friends.<br>\r\n\"Aww, you poor thing.\" Rebecca said.<br>\r\nPete leaned down and told Sam to jump on his back. \"Comon, lets just get to our seats and I'll get you something to eat.\"<br>\r\nSam leaned against Pete's back and sort of flopped on it. Pete grabbed Sam's legs and hoisted him up on his back.<br>\r\nSam's mind was racing. The medicine and beers weren't a good mix. <br>\r\nHe had thoughts about when he and Ashley had gone to a game together. They had so much fun. He remembered both of them drinking a lot at the game and he got on her back just like he is now. <br>\r\nHe forgot for a moment that he was on Pete's back and not Ashleys as he locked his arms snuggly around Pete's neck and leaned in against his cheek.<br>\r\nPete smiled and thought..</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Pete walked proudly through the gated areas surrounding the ballpark with Sam on his back. The other couples followed as they made their way past the food stands. That's where Pete decided to come to a stop. He stood up straight, sliding Sam down his back. When his feet hit the ground, Sam came to life, but leaned against Pete's body.<br>\r\nPete opened his pocket and took out the tickets for everyone. <br>\r\n\"I'm going to get Sam something to eat and some coffee to wake her up, anybody else need anything?\" He asked his friends.<br>\r\nEveryone agreed that they wanted nothing except beer and they would get that at another stand. They grabbed their tickets and went on their way to the seats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam's head was really floating. He hadn't been this sick and out of it in a long time. <br>\r\n\"Ashley's jacket is so soft\" Sam thought to himself as his face was planted into Pete's chest. \"Mmm, I smell hotdogs.\" He thought as he finally opened his eyes and facing the stand. <br>\r\nHe tried to talk and tell Ashley that he wanted a hotdog. He opened his mouth and remembered that he had lost his voice. What really threw him off was when he turned around and instead of seeing Ashley at the game, he saw Pete.<br>\r\n\"Oh that's right, I'm with Pete and his friends\" He thought to himself. \"I am so out of it.\"<br>\r\nHe smiled at Pete and then leaned against him. \"Wow, Pete's jacket is really soft too, just like Ashley's was.\"<br>\r\n\"Sam, I think you have a fever. When you were leaning on me, I could tell that you were burning up.\" Pete tried talking to Sam, but Sam just made a sad face.<br>\r\n\"Do you want something to eat, maybe that will help?\" he asked.<br>\r\nAgain Sam just made a sad face and then leaned on him again.<br>\r\nSam heard Pete order him a hot dog. Sam opened his eyes again and looked up, seeing Pete and he worded \"I LOVE YOU!\" to him.<br>\r\nPete smiled and felt really good. He wrapped his arms around Sam body from behind.<br>\r\nSam felt comfortable and leaned his head against Pete's face.<br>\r\n\"I love when Ashley cuddles me like this\", he thought as he felt safe in her arms.<br>\r\nPete loved that Sam was comfortable enough to let him hold her like this and that she pressed her face against his. He hesitated but then took a chance and turned his head to face hers and kissed her slowly on the cheek.<br>\r\nHe saw Sam smile at this.<br>\r\nPete saw that the 2 hotdogs and drinks that he ordered were ready so he released his hold on Sam and reached for his wallet. <br>\r\nAgain Sam opened his eyes to see what happened and where Ashley went. He turned around and saw Pete paying for food. <br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, I keep forgetting I'm not here with Ashley.\" He remembered. \"It's hard to think though, especially when it's only been Ashley and I doing stuff together alone for the longest time since we moved here.\" he continued trying to think straight.<br>\r\nPete walked with Sam after he payed and brought his date over to a bench that no one was sitting at. He placed Sam down and then sat right next to her. Sam leaned against Pete again.<br>\r\nPete had the food tray on his lap and he handed Sam a hot dog.<br>\r\nSam took the hotdog and looked at it and saw it was plain. <br>\r\nPete saw her staring at the hotdog. \"Did you want ketchup for it?\"<br>\r\nSam nodded his head.<br>\r\n\"Ok, I'll be right back, are you going to be alright sitting here for a few seconds?\" Pete asked.<br>\r\nSam again nodded.<br>\r\nPete got up and made his way over to the food fixen's area. <br>\r\nSam snapped out of it for a second but once again his eyelids got really heavy. <br>\r\n\"This reminds me of that rain delay game Ashley and I went to.\" Sam started to think. \"We spent 45 minutes by the food stands waiting for the storm to pass us by. I remember it was one of the best make out sessions we ever had. God I love her, she is so sexy.\" He continued to think.<br>\r\nWhen Pete came back he approached the bench and saw Sam with her eyes closed but with a big smile on her face. She was wobbling back and forth and it looked like she was going to sway backwards right off the bench.<br>\r\nPete quickly ran to her and leaned down behind her just as she started going back.<br>\r\nShe did just that, and landed right into Pete's arms.<br>\r\n\"Oh good Ashley's back\" Sam thought as he felt her again holding him. It was really hard for him to keep his eyes opened so he kept them shut.<br>\r\n\"Maybe I should just surprise her with another make out session while we wait for the game to start.\" He thought.<br>\r\nAs Pete lifted Sam's smaller body frame up and with Sam still in his arms he faced the opposite direction of the bench and had Sam sitting on his lap. To his surprise Sam grabbed Pete's head from behind the neck and pulled him in close. His lips smashed against Sam's as Sam started kissing him hard.<br>\r\nPete of course put up no struggle as he slowed Sam's pace down a little. He grabbed Sam's face and kissed Sam's lips slowly. Sam parted his lips and allowed Pete to insert his tongue.<br>\r\nPete inched his hand up to Sam's chest and slowly started touching his breasts. He thought to himself that they felt so soft.<br>\r\nOf course unknown to him, it was reallly a sock under Sam's trapped hoodie, that Pete was caressing.<br>\r\nThen thoughts streamed through Pete's head about Sam's mom and how she told his uncle that she didn't want anything to happen to Sam and then the talk that Pete's uncle had with him, and how he didn't want him even kissing her.<br>\r\n\"Damn\" He thought as he pulled his lips away from Sam.<br>\r\nSam was stuck in make out mode and again pulled Pete's head close and continued kissing him.<br>\r\nPete stood up off the bench with Sam still in his arms and attached at the lips and then put Sam down on the bench and then sat down himself.<br>\r\n\"mmmm, I love Ashley's lips.\" Sam thought.<br>\r\nPete snapped Sam out of it as he once again put the hotdog in his date's hands. <br>\r\nSam looked down and saw the hotdog. His head was really cloudy and he couldn't focus. He saw someone putting a ketchup packet across the top of the hotdog.<br>\r\n\"Comon' you have to get something in your stomach besides NyQuil and beer.\" Pete said as he made Sam take a bite of the hotdog.<br>\r\nSam did bite the hotdog and then looked next to him as he started to chew.<br>\r\nHe quickly became aware of his surroundings and looked around behind him. \"Where's Ashley?\" he thought. \"Oh shit, I really am out of it, I keep thinking I'm here with Ashley.\" Sam tried clearing his head as he chewed the hotdog.<br>\r\n\"mmm, Pete's right though, this hotdog hits the spot.\" Sam thought as he took another bite.<br>\r\nPete and Sam sat and ate their hotdogs on the bench. Sam stayed focused while he ate.<br>\r\nHe opened the top off the coffee and saw that it was black coffee, he nudged Pete's arm and without words pointing to inside the coffee and then raised his shoulders.<br>\r\n\"Oh, you need cream and sugar?\" Pete asked.<br>\r\nSam nodded.<br>\r\n\"I'll be right back.\" Pete got up and ran to the fixin area again.<br>\r\nSam's throat really hurt and his lips were dry. He opened up his fanny pack and pulled out what looked like chapstick.<br>\r\nStill unable to focus, what Sam was pulling the cap off of was a nude color lipstick that belonged to his girlfriend Ashley.<br>\r\nAs Pete approached Sam, he saw that Sam was alert and applying lipstick to her lips. \"She looks fabulous!\", he thought to himself.<br>\r\nSam finished applying the lipstick and put the tube back into his fanny pack. He pursed his lips to make sure that the chapstick was on both lips.<br>\r\n\"Oh man, her lips look so good. I just want to kiss her again, but I have to control myself.\" He thought as he reached the bench.<br>\r\n\"So what do you say, we go and catch this game.\" Pete said to Sam.<br>\r\nSam looked up and saw his friend. He got up and still with a cloudy head and leaning into his buddy and they went to find their seats.<br>\r\nSometime later while Sam and Pete were still at the game. Mr. Stevens was just finishing up putting his papers away. Ashley also was cleaning up bowls and glasses that the two of them had used.<br>\r\n\"I loved the ideas you have for this project Ashley. You are amazing for this job, I'm really lucky to have you on my team.\" Mr Stevens said as he continued to clean up.<br>\r\nThank you Patrick, that means a lot to me. I really enjoy my job and I can't wait to get going on \"Dazzle Me.\" She replied as she started to take thier wine glasses off the table. <br>\r\n\"Should I open another bottle of wine? We have a little more time til the kids'game ends.\"Ashley asked.<br>\r\n\"Only if you join me in one of these.\" Mr Steven's replied as he pulled out a fresh cigar from his breast pocket.<br>\r\nAshley liked that idea. \"We could go sit out on the front balcony and wait for them there.\" Ashley said.<br>\r\n\"Great!\" Mr Steven's carried the glasses and Ashley carried out the wine and the two stepped out onto the balcony.<br>\r\nThere was a small table there and two chairs right next to each other.<br>\r\nAfter they both sat. Ashley grabbed the two glasses and filled them. While Patrick bit off the end of the cigar and clicked open his zippo and lit the large cigar.<br>\r\nHe puffed on it a few times and then handed it to Ashley who expertly did the same.<br>\r\nThe two talked and laughed for awhile as they realized they had a lot in common.<br>\r\n\"I love a woman who can appreciate a good cigar.\" He said.<br>\r\n\"Well I haven't really been around anyone who liked to smoke them so I haven't in awhile.\" Ashley replied.<br>\r\n\"Does your daughter know you like them?\" Patrick asked.<br>\r\n\"She knows I have in the past but doesn't like them.\" She replied.<br>\r\n\"How did Samantha start smoking? Was there a guy in your life that smoked around her growing up?\" Mr Steven's asked subtly.<br>\r\n\"No, no other man. It's just been Sam and I for a long time. I guess she just sort of picked it up\" Ashley replied. She knew where Patrick was going with this and she was a little worried only because she's had a few glasses of wine already in her and she didn't want to say the wrong thing.<br>\r\n\"well, you just have to wait for the right guy. A guy that will appreciate you.\" he said and then smiled. \"A guy that is the same height as you.\" He glanced at Ashley as he hinted at that and she smirked.<br>\r\nHeadlights suddenly shined on the two, it was...</span></div></div>",

He hadn't seen his uncle or Ashley smoking their cigar on the front patio as he got out of the car and ran around to the passenger side of the car.<br>\r\nHe opened the car door and kneeled down. <br>\r\nSeconds later he stood back up with a passed out Sam in his arms.<br>\r\nHe kicked the passenger door closed with his foot and walked to the stairs that led up to the apartment.<br>\r\nMr. Steven's made himself known as he saw his nephew carrying Sam.<br>\r\n\"Is she alright?\" He asked as he met him at the top of the stairs.<br>\r\nPete was startled as he finally saw his uncle and Ashley. \"She's burning up.\" He replied.<br>\r\nMr Stevens grabbed the sleeping Sam from Pete's arms. <br>\r\nAshley opened the door and Mr Stevens followed her in.<br>\r\nOnce inside Ashley tried to grab Sam from her boss' arms. \"I'll take her from here.\" <br>\r\n\"Nonsense, she is really light, where is her bedroom?\" He asked.<br>\r\nAshley didn't want Mr Stevens to see that Sam's bedroom was also her bedroom so she led him over to the couch.  \"Just set her here.\"  <br>\r\nAshley was finally relieved when Mr Stevens put Sam down because he would really feel stupid to see her boss carrying him to bed.<br>\r\nQuickly Ashley covered her sleeping boyfriend with a large comforter.<br>\r\n\"I hope she's alright.\" Pete exclaimed.<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" Mr Stevens asked.<br>\r\n\"She was just really out of it at the beginning of the game. I fed her a hotdog and she seemed fine. Just about near the end of the game, she got sick all over the women's room floor, so I carried her to the car and we left.\" Pete explained.<br>\r\n\"I'm sure she'll be fine, I'll let you know tomorrow once she wakes up, but for now, lets just let her sleep.\" Ashley said trying to get the guys out for the night.<br>\r\nMr Steven's grabbed his briefcase and followed Pete to the door.<br>\r\n\"I really hate to bring this up right now Ashley, but is there anyway you could come into the office tomorrow? I know your daughter isn't feeling well but maybe your sister could come over and stay with her neice for a few hours.\" Mr. Stevens explained.<br>\r\n\"Oh I don't know Patrick. I feel really bad that she got sick at the game, I just want to make sure she's ok.\" Ashley replied still trying to end the evening.<br>\r\n\"Ok, well could you please at least call me, I have the Dazzle Me group coming in and I wanted to show them some of your ideas, but it would be better if you were with me.\" He replied.<br>\r\nAshley knew the meeting tomorrow was important. She wanted to be there, but she also wanted to be there for her boyfriend. \"I'll let you know first thing in the morning, ok?\" She said.<br>\r\n\"Fair enough, once again, Thank you again for a wonderful work session. Again, I gotta tell you...you amaze me and I'm excited to see where this contract is going.\" Mr STevens said. Then continued and added, \"Among other things\" He said as rubbed Ashley's hand.<br>\r\nAshley blushed and thanked her boss and then closed the door behind them.<br>\r\nAshley saw her sleeping boyfriend and walked over to him. She tried to undress him to make him feel more comfortable while he slept but her sister and her had jammed the zipper of the hoodie really well and there was no way she was getting it opened tonight.<br>\r\nShe sat on the end of the couch and looked at him. \"Is that lipstick?\" She thought.<br>\r\nThen leaned over and grabbed a tissue and wiped Sam's lips. Sure enough, it was her color that Sam had used.<br>\r\nShe wondered how it came about that he put that on.<br>\r\nShe got up and shut off the lights and went to lay down in her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning Ashley crept by her sleeping boyfriend on the couch and grabbed the phone.<br>\r\nShe was already fully dressed in her work clothes and was ready to go.<br>\r\nShe tiptoed her way into the bathroom and locked the door. Quickly she turned on the shower to make some noise, and then dialed the phone.<br>\r\nOn the other end of the line, Ashley's sister Pam picked up the phone.<br>\r\n\"Morning!\" She answered.<br>\r\nAshley whispered into the phone. \"Pam, I have to ask you for a big favor.\"<br>\r\n\"What's up?\" She asked.<br>\r\nAslhey swallowed hard. \"Can you come and sit with Sam for awhile. I have to go into work. It's really important and..\" <br>\r\n\"Sure\" Pam interupted Ashley's rant.<br>\r\nAshley stopped and heard her sister already say yes. \"Oh! I thought you'd put up a little fight being that you aren't too fond of Sam.\" Ashley replied.<br>\r\n\"Well, you are correct and the only reason that I'm saying yes is because you're going to be spending the day with Patrick.\" She explained.<br>\r\n\"Pam, you know I'm staying with Sam and nothing is ever going to ruin that. Patrick and I work together, and plus, he's my boss.\" Ashley explained to her sister.<br>\r\nPam sighed on the phone, \"Ok, so what time are you going into work?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, I kind of needed you now, if possible?\"Ashley said, hoping that it was ok.<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm getting coffee and I'm just down the road. I'm curious though, why can't you just leave him a note and he'll get it when he wakes up?\" Pam asked.<br>\r\n\"Well being that he's dressed the way that he is, I was hoping you could come over and kind of get him out of the hoodie and bra and other stuff before he woke up.\" Ashley again hesitantly explained.<br>\r\n\"You go, I'll take care of Sam, just leave the door unlocked and I'll get him changed. Don't worry about anything.\" Pam replied.<br>\r\n\"Oh you are the best sis. I'm leaving now. Thanks again. I'll call you before I come home.\" Ashley said as she hung up her phone and grabbed her purse and car keys and ran out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPam got in the car with her coffee and started her car. Before she drove she dialed another number.<br>\r\n\"Hi, I'd like to make an appointment this morning....\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He turned over to try and get the blood flowing in it again.<br>\r\nHe swallowed and felt the sore throat yet again. He opened his eyes and saw Pam, Ashley's sister sitting on the other end of the couch where his feet were stretched. She startled him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe still couldn't speak, \"What the hell are you doing here?\" He mouthed to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, still can't talk? That's a shame.\" she replied leaning over to the side table next to the couch.<br>\r\nOn the table was a full shot of Nyquil. She leaned back toward Sam and handing him the full shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam, who's throat was still really sore didn't quiestion the dosage and swallowed the whole shot down.<br>\r\nPam had the Nyquil bottle in her hand as Sam handed the dosage cup back to Pam.<br>\r\nOnce he handed it back to her, she started filling it back up to the rim. <br>\r\n\"Maybe you beter take one more for good measure.\" She said as she handed Sam another full shot of the nighttime medicine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam took the shot and afterward Pam handed him a can of Sprite with a straw. <br>\r\nSam immediately started sucking down the can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ashley asked me to come over and stay with you so that you wouldn't be alone.\" Pam explained.<br>\r\nSam rolled his eyes and then rolled over on the couch facing the other way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no you don't\" Pam began. Sam lifted his head to see what Pam was saying.<br>\r\n\"I have errends to run today and  you're going to come with me.\"  Pam continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam put his head back down.<br>\r\n\"Come on! Get up!\" Pam demanded as she stood up off the couch.<br>\r\nShe pulled the blanket that was draped over Sam away. Once again Sam looked up at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?\" He mouthed.<br>\r\n\"I said, I'm running errends today and you're going with me.\" She again repeated.<br>\r\nSam had a scared look on his face. On the one hand, he was still feeling really sick, but on the other hand, he was a little scared of Pam.<br>\r\nShe was bigger than he was and she looked like she meant buisness. <br>\r\nSam draped his legs off the couch and slowly sat up.<br>\r\nHe looked around the coffee table and found a piece of memo paper and a pen.<br>\r\nHe started writing something with Pam still hovering above him, waiting to read what he wrote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe handed the paper to Pam.<br>\r\nShe grabbed it and read it. It said, \"I didn't even shower\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPam laughed. \"Well, lucky for you the first stop is the salon, I need my nails done and I'll have them wash your hair there\" she said.<br>\r\nSam wrote again onto another memo pad paper. Once again he handed it to Pam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a wash though, NO HAIRCUT!\" He wrote in big letters.<br>\r\nSam didn't care about having his hair washed at the salon. As long as they didn't cut it, he was fine.<br>\r\nPam stood behind Sam and grabbed the hat from his head. It pulled Sam back onto the couch. <br>\r\nSam worded, \"HEY!\"<br>\r\n\"Oh calm down. I just wanted that thing off so I can pull back your hair.<br>\r\nPam took a scrunchie and pulled back Sam's hair into a high ponytail.<br>\r\nWhen she was finished Sam got up and immediately folded his arms and began to shiver. He was still really sick. <br>\r\nHe looked down and saw that he still had on the stuck hoodie. His chest was still pushed out from the layers of undershirts that Ashley told him she wrapped him in. He tried to once again unzipper the zipper that was jammed.<br>\r\nPam saw that Sam was trying to unzipper it.<br>\r\n\"I tried while you were asleep to get that thing off.\" She explained.<br>\r\nHe again made the breasts motion as he grabbed at his chest.<br>\r\nPam laughed, \"It does look like you have breasts. Maybe they can try something at the salon. Come on, we have to go. It's just about time for my appointment.\" Pam rushed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam looked around the room for his shoes.<br>\r\n\"What are you doing now?\" She asked.<br>\r\nSam pointed at his feet.<br>\r\n\"Come on. We don't have time for this.\" Pam was starting to get angry.<br>\r\nSam was looking under the couch, under the blankets, and all around the living room for his shoes.<br>\r\nPam smiled slightly. She had hidden Sam's shoes while he slept. She had placed a pair of Ashley's heeled sandals in the doorway. She leaned over and picked them up.<br>\r\nShe handed the pair to Sam.<br>\r\n\"Please Sam, I'm going to be late just put these on.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam looked at Ashley's sandals. THey had flowers on them and the back of the heel was raised a little.<br>\r\nHe made a face of disgust and then tried handing them back to Pam.<br>\r\nPam refused to grab the sandals as the two started pushing them back and forth.<br>\r\nFinally Pam had enough and yelled at Sam. \"PUT THE DAMN SHOES ON!\" <br>\r\nSam couldn't believe Pam got that angry but again, Sam was a still a little scared, so he threw the shoes on the floor and then guided his foot into both sandals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally, now come on!\" she said as she rushed Sam out the door and closed it behind him.<br>\r\nPam rushed Sam to her car. He was having a hard time walking in Ashley's sandals. Pam just smiled and laughed to herself at how much taller she was than Sam even in a slight heel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPam started the car and drove like a maniac down the main street.<br>\r\nSam put on his shades, as Pam noticed that the Nyquil looked like it was starting to hit him. His head bobbed a few times during the drive, but he ended up making it there without falling asleep.<br>\r\nPam parked the car and then walked with Sam through the front door of the salon.<br>\r\n\"Hello Pamela, you're just in time.\" The front receptionist said.<br>\r\nSam was really starting to get lightheaded, cause he went straight for the waiting room chairs and plopped down in it.<br>\r\nPam approached the front desk.<br>\r\n\"Who's the kid?\" The woman asked.<br>\r\nPam leaned in as she signed herself and Sam's name on the registry.<br>\r\nShe made sure to put \"Samantha\" down.<br>\r\n\"That's my sister's daughter Samantha. My niece.\" She explained. She looked over at Sam to see if she heard anything that she had sad, but now Sam was asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh she's cute. What are we going to do for her today?\" The woman asked.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Once they were secured and properly shaped, Tricia painted them a bright shade of pink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdditionally, Sam's toenails were also shaped and buffed, before being painted the very same pink color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is definitely her shade.\" Sandra remarked as she positioned a dryer dome over Sam's head, the heat keeping him asleep and blissfully unaware of what was going on outside his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Meanwhile, Sam was enjoying himself. At first he was sitting in bed with Ashley next to him and playing with his hair. She got a little rough at one point, but she seemed to have calmed down. Then, he was on-stage at a gig, tearing it on the guitar.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving finished with her appointment, Pam poked her head into the room where they were handling Sam and couldn't help but grin at what she saw. With his hair in curlers and his feet having foam separators in between the toes, Sam was turning out to be quite the teen beauty, more than good enough for the Dazzle Me campaign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think she needs some color on her face.\" Tricia said, as her and Sandra started to attack Sam's face with various cosmetics, blush, lipstick, the works.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they finished that, the dryer was done with its work, and Sandra and Tricia started to undo the curlers. Pam walked into the room to check on Sam, being quite pleased by what she saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my...\" Pam grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be the aunt, she's quite the looker, isn't she? Better hope her mom is ready for her to be bringing a different boy home every day of the week.\" Sandra giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should we wake her up?\" Tricia asked, as Sam started to stir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPam froze, if Sam woke up and saw himself, even with laryngitis, the game would be over... but what if she got him out of there fast enough that he couldn't see himself?

You went with your sister, who is two years older than you, Karen. Your parents didn't trust you alone outside the country yet, and she wanted to go too. You had separated on the first day of your two week trip, and you were currently wandering around the city.You decided to go check out the castle, and when you approached it, you saw a girl hanging off the wall. You ran to the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Are you okay?\" you shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quiet! I'm fine.\" she said, as she scaled the wall down and landed in front of you. She stood up and you looked at eachother intently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face was familiar to you, in fact, it was almost your own face, just softer, and on this girl's body. She was as intrigued as you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my.\" she said. \"You look like me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, the guards probably heard you scream, so I gotta get out of here. Take this.\" she handed you a piece of paper. \"Gotta run!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran off and you started to walk away from the castle, as you heard the guards run past where you were formerly standing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess Alexia!\" they shouted. \"Get back here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, back at your hotel, you looked at the piece of paper.

Go shave in the bathroom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pointed toward a door, and you walked into what you assumed was her private bathroom. It was beautiful. Clean, and pretty big considering she was the only one to use it. You spotted a razor and shaving cream on the edge of the tub and started to shave.

Then she worked on your face, applying enough make-up to soften your features and make you appear feminine. Your hair and her's were very similar in length so she just brushed it differently and cut it a bit to make your hair feminine, giving you her girly bangs. You looked in the mirror and saw Princess Alexia, with her brown pixie cut, and delicate features. You did still look like you so that was a plus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, now it's my turn.\" she said, as she went behind the screen, emerging a few minutes later with her breasts binded and wearing your clothes. She had gotten rid of any trace of femininity and you two looked like each other now. Except that you weren't dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do I wear?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything you'd like, except I should pick the outfit so no one suspects anything. Gimme a sec.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went to the closet and pulled out a floral skirt, that was about mid-thigh length, a powder blue blouse, and a pair of brown leather boots that were thankfully flats. You put them on, and you stood facing each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to give you the run down on my life. There's my mom, Queen Valanice. She's a bit overbearing, and she'll either try to get you in a poofy dress or bring suitors around. Tell her that you don't want to see suitors and you'll probably have to wear the dress. Sorry. Then there's my dad, King Graham. I have him wrapped around my finger. He won't be any issue for you.\" Alexia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's my sister at the hotel, but she's probably out at a club or sightseeing, so I haven't really seen her around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, I guess I'll see you if I return.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you return.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right.

Open this door this instant!\" a voice shouted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked over to the door and opened it. Who's behind the door?</span></div></div>",

She got tired of watching television and wanted to do something else. \"I want to play dollies, but its not as fun without someone else.\" she said clearly wanting you to play with her.\"Why don't you go bug Alexis to play dollies with you. I already let you interrupt my nap\" you snapped back.  Amelia started whining over this 'She said she's busy working on homework and doesn't want to play. Your not doing anything so you have to!\" For some reason you felt that you really did have to play with your sisters dolls. The next hour was spent with your sister as you dressed up her dolls and made up stories. Amelia was really having fun, but she couldn't understand why you so easily agreed to play with her. You ended up doing anything she told you to that day. She decided to try and test it with something she knew you would never do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did she tell you to do?</span></div></div>",

She gave it to you and told you \"You should use this to paint your toenails tonight. Its a really cute color, your toenails will be so pretty.\" After she gave it to you Amelia ran off eager to see later what would happen. You wanted to just put it down somewhere, but you found yourself bringing it to your room. You felt like you were in a trance as you applied the nail polish and waited for it dry. When it was done you felt embarrassed and put on some socks to hide it. You would have to sneak some nail polish remover in from your sister. The day was a really weird one with all that happened and you just needed to go to bed. Later in the night when you were asleep, Amelia snuck into your room to see if you used the nail polish. When she removed one of your socks and confirmed that you did,she gained a wide smile.  She didn't know why, but you had to do anything she told you and she knew he could have  a lot of fun with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you went to get breakfast in the morning you were greeted by Amelia. She asked you if you used the nail polish and you unconvincingly told her no.  She just giggled clearly not believing you and sat down to eat. As you were eating your sister realized that you might try to get rid of the nail polish. She thought of a plan that would fun and make things easier in the future. First Amelia told you \"You never find it odd when I tell you should do something or what you never or usually do.\" With that she could give all the commands she wanted and you would never suspect anything. Next she could kill two birds with one stone regarding your nails \" Your nails don't look so good. You should take great care of them, you should grow them out and shape them. You should also never chip at your nails or use nail polish remover without asking me, you might damage your nails.\" After Amelia was done talking, you looked down at your nails and felt like something was off. Later you found your sister on the couch watching a girly show.  She saw you and asked if you wanted to watch it with her. You refused, but she said it was your favorite show and you loved to watch it with her. You decided to watch it  just for a minute, although you ended up really getting into it and spent hours there. Your sister decided that she wanted to make another change she would change out something you use. She narrowed her options to getting you new undergarments, or new toys.</span></div></div>",

Smart suits, mainly black, navy and gray, probably at her aunt's insistence. You didn't know her age, but she was definitely in college, so you knew you had a shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she noticed.

Like many, he was looking for work trying to find anything to pay the bills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was approached one afternoon by a mysterious person he had never met, Cody was told he could make $2,000 in one night. All he would have to do is stand somewhere and look around...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis sounded far too sketchy...However rent was due next week. What else could he do? Reluctantly Cody agreed. He told a time and place and just to show up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat decision would come to haunt Cody forever. When he arrived at the desired place that night he found himself at the scene of bank robbery already in progress....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo make matters worse there was a dead security guard on the outside. No one else was anywhere to be scene. It seemed the gang had already made their getaway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever Cody was still there. Set up as the fall guy with his face now on camera. He had been tricked...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the police sirens got closer and closer panic set in for Cody. He ran down an alley as he heard the cops right on his tail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was late. So all the businesses were closed. He was desperate, terrified, looking for anywhere he could hide. Looking around he saw the lights were on at what looked like a salon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRushing over to it he found the back door unlocked as he ran inside quickly and hid himself in a supply closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sounds of footsteps were near. The sounds of cops yelling to circle the alleyway could be heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when Cody heard the door to the supply closet open. Looking up he saw a very effeminate Latino man looking down at him. He had very well styled hair and a very well styled curly mustache. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d He asked with an angry tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease....I\u2019m innocent!

I should have you arrested!\u201d The man said angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease! I will do anything!\u201d Cody begged on his hands and knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnything?\u201d The man asked with a curious look and smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes!\u201d Cody said as he heard a pounding on the back door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStay here and don\u2019t say a word.\u201d The man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPolice open up!\u201d The cops said pounding on the salon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man opened up the back door and looked to the cops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes? What\u2019s the problem officers?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere was a bank robbery around the block, we think a suspect in on the run around here. Have you seen anything?\u201d They asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo officers. I heard the noises but I am here doing inventory for my shop.\u201d He saidz<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine...What is your name?\u201d They asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiguel....Miguel Rodriguez. That\u2019s why this Salon is called Miguel\u2019s.\u201d He said pointing to the sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell sorry to disturb you. If you hear anything please let us know.\u201d The Police said before leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes Miguel let Cody out of the supply closet once the police had left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you! Thank you so much! How can I repay you?\u201d Cody asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell....I actually have something in mind....\u201d Miguel said with a smile. </span></div></div>",

Miguel grabbed it and showed Cody into the stockroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be back in the morning. Goodnight, Katy.\" Miguel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodnight.\" Cody said as Miguel locked the store and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody lay down onto the bed and wondered what tomorrow would bring.</span></div></div>",

Cody sat up and saw Miguel, carrying a drink tray with two cups of coffee in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rise and shine, my dear.\" Miguel grinned. \"Time to finish up, and get you ready for your first day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What time is it?\" Cody asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little after 7.\" Miguel replied. \"Now get up, and put on what's in the bag.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right.\" Cody said, hesitantly grabbing the bag and looking inside. \"You can't be serious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deathly.\" Miguel glared. \"Unless you'd rather turn yourself in... I imagine they'd probably like a pretty thing like you in lockup...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do it, I'll do it!\" Cody started pulling out what was inside the bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Allow me.\" Miguel reached into the bag and grabbed a bottle of glue and a pair of false breasts. \"Shirt off, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody sighed and removed his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hairless, by choice or coincidence?\" Miguel chuckled as he prepped the breasts before sticking them to Cody's chest and holding them for several seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this really necessary?\" Cody asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not entirely, but better safe than sorry. Plus, my clientele are mostly women, they can spot a fake from miles away.\" Miguel replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe same method was employed with a gaff, and soon, Cody was dressed in a matching bra and panty set, and a casual dress. Miguel re-applied the makeup, and 3/4 inch acrylic nails were attached to Cody's hands, painted pink, along with Cody's toenails being painted the same color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now, these.\" Miguel took out a shoebox and handed it to Cody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody, who by now had no intent of talking back to Miguel, opened the box, to find a pair of pink peep-toe heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heels?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't have you running off, now can I?\" Miguel laughed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at himself in a full-length mirror, Cody couldn't deny that he looked nothing like he had the night before. Whoever the cops were after, it wasn't \"Katy\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe I let you do this to me.\" Cody said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe you agreed.\" Miguel said. \"Now, Katy, let's get you up to speed on your responsibilities...\"</span></div></div>",

Your parents were rich industrialists, and had the means to spoil their only child as much as they wanted... which was nice when they were around, not so much when they weren't, which was often. This was one of those cases. They were going globetrotting and decided to send you away to school, because it was cheaper than giving you free reign of the mansion. At least that was your theory. You thanked the driver and climbed out of the car, before the driver grabbed your bags from the trunk and handed them to you, before getting back in the car and driving off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked up to the security gate, carrying/wheeling your bags, and the guard took a look at you, seeming incredulous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Name?\" the guard asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harper Erikson.\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard looked down at the sheet and their eyes widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we are. Says here that you're to report to the main office. Once you're in the building, it's a left down the hall and it should be straight ahead.\" the guard replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gate opened and you walked in, seeing some students milling about near the front doors. A few groups of girls sat around chatting, stopping when they saw you approaching. They didn't say anything, but you knew that this was a case of gawk at the new kid, with your family moving around a lot, this happened a lot. In fact, with this being your senior year, it marked the fourth straight new school you'd been in in high school. Not helped by the fact that this was sprung on you right before summer break ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked inside and immediately made your way to the main office. The secretary inside was busy typing when you cleared your throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, excuse me.\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked up and immediately, her eyes widened, just like the guard's. She shifted uncomfortably, and so you took that as meaning that you should introduce yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Harper Eriksen. I'm a new student, I was told to come here...\"  you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe secretary continued staring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there a problem?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... maybe I'd better let the headmistress explain.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of muffled arguing between the headmistress, Mrs. Graheme and her secretary, you were now sitting in the headmistress's office, as she attempted to explain the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And so you see, Mr. Eriksen, this is an all-girl's school, but because of your unisex name... there was some sort of computer error.\" she said. \"You were assigned here by mistake, but because your parents are currently unreachable, we have a legal obligation to house you until the error can be rectified.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" you started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, despite the fact that we don't normally accept boys... you will be enrolled here for the time being, at least until an appropriate co-ed or all-boy's school can be found.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right.\" you said. \"It's not ideal, but sharing a campus with a bunch of girls doesn't sound too bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckled, though Mrs. Graheme didn't seem amused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do apologize, but we will have to inform the entire campus about your presence, so you won't just be another student. Everyone will know who you are.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that's okay.\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, there's just the matter of living arrangements. We have suites, so you'll only be sharing communal spaces and not a bedroom with the other girls... Your class schedule is right here...\" she handed you a sheet of paper. \"I think the first thing  we should do is...\"</span></div></div>",

Just graduated high school, and about to start the last summer before college on a road trip with your girlfriend. Unfortunately, those plans got derailed. The why is a bit hard to explain. About 25 years ago, geneticists discovered how to engineer babies to be what the parents wanted. While attempts to bolster intelligence and skills weren't entirely up to snuff, the question of gender was no longer an issue. Parents no longer had to play the lottery and could request what gender they wanted their baby to be. Your mother was one of those people, a fact that had been kept hidden from you until now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"How could you have never told me?\" you demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When they told me that you were a boy, and that the process failed, I just... I accepted it. Sure, I wanted a daughter at the time, but I knew I'd love you no matter what. It didn't seem relevant.\" she responded, sadly.<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\nThis argument was sparked after you spent a week with a supposed cold, before you started feeling pain in every part of your body. A trip to the doctor confirmed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a reaction to the prenatal procedure done.\" the doctor had stated. \"Somehow, the genetic engineering laid dormant for eighteen years, and is now finishing the job it started in the womb. Which will rewrite your body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there a way to reverse it? Stop it?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately, the science is still pretty new. We can't stop it, the most we can do is make the transition easier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Transition? But I'm not transgender! I don't want to be a girl! I have a girlfriend, for crying out loud!\" you shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Personalities don't usually shift in situations like this, but I may prescribe that you meet with a counselor to work through the emotional baggage.\" the doctor said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What will I even look like?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Presumably, a female version of who you are now, that's the only part of the fetus that was altered.\" the doctor replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just wanted to go home and curl up into a ball. While you were laying in bed, the pain having been alleviated by some medication, you heard a knock at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go away!\" you shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please let me in!\" a voice shouted, a voice belonging to...</span></div></div>",

They were pointed to a sitting area. When you walked up, dressed in a casual outfit, the woman looked at you, puzzled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you are?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elliot Wilson...

It brings together teams from all over the world to compete and play for huge cash prizes. Most of these teams are groups of friends who live together  practicing every day for their next big competition. The current most popular game in the world is called Legend. A team based battle royal game where squads of four fight to be the last group standing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are part of one of these teams. A small group of friends from high school who have been living together for the past year. You guys were newcomers on the Major League Gaming Circuit until you won Back to Back Championships two years running. That put your team on the map. This was followed by online streaming, podcasts, video chats, etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Team- Nerd Revolution <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou- Tyler Mathews: Age 21: Race: White: 6\u20191 180lbs<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPosition- Team Leader: You are the team Captain. You organize and the lead the team in co-op games. You strategize and come up with ways to defeat your enemies. You also handle disputes between team members. In combat you take more supportive of defensive approach. Making sure your team stays alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus Lancer- Age 21: Race: Black: 6\u20193 220lbs<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPosition- Rusher. Marcus is your front line man. He specializes in short range, high speed combat situations. He is first to the battle every time and plays the fastest and quickest of all of you. He trades accuracy for speed and is a terror for enemies to try and hit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon Yamoto- Age: 21 Race: Asian: 5\u20198 150lbs<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPosition- Assault. Simon is your main DPS and has the highest kill count of the team. He focuses on midrange damage and suppression. His hair trigger reflexes allow him to quickly react lay down highly punishing amounts of damage to the enemy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuan Gonzalez- Age 21: Race: Hispanic: 5\u20199 160lbs<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPosition- Sniper: Juan is your long range specialist. He is incredibly accurate and rarely misses a shot. He stays in the back as much as possible. Finding the high ground and taking the enemies apart one shot at a time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow a few years later your team is nationally recognized. You are only a few steps behind the best teams in the world. Now a huge opportunity has come into your team\u2019s lap. Atlas Gaming. The world largest professional gaming sponsor has come to your team with an offer. They want to sponsor your team and help you get world wide recognition. This would be merchandise deals, touring, etc. This was the big break your team was waiting for! There was just little snag...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAtlas Gaming felt your team is too...Masculine. Nowadays Professional Gaming has done everything it can to shed off the bad reputation that video games are just for boys. In order for them to take you on as clients they insist you add a girl to the team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first your team did everything you could to recruit a female member. You held open auditions and try outs for any female gamer to try and join you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever one after the other none of them could come close to the skill levels your team requires. While many of the ladies who auditioned were skilled gamers, none of them were on the professional level...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you reported this to Atlas Gaming they came back to you with another option. One of you could undergo DNA Resequencing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDNA Resequence Therapy or DRT or short was a new scientific breakthrough. It allowed a person to physically change their gender from the DNA. This meant the person became a true member of the opposite gender without surgery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a landmark for anyone Transgender or anyone who wasn\u2019t comfortable in their own body. However it was still a new procedure and there were issues with it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe process was irreversible, it was also very controversial. It was only legal in a few states and the laws regarding those who underwent the process were still murky at best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first your entire team refused this option. You and your team were all normal straight guys. Marcus and Juan even have girlfriends that hang out with you sometimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAtlas tried to spin it in a new light. If one of you took the procedure you could sell yourselfs as a champion of female gamers and for DRT as a whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour team still refused. It was asking one of you to give up your life and change it forever. It was too high of a price for anyone of you to pay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever as the weeks went by and your teams numbers and popularity began to slip talks began to surface again. Marcus and Juan began to argue that you or Simon should take the DRT since we were the single ones. Simon argued you should take it as their leader. It would sent a positive message being led by a female gamer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou still refused. No sponsorship was worth giving up your life as a man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caused a fracture in the group. Teamwork and communication was starting to break down. Your team was beginning to lose matches it should have won.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour team pleaded with you again to reconsider taking the DRT. It was a simple pill. It would cause a \u201cmostly painless\u201d transformation. The four of you were sitting at a table currently discussing options as you decided...</span></div></div>",

Got a good girlfriend too,\" Shelly said. \"But it worked though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It did?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, he never misbehaved again. Stopped hanging out with the losers he was with. He's got a great job lined up after graduation. I doubt he'd want to re-live that summer, but I guess it worked! Come to think of it... might work for you, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I couldn't...\" Grace said. \"It's not right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well not like my mom did, but you know, maybe pretend it's some freaky bedroom stuff, maybe he'll act nicer if he spends some time in your shoes.\" Shelly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm....\" Grace started to turn the idea over in her head.

Football was an institution for Northtown, and the game was an event. It was also an event for the rival school, Southtown High. Northtown had been the winner of the game for the last decade, and they knew something had to change. This year, Northtown had been relying heavily on their star quarterback, Brendan Asterman and Southtown knew it. If they could somehow remove him from the game, they might stand a chance. And that's what they decided to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a quick workout, Brendan Asterman returned to the locker room to towel off and head to the last minute practice, to make sure that the team was ship-shape for the big game. When he arrived in the locker room, it was strangely empty, but Brendan didn't think much of it. He quickly opened his locker and grabbed his clothes from it. He pulled on his underwear before he heard a strange sound behind him. Before he could react, he was quickly grabbed from behind and a soaked rag thrust into his face. After a few seconds of resisting, his eyes shut and he fell unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChet Nash smiled as the rival quarterback lay unconscious in front of him. Three other Southtown players quickly ran into the room and grabbed Brendan's other limbs. They lifted him up and put him into a wheeled equipment basket and rolled him out of the school and into the trunk of Chet's car. They drove straight to Southtown and dragged him into their locker room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how are we gonna do this, Chet?\" the running back asked. \"How do we keep him out of the game?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple my friends, we're going to...\" Chet started.</span></div></div>",

If he did this mission, swallowed his pride, he would be set up for life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath he stepped out of his car and went into his work place heading into the elevator and up into the research labs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp there he was greeted by a female doctor he didn\u2019t recognize. She was remarkably attractive for a doctor he thought. She had a great figure, long brunette hair, and wore a tight and rather revealing dress and heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi there you must David, I\u2019m Dr. Lori Langley. You can just call me Lori.\u201d She said shaking his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm...yes. Umm...where is everyone else?\u201d David asked seeing thay the lab was empty except for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo to the nature of the procedure and secrecy of your mission no one else inside GeneTech will be allowed here for this procedure. I will act as your point of contact within here as well as a guide for anything you need regarding the female body you will be given. Any other questions before we begin?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm...what kind of woman am I becoming?\u201d David asked nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Lori laughed a bit at the question. In her mind this was a delicate medical procedure but of a course a typical guy like David was more concerned with his looks...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry. We have put together a DNA profile that we feel will best help you fit in over at InnoTech.\u201d Dr. Lori said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay...it hurt...the change?\u201d David asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere will be some discomfort. Nothing life-threatening but it won\u2019t be jusy a simple transition. The process of reshaping bone-structure, organs, and genetics does take its toll on the body.\u201d Dr. Lori said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid nodded as Dr. Lori instructed to remove his clothes and to lay down on prepped medical table nearby. Dr. Lori than proceeded to strap down his hands and feet preventing him from leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to inject you with a pre-programmed nannite formula mixture. The nanomachines inside will reprogram your DNA and restructure you into the design we have laid out. Once the transformation is complete we will take you for identity processing to introduce you...well...the knew you.\u201d She said taking a needle out that was filled with an odd looking pink fluid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore David could utter a word Dr. Lori stuck the needle in his arm and injected the formula into his body.</span></div></div>",

He screamed as he felt his limbs bubbling. He shut his eyes tightly as the transformation truly began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Lori watched on as the fat in David's body began to redistribute. His legs and arms started to slim as the fat pooled in the chest area. The skin on his face was shifting considerably, as the bones shrank and redistributed. David's hair started to fall out, and almost immediately, was replaced with long blonde hair that began to flow from his scalp. The hair on his arms and legs however, remained gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid clenched his fists, but recoiled when the nails in his hands grew and started stabbing his palms. He screamed again, but was silenced as his vocal chords shifted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis groin began to tingle as his member shrank in and was replaced with the feminine equivalent. At the same time, the fat pooling in his chest began to form into rounded masses that began to sprout forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings began to settle down as David heard a few pops and cracks as everything moved into place. All discomfort was starting to subside, and the pains were going away. David wiggled the toes of his now-dainty feet to test that he still had everything he was supposed to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce everything calmed down, David sighed in relief, but in a different voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations.\" Dr. Lori said, walking over and releasing the restraints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid immediately sat up and brushed the blonde hair from his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I see?\" David asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" Dr. Lori handed David a hand-mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid gazed into the mirror, seeing a face entirely unlike his own. Extremely feminine, small nose, big blue eyes with long eyelashes, lips that were kissable, but not overly plump, overall, the word to describe it would be...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Plain.\" David held a hand to his face. \"I look... plain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Typical male response.\" Dr. Lori scoffed. \"The tech is good, but if you want to look good, you'll have to use makeup, like women have been doing forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I just expected it to be a one and done thing.\" David replied as he angled the mirror down to his well-endowed chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If only.\" Dr. Lori sighed. \"But this works in our favor. There's no better way to make you feel like a woman than to make you learn all the intricacies of cosmetics.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess.\" David said, hopping off the table, and shivering when his feet his the cold metal floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, we've got to get you some proper clothes. Then we can assign your new identity and then get to your training.\" Dr. Lori handed David a white robe, which he quickly pulled over his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or we could do assignment first, then wardrobe. Your choice.\" Dr. Lori said.</span></div></div>",

Looking down he saw a vast valley of cleavage he was not used to. He also noticed his new breasts seemed perfectly rounded and perky. No sag or drop at all. Definitely not the kind of boobs one could get without a doctor\u2019s help. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn...how big are these?\u201d He asked as he also felt up his butt a bit noticing how well rounded it was, they definitely gave him a nice hourglass body it seemed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere is your new identity and IDs. Study your profile carefully. Your act is crucial to get you into InnoTech undetected.\u201d Dr. Lori said as she gave David a minute to read his profile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName- Madison Wilson (AKA Maddie)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge- 22<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeight 5\u20197<br>\r\n <br>\r\nWeight- 110lbs<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHair- Blonde, length to lower back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBust/Bra size- 36DD<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHobbies- Reading, TV (Reality shows and gossip shows), swimming, volleyball, Yoga, coffee, social media.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersonality- Madison or \u201cMaddie\u201d as her friends call her is a young American woman very much obsessed with her personal image and gossip. She enjoys hanging out with her friends, going on dates, hopes to get married one day but only to the right guy. Madison is very much into being feminine. She wears feminine clothing such as dresses, skirts, and heels as much as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBackstory- Maddie has just moved here to the city after being offered a secretary job at InnoTech. This will be her first office job. Her previous job experience included being a waitress at a popular nightclub at night and a barista at a bikini coffee stand during the day. She recently got her breasts augmented from 32Cs to 36DDs in order to help increase her sex appeal to get better tips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe job at InnoTech comes with the help of our mole \u201cLisa Thompson.\u201d Lisa will be playing the role of an old friend from Maddie\u2019s high school that helped get her the job. Lisa will be your contact and new roommate that you will share an apartment with. She will help guide you to stay in character, learn your new body and role. However it is crucial her cover is not compromised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mission is to learn everything you can about InnoTech\u2019s new project code named. \u201cVanity\u201d If our intelligence is correct Vanity is their own DNA restructuring tech that is almost ready for commercial distribution. You must find whatever info you can and copy it using whatever methods necessary. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have been placed strategically as the secretary of one of Vanity\u2019s lead executives Jason Morris. Jason is a young hotshot who has a weakness for beautiful women. He is highly competitive, arrogant, and therefore prone to overlooking small details.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a reminder if you fail in your mission or are compromised in any way GeneTech will dissolve any information regarding you. This means you will be stuck in this body forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath David or rather \u201cMadison\u201d set the folder down as she looked to Dr. Lori.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou will meet Lisa on your first day tomorrow. She was my first project and is very well trained on how to act female and feminine. Use her as a resource to help keep your cover intact. I will act as your contact here. Any data you recover on Vanity is to be reported to me and only to me, is that understood?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison nodded as Dr. Lori smiles. \u201cExcellent. Now follow me to the Wardrobe we shall begin with teaching the basics on makeup and feminine clothing.\u201d <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Dr. Lori led \"Madison\" to the table and sat her down in the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, the first thing we have to do, is ensure that you know your way around every aspect of being a woman. A good start is all the things that make us feel girly. Can't have you going to real salon just yet, so we've brought it here.\" Dr. Lori said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo additional women entered the room and started to get to work, prepping the table and chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're going to show you, and then we'll see how well you can replicate the process.\" Dr. Lori said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right.\" Madison replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison watched as the women got to work on her nails, which were already quite long, trimming them, filing them and painting them a pale pink. After they were done, Dr. Lori had Madison remove the polish and paint them herself, with the first attempt being a bit messy. After a few more tries, they were up to Dr. Lori's satisfaction and they moved onto the toes, before those were also satisfactory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next step was haircare. Madison's hair was clean, but they washed and dried it to give it more volume, before they moved onto makeup. They loaded a mirror onto the table and demonstrated what every item did, foundation, concealer, (not that Madison needed it, with her genetics) eyeliner, mascara, touch-up the brows, and finally lipstick. When they were done, they stepped away from the mirror and an image of Madison appeared on it, with instructions for her to follow, teaching her each individual step. After another few tries, Madison's makeup was perfect, not too heavy, but enough to tell she was wearing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat just left clothes. The outfit she was given was a matching pink bra and thong, followed by a low-cut casual summer dress, also pink, and a pair of matching open-toed heels. Madison took a few wobbly steps in her heels. It was getting easier for David to consider himself Madison, he wasn't sure if it was a psychological thing, or the nanites messing with his head, but he was glad for the help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's next?\" Madison asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next up is...\" Dr. Lori replied.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Dr. Lori led Madison to another room where another woman was sitting at a desk waiting for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMadison this is Tessa. She is a behavior expert in women. She will help you understand how to adapt to your new persona.\u201d Dr. Lori said leaving them together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there Madison. We don\u2019t have a lot of time so have a seat. I\u2019m here to help you understand how Madison thinks and acts. In your mind you are still David. As of now David is long gone. You have to not only act like Madison you have to think like her. Tell me...what do you think Madison is like as a person?\u201d Tessa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm...Girly? Flirty? Boy-obsessed?\u201d Madison said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes...what do all those things have in common? They are SHALLOW...Madison is a shallow person at nature. That\u2019s why she was designed as your undercover body. People don\u2019t think much of shallow people do they? They don\u2019t think much around them because they know those kinds of people aren\u2019t interested in what they have to say. You need to be that for InnoTech. Your new boss will say things he thinks will go over your head, while you are secretly listening.\u201d Tessa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just need to play dumb?\u201d Madison asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo...not dumb...Shallow...There is a difference. Stupid is not knowing who something simple like how many states are there? Shallow is knowing there are 50 states but only being able to name a handle of them because you are thinking of that designer purse you saw yesterday.\u201d Tessa explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo I have to act Vain and superficial?\u201d Madison asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes! Exactly! Look down to your boobs. Those are perfectly rounded DDs. The kind of boobs only trophy wives and porn stars have. Ask yourself why would a person like Madison have them? Because she values her appearance and what others think of her more than anything. You have to project this to everyone. Once they realize you are just a harmless self-obsessed girl the secrets will be easier to obtain.\u201d Tessa explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next several hours Tessa and Madison practiced having girly conversations. Everything from how to talk, laugh, joke, and even body language.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere is another thing of importance....sex. The nanites in your system are designed to react the way Madison\u2019s body normally would around men. This means they have increased your sex drive and you will start to be aroused by men.\u201d Tessa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa whoa...I\u2019m not sleeping with anyone.\u201d Madison said slowing things down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying you have to. I\u2019m saying you can use your sexuality to get close to people. Seduction is one of the oldest and easiest ways to gain information. Keep that in mind.\u201d Tessa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few hours of learning how to talk, act, and flirt Madison was beginning to feel more in character. She was practicing her act on Tessa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! So did you hear? Mark asked Jessica out last night! I know I can\u2019t believe it either! After she slept with Jake I didn\u2019t think he would ever forgive her. Oh this top? You like it? Thanks I thinks it\u2019s kinda slutty but I can\u2019t help it.\u201d Madison said ending her little speech with a girly giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot bad...not bad. You will learn and adapt as you develop your personality at work. Just always remember, people see what they want to see. So hide in plain sight.\u201d Tessa said shaking her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Lori came back in sometime later. She was holding a set of keys in her hand along with a pink smartphone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt seems our time has come to set you on your way Madison. Here is your new set of keys and Phone. Outside is a car take it to the address listed on your phone. There you will have your new apartment which is already fully stocked with clothes and fully furnished. I will expect a report once a week. Call me on the number provided in the phone and only from that phone...\u201d Dr Lori said handing the keys and phone over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath Madison accepting the keys and phone and left the building. She saw outside a yellow VW beetle. It was cute and simple. Perfect for Madison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting in Madison drove off to her new place as her mission officially had begun...</span></div></div>",

Her apartment was on the 3rd floor, and she used her new key to let herself into the place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here goes nothing...\" Madison said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked in to find a darkened room, upon turning the lights on, it was a fairly standard living room, nothing too fancy, and it had a decidedly lived-in feel, with a few fashion magazines strewn about the coffee table. The kitchen was stocked and there were a few dishes sitting in the sink. Madison looked around, and noticed a small annex leading off into two rooms. One room was locked shut, and the other was left open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The other door must lead into Lisa's room. I wonder where she is...\" Madison pondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison let herself into her bedroom, which served to reinforce the identity that she had been assigned. Lots of clothes in the drawers and closet, in various styles, though many tended to be ones that accentuated the female form. There was a vanity, fully stocked, a desk with a computer on it, and a bed. After the day that she'd had, Madison was exhausted, and quickly stripped from her outfit, leaving the dress neatly hanging off of a chair, while she placed her shoes into a shoe-rack in the closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe perused her closet, going through several dresses before she located a nightgown to change into. Her first instinct, a leftover of David, wanted to wear pajama pants, but Madison liked nightgowns, especially the pink sleeveless one that she chose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison quickly stripped out of her bra and pulled the nightgown over her head. She took a few minutes to examine the computer, seeing that Dr. Lori's people had created social media accounts for Madison already. Madison yawned and decided to climb into bed, nervously awaiting the start of her mission.</span></div></div>",

Yawning she looked at the clock realizing it was much earlier then she would have woken up as a guy. After another loud knocking Madison slowly got out of bed and walked over and opened her door. Her eyes immediately widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding there in font of her was a beautiful naked woman. She had long black hair and a great body. Not as voluptuous as her own and her breasts were still natural and not as big. However she was very attractive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey come on get undressed. I\u2019ve got to show you your new morning ritual.\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm....okay....are you Lisa?\u201d Madison said yawning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever would give you that idea....\u201d She said with a sarcastic tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison was a bit nervous at first but she took off her nightgown getting naked as she followed Lisa to the bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was bigger than she expected with a nice large shower and plenty of room to move around. Lisa began to turn on the water as she outlined all the things they were going to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEvery morning you have to wake, shower, shave, do your hair, nails, makeup and dress. It takes awhile so get used to waking up this early. I will show how to do everything this once but don\u2019t be asking me every day.\u201d Lisa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison nodded as the two women climbed into the shower together. Lisa began to show Madison how to shave her legs, and every other part of her. She showed how to wash her long blonde hair and keep it maintained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the shower Lisa showed Madison how to wrap a towel  around her head and body like a woman normally does. She then began to show her how to apply makeup, eyeliner, mascara, foundation, etc. anything she needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter blowing drying and learning how to use a hair straightener Madison was ready to get dressed. However she wasn\u2019t exact sure which outfit to chose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour new boss is a boob and leg man. I recommend wearing something low cut and sexy but not slutty. You still have to make a good impression.\u201d Lisa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison found a black mini dress in her closet. It was low cut enough to wear her large round breasts showed a nice amount of cleavage but it was still tasteful. It also only went to mid thigh so her long smooth legs showed off nicely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe picked out a matching pair of opened toed black heels as she had a matching set of black lingerie on underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison was finally ready as Lisa looked her over and gave a nod of approval. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, I will I introduce you once we arrive but from there you are on your own. From this moment we leave the door we are girly girls and best friends understand?\u201d Lisa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison nodded as she took a deep breath and left on her first day of her new mission. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Walking into the Innotech office, Madison noticed that the place was just as, if not more bustling than GeneTech was. She found herself being slightly self conscious as her heels clicked across floor. As they approached the security desk, Lisa took out an ID card, which she swiped. The machine flashed a green light and the gate opened. The guard sitting at the desk turned to Madison. Lisa quickly took point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lenny! This is my bestie, Madison. She's the new girl I was telling you about. She's gotta be signed into the system.\" Lisa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you.\" Lenny tipped his hat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Likewise.\" Madison replied. \"How does this all work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just place your hand onto this panel.\" Lenny pointed to a glass panel with a light underneath it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison complied and placed her hand down. Seeing her delicate hand next to Lenny's larger, hairier hand was a little strange for Madison. After that, Lenny held out a small device, that looked similar to a diabetes blood monitor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just put your finger on the strip.\" Lenny said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison quickly looked at Lisa, who nodded in approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it.\" Madison said, placing her finger, which was pricked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DNA sample for the company. Helps security, since we know everyone who goes in and out.\" Lenny said. \"We'll have your new ID card made up and sent to your desk. Just let me take a photo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLenny grabbed a camera off the desk and Madison quickly checked her hair and makeup, before posing for the photo, making a suggestive glance at the camera. Lenny shrugged it off and checked the output.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gorgeous. Almost a waste that you're a secretary, cause you'd make a helluva model.\" Lenny said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Madison giggled and twisted a strand of hair in her finger. \"Maybe I'll try that if this doesn't work out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLenny chuckled and tapped a button on the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're free to go up. I'm sure Lisa will show you the way, but Mr. Morris in on the top floor, corner office.\" Lenny said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Len.\" Madison winked as she sauntered through the gate, following behind Lisa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they were far enough away, Lisa turned to Madison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good job, keep that up with Jason Morris and you might be done within the week.\" Lisa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, bestie.\" Madison smiled, proud of herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey entered the elevator and rode it to the top floor. The doors opened and Lisa and Madison stepped out, with Lisa leading Madison to her new desk. When they arrive at the desk...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Madison took the elevator to one of the highest floors in the building. Only high end executives worked this far up. When the elevator opened Madison stepped out and saw the large offices around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou must be Madison. I must say you are even more beautiful then I was told.\u201d A man said stepping in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was very tall, over 6\u20192. He had dark hair that was neatly cut  with a well groomed beard that looked more like professional 5 o\u2019clock shadow. He was wearing a very nice tailored suit and had a really nice build.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you Mr. Morris?\u201d Madison asked in a polite way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, but please just call me Jason. We aren\u2019t that formal here. Do you just prefer Madison or something else?\u201d Jason asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell...my friends call me Maddie.\u201d Madison said blushing a bit as she twirled her hair in a flirtatious manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I wanna start things off on the right foot Maddie. It\u2019s nice to meet you.\u201d Jason said shaking her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe seems like a really nice guy...\u201d Madison thought to herself as she followed Jason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason showed Madison to her desk and went over a few basics. How to use their system and her basic duties. David had trained several of his own secretaries in the past so this was all really basic knowledge to him. However as Madison she tried to look interested and curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a bit of training and introductions to their system Madison was feeling comfortable to start her actual job. She also noticed Jason didn\u2019t seem to want to take his eyes off her. He noticed several times he was glancing at her chest and legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a clacking noise that was suddenly getting louder. Looking up Madison saw another woman walking towards them and suddenly Madison\u2019s eyes widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman looked almost like the cartoon Jessica Rabbit come to life...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had fiery red hair that was almost the length of her body. It was tied up into a long braided bun to be eaisier to walk in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had massive breasts. Even larger than Madison\u2019s obviously enhanced ones. They were also perfectly rounded and definitely not natural.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had very wide hips and a total hourglass figure. A large and perfectly rounded behind along with great and very long legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face was very sensual and her lips very pouty with bright red lipstick. Her skin was very light toned but almost glowing with how it accented her look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for her dress she seemed to take the color red to a bit extreme...She wore a red dress similar to Madison\u2019s. Along with match red heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked over to the two of them smiling gently as she was holding a clipboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see your new assistant arrived. I hope everything is working out fine?\u201d She asked in a somewhat judgemental tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, things are going great. Maddie this is Scarlet Rosenberg. She is the senior Secretary for all the executives on this floor. She will be your primary supervisor for any work related issues.\u201d Jason said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see your tastes haven\u2019t changed much Jason...If you need anything Madison please come and see me. My desk is on the other side of the hall.\u201d Scarlet said shaking Madison\u2019s hand as she gave her a rather deep glare...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm...everything okay Jason?\u201d Madison asked looking up to Jason who had a weird look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah...sorry about that. I won\u2019t bore you with the details but Scarlet used to be my old secretary before she was promoted. We have...something of a history together.\u201d Jason said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison could immediately tell a few things. Scarlet and Jason used to date. Also it appeared that Scarlet had undergone a similar procedure to what she did. Her features were far too perfect and refined. Her body seemed to be sculpted to sexual perfection...This meant Project Vanity wasn\u2019t just an idea after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlet also seemed really suspicious of Madison. She could feel the jealous and judgemental eyes on her...This was not going to make her mission any easier...</span></div></div>",

Seeing Scarlet was a bigger lead than she had expected, Dr. Lori would certainly appreciate that in the weekly report. Madison checked the computer thoroughly, but she didn't have full clearance yet, and many documents were encrypted behind passwords that she didn't have. But she was certain that she'd get a hold of them eventually. Her first few assignments were to clean up after her predecessor, reading emails, replying, answering phones, nothing related to Project Vanity... yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, she did get cleared by security and received her freshly printed ID card, meaning that their DNA scan hadn't told them her true identity and she was safely implanted as Madison. As Madison sat, she remembered a little of what the GeneTech guys had told her... or rather had told David, that her new DNA was unique, but they had connections, so it was placed within a database, so any checks on it would come up with Madison's identity as opposed to a blank page.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After you finish that report for me, you can take lunch.\" Jason said, popping his head out of his office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" Madison replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cafeteria is three floors down.\" Jason said. \"Or you're free to eat with me in here, if you'd like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a nice offer, but I was planning to eat with a friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lisa, right. Made a bang-up recommendation for you. Almost like you were made to work for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison giggled as Jason went back into his office as Madison finished up the report and prepared to leave for lunch.</span></div></div>",

One of the parts of the transformation Madison hated was they changed her appetite so she would get less hungry and crave less unhealthy foods. Maintaining this figure was a huge part of her cover so they built it into the DRT.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found Lisa sitting at a table with a few other girls. They were gossiping and having a good time as Lisa waved her over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey everyone this is my roommate Madison. It\u2019s her first day so let\u2019s make sure she feels welcome.\u201d Lisa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting by Lisa was an Asian girl, black girl, and ginger girl. They were all beautiful girls and if David was still around he would have felt a bit intimidated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god I love your dress!\u201d The Asian said looking at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour hair is amazing!\u201d The black girl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m just gonna say it...Your tits are rocking!\u201d The Ginger girl said with a bit snarky tone as everyone laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMadison this is Lin, Cheryl, and Cassie.\u201d Lisa said pointing to the Asian, Black, and Ginger girl respectively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey everyone! Thanks for having me!\u201d Madison said in a bubbly tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Madison...I just gotta ask...are those things real?\u201d Cassie said pointing to her boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop it...You are always so vulgar.\u201d Cheryl said hitting her shoulder playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat I can\u2019t help it?\u201d Cassie said back with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry about that. Cassie is the group horn dog if you couldn\u2019t tell.\u201d Lin said with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShhh!\u201d Cassie said only pretending to care if everyone knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, Lin is the smart one, I\u2019m the one with attitude, and Cassie is the slutty one. We are a basically a walking sitcom over here...\u201d Cheryl said rolling her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo...what are you then?\u201d Madison said looking over to Lisa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa looked back to Madison with a bit of look. \u201cOh that\u2019s easy...I\u2019m the bitchy one...Right?\u201d Lisa said looking to the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girls dodged that looking at each other for a second pretending they didn\u2019t hear that before laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou could say I\u2019m the leader or the one who keeps them inline...aka the bitch....as I\u2019ve heard in the past...\u201d Lisa said with a stern look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat you told my supervisor I had sex with my boss in the copy room! I just thought that was kinda bitchy thing to do...\u201d Cassie said defensively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe only reason she didn\u2019t get in trouble was she already slept with her supervisor too...\u201d Cheryl said coughing under her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo...bright blonde hair, big fake titties, and a ridiculously sexy body and obviously the hottest one here...You are going to be the girly one now of our group right? The token blonde cheerleader all the guys want?\u201d Cassie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCassie! You are terrible I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d Lin said shooting her a dirty look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo no it\u2019s okay. I...dunno maybe? We just met but maybe we can all go out for a drink sometime?\u201d Madison asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes! Drinks tonight! Maybe we can finally find Lin a man....\u201d Cassie said excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLin blushed as she was also the shy one of the group. Out of all the girls at the table she was dressed the most conservative with a simple blouse and skirt combo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright but I swear to god I\u2019m not covering for any of you again...\u201d Lisa said giving everyone a stern look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls soon finished their lunch and gossiped about random stuff. Madison was a bit surprised at how easy she was starting to fit in. She also felt something odd. A bit of pride knowing she was the hottest of her new friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter lunch Madison returned to work but didn\u2019t see Jason for the rest of the day. He was in meetings and Madison just went about her routine until the day was finally over. </span></div></div>",

Loud music, dancing, just the type of place to unwind after a long day. Despite being a little out of her depth, Madison adapted easily enough, picking the same drink as Lisa before heading over to a booth, sliding in next to Lisa. While walking from the bar, Madison noticed that several people at the bar also worked at InnoTech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See anyone you like?\" Cassie asked, gulping down her drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" Madison blushed. \"No, I just noticed that a lot of people here are from InnoTech.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, this place is sort of the company hangout. Not the higher ups, but the peons like us.\" Cheryl remarked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No shame in browsing the eye-candy, though. Ooh, Lin!

I don't even know where that word came from.\"</i> Madison thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps noticing her momentary spacing out, Lisa brought Madison back into the fray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Maddie, didn't you used to work in a place like this?\" Lisa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I did.\" Madison replied, remembering her training. \"It's sort of where my image came from. Had to be hot to get tips.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you just need to be hot to get a promotion!\" Cheryl laughed. \"Worked for Scarlet, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know her?\" Madison asked. \"I met her this morning... she seemed... interesting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She started around the same time as I did.\" Cassie said. \"Then she spent a week's vacation getting work done and I guess she ticked the right boxes for one of the bosses and she was promoted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By that logic, I should already be the boss!\" Madison giggled and the other girls joined suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mind getting another round?\" Cassie asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all.\" Madison replied, standing up and carrying the tray back to the bar.

He was wearing a suit but had his tie off for casual appearance. He was very well built with tanned skin, dark hair, short and professionally cut. He had a five o clock shadow look that was well trimmed and maintained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison was a bit surprised at how much she was checking him out. If she didn\u2019t know better one could assume she was attracted to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm...Excuse me?\u201d She asked not quite understanding his comment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe lionesses over there.

Nice to meet you...\u201d Max started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMadison! You can call me Maddie.\u201d Madison with a flirty smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice to meet you Maddie. So you just started huh? Have you met the Red Devil yet?\u201d Max said as he coughed the name Scarlet under his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison laughed at the comment as she nodded knowing it was very likely Scarlet could be here or hear of their talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them began to talk and talk. Max went on about how he grew up in a small town but moved to the city to pursue his dreams. He was an only child raised by a single mother. He had been working at InnoTech for almost a year but mostly did grunt work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison did a great job playing her character. She told her background and everything in her profile to Max who seemed to believe it without question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two continued to talk over several drinks and pretty soon Madison began to feel a bit tipsy...More than that she was feeling a bit odd...Her body felt warm...There was something else...A new feeling between her legs...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie\u2019s eyes widened as she realized what it was...She was horny! She had been playing the part so much she fell into her character too easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up Madison excused herself as she tried to sober up for a moment and find her friends. To her surprise at their table each of her new work friends also had a male partner by their sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas this their plan all along. To come here and find guys to hook up with? Madison was beginning to worry about her new work friends. She even glanced to Lisa who darted her a look that seemed to say \u201cJust go with it.\u201d This the whole while she was stroking a guys leg and laughing at his terrible jokes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEverything okay?\u201d Max said behind her as he had walked over to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadison turned around as her body began to react again as Madison tried to hold back her growing arousal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh...Yeah..I\u2019m fine.\u201d Madison said with a fake smile as she struggled to stop imagining Max ripping her clothes off.</span></div></div>",

You were currently staying at an RV park getting ready to hit the road tomorrow morning with your two best friends Aaron and Julia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you had always been friends going back since grade school. You had planned this road trip for a year now. The plan was to spend all summer traveling the country and seeing everything you could. It took months and months of planning and saving, plus borrowing your parents RV but you finally managed to make it happen. You guys were now a week into your trip and several states away from home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia was a tomboy. Tougher than most of the guys you know, she could fix an engine, throw a ball, and defend herself better than most guys. However this year she has been trying to act way more girly. She grew her hair out, started wearing skirts and dresses. Even though every time she even does everything feminine she is the first to make a sarcastic remark about it. You had to admit she was rather pretty when she actually made the effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron was a nerd. You saved from a bully years ago and sense then he has been your best friend. He knows computers better than anyone you have ever met. Movies, comics, video games, he knows it all. Skinny as a poll but with a good heart. His only real fault is he is a hopeless romantic. He has always had a secret crush on Julia but that\u2019s always been a one sided affection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were always a middle of the road guy. You played some sports but nothing competitive. You liked movies and video games but you weren\u2019t obsessed. You had dated in the past but nothing serious. You never really knew what defined you. The best thing you could say about yourself was your ability to keep your friends together and always find a way ahead no matter the problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were finishing up a beer enjoying the warm summer night as you sat up and looked around for the bathroom. Since you were so far outdoors most guys just found a quiet space somewhere out in the desert. You were in the Southwest now heading west to California coast before heading north.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWandering off a bit to take care of business you yawned as you looked up to the stars wondering if this was going to be the last adventure you and your friends would go on? Life was drifting you guys farther apart now and who knows when another opportunity like this will come up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you finished you saw something odd in the night sky...it looked like a shooting star almost...As it got closer and closer your eyes widened as what looked like a small comet cane falling out of the sky and landed several hundred yards in front of you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly began to rush over as quick as you could giving the darkness and surroundings as you saw smoke rising from a small creator ahead of you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you made your way to the creator you saw what had fallen from the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first you thought it was a downed satellite or small UFO...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked like metal box of some kind. It was cube shaped and about the size of a refrigerator. There didn\u2019t seem to be any opening anywhere but there was one large blinking light on it.

What this.....really your hair? Sure it was the same color, but it was so....long and straight....certainly not like how it was before. I mean, you kept your hair clean fairly enough, but not like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh....w-what's going on.....?\" you said, a slow rising panic beginning to creep into your voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Aaron and Julia got up now, suddenly very much alarmed. All sense of joking from a minute ago was gone, replaced with concern over what was now happening to their friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaron, what's going on?!\" Julia asked, raising her voice just a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-How should I know?!\" Aaron replied. \"I'm no alien expert!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\"Guys! Not helping!\" you raised your own voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hair was coming down pretty long now, enough to your shoulders at least. It came down perfectly straight, as if completely natural. Of course, nothing about it felt natural to you at all. You were pulling at your hair now, completely in disbelief at what was happening. No way could something like this happen so quickly. It felt so supernatural.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA feeling that only got worse after that. Seeing your hands holding your hair, you became aware of how they were feeling rather odd now. Letting go of your hair, you held your hands in front of you. They appeared to be shrinking slightly, looking smoother than before while your fingernails seemed to be growing. This smoothing sensation continued to spread through your arms and up to your shoulders. Right when they did though, you suddenly felt a brief crunch as it was like your shoulders caved in a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys!\" you cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I don't know what to do!\" Julia said. \"Should we call an ambulance?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And tell them what? That our friend is literally transforming or something?\" Aaron replied. \"Who'd believe that?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's gotta be something right?....Like....uh...some parasite or whatever!\" Julia said back. \"We gotta help somehow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as your friend's concern was touching, it was doing little to actually stop what was going on. You weren't in pain per se, but you felt far from great. It was like a constant pressure building everywhere in you, getting worse every second. You felt that smooth sensation all over your torso now, cringing as it felt like your waist was caving in as well as your back arching a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only then that it was all starting to connect. You couldn't.....be becoming a girl.....right?</span></div></div>",

What are we gonna day? Also we are hours from a hospital out here!\u201d Aaron protested back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile you could do little to stop the onslaught of changes assaulting your body. Your body had shrunk down to around 5\u20195 now. Your Skin was totally smooth and hairless. It was obvious now what was happening to you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body grew thinner as fat and muscle was shifting around rapidly. Your feet were small and dainty as your legs turned thinner and more toned. Your butt inflated and swelled to a tear drop shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour arms thinned out as well as your hands shrunk to match the long nails attached to them. Your pecs soon began to swell as female breasts began to form on your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough quickly surging past A and B cups settling somewhere in the middle C-cup range. Not too big but also not small or easy to hide...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour manhood soon began to shrink and slither away disappearing into the new wet and warm slit that was forming between your legs...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally your face changed as your voice got lighter as your lips plumped out a bit as your features softened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of it you looked at yourself shocked at what you were looking at. By all accounts you had changed into the female version of yourself. Or how you imagined you would look had you been born a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were cute and rather pretty but nothing out of the ordinary. You had shoulder length brown hair, a small and petite body, decent sized breasts, and an overall nice form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing yourself changed like this was too much as you passed out from the shock...</span></div></div>",

Everything that just happened felt like a blur. Seemed like you were inside the RV though, laying on one of the seats with a blanket over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only sounds you could swear was the occasional shifting inside. However, seemed like someone noticed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Jesse's finally up,\" you could hear Julia saying, hearing her steps coming closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh......what......\" Was that you? That voice...sounded a lot higher....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes clearing up a little, you could see Julia was know across from you, a look of deep worry on her face. For a second, you wondered why. However, it slowly began to come back to you, making you look down underneath the blanket. You could see you had a shirt and shorts on....but they didn't seem like yours...Weren't these Julia's? The shirt was pretty tight on you....and had two mounds poking out of it....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait....all that was real?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh!\" you cried out a bit, spazzing out a little as Julia came over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, it's okay! It's okay!\" she cried out. Obviously that wasn't the case, but what else could she say in this situation? \"Okay maybe not okay but.....you get the point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I don't think I do!\" you cried out, holding the blanket up so you couldn't see underneath. God your voice was so high now. \"I'm...I'm a freaking chick! This is not okay!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I know! Poor word choice I get it!\" Julia raised her voice a little too. \"Let's just.....try and calm down and think about this....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously that was a little hard for both of you, and Aaron soon joined you both. He seemed just as much alarmed as you were, if not more so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did....did I pass out?\" you asked suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, for about half an hour,\" Aaron said, still seeing the night sky outside. \"Oh, and Julia was the one who got you the clothes obviously. Didn't want to stick you back into those sticky ones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay....makes sense...\" you said with a little nod. Guess that explained the clothes, and they didn't fit too well now that you thought about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat left an awkward silence in the air. Everyone had something on their mind but no idea just what to say out loud. All three pairs of eyes shifted between each other and occasionally outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This.....this can't be real can it?\" you said, putting your face in the blanket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe it either....\" Julia sighed, her hands on her face too. \"Yet I don't think we're dreaming....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So....was that stuff really alien...?\" Aaron mumbled. \"I mean.....this only happened after you found that pink stuff right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah....\" you stuttered a little. \"That...makes the most sense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think we should go to where he found it?\" Julia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not sure if that's a good idea,\" Aaron said. \"This sounds really dangerous whatever it is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....we can't just leave me like this right?\" You said. \"Maybe we should go to a hospital.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already gave Julia that same talk. What good will that do?\" Aaron said. \"They'll just think we're nuts if we tell them what we saw. This ain't natural no matter how you slice it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe....just call it for the night?\" Julia piped up a little. \"Maybe sleep on it for a little and come back in the morning?\"</span></div></div>",

This was still too weird for you to deal with and the last thing you needed was temptation...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen morning finally did come you woke up early getting your friends out of bed.

Can\u2019t say much else about it. Obviously whatever turned me into this.

Could be dangerous..\u201d Julia pointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh you mean like your friend just growing tits isn\u2019t dangerous?\u201d Aaron said back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnough it\u2019s right over.....here....\u201d You pointing to the spot where you found it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was just one problem....It was gone...Nothing...No tracks no creator...nothing...It was like it was never here...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm...dude...there is nothing here...\u201d Aaron said pointing out the obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh really? I\u2019m sorry I guess it\u2019s cloaking device is on...\u201d You said back a little pissed being sarcastic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIdiots!

In any case, the vehicles eventually came around, and you guys made no obvious attempt to escape. As expected, people in black suits all began coming out.

The three of us are high school friends on a cross country road trip.\u201d Julia said being the calm one of your group. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah we haven\u2019t seen anything weird at all recently...like at all!

Looking for anything odd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen guys...This area is a government testing site. There are signs at RV park not to trespass here.\u201d He said calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor that we are VERY sorry. We just wanted to go for a hike.\u201d Julia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, we just needed some fresh air.\u201d You said agreeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFresh air huh? Pardon me but you don\u2019t seem very well dressed for a hike.\u201d You said looking to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia was bigger and taller than you were now. You were now a very petite woman maybe 5\u20195 and 105lbs. while she was pushing 5\u20199 at least 140lbs. The clothes you were wearing were obviously mismatched on your body. Not to mention you weren\u2019t wearing a bra because she want the same size as you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh...yeah. These clothes were from my....fat phase? I just think they are comfy.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia suddenly stepped on your foot obviously taking offense to that remark. She wasn\u2019t fat at all, she had always just been tall and built so very tomboyish. Recently however she has tried being more girly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe clothes are mine...Jesse just wanted something loose fitting. She normally wears such tight and girly clothes. She can be kinda slutty sometimes.\u201d Julia said back giving you a death glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep...that\u2019s me...You know I like to show off my uh...tits...and stuff. Sure do like that a lot...\u201d You said gritting  through your teeth hating Julia right now for saying that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude...bitches be crazy right?\u201d Aaron said trying to fake a total bro attitude as you and Julia both nudged him hard for saying that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe agent began rolling his eyes as the three of you arguing and acting like fools as he held up his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay okay I get it...that\u2019s enough....just...get out of here and be careful.\u201d He said letting the three of you go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wave of relief fell over the three of you as you were released. You walked as normally as you could away from the site and back to your RV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Back at the site-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother agent came by. He was younger with dark skin and a well groomed appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou get anything out of those three?\u201d He asked the older agent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo...why are young people so dumb nowadays?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBeats me....However you might wanna look at this.\u201d The younger black agent said handing him a digital tablet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older white agent looked it over as his eyes widened a bit....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Back at the RV-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYo I\u2019m driving let\u2019s GTFO!\u201d Aaron said as you finished packing up your stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere are we even going?\u201d Julia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnywhere that isn\u2019t here! We are stuck in some ET or Men in Black level bullshit right now!\u201d Aaron replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWest...head west. To the California coast. I think whatever was in that container is heading for water...\u201d You replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat makes sure?\u201d Julia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou called them back to the bathroom where your old clothes were still covered in pink slime. It was all hard and sticky now ruining your old clothes. You tried washing them with water from the sink and then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou showed them the pink slime seemed to react with water. It began to glow brighter giving off bright shine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWest it is....We need to stop at the first town we can though. You need a new wardrobe.\u201d Julia added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron started up the RV as you left the RV park. You were in New Mexico now so El Paso was the closest town.</span></div></div>",

You tried to get as comfortable as possible, but the mismatched clothes didn't help. God these boobs were so strange, and without a bra they just swayed with each movement. Guess you could imagine why bras were helpful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know....I wonder why that slime was shining with the water,\" Aaron mentioned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neither do I,\" you sighed. \"Guess we'll find out whenever we come across it again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever it is, I just want to make it regret causing this mess,\" Julia said a little threateningly. \"It totally messed up our trip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....I wouldn't say that,\" Aaron said. \"I mean....sure it's a little strange now but.....we can still enjoy ourselves...right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed a little sheepishly at that, but you and Julia actually did smile a little. Hey, if this had to happen, at least it was around your childhood friends. You could never explain this to your parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, after a little while longer, El Paso came into view.</span></div></div>",

The summer heat was blazing as it was pushing 100 degrees out today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god it\u2019s like standing on the sun.!\u201d Aaron said stepping out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah it\u2019s summer time dude...Julia why are you still wearing that?\u201d You asked looking back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia was wearing baggy sweatpants and a baggy sweat shirt. During this whole road trip in fact she had been wearing loose and baggy clothes covering as much of herself as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s not like either of you cared much. Julia was always the tomboy. She barely had any boobs all through high school and she was so tall and big many confused her for a boy. She even had short hair for most of it, it was actually a surprise she had grown it out recently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it...\u201d Julia said trying to deflect that question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey I see a clothing store up ahead. What should I get?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s see here, you are like a solid 7/10 now so we better get you some skimpy outfits, that would at least take you up to like an 8....Ow!\u201d Aaron said sarcastically as Julia punched him in the arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever is comfortable for you. We are in the Southwest during summer so just keep that in mind.\u201d Julia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you went inside as Julia took you to the ladies section while you banished Aaron to another part of the store for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere seemed to be countless choices but you decided to keep it simple. Shorts, shirts, underwear, and flip flops. You took the clothes to the dressing room as Julia followed to give you a hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c36C not bad...\u201d Julia said measuring your bust for your new bra size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh thanks...how the hell do you put this damn thing on?\u201d You asked struggling with the bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia showed you how to put it on and after a bit you figured it out. You continued to try on some more clothes as you could tell something was bothering Julia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey what\u2019s going on? You have been acting a bit weird. Before this happened too...What\u2019s up?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia was struggling to maintain her composure as she sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen...I didn\u2019t want to say anything especially after what happened with you. I didn\u2019t want you guys to treat me differently...\u201d Julia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTreat you different why?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia sighed as she began to take off her own clothes getting of her baggy sweat pants and sweat shirt. Your eyes began to widen as you saw Julia standing there in just her underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia\u2019s body had changed drastically from the last time you saw her last year. Her small B cups were now massive DDs. She took her hair out of its bun as it fell past her butt showing it was much longer then she let on before. Her former boyish frame was now a perfect hourglass figure. Her butt was rounder, hips were wider, she had turned from a tall tomboy to a tall sexy woman! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe doctors said it was a late term hormone development....Basically my body didn\u2019t release the proper amount of hormones and estrogen when I was growing up. That\u2019s why I looked so much like a boy. Then last year my body began dumping all those stores up hormones all at once. I went up three cup sizes in a year, developed curves, everything...I went through massive mood swings it was horrible...\u201d Julia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJulia...I had no idea I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d You said trying to comfort her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook I know I\u2019m no position to complain about their body but...\u201d Julia said tearing up a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey hey, it\u2019s okay.\u201d You said giving her a big hug. Right now you just wanted to focus on being a good friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI spent months learning how to adapt to this body. I wore dresses, skirts, and heels. It just always felt so weird but after awhile I...I actually started to like it. You wanna hear something stupid? I was actually planning to surprise you with my stash of sexy clothes I brought on our trip...I wanted..I wanted you to be my first...\u201d Julia said embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren\u2019t sure how to take that. Julia was always your friend. You never had thought about her in a sexual way. Mostly because you never had to. She looked like a boy most of her life which made it easy to ignore. If you were still a guy however you had to admit she looked pretty sexy now you aren\u2019t sure how you would have reacted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey...I have a crazy idea...What if we both got dolled up here? Instead of just boring clothes we go for the full thing. Skirts, dresses, heels, and everything. If I\u2019m all dressed up wouldn\u2019t that make it easier for you to be comfortable?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI...guess...I\u2019m not sure though...I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m ready for all that...\u201d Julia said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere is even a hair and nail salon next door...We could just go for it. Get all feminized and everything?\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren\u2019t exactly sure why you were doing this but you knew it would help out your friend and that\u2019s what mattered most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter thinking for a bit Julia decided to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Julia thought on it for a good minute, making you wonder just what she was going to do. To be frank, even you were surprised at your words, but you did want to make your friend feel better, even if you were dealing with your own problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, she gave a genuine smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right....if girling it up is what you want, then it's what you'll get,\" she said, leading into a little giggle. \"Just remember that we have a budget to keep in mind. We're not rich.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I know,\" you smiled a little too. This sounded totally ridiculous, yet you felt kind of happy. Julia seemed to be a little better, and that mattered most. \"So, why don't you lead the way then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a bigger smile, Julia lead you back into the clothing aisles, once she was re-dressed herself. You both spent quite a bit of time looking over various feminine items, from blouses to skirts to tops to dresses to everything in between. You got the feeling you both would be spending quite a bit of time traveling back and forth between the aisles and the dressings rooms. Heck, after just one cycle, you had arms full of items.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, basically just really late puberty?\" you asked as you were stripping out of your current clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. It's pretty uncommon according to the doctor, which is no surprise,\" Julia said as she unhooked her bra, going to try on a lacier one for kicks. \"It was like getting hit with a ton of bricks. I felt overwhelmed a lot of time. Experimenting with some different clothes and what not actually helped to alleviate it somewhat. That's why I even grew my hair out this long, just to get a feel for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" you nodded. \"Gotta say, you hid it well. I never would have guessed you had that much hair in that bun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A trick of the trade,\" Julia smiled. \"Really works when you want to hide something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laughed a little with her, finding the atmosphere really welcoming now despite the oddity of it all. On your end, the overly feminine items were certainly....something. Skirts felt oddly liberating, yet you felt kind of naked with them too. The tops were tighter than anything you had before, yet not constricting or anything. Julia even admitted she felt similarly to stuff like that at first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt one point, while Julia was trying on a lacy pair of underwear and was bending over to get a dress off the bench, you got a full look at your rear. My god, she was truly stacked, both in the front and in the back. You hadn't thought much about sex in regards to girls often, but that didn't mean you weren't attracted. Granted, you weren't sure how much that transferred over to this new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn that though, you felt a little odd when looking at Julia half-naked. Your nipples were suddenly feeling harder, and you felt a tiny wet feeling down below, making you blush a little at the sensations. Was....that how arousal was like as a woman? It was.....bizarre...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd sadly for you, Julia noticed it, giggling a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I take it you still like girls?\" she smiled. \"Admittedly, it's hard to tell sometimes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I like girls plenty,\" you defended. \"Just....never thought about it much. Other priorities.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't trying to accuse you,\" Julia smiled, pulling over a yellow dress that actually matched very well. \"Just sometimes wondered where you stood there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face had to be red at the sudden talk of that stuff. Leave it to Julia to see right through you in that regard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Anyway....that aside...\" you said, wanting to divert the conversation. \"Um....your chest....so they really get that big naturally?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could ask that, right? You were a girl at the moment so you couldn't be accused of being a pervert right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apparently they do. That shocked me too,\" Julia smiled a little bashfully at that. \"The increase in cup size came super quick as I said before. I don't think anyone in my family got breasts this big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded in affirmation at that. Guess everyone's different. At that though, you got back to trying on your own stuff. For a little fun, you had gotten a dress in the same style as Julia's, though blue as opposed to her yellow. It was a bright blue though, which you liked. You tried it on, feeling the strange sensation of silk on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn....you really pull that off well,\" Julia smiled, coming over to gently adjust it where it needed to be. \"Just the right length and everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a little fun, she dragged you over to the mirror, just to see you both in your dresses. It was quite a surreal sight, and both of you were a little shy about it, which was evident on your faces. Seeing that though ended up making both of you laugh a little bit. It was so silly and stupid and yet kind of fun to be doing it together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I think this is worthy of a few pictures.\" Julia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Might as well use mine. I have like no pictures on mine,\" you smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough.\" Julia replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you had a little fun with some pictures, before deciding to proceed on. You both tried some heels, which Julia was obviously better in. You buckled over quite a bit when trying them, needing the wall and Julia to help stay up. That would certainly take some getting used to, the sensation of being up on your feet like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, you had time to practice, especially as the two of you tried a couple more cycles of shopping. In the end, it felt like you had tried on almost everything in the aisle, even though you hadn't really. You and Julia figured out which ones you wanted to keep, since you at least needed some necessities in addition to the girlier stuff. For a little bit of fun, after making the purchases, you both decided to keep the dresses and heels on. Might as well see how far it could go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, feeling any better about it?\" Julia smiled and blushed a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...if it was anyone else, probably not,\" you said, laughing sheepishly. \"But.....I'll admit it wasn't bad with you....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, why thank you,\" Julia said playfully, even giving you a little kiss on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that wasn't out of the ordinary. Even Julia did that at times, most often as a way to mess around. Aaron especially was really easy to mess with. Speaking of which, you couldn't see him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably saw that game store that was on the way,\" Julia said when you pointed it out. \"He'll catch up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the salon was next. Granted, you both didn't want to burn through your money, so Julia tried to keep it relatively simple. Nothing too fancy. Just a little clean up with your hair and nails and you'd be good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully it wasn't too busy either, so it was easy to get in and the prices were good. It wasn't the first time you had been in a salon, as your mom had taken you to one once for your high school graduation picture. You got your hair all cleaned up and your nails done a little, keeping yours clear since you weren't in to coloring them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, Julia wasn't either, so no problem there. You both spent a little time inside before being done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew......glad to actually have someone around for that,\" Julia said. \"I've gone to a salon perhaps once or twice, but only when I was definitely alone and if I could hide it in time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Makes sense to me,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoy, this was turning into quite the whirlwind. How long had you even spent in here now....?</span></div></div>",

There was a juice bar nearby so you decided to get some smoothies and relax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is so weird...We have been getting looks all day.\u201d Julia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know...is this how girls feel all the time?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia laughed. \u201cHow am I supposed to know? I looked like a boy until a year ago. I basically never left the house once I started developing. I was far too embarrassed.\u201d Julia replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey at least you were born a girl...Mother nature just took her sweet time making you pretty. I\u2019m the one who got blasted with alien slime remember?\u201d You said joking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah I know I\u2019m sorry. I can imagine having your manhood ripped away like that.\u201d Julia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s weird...At first it freaked me out. Now it feels like I\u2019m in kind of adventure. New body, weird alien slime, shifty government agents. I\u2019m kinda just going with it.\u201d You said with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia laughed at the response as she pointed behind you. Aaron was walking around looking for you two as he seemed a bit lost and confused. It took him a few minutes to come by as he didn\u2019t even recognize either of you at first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYo...\u201d You said waving at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron paused for second confused. From his perspective two cute girls were just waving at him. His eyes then widened as he realized who you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa! Jesse and Julia! I...uhh...whoa...Julia when did you become a girl? I mean Jesse you became a girl yesterday but like serious when did you....ow...\u201d Aaron said as Julia hit his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou were hiding the fact you were secretly hot this whole time?!\u201d Aaron said as you caught him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want you freaking out over my massive tits...You know how you get...\u201d Julia said looking him over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? I don\u2019t....Well I don\u2019t always...wait...Yes I do...okay fair point but what? I feel like everyone here is changing except me...\u201d Aaron said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou got anymore of that pink slime?\u201d Julia asked jokingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laughed. \u201cSorry fresh out. I would mind seeing Aaron grow boobs.\u201d You said cupping your own in a joking manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHahaha....yeah you two are hilarious...well if you two are done getting all dolled up we should hit the road. You said we need to hit the coat right? We still have to find whatever did this to you don\u2019t we?\u201d Aaron asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess your right. Go get the RV we will meet you there.\u201d You said tossing him the keys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron rolled his eyes before leaving to get the RV as you two finished up your drinks. Male or female, messing with Aaron was still fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you two left the Juice bar you both suddenly froze...Standing outside was the same two government agents you saw before. The older white one and the younger black one. They were holding up scanners of some kind looking around the area. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe they won\u2019t notice us with the makeovers...\u201d Julia whispered as you tried to walk back to the RV</span></div></div>",

It was a little amusing in the sense that they were getting some odd looks as well, like seeing a movie or something. Still, it didn't make you feel better about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you and Julia walked, about halfway through, the younger black agent paused for a second. Your blood froze for a few seconds, before the man eventually started walking again, though he did appear to glance in your direction. There was another slight pause, but he eventually followed the other agent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they were a little bit away, you released a breath you didn't know you were holding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.....that might have taken off a few years...\" you shivered a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too,\" Julia sighed. \"Let's just get out of here. Less we stick around the better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. Lead the way,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you both picked up the pace just a little bit, not going too fast to bring any sort of suspicion to you. Another minute and you both were outside the building, and you could already see the RV being wheeled around. You didn't even wait for Aaron to greet you both as you got in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, where's the fire?\" Aaron asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The fire is the fact that those agents were back,\" Julia said, getting buckled in. \"So, in other words, we need to scram.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to tell me twice,\" Aaron replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he wheeled the RV around and through the cars, getting back to the main roads as you were once again headed westward. Getting seated yourself, it was kind of too bad. That was a pretty enjoyable little shopping trip you had with Julia. Made you wish you had more time to fool around in there. Hopefully next time.</span></div></div>",

You all were so focused on what just happened that time just went by in a flash. It truly felt like something out of a sci-fi movie. Alien slime, government agents, being on the run, etc. That last part felt truly unsettling. Aaron kept mumbling about not wanting being a fugitive on his record, to which Julia just hit his arm again. You really had little to add to it. You weren't sure what sounded worse between jail and being seen as some experiment due to your exposure already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia seemed to notice your discomfort over the course of your trip, occasionally putting her hand on your shoulder as a silent gesture of support. It was small, but appreciated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess we should probably just hit the hey right now,\" Julia said. \"We'll need all our strength for the next few days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True,\" Aaron said, leaning back in his chair. \"Think one of us should stay up as a lookout?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think we need to be that paranoid about it. We all need rest,\" you said, getting out of your seat. \"Let's just trust we can all sleep well for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough,\" said Aaron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, this all means Jesse and I both need our privacy,\" said Julia, casting a knowing look at Aaron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think I don't know that? What kind of guy do you think I am?\" he grumbled the last part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The kind who already had a penchant for peeking,\" Julia smirked a little, which actually made you smile a little. It's true. Aaron really was too easy to tease. Some parts were exaggerated of course but it was still fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine fine, I get it,\" he sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next little bit, you three all got ready for sleep. The only real difference being you had to get ready with Julia instead of Aaron. As you might have guessed, Aaron got straight to the point, asking all about the shopping trip. You replied as casually about it as you could, as it actually felt kind of nice. As you thought earlier, it was kind of like an adventure, and having supportive friends was helping it feel a lot easier to cope with. Of course, Aaron was happy to hear you were doing well, although he couldn't help himself by asking how big Julia's chest really was. You decided to not divulge that information. That was a secret, much to his chagrin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get the feeling this is the start of you keeping a lot of things from me,\" he sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not all that different from the usual honestly. Only difference being I may have a couple more things about Julia to hide from you,\" you smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome casual ribbing aside, it seemed like things were relatively normal as you all got ready for bed. Though, against your notice, Julia seemed to be a little antsy. Aaron actually caught on to this, walking over to her while you were just getting into the nice sleep clothes you got at the mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You still want to do the \"thing\" with him?\" he asked casually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo say Julia was caught off-guard by what he said was an understatement, as her face went beat-red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What? What are you....?\" she stammered a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look I may have been in the dark about you being all hot and all....but even I could see that you liked Jesse,\" Aaron smirked, pointing to his head a little. \"What was that you said? That my brain was the only thing I had going for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I meant that as a joke right?\" Julia said, exasperated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, but you probably weren't too far off the mark,\" Aaron shrugged, smile still evident. \"But hey, go ahead. Jesse could probably use the comfort, and what guy doesn't dream of seeing two hot women do....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat earned him another whack on the arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch! Sheesh, you know it was a joke right?\" Aaron said, rubbing his arm a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your sense of humor needs work,\" Julia smirked. \"You're a little too blunt sometimes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you mean all the time,\" Aaron smirked back before turning. \"But....still I meant what I said. I know you want to. Probably should before things get too out of hand that we won't get any casual time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia was honestly floored by all this. By Aaron having some idea to even being okay with it, even if the reason was slightly pervy. Still, the support was appreciated. Truth be told, he was on the money. She even had put on some of the sexy clothes she got underneath her top and pants just in case. It wasn't like she really planned it. It just kind of....happened...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Thanks Aaron...\"</span></div></div>",

You've got the wrong--!\" Harry was quickly pulled into the living room and sat into the chair. A bubbly blonde, one of the three, stood over him, holding a clipboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi! I'm Cassie. I'll be overseeing the makeover. Let's see...\" Cassie quickly grabbed Harry's hand and started to inspect it. \"Ooh, you bite these, don't you?

Rhonda was unpacking items from a box and placing them on a small wheeled cart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, first things first, your...\" Cassie started.</span></div></div>",

Over her immortal lifespan, she had seen the very worst and best of humanity, some attempted to use their magic to help the world, while others attempted to gain power and glory for only themselves. The latter far outweighed the former, in Jethyea's case. However, it had been ages since she had a master, and being alone with your own thoughts for that long is bound to drive anyone mad, especially a genie. Hence, Jethyea promised herself that whenever she was released next, she'd do what so many other magical creatures did, trick her master by turning their own wish against them. And it just so happened that she was due to be released rather soon...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrift shops, garage sales, antique stores, they were all good places to find bargains on old stuff. Stanley Aldin was an amateur archaeologist, but without tombs to raid or temples to excavate, he was left to frequent stores and flea markets for his artifacts. He was building up quite a collection, a few old books here, a vase there, and he was learning a lot about history. At this particular thrift store however, he found himself gravitating towards a set of kitchenware items strewn about on a shelf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Old pots and pans, a rusty spatula... hey, look at that!\" Stanley exclaimed, pushing the kitchenware aside to grab a gleaming gold oil lamp. He critiqued it with his eyes. \"Probably from ancient Arabia... or a reconstruction... but it does look and feel like real gold...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanley ruminated for another moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Regardless, it's coming home with me.\" Stanley decided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe paid for it and quickly took it home, finding the perfect place to put it on his shelf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do some more research into you in the morning. Though I should be careful I don't accidentally rub it.\" Stanley joked as he went to adjust it slightly, moving his fingers across the handle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lamp began to shake and smoke began billowing from the spout as Jethyea emerged in a cloud of smoke from the lamp. Stanley wasn't really expecting a genie, but she looked about what he would have expected. Light red, almost pink skin, a traditional hairstyle with the long top knot ponytail, and a harem outfit. Her face was almost sculpted, and too perfect to be human. If she was, she'd be one of the most gorgeous women on the planet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Master. I am Jethyea, the genie of this lamp, and by magical law, I am bound to grant you three wishes!\" Jethyea exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-who... this is remarkable!\" Stanley exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJethyea was not impressed with her new master in the slighest. Despite being an amateur archaeologist, he hardly looked like Indiana Jones. Well, in fact, he looked like Indiana Jones, but only if he spent all his time at the college teaching classes instead of globetrotting. She couldn't wait to sabotage his wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what is it that you desire? Money? Power? I can grant it all!\" Jethyea giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do I wish for...\" Stanley asked himself. \"I know that genies can be tricky, so it has to be good...\"</span></div></div>",

How does this whole thing work?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you asked master. It\u2019s quite simple you get ONE wish. That\u2019s it, one, plain and simple.

So keep that in mind.\u201d Jethyea said as she looked to her nails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright...it\u2019s got to be a life changing wish. However nothing too selfish. Wealth or power, greed can destroy people....Hmm..\u201d Stanley thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know...I want to be popular. I want everyone to love me for I do. When others see me they get excited. I want to love what I do, and for others to love me for it.\u201d Stanley said thinking this was a great compromise wish. He could be happy but also make others happy as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs this your official wish master? I need to hear the magic words.\u201d The genie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright...I WISH...That I was popular, that people loved me for my work, which I am great at, and that I loved it too.\u201d Stanley wished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe genie gave him an almost delish smile...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour wish is my command master.\u201d She said clapping her hands together as a cloud of dark purple smoke began to swirl around her as it enveloped Stanley and everything around him until the world suddenly faded to black...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does the Genie mess up this wish?</span></div></div>",

The bed he was in felt much nicer. Soft silk sheets, that were a deep red color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening his eyes Stanley looked around and saw a very different apartment from the one he was used to. This one looked like it belonged to some one who could afford to have their place professionally decorated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was sleek modern look with brand new appliances, stylish furniture, and a really slick look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping out of bed Stanley almost tripped and fell over as a large and unfamiliar weight was tugging at his chest...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatching himself Stanley rushed over to a large mirror on the wall and gasped at his...or rather...her reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a woman staring back at him. Not just any woman either, but a total knock out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had fiery red hair was that perfectly straight and went down to her waist. Her skin was silky soft and light bronzed color showing she had a nice tan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had two very large breasts. 36DD from the look of them from the bras he found in the drawers. They were also very soft but perky with little to no sag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had amazing hourglass curves with a large bubble butt.

The knocking continues, a little more urgent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone must have seen you! What could you do? If you didn\u2019t answer the door, then the police would surely be called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou keep panicking until you remember something. Mary had blonde hair, just like you. Maybe...they had thought you might be her? Her car WAS missing from the driveway...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cautiously approached the door. Listening carefully, you can hear a voice just on the other side, a man\u2019s voice. \u201c-iss Thomas? Miss Thomas is that you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Thomas? Well no time to worry about that, you had your window! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold on, I\u2019m not decent!\u201d You shout in a feminine tone. The knocking stops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid...did they buy it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, you have no time to waste! You hurry back upstairs and step in front of her bedroom mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour 24 year old body was rather slender and you were fairly close in height, although you were maybe two inches taller at most...maybe you could pull this off...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking quickly, you untie your ponytail and trade out your stud earrings for the hoops. You quickly strip down and open up her closet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull out a matching pale blue bra and panties, pulling them on and tucking away your member. Your legs don\u2019t have hardly any hair and their being blond mad them practically invisible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dress was still completely unnecessary. You pull out a pair of her jeans and slide into them. They hug and shape your legs femininely and some padding at the top helps give the illusion of hips and a woman\u2019s butt. A sleeveless blouse completed the look but it wasn\u2019t until you had slipped into a pair of sandals that you realized it was just too short to tuck into the jeans so the tip of your midriff stayed exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked into the mirror. Not bad...but would it fool whoever that was downstairs?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to at least wear a little makeup to complete the ruse. You remember what you\u2019ve seen girls do over the years and manage to put on foundation, eyeliner, mascara, and some glossy pink lipstick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMussing your hair into s feminine style over one eye, you take a deep breath and go downstairs.</span></div></div>",

Why would Mary have been expecting company the day she was leaving for vacation? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat you could never have possibly known was that Mary...had been tempted to cheat on her always gone husband. She set up an online hookup but her conscience caught up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead Mary decided a nice vacation to the beach  would be best to deal with her loneliness. She was going to treat herself to something nice rather than betray her love. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, she did really love him. It had just been a moment of weakness. So instead she planned a trip and set out...unaware that the one thing she had neglected to remember was to cancel her online fling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, however, know none of this. Was he a repair man? An online acquaintance meeting her for the first time? A consultant? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, turning away someone who was supposed to meet Mary today would only rouse suspension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile and take a step back holding the door open for Finn.
