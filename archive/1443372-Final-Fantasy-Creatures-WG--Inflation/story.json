You, then, began to nosebleed as you thought of looking at her breasts and her big butt. You got a hard-on after a few minutes of staring at her, but not before she woke up and stood up at an impressive eight feet tall. She felt her enlarged bosom, and murred in pleasure at the new size. She was completely oblivious of you as she admired her figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooh, I never knew there would be fans of me.\" She said, feeling her poofed-out butt. You felt an insatiable urge to glomp and grope the behemoth beauty, but your judgement reminds you of how dangerous behemoths are when angry.

You, then, run into her at full speed, mashing your face into her asset and groping her butt cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe behemoth girl gasped and began blushing bright red as she felt her assets mashing into your face and her butt was groped.
