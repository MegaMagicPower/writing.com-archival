Wielding swords and clubs, also wearing armor that is nigh impenetrable to protect your sacrifice. You aren\u2019t the sharpest tool in the shed, but you have a massive heart, you have no preferences when it comes to girls, but mainly that is because you have no real interest in a girlfriend, you love football too much. You are the main defensive lineman on your football team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are built like a tank, extremely tall, around 6.4 and muscular with a square jaw, you have black hair, Caucasian skin and hazel eyes; you have a small soul patch.

Your high I.Q. makes you a bit cocky, but I think it\u2019s that cockiness that will draw your sacrifice to you. You have pale skin, greased down blonde hair and brown eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing so intelligent, you also have a side job tutoring at college.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Ranger: Oscar Zacheriah, you take your victory through your skill and accuracy. All of your peers in the rifle range and archery club are jealous of your ability to get the bulls eye on a far off target every time perfectly. You have a bit of a short temper but it usually doesn\u2019t last long when you\u2019re set off. You have dark chocolate skin, brown eyes, and a head of curly hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou work at the rifle range and also are in an archery club in college.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, which path will you take\u2026?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This day will begin your service to your Sacrifice, Speechless, who you must protect with your very life from those who would harm her. As you brush your teeth, you think about the picture you were given of her. Speechless was a young woman named Tanya about your age, so she goes to college like you. Of course, since you found she goes to a college only the rich can afford and the smartest can get scholarships into, you figure she must be very intelligent. You think more about Tanya; she was a pretty attractive girl, though plus-sized. Tanya was a little chubby, mostly in her stomach and hips, but still you saw she was quite cute with her long dark brown hair. And apparently she wasn't exactly undesirable if she didn't have her cat ears or tail anymore (Writer's reminder: Anyone with cat ears and a tail is a virgin, as those features are shedded after sex in Loveless). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you still have your ears and tail?</span></div></div>",
