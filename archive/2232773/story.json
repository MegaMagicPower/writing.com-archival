Free booze, free food and a free room, he could hardly say no. The theme was super hero\u2019s so after some searching he found what he thought was a Spider-Man outfit, a fitted all in one with a face mask. It covered him from head to toe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving at the hotel he checked into his room, after an initial mixup he got the correct room and he got ready for the party. Joining his friends at the bar for pre-party drinks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, looks it\u2019s spider woman\u201d danny said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, its Spider-Man\u201d Marshall said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, i am pretty sure that\u2019s a spider woman costume\u201d Danny grinned<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not\u201d Marshall replied \u201care we drinking or what\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on boys\u201d Marshall said and they were soon in their third pint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaty walked across the bar to join them \u201chey boys, starting earlier\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarshall turned around, and his heart sank. Katy was wearing a spider woman costume. It was identical except she was wearing a pair of red stiletto knee high boots with hers, compared to his trainers hidden under the costumes feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHahaha, told you\u201d Danny said \u201cSpider-woman\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarshall was not happy, but grinned regardless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking through to the party they were all soon feeling very drunk. Marshall spotted Katy sitting down so he joined her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry about earlier, I didn\u2019t realise\u201d she grinned<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s okay, why are you sitting down\u201d Marshall asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy feet are killing me in these boots\u201d Katy replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you want to borrow these\u201d Marshall said kicking off his trainers,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you mind\u201d Katy said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell with the masks on, we look the same anyway\u201d Marshall grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks\u201d Katy said pushing on Marshall\u2019s trainers and heading to the dance floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarshall pushed his feet into Katy\u2019s  boots, standing up he joined the dance floor. One of Katy\u2019s friend Becky grabbed his arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKaty, can you help me back to my room, I really need to go to bed\u201d she asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny grinned \u201csure\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelping Becky back to her room she fell on the bed, \u201ccan you help me get undress, you can wear my costume if you like, I did say we could swap \u201c as Becky the passed out, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarshall removed the rest of Becky costume until she was naked on the bed. Her black leather cat suit, lay in a pile along with her underwear and ankle boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarshall grinned, why not. He was soon dressed in the costume. It was extremely tight figure hugging and he needed to push his tackle between his legs held in by the thong so it wouldn\u2019t show, stuffing his feet into the high heeled boots he stood up and put on the mask. Applying the red lipstick from Becky bag he was now her twin. </span></div></div>",

They were leaving in an hour. Marshall walked into the house, sitting in the conservatory with Danny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChatting for 30minutes Danny got a call, Danny left the room returning a few minutes later<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"well that's that,\" Danny said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up\" Marshall replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Claire's not coming she's stuck at work won't be here for at least three hours so we cant go\" Danny replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go with you\" Marshall replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have leathers?\" Danny asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, do you have some I can borrow, I don't mind\" Marshall replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think mine will be too big for you,\" Danny said, \"What wist size are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"28\" Marshall said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blimey, mine will swamp you,\" Danny said \"Hang on come with me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking upstairs and into the 4th bedroom, Danny pointed to some leathers on the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are Claire's, they might fit you,\" Danny said \"What shoe size are you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"6\" Marshall replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blimey, they will fit you too\" Danny grinned, get changed we can leave in 10minutes,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny left the room and closed the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarshall kicked off his boat shoes and tried to slide his legs into the leathers, there were too tight against his loose jeans. Spotting Claire's blue skinny fit jeans on the bed he removed his jeans and replaced them with Claire's. Having the same problem with his shirt he pulled it off and replaced it with Claire's fitted sports top, it had an inbuilt bra which gave him a fairly impressive cleavage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting down he put his feet into the motorcycle boots, they fitted him really well, doing up the velcro sides he put on the biker jacket zipping it up. Walking down the stairs Danny was ready. Handing Marshall the matching helmet and gloves and they headed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving at a roadside cafe they stopped, getting off Marshall pulled off the helmet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow, look at you,\" Danny said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What\" Marshall replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Makeup, it must have been from the inside of the helmet\" Danny grinned<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice\" Marshall grinned<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a quick drink, they got back on the bike and in under an hour, they arrived at the bike rally. Removing his helmet Danny laughed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You might need to sort that\" Danny grinned \"Its worse\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should have brought my trainers, its gonna be hot in these\" Marshall said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Claire's bag is in the side box, there might be something in there,\" Dany said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarshall carried the bag to the portaloo. Opening the bag there were some clothes, makeup, and a pair of boots. Unfortunately, they were a black suede pair of ankle boots with a 4\" block heel. removing the biker boots he pulled off the leathers and then remembered he was wearing Claire's jeans. He put on the ankle boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking in the mirror he had foundation all over his face, after routing there the makeup bag he had foundation, mascara, and lipstick on. He looks a lot like Claire. Putting his hair into a high ponytail with one of her scrunchies. Picking up the bag, leather trousers, and boots he walked back to the bike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny took a double-take \"Wow\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What\" Marshall grinned<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on let's get a drink,\" Danny said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But one thing led to another, as it usually did, and at 6:15 the next morning, they were curled up on the couch in Ted's office, naked, sweaty, still high on the endorphins from their latest round of lovemaking. As far as they knew, they were the only ones in the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey stretched and ran her fingers through her dark brown hair, which she wore in short, extremely chic style. (Ted's, on the other hand, was long for a man, though he usually wore it slicked back at work to fit the conservative dress code.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm starving,\" she said. \"Want something from the vending machine?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything with chocolate,\" he replied, still slightly dazed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slipped on his expensive powder blue dress shirt, then looked around the floor before stepping into his black leather oxford shoes. \"Hey, that's my stuff!\" he protested. She grinned and said, \"It is way too early to be walking in heels, boss man,\" and marched out towards the break room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed sat up, drank from a bottle of water on the end table, and tried to remind himself of the day's schedule. Lindsey returned with a couple of Snickers bars. She looked deep in thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up?\" Ted asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just surprised by how well these shoes and this shirt fit me,\" she said, walking around and turning to show off how comfortably she could move in them. \"I knew we were about the same height, but still. You would think these were mine to begin with.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My mother used to say we were lucky that my feet stopped growing before the rest of me did, so we wouldn't have to keep buying new shoes,\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down at her feet, then at his, and a wicked grin spread across her face. Ted knew that look meant nothing good for him, but couldn't resist asking, \"What?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed her black Louboutins off the floor and sat next to him. \"Well, it occurs to me that if your shoes fit me so perfectly, then mine should do the same for you.\" She sat down and placed the high-heeled pumps on the floor in front of him. \"What say we prove my hypothesis?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want me to wear your shoes?\" he asked, laughing nervously? \"Didn't you just say it's too early for heels?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too early for me to wear them after having spent all of yesterday in those pretty but uncomfortable things,\" she said, stroking his leg in a way that made him feel weak. \"You, on the other hand, have just been cruising around in these low to the ground wonders, so I think your feet can take the Lobu's better than mine at the moment.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not going to wear your shoes!\" he protested. \"That's ridiculous. What if anybody sees me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fingers now moved to his inner thigh as she said, \"The custodial staff doesn't even get here until 7:30. We are all alone. This is a safe space, and I want to see how sexy your legs and ass look in these. Won't you do it for me? Please?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween the pouty, sexy look on her face and the feel of her hand hovering near his groin, Ted felt powerless to resist. He let Lindsey squeeze his feet into the narrow shoes, then help him stand up. He wobbled a bit at first, then found his balance. He and Lindsey were the same height in bare feet, so he towered over her the way she usually did in heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stepped back to study him, circling his body and whistling approvingly. \"My goodness, you've got some nice legs, boss man,\" she said with a giggle. \"How do they feel?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better than I would have thought,\" he admitted. \"They're a little pinchy, but they fit.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe encouraged him to walk around his office in them. After a few stumbles, he gained his balance and was practically gliding in them. \"Goddamn!\" Lindsey cheered. \"Do you want some fries with that shake?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Satisfied?\" he asked, trying to keep from blushing. He felt a bit embarrassed, but there was something else there \u2014 a feeling he was too afraid to fully recognize. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" she said smugly. \"If our shoes fit each other so well, maybe we should see how the rest of the ensembles look.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" he asked, both nervous and excited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gestured to his expensive navy pinstripe three-piece suit, which was lying across his desk, and then to her sleeveless red silk blouse and black pencil skirt, and said, \"I want to try on that fabulous suit of yours, and I want to see how you look in my clothes.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed's heart was pounding his chest. He was both terrified of the idea itself and at how excited he realized it made him. He wasn't sure what to do next.  </span></div></div>",

What was he going to do, Lindsey had no spare shoes at her desk. Sitting down he pushed his feet into the boots zipping them up. They were at least lower than the heels but he hated how tight they were on his legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking to the lifts he slipped on Lindeys overcoat and put her handbag on his shoulder as the lift doors closed he could see Jessica and Lindsey deep in conversation in his office. How did this go so wrong? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking across the reception area and into the street, he walked into the shoe repairers, after handing over the boots they were quickly repaired and back on his feet. He then grabbed the coffee and went back to the office. Flashing Lindseys security badge he was soon in the lifts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the door opened the office was starting to fill up. As Ted walked across the floor he hoped no one would notice. He and Lindsey were new to the floor so he felt slightly easier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanging up Lindsey's overcoat and putting her handbag under her desk he removed the boots and carried them along with the coffee back to his office, knocking on the door her walked in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" Jessica said taking the coffee <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have your repaired boots here\" Ted replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's so hot in here I have decided to wear your heels, you can wear my boots, that will be all\"Jessica said <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed looked at Lindsey who had taken his suit jacket off and was sat confidently at his desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Ted said returning to Lindsey's desk.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lindsey reflexively straightened her tie again as Jessica paced around Ted's office. She had played along with his decision for them to pretend to be each other, simply because she wasn't sure what else to do in that moment. But now Jessica thought she was Ted, and vice versa. And worse, the rest of the staff had started to file in. Even though they were new to this floor, the odds of making it through an entire work day without running into someone who knew who she really was seemed impossible. And even if they somehow did, she realized, it wasn't like Jessica was going anywhere. She was in charge of the whole company! And Ted was one of the company's most promising young executives. It wasn't like they could avoid her after today. If it wouldn't ruin the masculine persona she was trying so desperately to maintain, Lindsey would have cried (or, at least, pouted). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething in her pocket buzzed, and she realized she had Ted's phone. She fished it out of her trousers and saw a calendar reminder (one that she had made, in her real job as Ted's assistant) for the big meeting they had stayed up late the night before to prep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica, who had been droning on about her management style, noticed her looking at the phone. \"Something the matter, Ted?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey wasn't sure of the right thing to do, or say, under these crazy circumstances, but she had to make a decision. It was a meeting with a company called Bannister, and Ted had to this point communicated with them only by phone and email, so they wouldn't necessarily know what he looked like. Plus, the thing was supposed to happen at the hotel where Bannister's rep was staying, which would get her out of the office for a bit and at least delay the moment of discovery by a few hours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm supposed to go to Bannister to make the pitch,\" she said, trying to sound confident. \"Lindsey should have CC'ed you on the details yesterday. I really want to spend as much time with you as I can, but I really should be heading out for this meeting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica smiled. \"Well, why don't I tag along? It'll do me some good to be out in the field, and we can get some more of that face time you wanted on the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey was cornered. She knew the pitch well enough to deliver it herself, but to do it in front of Jessica?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least it's better than staying here,\" she thought, before smiling, pulling on Ted's suit jacket, and gesturing towards the door, telling Jessica, \"Ladies first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica snickered. \"And here I thought no gentlemen worked at this company,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe passed Ted, who was frantically composing a text on her phone, presumably about the Bannister meeting. \"Lindsey,\" she said, trying to sound casual, while looking for an excuse to get him out of the secretarial bullpen before anyone noticed him. \"Jessica wants to come with me to Bannister. Why don't you hold down the fort from my office? There's some reorganization in there I need you to do in there. It should take you at least until we get back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed looked like he was about to have a stroke as he considered the way this day kept evolving, but then he composed himself and said, \"Yes, sir.\" He got up, pivoted on the heels of Jessica's boots, and walked into his own office. Lindsey couldn't help admiring the way his ass looked in her skirt, and Jessica caught her admiring it. Lindsey motioned like she was going to apologize, but Jessica simply laughed and held up a hand in a stop gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, Ted. We've all had attractive colleagues. The important part is that you don't act on that attraction, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right!\" Lindsey answered through clenched teeth, and marched towards the elevators.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you mind driving?\" Jessica asked on the way down to the garage. \"After all those years at the London office, it's taking me a while to readjust to driving on the other side of the road.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey felt through her pockets until she found the keys to Ted's sports car. He had given her many rides in it, but never once let her drive. She was suddenly seeing a silver lining in this dark cloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, boss!\" she said cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After an exhilarating highway drive where even Jessica approved of her pushing the sports car to its limits, Lindsey arrived at the hotel. She checked her reflection in the mirror. She hadn't thought of her hairstyle as masculine, nor had anyone ever accused her of looking androgynous, but between Ted's suit and the lack of makeup and jewelry, she looked close enough to pass. If she told people she was Ted Smith, then the illusion was believable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Bannister rep was named Kevin Jarvis, a balding, friendly Englishman much closer to Jessica's age than Lindsey's. He did, indeed, believe her as Ted \u2014 and it helped that she had been CC'ed on all their emails and been on the line for all their calls, so she could throw in details from past conversations. The pitch went even better than the small talk, to Lindsey's amazement. She had never done this in a meeting before, though she'd seen Ted do it plenty of times. As she strutted around the room, her hand cockily perched on the pocket of her borrowed trousers, she realized that she had always envied Ted his position, and that she not only liked doing his job for the moment, but was actually good at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was, she would soon realize, *too* good at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" she asked with a confident smile as she finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a long pause at first, and for a moment, Lindsey worried she had messed up. But she turned to Jessica, who was practically beaming with pride, and when she turned back to Kevin, she could see that he was just searching for the right words to express his appreciation of the pitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That,\" he said carefully but enthusiastically, \"was maybe the best presentation of its type I've ever had the pleasure to witness in person. You've convinced me this would be an incredible opportunity for Bannister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey felt herself flush with pride. For the moment, all memory of this swap of clothes, and roles, or the disaster that was approaching her and Ted whenever they were found out, was forgotten. She thought of putting on some false modesty, but knew that the real Ted wouldn't. And she had gotten this far by acting like Ted, so instead she confidently asked, \"So, do we have a deal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled and said, \"We do, on one condition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer confidence faltered a bit. \"What's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We would want you to come back with me to Bannister HQ in London so we can work together overseeing Phase 1 of the project.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey's heart began pounding again. She was not at all prepared for this, especially once she remembered that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phase 1 is meant to last six months,\" she said, only barely remembering to maintain her fake male voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least!\" Jessica interjected herself into the conversation, looking delighted with this turn of events. \"Depending on how things go, you might get to be on the other side of the pond for a year, maybe two!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe two?\" Lindsey asked weakly, contemplating an extended time of having to dress like a man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other two seemed oblivious to her distress. \"Ideally, you'd be able to fly back with me tonight,\" Kevin said. \"I really want to get started on this immediately. We could set you and, say, your assistant up with housing for as long as you'd need, so you wouldn't have to worry about anything at all over there. Do you think you could swing such a fast turnaround?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Lindsey could say anything, Jessica stepped in to say, \"Of course he can. You're going to love London, Ted. Trust me. And I bet your lovely secretary \u2014 what was her name again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lindsey,\" she replied, feeling fainter by the minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Jessica said, \"Lindsey will adore getting to spend some extended time over there at such a young age. Why, maybe she'll meet and fall in love with an Englishman! Wouldn't that be just darling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey tried to imagine telling Ted about this latest turn of events. On the one hand, this was the (temporary) solution to all their problems. They'd be leaving immediately. They'd be an ocean away from anyone who knew them, and thus would have a long time before anyone caught on \u2014 maybe enough time to figure a way out of this catastrophe. On the other, they would be getting in so deep that there might never be a safe way out. What, she wondered, would Ted want to do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lindsey again roared the sports car down the highway, this time heading back to the office with Jessica, feeling at once triumphant about how well she had done in the pitch and anxious about what to do regarding Kevin's request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should say that I already feel as if I'm going to miss you terribly,\"  Jessica said as they walked through the secretarial bullpen back towards Ted's office. \"Even though we've only known each other for a few hours, I have a very good feeling about you, Mr. Ted Smith.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" said Lindsey, again fighting the urge to blush. As bad as things were on some level, she couldn't resist the idea that she liked being treated like a powerful executive. And, as she strutted past some admiring (or, at least, puzzled) secretaries, she also couldn't help noticing how much more she enjoyed wearing Ted's fancy three-piece suit and oxfords than she did tottering around in her tight clothes and precarious heels. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey arrived at the office, where they found Ted seated on the couch, Jessica's boots lying on the floor near him as he rubbed what were clearly aching feet. He sat up with alarm when he saw them and began trying to spit out an apology, but Jessica tut-tutted him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now now, young lady, that's quite alright,\" she told him. \"I've been there many times myself, particularly when I'm vain enough to wear those boots. They look fabulous, but I always pay for it later.\" She sat down next to Ted, pulled off Lindsey's pumps, and began putting on and zipping up the boots. She gestured to the Louboutins, and added, \"Though I have to admit these are precarious in their own way. But you're welcome to them back, and I appreciate the loan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's okay,\" said an anxious Ted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey could see it was killing him waiting to find out how the meeting had gone, and to have a moment alone with her so they could regroup and figure out what to do next. She decided to help him, by offering, \"Thanks so much for helping me prep for the Bannister pitch, Lindsey. It went better than we could have possibly hoped for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed seemed so stunned by this news that Lindsey felt a bit offended. Did he really think she couldn't do his job if she had to?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore either could say anything else, Jessica interjected, \"So well, in fact, that I believe the two of you need to have a big discussion now. I'll leave you to it. Ted, let me know what she decides immediately so travel can begin booking tickets for tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tonight?\" Ted asked, but Jessica had already twirled around on the heels of her boots and was marching out of the office. Ted turned to Lindsey, looking both scared and even a bit angry, and demanded to know what had happened. She told him everything, up to and including the offer for them both to transfer to London, immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed looked thrilled, then shocked, then afraid again. He gestured at how they were each dressed. \"But, we'd have to go... like this? For six months?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe longer,\" Lindsey said, parroting Jessica. \"If the project works, we might be there for a couple of years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YEARS?!?!?\" Ted bellowed in his own voice, before realizing that people outside might be looking, and added much more quietly, \"How did this go from a silly little sex game into something where we're posing as each other for years?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey paced, again noticing how much easier this was to do in a man's suit. \"I know, I know,\" she said, before laying out the bright side. \"But it keeps us from being discovered right now. Nobody there knows us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but Kevin thinks you're me, which means I have to be you,\" he replied, not appeased. \"I've been wearing a thong and fishnets for only a few hours and I already want to kill myself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, girlie,\" said Lindsey, now more than a little annoyed to hear him moaning about the fashion challenges she had to put up with every day of her life. \"At least it buys us time to think of a way out. Maybe once we're over there for a bit, there's a simple escape hatch. Like, you apply for another job virtually, take it, and we come back to America as ourselves, never once having to return to this place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not bad,\" he admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the alternative is to swap our clothes back now, walk into Jessica's office, confess, and probably both become unemployable in this field,\" she added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be very bad,\" he said. He slipped the pumps back on, cringing a bit as he did so, stood up and walked around in them again. \"I think you're right. We go to England, role play for a few weeks with me coaching you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... and vice versa,\" she added, thinking of how woefully unqualified he was for most of her secretarial duties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" he said apologetically. \"And then once we're sure the project is on the right track, I start looking for a job back here \u2014 just preferably not *right* here \u2014 and we get to return to our own lives. It's the best of a bunch of bad options.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree,\" she said, even as a part of her realized how much she was looking forward to getting to be Ted for as long as that phase of the plan lasted. Maybe, she thought, she might even find ways to extend that phase. \"I guess we need to help each other pack?\" </span></div></div>",

He placed his ear against it, and could just barely make out the speech that Jessica was delivering to the assembled staff. It was something about the value of flexibility in the modern corporate world, and how important she found it for everyone to be able to do anyone else's job at a moment's notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And,\" Jessica continued, \"two of your colleagues have found a very dramatic and effective way to demonstrate this lesson.\" She raised her voice and called out, \"Ted? Lindsey? It's time for your big reveal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed's heart felt like it wanted to explode out of his chest. \"No way am I going out there now,\" he said half-heartedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey stood up, straightened her cuffs, and put a reassuring hand on his shoulder. \"There's no way out of here except through that door, Ted. I don't think we have much choice in the matter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right,\" he admitted, and braced himself for the reaction that followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey pulled the door open and stepped out wearing his suit, then reached back to pull him out to follow her. They were greeted with a mix of gasps, giggles, and several approving comments from both male and female staffers. Ted tried not to blush, but it was a losing effort. He looked over at Lindsey, who only looked slightly less embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't they just look marvelous?\" Jessica said, clearly reveling in their discomfort. \"I was speaking with them both about this very subject, and it was Ted, I believe, who came up with this incredible idea. They will not only swap jobs for the next month, but clothes as well, as a symbol to the rest of the team about how interchangeable we must all be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was all Ted could do to keep from screaming. She wanted him to dress like this for a MONTH? And to do Lindsey's job that whole time? As bad as things had gotten, this seemed like a bridge too far. He pondered quitting then and there, career consequences be damned. </span></div></div>",

He had built his whole career at this place, and what was he going to say when someone asked him why he abruptly quit? \"I got caught wearing my secretary's clothes?\" No, he realized with some discomfort, he was going to have to swallow his pride and tough it out for a month, and then hopefully life would get back to normal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled through gritted teeth, then told the amused crowd, \"I know we look a bit ridiculous, but it's like Jessica said: we're a symbol of how we all need to be able to walk in each other's shoes if the job calls for it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I don't think you look ridiculous at all,\" called out Katrina Hope, an attractive blonde member of his team. \"Why have you been hiding those legs in pants for all these years?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was more whooping and catcalling, and Ted found himself blushing again. Jessica was clearly enjoying his embarrassment, but she held up her arms to put a stop to the whistles and comments. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now now, this is still an office, and I still expect you to act like professionals,\" she told the group. \"Let's all get back to work. In fact, I believe I have to go to receive some guests for a pitch meeting with Ted... or, I guess, Lindsey now.\" Amid more snickers, the crowd dispersed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed's stomach lurched, as he remembered the reason he and Lindsey had been up all night in his office to begin with. He looked to Lindsey, who had an odd expression on her face \u2014 was she... pleased by this turn of events? \u2014 then to Jessica, who was smugger than ever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fun and games and all of that,\" he said, \"but you're not seriously going to send Lindsey to the pitch wearing my clothes, are you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey crossed her arms across her chest and pouted. \"I've been working on this thing every step of the way with you, Ted. You don't think I can handle it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Ted,\" Jessica added. \"Or don't you believe in the very concept of this role swap that you proposed.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed felt like he was losing his mind. The clothes swap had been Lindsey's idea initially, and making it a team-building exercise had been Jessica's. And now both were acting like the whole thing had come from him? And he was just supposed to go along? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey checked her watch \u2014 it had been Ted's watch not long ago, he realized with some displeasure \u2014 and said, \"We'd better get to the lobby. They should be here any minute.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But,\" he said, desperately searching for a way out of this. \"How are you expecting the clients to react to... this?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it will make for one of the more memorable pitches they've heard in quite some time, Ted,\" said Jessica. \"Especially when they see how cute you look in that skirt.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey gestured towards the elevators, giggling as she said, \"Come on, Ted.

She was an absolute stunner: a tall blonde with sharp features, piercing blue eyes, and legs that seemed to go on for days between her tight red minidress and her matching stiletto heels.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was also, for reasons he didn't quite understand, really boring to him now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she could clearly tell. They had been making out for several minutes while seated on the edge of the huge king bed, Cassidy's hands flying all over Ted's body as they kissed. Basic stuff, but it usually did the job to get her clients started, and once upon a time had with Ted. Today, though, he was just going through the motions, and there was no movement whatsoever between his legs, even after she put her hand down his pants and tried to give him a jump start. He pulled away from her, embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tough day at the office?\" she asked, trying to sound supportive. He'd already paid for this session, but if she wasn't doing it for him anymore, she doubted there would be future ones, and this guy paid well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little,\" he admitted, \"but that's not it. I don't know what's wrong. You're the sexiest goddamn woman I've ever been with. We're doing all the things I usually like. And... nothing.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then maybe we should try something different from what you usually like,\" she suggested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe suggested various specialties, like erotic food play, or some light S&amp;M, but he didn't seem interested. As she tried to think of a solution, she noticed him loosening the knot on his silk royal blue necktie, which matched his impeccably tailored suit, and a lightbulb went off above her head. She reached over and loosened the tie some more, pulled it over his head, and pulled it over hers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about a little role reversal?\" she asked, a grin on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" he asked nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean,\" she said, kicking off her heels and unbuttoning his expensive shirt, \"that I put on this exquisite suit of yours, and you put on my dress, and we pretend to be each other for a bit, just to see how it feels.\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But now that she had done it, she might as well see what kind of money she had acquired in the short term. There were a few hundred dollars, which was more than she was probably expecting, but less than she was hoping for. On the other hand, there were several credit cards, including a black card, and Cassidy realized she could probably run up a bunch of purchases before Ted was able to cancel the card. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got off in the lobby, her attire immediately attracting stares \u2014 most of them approving \u2014 walked into the hotel bar, and ordered a glass of the most expensive scotch they had.

Lindsey was very fast with taking off her dress and heels and unhooked her bra, then dropped her panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim then moved over to his secretary's pile of clothes and stepping into the black panties. They had a small red lace on the edges and were very tight on his crotch. He then hooked the bra on his chest, which he did fairly easily and lastly pulled the black dress over top his head and stepped into the heels. Lindsey in the meantime had gotten dressed in her boss's boxers, comfortable suit pants, shirt and jacket as well as his smart shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they just finished getting dressed, the elevator arrived at Tim\u2019s office<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lindsey strutted off the elevator, looking completely at ease in Tim's clothes, her hands leaning out of his trouser pockets. Tim, on the other hand, was instantly struggling to get around in Lindsey's outfit. The little black dress was so tight that his legs could barely move, and the high heeled shoes made him feel like he was trying to stay balanced on a tightrope 100 feet above the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you walk in this stuff?\" he groaned as he struggled to follow her into his office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe swaggered around to his desk, plopped down in his chair, and boldly put her feet up, her hands folded smugly behind her head. She gave Tim a pitying look, and said, \"Awww, the sacrifices we make for beauty.\" She appraised him up and down, then added, \"But in your case, cutie, it's surely worth the pain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim eased himself down onto the sofa where Lindsey usually sat when she worked away from her own desk. It felt good to not be standing, though the heels still pinched his feet something awful. \"I think you got the better end of this deal,\" he grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey straightened her black necktie and fingered the lapel of her suit jacket. \"I could pretend to find something to complain about,\" she admitted, \"but I think you're right. I don't know that I'm ever going to trade back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't joke like that!\" Tim snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey pulled her feet off the desk, stood up, wandered over to sit next to Tim, and gently stroked his cheek. \"Who said I was joking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah yeah,\" Tim said. \"Now what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe checked the sleek Rolex on her wrist, then announced, \"Well, we do have to finish up each other's work, but there's something important I have to do first. Give me your purse, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim handed over the purse he still had on his shoulder, annoyed that she had referred to it as his, and watched as she fished through it until she produced a tube of lipstick, an eyeliner pencil, and a bottle of nail polish. Seeing where this was going, he raised his hands in protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no no,\" he insisted. \"I'll wear your clothes for a bit, but makeup is where I draw the line.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I want you to look like your prettiest self,\" she said with a pout. \"And I think you'll feel happier in these clothes too if you can see how you look after I do my magic. Please?\" She batted the lashes above her big blue eyes, and he was putty in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, fine,\" he grumbled. She clapped her hands with delight, then spent the next ten minutes carefully applying color (mostly red) to his lips, his cheeks, his eyes, and his finger and toenails. The latter at least allowed him to take off the cursed shoes, but now he had to wait even longer just to get back to work. Lindsey leaned back to take in the full look, pleased with her work. She fished a compact out of the purse, flipped open the mirror, and shocked Tim with his reflection. He certainly didn't look like a woman, but he did look...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gorgeous,\" he said, almost in a daze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bet your sweet ass you are,\" Lindsey said, before getting up and going back to Tim's desk. She began going through the paperwork, warning him that he would have to do the same the second his nails were dry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin 15 minutes, he felt comfortable using his hands again, and he was pleasantly surprised to find that Lindsey had been right. Even though he was just doing more paperwork, the swap of role \u2014 and clothing \u2014 spiced it up enough that it was almost fun to complete. He blazed through it in record time. He was so focused on the task that, when he looked up again, he was shocked to realize that Lindsey had gone... taking his clothes, his phone, his wallet, and his car keys with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where the hell did she go?\" he asked, starting to panic. </span></div></div>",

The family were loaded, the daughter was a bit of a nightmare but nothing Elaine couldn\u2019t handle. The best part was the family had an indoor swimming pool which she used every time she went over there. She even left her swimming costume at the house,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking through the door the daughter wasn\u2019t home from school yet. Slipping off her high heeled loafers by the front door she made herself a drink and hanging her leather jacket on the stairs she sat in the tv room. She had finished her drink when Katy got home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Katy was only 14 she was already the same size as Elaine. Her mum was a very tall woman and it looked like Katy would be the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you coming for a swim\u201d Katy said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure\u201d Elaine replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking into the pool changing room, Elaine\u2019s swimming costume was not where she had left it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave you seen my bikini\u201d Elaine asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c oh the cleaner must have washed, there must be something you wear in the pile\u201d Katy said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlightly annoyed, Elaine looked. There were two costumes that belonged to the mom, they were too large, a pair of men\u2019s swim shorts and two of Katy\u2019s costumes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne was a black all in one and the other was a really babyish pink one with frilly parts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can wear my pink one\u201d Katy said \u201c I was going to wear the black one\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElaine wasn\u2019t happy but she pulled off her clothes and put on the pink costume, as she stood next to Katy she now looked like the younger of the two of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both got in the pool and started swimming, after half an hour Katy got out \u201cI am going to do some homework\u201d Katy said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, i am going to go in the hot tub and sauna for a bit\u201d Elaine replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaty then walked into the changing rooms. After another 30 min, Elaine got out of the sauna and walked into the changing room, she stopped dead. Instead of her jeans and fitted vest top Katy\u2019s school uniform was hanging there nothing else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a shower she didn\u2019t know what to do. She looked at the pile of clothes, the little cow had taken her underwear and bra as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanted to storm upstairs but she decided to play along. Dressing in Katy\u2019s plain underwear and school uniform ( white shirt, grey skirt, long white socks and ballet flat shoes) brushing her hair she walked upstairs and found Katy in the tv room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice outfit\u201d Elaine said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell i thought as you borrowed my costume you would return the favour\u201d katy grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat I am not sure\u201d Elaine said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about we have a little bet\u201d Katy said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo on\u201d Elaine replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell the pizza guy will be here in 10 minutes, why dont we see if he can work out who is the oldest\u201d Katy grinned<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that\u2019s not fair, I am wearing your school uniform, i clearly look younger\u201d Elaine complained<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you can wear anything from my room\u201d KAty said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay you are on\u201d Elaine replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElaine hurried up to Katy\u2019s room, this would be easy she thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking through Katy\u2019s wardrobe her heart sank, everything looked like it belonged to a younger girl, no heels at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoosing some skinny jeans with colourful stitching, pair of uggs boots and a flowery shirt style top with a collar. Walking back downstairs she was in for a shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaty had helped herself to her makeup, she now was fully made up for a night out. With her heeled loafers on and leather jacket she looked even older than Elaine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the door bell rings...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Remembering what her aunt had said, Amy had been having trouble sleeping so had been taken something to help her sleep. It looks like it has worked Lucy grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpotting Amy's clothes laying on the chair Lucy lifted her duvet cover, Amy was just in her underwear. That's not warm enough for my cousin grinned Lucy. Pulling off Amy's thong and unbuckling her bra she and proceeded to put her plain cotton bra and panties over her and then proceeded to pulled her pyjamas onto her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWiping the make off off her face Amy now looked identical to Lucy. Lucy was grinning massively. First Lucy pulled on Amy's lacy underwear and thong, she then pulled on the skinny jeans and finally the fitted white top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank god she is a heavy sleeper\u201d thought Lucy as she started to look for Amy\u2019s footwear <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting on the bed she pulled on Amy's socks and finally pulled on her pixie style ankle boots. Opening Amy's handbag she used her makeup to make her look more like Amy. Finally putting on Amy's jacket and handbag she walked downstairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting dressed in Amy\u2019s clothes Lucy took a moment to admire her handiwork while noting that they both looked completely like the other,Walking into the kitchen her Aunty was standing up<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah Amy, are you finished, where's Lucy,\" she asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She decided to go to bed\" Lucy grinned, \"She said she was tired\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well she has got a busy day tomorrow,\" Lucy's mum said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on love,\" her aunty said as Lucy followed her out of the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
