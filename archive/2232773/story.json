He retaliated as Olivia found herself growing more annoyed with Simon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut Simon my feet hurt.\u201d She pleaded, however Simon wasn\u2019t listening as he dragged her to her feet saying that \u201cthe escape room will probably have a chair in it or something just come on.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia and Simon then walked up to see a women dressed like a magician being the tickets saleslady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello there Olivia and Simon I see you wish to enter my escape room.\u201d She said shocking the both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you know our names?\u201d Olivia asked now more worried about entering the room now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMagic my dear, I see your feet are killing you, well don\u2019t worry once you two escape my room I promise you the boot will be on the other foot.\u201d She said laughing as she said it. Confusing Simon and Olivia, who was already fed up with the fair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they entered the room the door they entered from locked behind them, with the only door being left was the door in front of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon instantly tried the handle to it but to no avail as it remained shut, Olivia meanwhile looked around at the room they were in, it was filed to the brim with shoe boxes and racks of high heels and sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat should we do first?\u201d Asked Olivia knowing that Simon had already thought of a plan she was going to be forced to follow no matter what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Simon didn\u2019t hesitate to suggest his plan as he confidently blurted out. \u201cOpen up the shoeboxes their might be a clue in one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia then sighed as she searched shoe box after shoebox only to come up empty each time. Eventually though Simon found a clue to which he was extremely happy about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah this is great I\u2019m breezing through this escape room easy peasy, and now- wait what no that can\u2019t be right?\u201d He said with a look of embarrassment on his face as Olivia decided to take a glance at the clue that was a piece of paper with a message on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia then read the message and felt a smug grin appear on her face. \u2018If you wish to leave this room too, simply walk a mile in each other\u2019s shoes\u2019. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia knew what the message meant as did Simon, who blushed at the thought of changing his white trainers out for Olivia\u2019s heels. Could he really go through with it Simon decided too....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Free booze, free food and a free room, he could hardly say no. The theme was super hero\u2019s so after some searching he found what he thought was a Spider-Man outfit, a fitted all in one with a face mask. It covered him from head to toe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving at the hotel he checked into his room, after an initial mixup he got the correct room and he got ready for the party. Joining his friends at the bar for pre-party drinks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, looks it\u2019s spider woman\u201d danny said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, its Spider-Man\u201d Marshall said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, i am pretty sure that\u2019s a spider woman costume\u201d Danny grinned<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not\u201d Marshall replied \u201care we drinking or what\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on boys\u201d Marshall said and they were soon in their third pint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaty walked across the bar to join them \u201chey boys, starting earlier\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarshall turned around, and his heart sank. Katy was wearing a spider woman costume. It was identical except she was wearing a pair of red stiletto knee high boots with hers, compared to his trainers hidden under the costumes feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHahaha, told you\u201d Danny said \u201cSpider-woman\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarshall was not happy, but grinned regardless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking through to the party they were all soon feeling very drunk. Marshall spotted Katy sitting down so he joined her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry about earlier, I didn\u2019t realise\u201d she grinned<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s okay, why are you sitting down\u201d Marshall asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy feet are killing me in these boots\u201d Katy replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you want to borrow these\u201d Marshall said kicking off his trainers,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you mind\u201d Katy said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell with the masks on, we look the same anyway\u201d Marshall grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks\u201d Katy said pushing on Marshall\u2019s trainers and heading to the dance floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarshall pushed his feet into Katy\u2019s  boots, standing up he joined the dance floor. One of Katy\u2019s friend Becky grabbed his arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKaty, can you help me back to my room, I really need to go to bed\u201d she asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny grinned \u201csure\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelping Becky back to her room she fell on the bed, \u201ccan you help me get undress, you can wear my costume if you like, I did say we could swap \u201c as Becky the passed out, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarshall removed the rest of Becky costume until she was naked on the bed. Her black leather cat suit, lay in a pile along with her underwear and ankle boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarshall grinned, why not. He was soon dressed in the costume. It was extremely tight figure hugging and he needed to push his tackle between his legs held in by the thong so it wouldn\u2019t show, stuffing his feet into the high heeled boots he stood up and put on the mask. Applying the red lipstick from Becky bag he was now her twin. </span></div></div>",

They were leaving in an hour. Marshall walked into the house, sitting in the conservatory with Danny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChatting for 30minutes Danny got a call, Danny left the room returning a few minutes later<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"well that's that,\" Danny said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up\" Marshall replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Claire's not coming she's stuck at work won't be here for at least three hours so we cant go\" Danny replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go with you\" Marshall replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have leathers?\" Danny asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, do you have some I can borrow, I don't mind\" Marshall replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think mine will be too big for you,\" Danny said, \"What wist size are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"28\" Marshall said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blimey, mine will swamp you,\" Danny said \"Hang on come with me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking upstairs and into the 4th bedroom, Danny pointed to some leathers on the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are Claire's, they might fit you,\" Danny said \"What shoe size are you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"6\" Marshall replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blimey, they will fit you too\" Danny grinned, get changed we can leave in 10minutes,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny left the room and closed the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarshall kicked off his boat shoes and tried to slide his legs into the leathers, there were too tight against his loose jeans. Spotting Claire's blue skinny fit jeans on the bed he removed his jeans and replaced them with Claire's. Having the same problem with his shirt he pulled it off and replaced it with Claire's fitted sports top, it had an inbuilt bra which gave him a fairly impressive cleavage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting down he put his feet into the motorcycle boots, they fitted him really well, doing up the velcro sides he put on the biker jacket zipping it up. Walking down the stairs Danny was ready. Handing Marshall the matching helmet and gloves and they headed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving at a roadside cafe they stopped, getting off Marshall pulled off the helmet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow, look at you,\" Danny said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What\" Marshall replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Makeup, it must have been from the inside of the helmet\" Danny grinned<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice\" Marshall grinned<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a quick drink, they got back on the bike and in under an hour, they arrived at the bike rally. Removing his helmet Danny laughed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You might need to sort that\" Danny grinned \"Its worse\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should have brought my trainers, its gonna be hot in these\" Marshall said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Claire's bag is in the side box, there might be something in there,\" Dany said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarshall carried the bag to the portaloo. Opening the bag there were some clothes, makeup, and a pair of boots. Unfortunately, they were a black suede pair of ankle boots with a 4\" block heel. removing the biker boots he pulled off the leathers and then remembered he was wearing Claire's jeans. He put on the ankle boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking in the mirror he had foundation all over his face, after routing there the makeup bag he had foundation, mascara, and lipstick on. He looks a lot like Claire. Putting his hair into a high ponytail with one of her scrunchies. Picking up the bag, leather trousers, and boots he walked back to the bike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanny took a double-take \"Wow\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What\" Marshall grinned<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on let's get a drink,\" Danny said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Marshall has a habit of going to a club getting hammered and leaving with whatever girl would sleep with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe usually Liked to try and leave clubs as quickly as possible due to his appearance as Marshall has quite a unique problem of people mistaking him for a girl. This was because of his Slender figure and height of 5\u20195. It didn\u2019t help that he also had quite a feminine face. This usually led him into quite a few awkward situations, with the worst one being when a big strong guy mistakes him for his girlfriend and french kissed him, and punched him in the face when he realised he was a guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarshall then looked around the room he was in and realised that he had went to girl he slept with\u2019s house, it wasn\u2019t the first time this had happened but he couldn\u2019t see the girl he slept with anywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer name was Brittney and she wasn\u2019t the usual type of girl that he would go for. She was the same height as him and had blonde hair and an hourglass figure. She wore a tight pink dress and was bossy, sassy and air headed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Marshall got up he realised he was completely naked he also got a good look at the room he was in. It was all pink and filled to the brim with cosmetic products wardrobes and a vanity table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet for all the stuff in her room, Marshall could not find the one thing he needed...his clothes, he searched all over the room praying he had some luck, even searching her trash can to see if she put them in there like his ex girlfriend did but it was all in vein.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarshall was starting to panic now, he couldn\u2019t find his phone his wallet or his keys. Not only that but at this rate he was going to be late for an important job interview at a salon, Marshall hated girly stuff like that but he needed the money and new how to put on makeup thanks to his Ex teaching him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarshall then saw the note that Brittney had left in the vanity mirror ripping it off and beginning to read it to gain some understanding of what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Hi whatever you\u2019re name was, I\u2019m so glad you let me talk you into letting me pick out an outfit for you to wear to your interview and trust me you\u2019re going to look super pretty and stylish and they\u2019ll hire you just because of how pretty you\u2019ll look. But in case you don\u2019t want to wear something pretty and pink I\u2019ve got your ugly ratty clothes with me, I\u2019ll probably be at the shopping mall if you want them back for some reason. Anyway I\u2019ll see you later Cutie and I hope your job thingy goes well - Love Brittney p.s. if you come for you\u2019re old clothes and you\u2019re other stuff you\u2019ll only get them if you wear the pretty outfit I picked out for you\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat stupid Bitch\u201d Murmured Tim as he realised what had happened. While drunk he must of told her about how him and his ex swapped clothes and how he had a big interview today and Britney must have talked his drunk ass into letting her choose what he wears too it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim slapped himself in the face for being so stupid he knew that once this was over he probably want going to drink for a while. He then went to see what clothes Brittney left for him and prayed they were at least subtle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim\u2019s jaw dropped when he saw what Brittney had chosen for him to wear for the interview. And it was not subtle. Brittney had left a tight white women\u2019s business shirt for him, a Bright pink blazer and tight Mini skirt combo, bright Pink stilettos, a full set of pink lingerie, a Purse filed with cosmetics and A bright blond wig that was styled to make him look more Sexy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim wanted to scream he realised that he was going to have to go out looking like a Business Bimbo. It was the most humiliating thing possible for him. But he had no choice but to wear all of it if he wanted his stuff back from Brittney.including that stupid Blonde wig. But then he thought about what other clothes Brittney had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe she had something more causal laying about that wouldn\u2019t be too embarrassing to wear like a pink t shirt and jean shorts. But that Would also mean he\u2019d lose his phone, his wallet, and his house keys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim spent a minute trying to work out what to do and decided to.....</span></div></div>",

But one thing led to another, as it usually did, and at 6:15 the next morning, they were curled up on the couch in Ted's office, naked, sweaty, still high on the endorphins from their latest round of lovemaking. As far as they knew, they were the only ones in the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey stretched and ran her fingers through her dark brown hair, which she wore in short, extremely chic style. (Ted's, on the other hand, was long for a man, though he usually wore it slicked back at work to fit the conservative dress code.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm starving,\" she said. \"Want something from the vending machine?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything with chocolate,\" he replied, still slightly dazed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slipped on his expensive powder blue dress shirt, then looked around the floor before stepping into his black leather oxford shoes. \"Hey, that's my stuff!\" he protested. She grinned and said, \"It is way too early to be walking in heels, boss man,\" and marched out towards the break room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed sat up, drank from a bottle of water on the end table, and tried to remind himself of the day's schedule. Lindsey returned with a couple of Snickers bars. She looked deep in thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up?\" Ted asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just surprised by how well these shoes and this shirt fit me,\" she said, walking around and turning to show off how comfortably she could move in them. \"I knew we were about the same height, but still. You would think these were mine to begin with.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My mother used to say we were lucky that my feet stopped growing before the rest of me did, so we wouldn't have to keep buying new shoes,\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down at her feet, then at his, and a wicked grin spread across her face. Ted knew that look meant nothing good for him, but couldn't resist asking, \"What?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed her black Louboutins off the floor and sat next to him. \"Well, it occurs to me that if your shoes fit me so perfectly, then mine should do the same for you.\" She sat down and placed the high-heeled pumps on the floor in front of him. \"What say we prove my hypothesis?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want me to wear your shoes?\" he asked, laughing nervously? \"Didn't you just say it's too early for heels?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too early for me to wear them after having spent all of yesterday in those pretty but uncomfortable things,\" she said, stroking his leg in a way that made him feel weak. \"You, on the other hand, have just been cruising around in these low to the ground wonders, so I think your feet can take the Lobu's better than mine at the moment.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not going to wear your shoes!\" he protested. \"That's ridiculous. What if anybody sees me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fingers now moved to his inner thigh as she said, \"The custodial staff doesn't even get here until 7:30. We are all alone. This is a safe space, and I want to see how sexy your legs and ass look in these. Won't you do it for me? Please?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween the pouty, sexy look on her face and the feel of her hand hovering near his groin, Ted felt powerless to resist. He let Lindsey squeeze his feet into the narrow shoes, then help him stand up. He wobbled a bit at first, then found his balance. He and Lindsey were the same height in bare feet, so he towered over her the way she usually did in heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stepped back to study him, circling his body and whistling approvingly. \"My goodness, you've got some nice legs, boss man,\" she said with a giggle. \"How do they feel?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better than I would have thought,\" he admitted. \"They're a little pinchy, but they fit.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe encouraged him to walk around his office in them. After a few stumbles, he gained his balance and was practically gliding in them. \"Goddamn!\" Lindsey cheered. \"Do you want some fries with that shake?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Satisfied?\" he asked, trying to keep from blushing. He felt a bit embarrassed, but there was something else there \u2014 a feeling he was too afraid to fully recognize. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" she said smugly. \"If our shoes fit each other so well, maybe we should see how the rest of the ensembles look.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" he asked, both nervous and excited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gestured to his expensive navy pinstripe three-piece suit, which was lying across his desk, and then to her sleeveless red silk blouse and black pencil skirt, and said, \"I want to try on that fabulous suit of yours, and I want to see how you look in my clothes.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed's heart was pounding his chest. He was both terrified of the idea itself and at how excited he realized it made him. He wasn't sure what to do next.  </span></div></div>",

She had played along with his decision for them to pretend to be each other, simply because she wasn't sure what else to do in that moment. But now Jessica thought she was Ted, and vice versa. And worse, the rest of the staff had started to file in. Even though they were new to this floor, the odds of making it through an entire work day without running into someone who knew who she really was seemed impossible. And even if they somehow did, she realized, it wasn't like Jessica was going anywhere. She was in charge of the whole company! And Ted was one of the company's most promising young executives. It wasn't like they could avoid her after today. If it wouldn't ruin the masculine persona she was trying so desperately to maintain, Lindsey would have cried (or, at least, pouted). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething in her pocket buzzed, and she realized she had Ted's phone. She fished it out of her trousers and saw a calendar reminder (one that she had made, in her real job as Ted's assistant) for the big meeting they had stayed up late the night before to prep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica, who had been droning on about her management style, noticed her looking at the phone. \"Something the matter, Ted?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey wasn't sure of the right thing to do, or say, under these crazy circumstances, but she had to make a decision. It was a meeting with a company called Bannister, and Ted had to this point communicated with them only by phone and email, so they wouldn't necessarily know what he looked like. Plus, the thing was supposed to happen at the hotel where Bannister's rep was staying, which would get her out of the office for a bit and at least delay the moment of discovery by a few hours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm supposed to go to Bannister to make the pitch,\" she said, trying to sound confident. \"Lindsey should have CC'ed you on the details yesterday. I really want to spend as much time with you as I can, but I really should be heading out for this meeting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica smiled. \"Well, why don't I tag along? It'll do me some good to be out in the field, and we can get some more of that face time you wanted on the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey was cornered. She knew the pitch well enough to deliver it herself, but to do it in front of Jessica?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least it's better than staying here,\" she thought, before smiling, pulling on Ted's suit jacket, and gesturing towards the door, telling Jessica, \"Ladies first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica snickered. \"And here I thought no gentlemen worked at this company,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe passed Ted, who was frantically composing a text on her phone, presumably about the Bannister meeting. \"Lindsey,\" she said, trying to sound casual, while looking for an excuse to get him out of the secretarial bullpen before anyone noticed him. \"Jessica wants to come with me to Bannister. Why don't you hold down the fort from my office? There's some reorganization in there I need you to do in there. It should take you at least until we get back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed looked like he was about to have a stroke as he considered the way this day kept evolving, but then he composed himself and said, \"Yes, sir.\" He got up, pivoted on the heels of Jessica's boots, and walked into his own office. Lindsey couldn't help admiring the way his ass looked in her skirt, and Jessica caught her admiring it. Lindsey motioned like she was going to apologize, but Jessica simply laughed and held up a hand in a stop gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, Ted. We've all had attractive colleagues. The important part is that you don't act on that attraction, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right!\" Lindsey answered through clenched teeth, and marched towards the elevators.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you mind driving?\" Jessica asked on the way down to the garage. \"After all those years at the London office, it's taking me a while to readjust to driving on the other side of the road.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey felt through her pockets until she found the keys to Ted's sports car. He had given her many rides in it, but never once let her drive. She was suddenly seeing a silver lining in this dark cloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, boss!\" she said cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After an exhilarating highway drive where even Jessica approved of her pushing the sports car to its limits, Lindsey arrived at the hotel. She checked her reflection in the mirror. She hadn't thought of her hairstyle as masculine, nor had anyone ever accused her of looking androgynous, but between Ted's suit and the lack of makeup and jewelry, she looked close enough to pass. If she told people she was Ted Smith, then the illusion was believable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Bannister rep was named Kevin Jarvis, a balding, friendly Englishman much closer to Jessica's age than Lindsey's. He did, indeed, believe her as Ted \u2014 and it helped that she had been CC'ed on all their emails and been on the line for all their calls, so she could throw in details from past conversations. The pitch went even better than the small talk, to Lindsey's amazement. She had never done this in a meeting before, though she'd seen Ted do it plenty of times. As she strutted around the room, her hand cockily perched on the pocket of her borrowed trousers, she realized that she had always envied Ted his position, and that she not only liked doing his job for the moment, but was actually good at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was, she would soon realize, *too* good at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" she asked with a confident smile as she finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a long pause at first, and for a moment, Lindsey worried she had messed up. But she turned to Jessica, who was practically beaming with pride, and when she turned back to Kevin, she could see that he was just searching for the right words to express his appreciation of the pitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That,\" he said carefully but enthusiastically, \"was maybe the best presentation of its type I've ever had the pleasure to witness in person. You've convinced me this would be an incredible opportunity for Bannister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey felt herself flush with pride. For the moment, all memory of this swap of clothes, and roles, or the disaster that was approaching her and Ted whenever they were found out, was forgotten. She thought of putting on some false modesty, but knew that the real Ted wouldn't. And she had gotten this far by acting like Ted, so instead she confidently asked, \"So, do we have a deal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled and said, \"We do, on one condition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer confidence faltered a bit. \"What's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We would want you to come back with me to Bannister HQ in London so we can work together overseeing Phase 1 of the project.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey's heart began pounding again. She was not at all prepared for this, especially once she remembered that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phase 1 is meant to last six months,\" she said, only barely remembering to maintain her fake male voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least!\" Jessica interjected herself into the conversation, looking delighted with this turn of events. \"Depending on how things go, you might get to be on the other side of the pond for a year, maybe two!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe two?\" Lindsey asked weakly, contemplating an extended time of having to dress like a man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other two seemed oblivious to her distress. \"Ideally, you'd be able to fly back with me tonight,\" Kevin said. \"I really want to get started on this immediately. We could set you and, say, your assistant up with housing for as long as you'd need, so you wouldn't have to worry about anything at all over there. Do you think you could swing such a fast turnaround?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Lindsey could say anything, Jessica stepped in to say, \"Of course he can. You're going to love London, Ted. Trust me. And I bet your lovely secretary \u2014 what was her name again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lindsey,\" she replied, feeling fainter by the minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Jessica said, \"Lindsey will adore getting to spend some extended time over there at such a young age. Why, maybe she'll meet and fall in love with an Englishman! Wouldn't that be just darling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey tried to imagine telling Ted about this latest turn of events. On the one hand, this was the (temporary) solution to all their problems. They'd be leaving immediately. They'd be an ocean away from anyone who knew them, and thus would have a long time before anyone caught on \u2014 maybe enough time to figure a way out of this catastrophe. On the other, they would be getting in so deep that there might never be a safe way out. What, she wondered, would Ted want to do?</span></div></div>",

As bad as things were on some level, she couldn't resist the idea that she liked being treated like a powerful executive. And, as she strutted past some admiring (or, at least, puzzled) secretaries, she also couldn't help noticing how much more she enjoyed wearing Ted's fancy three-piece suit and oxfords than she did tottering around in her tight clothes and precarious heels. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey arrived at the office, where they found Ted seated on the couch, Jessica's boots lying on the floor near him as he rubbed what were clearly aching feet. He sat up with alarm when he saw them and began trying to spit out an apology, but Jessica tut-tutted him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now now, young lady, that's quite alright,\" she told him. \"I've been there many times myself, particularly when I'm vain enough to wear those boots. They look fabulous, but I always pay for it later.\" She sat down next to Ted, pulled off Lindsey's pumps, and began putting on and zipping up the boots. She gestured to the Louboutins, and added, \"Though I have to admit these are precarious in their own way. But you're welcome to them back, and I appreciate the loan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's okay,\" said an anxious Ted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey could see it was killing him waiting to find out how the meeting had gone, and to have a moment alone with her so they could regroup and figure out what to do next. She decided to help him, by offering, \"Thanks so much for helping me prep for the Bannister pitch, Lindsey. It went better than we could have possibly hoped for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed seemed so stunned by this news that Lindsey felt a bit offended. Did he really think she couldn't do his job if she had to?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore either could say anything else, Jessica interjected, \"So well, in fact, that I believe the two of you need to have a big discussion now. I'll leave you to it. Ted, let me know what she decides immediately so travel can begin booking tickets for tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tonight?\" Ted asked, but Jessica had already twirled around on the heels of her boots and was marching out of the office. Ted turned to Lindsey, looking both scared and even a bit angry, and demanded to know what had happened. She told him everything, up to and including the offer for them both to transfer to London, immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed looked thrilled, then shocked, then afraid again. He gestured at how they were each dressed. \"But, we'd have to go... like this? For six months?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe longer,\" Lindsey said, parroting Jessica. \"If the project works, we might be there for a couple of years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YEARS?!?!?\" Ted bellowed in his own voice, before realizing that people outside might be looking, and added much more quietly, \"How did this go from a silly little sex game into something where we're posing as each other for years?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey paced, again noticing how much easier this was to do in a man's suit. \"I know, I know,\" she said, before laying out the bright side. \"But it keeps us from being discovered right now. Nobody there knows us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but Kevin thinks you're me, which means I have to be you,\" he replied, not appeased. \"I've been wearing a thong and fishnets for only a few hours and I already want to kill myself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, girlie,\" said Lindsey, now more than a little annoyed to hear him moaning about the fashion challenges she had to put up with every day of her life. \"At least it buys us time to think of a way out. Maybe once we're over there for a bit, there's a simple escape hatch. Like, you apply for another job virtually, take it, and we come back to America as ourselves, never once having to return to this place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not bad,\" he admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the alternative is to swap our clothes back now, walk into Jessica's office, confess, and probably both become unemployable in this field,\" she added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be very bad,\" he said. He slipped the pumps back on, cringing a bit as he did so, stood up and walked around in them again. \"I think you're right. We go to England, role play for a few weeks with me coaching you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... and vice versa,\" she added, thinking of how woefully unqualified he was for most of her secretarial duties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" he said apologetically. \"And then once we're sure the project is on the right track, I start looking for a job back here \u2014 just preferably not *right* here \u2014 and we get to return to our own lives.

Maybe, she thought, she might even find ways to extend that phase. \"I guess we need to help each other pack?\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"How did I get here?\" Ted asked himself for the millionth time today. This was the first one where he was flying in a private jet over the Atlantic, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin had gone out like a light the moment their flight took off. Ted had wanted to take advantage of the private time to gameplan some more with Lindsey, but she was mainly interested in enjoying the amenities of such high-class travel. After a couple of scotches, she had loosened her necktie, reclined her seat, and joined Kevin in slumber land.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed drummed his fingers anxiously against the arm wrest of his own luxurious seat. His hands were now freshly-manicured, his fingernails painted dark red. This was part of an elaborate impromptu makeover Lindsey had thrown together for both of them between the time they finished packing for London and when they had to be at the airport. Ted kicked off his already-hated pumps and wiggled his toes, which were painted matching shade of red. He had at least enjoyed the pampered feeling of the mani-pedi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther aspects of the makeover had been less pleasant, including a full body waxing session, getting his eyebrows plucked into a more feminine arch, and having hair extensions sewn in, to take his hair from collar length down to his shoulderblades, where the added locks cascaded in blonde waves that even he had to admit looked great. Though he had always kept himself trim, his waist was now encased in Spanx, to help add to the feminine illusion, and his bra was filled with some convincing silicone breast forms. He stared at his reflection in the window, not quite believing that all of this had happened to him, and would keep happening for quite some time, because of how dumb he had been with Lindsey, and then with Jessica.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe studied Lindsey. He had always found her very attractive, even before the first time they fell into bed together, but he hadn't realized how androgynous her features were until they had swapped identities. While he was getting waxed and plucked, she had gone to a barber next door to get her still vaguely feminine cut trimmed down into something more conservatively masculine, with the back and sides buzzed close to her scalp and a clear side part. Between the hair, her prominent jaw, and eyebrows that she had always worn on the thick side, she looked close enough to male for Ted's expensive suit to do the rest of the work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried mapping out how they would be able to both maintain their secret and escape this cross-dressing prison as quickly as possible, but eventually, fatigue got the better of him and he fell asleep, waking up with a gentle nudge from Lindsey on the tarmac at Heathrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wake up, Sleeping Beauty,\" she whispered in his ear, more flirtatiously than might have been advisable if Kevin hadn't already deplaned. Ted yawned, stretched, and pulled the accursed heels back on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a heart-stopping trip through Customs, where the officials paid surprisingly little scrutiny to their passport photos, Ted and Lindsey found themselves in the back of an SUV limo with Kevin, who was extolling the virtues of the corporate housing he had arranged for them. When they arrived at the building, though, Ted couldn't help noticing that the apartment that had been arranged for Lindsey was a well-appointed suite with a huge TV, a wet bar, a pool table, and other accoutrements, while he had been assigned a modest one-bedroom that Kevin referred to as \"cute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I should give you a few hours to settle in, unpack, and start adjusting to the new time zone,\" he told them. \"I'll pick you up at 6.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For what?\" Ted asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As luck would have it, tonight is our division's annual black tie dinner,\" Kevin said with a smile. \"I can't think of a better opportunity for you to meet your new team.\" He could see their apprehension and added, reassuringly, \"If you didn't pack for black tie, I can arrange a car to take you both out shopping.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Ted has a tuxedo,\" Ted said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Lindsey has several nice dresses,\" said Lindsey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's almost like you packed for each other!\" Kevin said with a laugh, oblivious to the truth of that statement. He left, and Kevin plopped down on one of the plush couches in Lindsey's living room. Lindsey followed suit, placing her feet up on a coffee table, folding her hands behind her head, clearly enjoying her new life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty swank, huh, boss man?\" she asked with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You definitely got the better end of the deal,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You haven't seen the dresses I packed for you,\" she replied. \"Though I bet I look hot as balls in a tux!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god,\" Ted sighed. \"Do I really have to go to this thing tonight?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey sat up, removed her suit jacket, and began unbuttoning her vest. \"I mean, it probably doesn't make *me* look great if my secretary blows off our first social engagement. But I bet if we blame it on jet lag, nobody will care all that much.\"  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"No, I should go,\" Ted said with a sigh. \"I'm going to be at enough of a disadvantage as it is, having to dress and act like you. Better to meet everybody we have to work with at an informal setting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it sounds like this will be a very formal setting,\" Lindsey quipped, as she began opening up their luggage. First she produced a black men's tuxedo from Ted's garment bag, then withdrew a stunning red sleeveless gown from one of her own suitcases. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.\" For a moment, Ted was too awestruck by the dress to realize that he was going to be wearing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn right, 'wow,'\" Lindsey said, as she laid it carefully on the bed. As she began loosening her necktie, she pouted \u2014 an expression that looked wildly incongruous with her clothes and haircut. \"I would have looked so hot in this, too,\" she added wistfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin moments, Lindsey had stripped down to Ted's undershirt, boxers and dress socks. She yawned and ran her fingers through her close-cropped hair, then looked at Ted. \"I've never worn a tux before, and I know you've never worn a dress like this before. You want me to help you first, or vice versa?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed was still mesmerized by the dress. It was the first thing since this ordeal began that he found genuinely exciting, in a way he felt more than a little embarrassed by. He hoped Lindsey couldn't tell from his expression how badly he wanted to wear that thing, and instead tried to play it cool. \"Why don't I help you put on the ol' monkey suit first?\" he suggested. \"The less time I have to spend squeezed into that thing, the better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say so,\" Lindsey replied, but there was something in her tone of voice that had Ted wondering if she in turn could read into how he was acting. He tried to focus on the task at hand, first helping Lindsey insert the studs and cufflinks into the crisp white tuxedo shirt before she put it on, then adjusting the black suspenders after she had wriggled into the tuxedo pants with their shiny black stripe, then adjusting the cummerbund for her more narrow waist. He gave her a crash course in tying a bow tie, to which she responded by asking him to get her a clip-on next time, then helped with the jacket and patent leather shoes. She posed for him and asked, \"How do I look?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like a million bucks,\" he told her sincerely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled at this compliment and mimed holding a gun before saying, in a terrible English accent, \"The name's Bond. James Bond.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, now I need your help, Mr. Bond,\" he replied, trying not to seem too eager to put on the gown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you do,\" she said, returning to her suitcase for another item: a lacy red corset. \"I have to stitch you into this torture device first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed held up a hand in protest. He had seen women in these things up close before, and while they looked hot, they did not seem the least bit comfortable. \"Whoa, do I have to wear that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me: the dress will look way better on you if you have this corset on underneath.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis were the exact words Ted needed to hear. He held up his arms in a gesture of surrender, and soon was wincing as Lindsey pulled the corset's strings tighter and tighter. \"Torture device\" was starting to feel like an understatement. But a moment later, all thought of pain was gone, as Lindsey slipped the silky dress over his head and pulled it down over him. Outside of sex \u2014 and not even all sex, at that \u2014 he had never had so pleasurable a feeling in his life as that material sliding across his newly-smooth skin. He shivered at the sensation of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's right,\" she said with a smirk. \"It feels nearly as good as it looks, doesn't it? And it already looks sensational on you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed really wanted to see his reflection, but Lindsey first insisted on accessorizing him: a matching pair of red pumps that were mercifully an inch shorter than the Louboutin's he'd been wearing since yesterday, dangly costume jewelry faux diamond earrings, a matching bracelet, and a fresh coat of makeup, including bright red lipstick in the same shade as the dress. She helped him to his feet, put her hands over his eyes, and led him to the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My god,\" he said, when he saw his reflection. He could still recognize his own facial features beneath the makeup and the long hair, but it was an obviously female version of him \u2014 a gorgeous female version of him, at that. The dress fit him like a second skin, the neckline stopping just north of where his cleavage would be protruding from the corset, his waxed leg looking long and sexy from the dress's long slit in the front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't sure how long they both stood there silently looking at the floor-length mirror, but it was obvious that Lindsey was as thunderstruck by the image as he was. \"I don't know what to say, Ted,\" she finally offered. \"I can't imagine I'd look any better in that outfit, and I'd probably look worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" he said, before attempting to return the compliment. \"That tux really suits you, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah yeah,\" she replied, dismissing the politeness for what it was. \"We both know who everyone in the room is going to be staring at when we arrive. Who knows? Maybe you'll even get lucky on your first night in the UK!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed was too taken by the beautiful women he now resembled to even register Lindsey's joke. Or was it a joke?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>What happens at the party?<br>\r\n</b></span></div></div>",

Ted bound Lindsey's breasts with an ace bandage, while she in turn helped tie back his genitals with a gaff she had purchased during his waxing session the day before. Neither found this comfortable, but the devices did their job, giving her a flat chest and him a flat crotch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed was wearing a pair of red lace panties and matching stockings, while Christina was clad only in the bandage and a pair of white boxer briefs, which she was busy stuffing with a rolled-up sock, when they were startled to hear Kevin's voice behind them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So sorry to interrupt, folks, but I just realized I didn't tell you --\" he began, before freezing when he got a better look at them. Everyone seemed frozen for what felt like an eternity, before Kevin broke the agonizing silence to murmur, \"My goodness, what have we here?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kevin, I can explain,\" offered Lindsey, who reflexively had crossed her arms over her breasts, even though the bandage was already hiding them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should hope you can,\" he said, still stunned. \"But perhaps you should both put on more clothing first?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsure of what to do, Lindsey slipped on the tuxedo shirt that was lying on the bed next to her, which in turn led Ted to reach for the red sleeveless gown he had planned to wear to the dinner. He stepped into it, but did not bother zipping up, then turned to face Kevin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey took turns telling him the whole embarrassing story: fooling around in Ted's office, foolishly swapping clothes, getting caught by Jessica, and impulsively deciding to impersonate each other as they fell deeper and deeper into this problem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they finished, Kevin tented his hands under his chin, deep in thought, before looking up at them. \"This is very, very bad, you two.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We know, we know,\" said Ted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we're so sorry!\" added a desperate Lindsey. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure you realize quite how bad,\" said Kevin. \"Lindsey misrepresented herself in an important meeting with me and representatives of this company. Then the two of you entered the United Kingdom illegally, using each other's passports. I'd be within my rights to report you to the police, your superiors, or both.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed buried his face in his hands, muttering, \"Ohmigod ohmigod ohmigod.\" Lindsey felt like she was going to throw up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\" Kevin added, giving them hope, \"Do I want to do that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, please please don't!\" begged Lindsey. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It occurs to me that keeping your shameful little secret would put you both very deeply into my debt,\" he said, his face turning into a wicked expression that neither of them liked at all. \"And that could prove very valuable to me. You'd have to abandon this idea of escaping anytime soon, of course, but I'd be willing to look the other way if you are willing to do what I say.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey and Ted gulped. They had no choice in the matter, they realized, and were afraid to learn what Kevin wanted. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We're going to have to bulk you up. I have a fabulous personal trainer who can make more of a man out of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey, who was not especially looking forward to bulking up, just nodded and said, \"Great,\" without much enthusiasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And me?\" asked Ted, anxiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin stroked Ted's new long, flowing locks, then picked up one of his manicured hands. \"I must admit, Lindsey has already done a remarkable job on you, but I think we could stand to give you some more curves, to keep people from noticing, say, the size of these hands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed had many follow-up questions about what exactly Kevin had in mind, but didn't want to say any of them. They finished dressing quietly, went to the firm's dinner, and somehow faked their way through a few dozen introductions, with Kevin helping them each time.

He got up, cursing once again the discomfort of Lindsey's stilettos, and walked over to the door. He placed his ear against it, and could just barely make out the speech that Jessica was delivering to the assembled staff. It was something about the value of flexibility in the modern corporate world, and how important she found it for everyone to be able to do anyone else's job at a moment's notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And,\" Jessica continued, \"two of your colleagues have found a very dramatic and effective way to demonstrate this lesson.\" She raised her voice and called out, \"Ted? Lindsey? It's time for your big reveal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed's heart felt like it wanted to explode out of his chest. \"No way am I going out there now,\" he said half-heartedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey stood up, straightened her cuffs, and put a reassuring hand on his shoulder. \"There's no way out of here except through that door, Ted. I don't think we have much choice in the matter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right,\" he admitted, and braced himself for the reaction that followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey pulled the door open and stepped out wearing his suit, then reached back to pull him out to follow her. They were greeted with a mix of gasps, giggles, and several approving comments from both male and female staffers. Ted tried not to blush, but it was a losing effort. He looked over at Lindsey, who only looked slightly less embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't they just look marvelous?\" Jessica said, clearly reveling in their discomfort. \"I was speaking with them both about this very subject, and it was Ted, I believe, who came up with this incredible idea. They will not only swap jobs for the next month, but clothes as well, as a symbol to the rest of the team about how interchangeable we must all be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was all Ted could do to keep from screaming. She wanted him to dress like this for a MONTH? And to do Lindsey's job that whole time? As bad as things had gotten, this seemed like a bridge too far.

He had built his whole career at this place, and what was he going to say when someone asked him why he abruptly quit? \"I got caught wearing my secretary's clothes?\" No, he realized with some discomfort, he was going to have to swallow his pride and tough it out for a month, and then hopefully life would get back to normal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled through gritted teeth, then told the amused crowd, \"I know we look a bit ridiculous, but it's like Jessica said: we're a symbol of how we all need to be able to walk in each other's shoes if the job calls for it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I don't think you look ridiculous at all,\" called out Katrina Hope, an attractive blonde member of his team. \"Why have you been hiding those legs in pants for all these years?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was more whooping and catcalling, and Ted found himself blushing again. Jessica was clearly enjoying his embarrassment, but she held up her arms to put a stop to the whistles and comments. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now now, this is still an office, and I still expect you to act like professionals,\" she told the group. \"Let's all get back to work. In fact, I believe I have to go to receive some guests for a pitch meeting with Ted... or, I guess, Lindsey now.\" Amid more snickers, the crowd dispersed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed's stomach lurched, as he remembered the reason he and Lindsey had been up all night in his office to begin with. He looked to Lindsey, who had an odd expression on her face \u2014 was she... pleased by this turn of events? \u2014 then to Jessica, who was smugger than ever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fun and games and all of that,\" he said, \"but you're not seriously going to send Lindsey to the pitch wearing my clothes, are you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey crossed her arms across her chest and pouted. \"I've been working on this thing every step of the way with you, Ted.

The clothes swap had been Lindsey's idea initially, and making it a team-building exercise had been Jessica's. And now both were acting like the whole thing had come from him? And he was just supposed to go along? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey checked her watch \u2014 it had been Ted's watch not long ago, he realized with some displeasure \u2014 and said, \"We'd better get to the lobby. They should be here any minute.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But,\" he said, desperately searching for a way out of this. \"How are you expecting the clients to react to... this?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it will make for one of the more memorable pitches they've heard in quite some time, Ted,\" said Jessica. \"Especially when they see how cute you look in that skirt.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey gestured towards the elevators, giggling as she said, \"Come on, Ted.

She had been so enraged by catching Ted \u2014 the kind of cocky alpha male who got all the advantages she had had to struggle her whole career to duplicate \u2014 fooling around with his secretary, and on company property, that the sheer pleasure of being able to publicly humiliate him had overtaken her common sense. But now as they were minutes away from a very important meeting, she worried that she was cutting off her nose to spite her face. Amusing as it was to see Ted try to sashay around in his secretary's skimpy outfit, she didn't want to blow a big opportunity for the company on her first real day on the job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned around and studied them. Ted's cheeks remained flush with embarrassment, but there was an unexpectedly serene and confident expression on Lindsey's face. If she felt thrown at first by the role reversal, she had already grown accustomed to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two have worked very closely on this presentation, yes?\" she asked Lindsey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey cleared her throat, reflexively adjusted her tie, and then said, \"Yes, from the very start to the finish,\" in a tone that inspired Jessica to continue taking this crazy chance on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" she said. \"Then for the moment, I want you to come into the meeting with me by yourself, while Ted waits out in the hall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed opened his mouth as if to protest, then seemed to realize that this would spare him anyone from outside the company seeing him dressed this way, and he closed it and looked down at the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ted,\" Jessica added, waiting for him to reluctantly look up and meet her gaze, \"you may yet have a part to play in this, but for now, I want to see if Lindsey can handle the pitch on her own. If we want you to enter the conference room, one of us will come out to get you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, ma'am,\" he said in a defeated voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were meeting with Kendall Grainger, a beautiful 40-year-old redhead, and her team from a biochemistry company called Pimco. Jessica knew her well, and Kendall beamed as she and Lindsey entered the conference room. The women hugged, but then Kendall stepped back and studied this young woman in a man's suit and tie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jessica, it's so lovely to see you, but who is this?\" she asked. \"And where is Ted?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica took a deep breath, then said, \"This is Lindsey Porter, Kendall, and I hope you'll indulge me for a few minutes. We're trying an experiment here at the company, starting today.\" She quickly explained this crazy role switching concept she had dreamed up (without revealing its true origins), and concluded, \"So we're giving Lindsey here a chance to prove she can pitch as well as Ted.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKendall's face had gone from confused, to concerned, to... delighted? She smiled broadly as she studied Lindsey like she was seeing her for the first time. \"And here I thought you were just really into the menswear look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I'm being totally honest, I really am now,\" Lindsey said. \"I mean, I look like a total boss in this suit, don't I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Literally,\" said Kendall, who delivered a big, throaty laugh \u2014 a laugh that told Jessica she had nothing to worry about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, she needn't have worried at all. Lindsey strutted her way through the presentation like she had been doing Ted's job, and wearing his clothes, for years. As a finishing touch, Jessica had Ted himself come in to distribute the hard copies of the presentation for Kendall and her team to refer to later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My god, Ted,\" Kendall said, enjoying the hell out of the sight before her. \"I had no idea how good you would look in a skirt and heels.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed grimaced again, but Jessica's mental gears were turning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>What happens next? </b></span></div></div>",

She turned to look at Ted, who had been noticeably quiet since they left the meeting with Kendall. \"And what's the matter with you, beautiful?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am never going to live this down,\" Ted muttered. \"It was bad enough when the staff saw me like this, but now Kendall and her team have.

Or, at least, less alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed looked up and wiped a stray tear from his eye. \"What idea?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Lindsey was such an instant success trading places with you that I think I'm ready to expand the program,\" she explained. \"Soon, we'll have an entire floor of managers and secretaries doing each other's jobs \u2014 and wearing each other's clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey jumped up and down and clapped her hands with glee. \"Yes! I can't wait!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey stepped off the elevator to find a buzz of activity. Jessica looked around, searching for her next pair to swap. In one corner, she saw Rick Daniels, pushing 40 but tall, athletic, handsome, and, by all accounts, incredibly cocky. He was talking with his secretary Kelly Minter, an equally tall 30-year-old blonde bombshell whose beauty had been known to drive coworkers to distraction. Rick was telling her a joke \u2014 one that Jessica was sure wasn't nearly funny enough to generate the huge laughter with which Kelly was greeting it. Rick was wearing a smart grey double-breasted suit and wingtips, while Kelly was in a sleeveless red shell dress that just barely qualified as work appropriate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn another corner was another of the firm's boy wonders: Billy Cooper, a slim 24-year-old wunderkind who didn't look old enough to shave, yet had already been placed in a position of power over Gail Williams, a stunning woman in her 30s with long jet black hair whose resume suggested was being wasted as anyone's assistant. Billy had on a slim-cut electric blue suit with matching tie, white shirt, and brown oxfords, while Gail wore a pink sweater set with a matching skirt that ended above the knee, and black peep-toe shoes with a 4-inch heel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica liked the idea of putting Billy in his place and giving Gail a promotion she had long deserved. On the other hand, the thought of Kelly having to hide her curves underneath Rick's baggy suits, while Rick had to squeeze himself into her sexy outfits, amused her even more than Ted's current misery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Who did she choose to swap?</b></span></div></div>",

Interesting idea you cooked up with Ted and Lindsey.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly giggled, and the sound made Jessica cringe inwardly. \u201cYeah,\u201d Kelly said, \u201cI can\u2019t believe they agreed to swap clothes like that.

Go into your office, put on each other\u2019s clothes, and the we\u2019ll talk about your new responsibilities.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow both looked dismayed.

Ted may be into that, but I\u2019m not.\u201d He crossed his arms and glared  at Jessica, convinced he had won the argument.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou swap clothes with each other or you\u2019re both fired,\u201d Jessica said quietly but firmly. \u201cThis initiative is very important to me and to the company, and I won\u2019t have my one disrupting it on the first day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow both looked scared. \u201cI need this job, ma\u2019am,\u201d Kelly pleaded. \u201cSo do I,\u201d Rick whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood!\u201d Jessica said, triumphant. She gestured to Rick\u2019s office. \u201cThen go on in there, take off all your clothes, and start finding out how the other half lives.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEven our underwear?\u201d asked Kelly. She looked on the verge of tears at the thought of swapping her bra and panties for boxers and an undershirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEvery last scrap,\u201d Jessica said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll be doing underwear checks every day going forward, so don\u2019t think about trying to slip something lacy on under one of those body suits.\u201d She again pointed at Rick\u2019s office, and the two shuffled off, shocked by the turn their day had taken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica rubbed  her hands with delight. \u201cWho can I swap next?\u201d </span></div></div>",

This was because the both of them had long silky blonde hair and slender figures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuliette always found it hilarious that people thought Ted was her tomboyish twin sister, while Ted hated it and always got annoyed when people even thought of making the comparison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually though, one day Juliette got curious and wondered how much did the two of them look alike. \u201cSay Ted you wanna make a bet?\u201d She asked with a smug grin as a plan formed in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh sure what is it?\u201d Asked Tim worrying knowing Juliette had some sick plan in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk Rock Paper Scissors, if I win we have to swap clothes, if I lose I\u2019ll be your slave for the day ok?\u201d Explained Juliette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTed nodded his head and the two of them began their tense game of Rock Paper Scissors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Juliette used Rock to crush Teds puny scissors. Juliette snickered as Tim blushed in horror as Juliette forced him to take of his blue shirt, shorts and sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd instead put on Juliettes Pink spring dress and flat heels. Juliette meanwhile enjoyed the swap and laughed when she saw Ted in her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god, you look just like me! Awe it\u2019s so cute\u201d. Mocked Juliette while Teds face went red with a mix of anger and embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up Juliette.\u201d Replied Ted annoyed about losing the bet. However Juliette just snickered in his face and explained that for the rest of swap she would be Ted and Ted would be her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuliette then forced Ted to pose for a quick photo, with her. With Ted being annoyed as he knew deep down that if he didn\u2019t swap clothes with her and just saw the photo he would think Juliette was him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo loser ready for the next part of losing the bet\u201d. Joked Juliette wanting to get a rise from her friend. As Tim just grunted in response to her question hoping to just get the stupid day as Juliette over and done with.

She was an absolute stunner: a tall blonde with sharp features, piercing blue eyes, and legs that seemed to go on for days between her tight red minidress and her matching stiletto heels.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was also, for reasons he didn't quite understand, really boring to him now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she could clearly tell. They had been making out for several minutes while seated on the edge of the huge king bed, Cassidy's hands flying all over Ted's body as they kissed. Basic stuff, but it usually did the job to get her clients started, and once upon a time had with Ted. Today, though, he was just going through the motions, and there was no movement whatsoever between his legs, even after she put her hand down his pants and tried to give him a jump start. He pulled away from her, embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tough day at the office?\" she asked, trying to sound supportive. He'd already paid for this session, but if she wasn't doing it for him anymore, she doubted there would be future ones, and this guy paid well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little,\" he admitted, \"but that's not it. I don't know what's wrong. You're the sexiest goddamn woman I've ever been with. We're doing all the things I usually like. And... nothing.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then maybe we should try something different from what you usually like,\" she suggested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe suggested various specialties, like erotic food play, or some light S&amp;M, but he didn't seem interested. As she tried to think of a solution, she noticed him loosening the knot on his silk royal blue necktie, which matched his impeccably tailored suit, and a lightbulb went off above her head. She reached over and loosened the tie some more, pulled it over his head, and pulled it over hers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about a little role reversal?\" she asked, a grin on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" he asked nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean,\" she said, kicking off her heels and unbuttoning his expensive shirt, \"that I put on this exquisite suit of yours, and you put on my dress, and we pretend to be each other for a bit, just to see how it feels.\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His heart jumped. He wasn't ready for anyone to see him looking like this. He tiptoed up to the peephole and felt a wave of relief flood through him when he saw Cassidy standing there, still wearing his clothes, looking extremely smug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cassidy, are you there?\" she asked in a loud whisper. <i>Cassidy? Why was she calling him Cassidy?</i> He yanked the door open, she walked in and planted a long, wet kiss on his lips. He would have felt incredibly turned on if he wasn't still half panicked about those five minutes when he thought she had run off with his clothes, his money, and his dignity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer lips released from his, and she stroked his face. \"Goddamn, Cassidy, you are the sexiest woman I have ever seen,\" she said. She strutted over to the edge of the bed, sat down, spread her legs, and said, \"Do one of your sexy dances for me, would you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh, I get it,</i> Ted thought. <i>She's role playing as me, and I'm supposed to act like her. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassidy took Ted's phone out of her pocket, turned on some sultry R&amp;B music, and gestured to the spot in front of her.

Or I'm gone and you can figure out how to get home dressed like you are right now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe clicked the disconnect button and returned to her drink. Part of her was very much hoping Ted would come down \u2014 not only so she could repair their relationship and make sure she had future gigs with him, but because she was getting surprisingly turned on by the whole role reversal. But part of her was also eager to just pick up his car and roar off into the night, consequences be damned.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

How come?\" Lindsey asked.<br>\r\n\"Well, I have no real lover but even when I have to occasional interaction, it just starts to get stale.\" Tim complained.<br>\r\n\"Have you tried role play?\" Lindsey asked.<br>\r\n\"I have but nothing really exciting has come up, it's just a bit too standard in most cases.<br>\r\n\"It all depends on how you handle it.\" Lindsey giggled.<br>\r\n\"That's true,\" Tim replied with a snicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much work do you have left anyway?\" Lindsey asked.<br>\r\n\"Just some paperwork for the most part, as boring as ever.\" Tim replied. \"You?\"<br>\r\n\"Paperwork as well, I usually kind of enjoy it, but it's been kind of repetitive lately.\" Lindsey sighs.<br>\r\n\"We should probably get back to it.\" Tim said bored as he got up.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but before we head back up, I think I know a way we can make it more interesting.\" Lindsey said.<br>\r\n\"Do tell.\" Tim asked, curious what she had to say.<br>\r\n\"What if we do some role play?\" Lindsey suggested.<br>\r\n\"How do you mean exactly?\" Tim asked.<br>\r\n\"Since there is no one around anyway, maybe we could try out a small little role swap?\" Lindsey suggested with a smile.<br>\r\n\"So we switch work places?\" Tim asked, not knowing exactly what she meant.<br>\r\n\"Work, clothes... names.\" Lindsey grinned.<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure about this.\" Tim said hesitantly.<br>\r\n\"No one is around and it would at least be a bit more exciting!\" Lindsey said excited.<br>\r\n\"Okay, in the elevator.\" Was all Tim said as they made their way over to the elevator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim was currently wearing his usual black business suit with his smart shoes, it looked clean and was his favorite. Lindsey was wearing a black dress with some heels and looked as professional as she could without wearing a skirt suit.<br>\r\nTim and Lindsey entered the elevator and as soon as the door closed, they started to undress. Tim took off his jacket and shirt first, then stripped off his shoes and pants and lastly dropped his boxers, moving as quickly as he could. Lindsey was very fast with taking off her dress and heels and unhooked her bra, then dropped her panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim then moved over to his secretary's pile of clothes and stepping into the black panties. They had a small red lace on the edges and were very tight on his crotch. He then hooked the bra on his chest, which he did fairly easily and lastly pulled the black dress over top his head and stepped into the heels. Lindsey in the meantime had gotten dressed in her boss's boxers, comfortable suit pants, shirt and jacket as well as his smart shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they just finished getting dressed, the elevator arrived at Tim\u2019s office<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next</span></div></div>",

Tim, on the other hand, was instantly struggling to get around in Lindsey's outfit. The little black dress was so tight that his legs could barely move, and the high heeled shoes made him feel like he was trying to stay balanced on a tightrope 100 feet above the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you walk in this stuff?\" he groaned as he struggled to follow her into his office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe swaggered around to his desk, plopped down in his chair, and boldly put her feet up, her hands folded smugly behind her head. She gave Tim a pitying look, and said, \"Awww, the sacrifices we make for beauty.\" She appraised him up and down, then added, \"But in your case, cutie, it's surely worth the pain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim eased himself down onto the sofa where Lindsey usually sat when she worked away from her own desk. It felt good to not be standing, though the heels still pinched his feet something awful. \"I think you got the better end of this deal,\" he grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey straightened her black necktie and fingered the lapel of her suit jacket. \"I could pretend to find something to complain about,\" she admitted, \"but I think you're right. I don't know that I'm ever going to trade back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't joke like that!\" Tim snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey pulled her feet off the desk, stood up, wandered over to sit next to Tim, and gently stroked his cheek. \"Who said I was joking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah yeah,\" Tim said. \"Now what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe checked the sleek Rolex on her wrist, then announced, \"Well, we do have to finish up each other's work, but there's something important I have to do first. Give me your purse, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim handed over the purse he still had on his shoulder, annoyed that she had referred to it as his, and watched as she fished through it until she produced a tube of lipstick, an eyeliner pencil, and a bottle of nail polish. Seeing where this was going, he raised his hands in protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no no,\" he insisted. \"I'll wear your clothes for a bit, but makeup is where I draw the line.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I want you to look like your prettiest self,\" she said with a pout. \"And I think you'll feel happier in these clothes too if you can see how you look after I do my magic. Please?\" She batted the lashes above her big blue eyes, and he was putty in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, fine,\" he grumbled. She clapped her hands with delight, then spent the next ten minutes carefully applying color (mostly red) to his lips, his cheeks, his eyes, and his finger and toenails. The latter at least allowed him to take off the cursed shoes, but now he had to wait even longer just to get back to work. Lindsey leaned back to take in the full look, pleased with her work. She fished a compact out of the purse, flipped open the mirror, and shocked Tim with his reflection. He certainly didn't look like a woman, but he did look...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gorgeous,\" he said, almost in a daze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bet your sweet ass you are,\" Lindsey said, before getting up and going back to Tim's desk. She began going through the paperwork, warning him that he would have to do the same the second his nails were dry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin 15 minutes, he felt comfortable using his hands again, and he was pleasantly surprised to find that Lindsey had been right. Even though he was just doing more paperwork, the swap of role \u2014 and clothing \u2014 spiced it up enough that it was almost fun to complete. He blazed through it in record time. He was so focused on the task that, when he looked up again, he was shocked to realize that Lindsey had gone... taking his clothes, his phone, his wallet, and his car keys with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where the hell did she go?\" he asked, starting to panic. </span></div></div>",

She was having the time of her life, driving way above the speed limit with the top down on Ted's Maybach convertible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, she had stepped out of the office to use the bathroom. Since they were alone after hours, and since she was dressed for it, she decided to check out the men's room, and was disappointed it was so spartan, and without the profane graffiti she assumed was written on the stalls of every men's room in creation. But when she walked back towards Ted's office, she saw he was still so absorbed in his work (or, her work) that he hadn't even noticed her absence. And then a wicked thought occurred to her: <i>I have Ted's car and apartment keys.</i> Since they were playing around as each other anyway, she thought she would just pop over, take a few selfies on his couch, and then come back to the office. But now she was having so much time putting Ted's car through it's paces, she wasn't sure she ever wanted to return it, or any of the other spoils of this swap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled up to Ted's luxury apartment building and used his security badge and keys to let herself in. She had been there a few times before, but always when she was there to have sex with Ted. This was her first time to really appreciate the size and beauty of the place, especially compared to her own shabby apartment. She took her planned selfie on his brown leather couch, blasted some K-pop through his Bose speakers, then headed to the bedroom to go through his walk-in closet. She would have said that a huge closet like this was wasted on any man, but Ted's wardrobe of fancy suits, blazers, shirts, slacks, and other business and formal attire was so big and impressive, she couldn't imagine it being kept anywhere else. She paused to admire herself in the three-way mirror. She knew she looked good in Ted's navy pinstripe three-piece, but she hadn't realized just how good. She adopted various masculine and feminine poses, took more pictures, then began exploring the other options in the closet. As she held one jacket or another up in front of her, she began thinking about how much she would enjoy getting to eventually wear all of this stuff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought about swapping her current suit for another \u2014 there was a charcoal wool one that she thought would really bring out the blue in her eyes \u2014 when she heard a loud knock at the front door.

There were two costumes that belonged to the mom, they were too large, a pair of men\u2019s swim shorts and two of Katy\u2019s costumes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne was a black all in one and the other was a really babyish pink one with frilly parts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can wear my pink one\u201d Katy said \u201c I was going to wear the black one\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElaine wasn\u2019t happy but she pulled off her clothes and put on the pink costume, as she stood next to Katy she now looked like the younger of the two of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both got in the pool and started swimming, after half an hour Katy got out \u201cI am going to do some homework\u201d Katy said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, i am going to go in the hot tub and sauna for a bit\u201d Elaine replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaty then walked into the changing rooms. After another 30 min, Elaine got out of the sauna and walked into the changing room, she stopped dead. Instead of her jeans and fitted vest top Katy\u2019s school uniform was hanging there nothing else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a shower she didn\u2019t know what to do. She looked at the pile of clothes, the little cow had taken her underwear and bra as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanted to storm upstairs but she decided to play along. Dressing in Katy\u2019s plain underwear and school uniform ( white shirt, grey skirt, long white socks and ballet flat shoes) brushing her hair she walked upstairs and found Katy in the tv room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice outfit\u201d Elaine said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell i thought as you borrowed my costume you would return the favour\u201d katy grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat I am not sure\u201d Elaine said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about we have a little bet\u201d Katy said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo on\u201d Elaine replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell the pizza guy will be here in 10 minutes, why dont we see if he can work out who is the oldest\u201d Katy grinned<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that\u2019s not fair, I am wearing your school uniform, i clearly look younger\u201d Elaine complained<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you can wear anything from my room\u201d KAty said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay you are on\u201d Elaine replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElaine hurried up to Katy\u2019s room, this would be easy she thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking through Katy\u2019s wardrobe her heart sank, everything looked like it belonged to a younger girl, no heels at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoosing some skinny jeans with colourful stitching, pair of uggs boots and a flowery shirt style top with a collar. Walking back downstairs she was in for a shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaty had helped herself to her makeup, she now was fully made up for a night out. With her heeled loafers on and leather jacket she looked even older than Elaine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the door bell rings...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Besides you like babysitting your sisters, you always have such fun with them.\u201d She pointed out making Jason as although he did love hanging out with his little sisters Jackie and Jessie, he didn\u2019t want anyone outside of the house knowing about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut Mooooom, Steve and the guys are apparently flinging the biggest party tonight, can\u2019t you please just leave the vacation for tomorrow.\u201d Pleaded Jason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever before he could even be told of by his mom, his father slammed his foot on the pedal and flew down the street leaving the annoyed Jason with the responsibility of looking after his little sisters, who he would be happy to see any other day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason then walked back onto his house as he saw his 8 year old sister Jackie holding Jessie\u2019s small hand in the hallway looking sad and almost crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re sorry big bro that you can\u2019t go to your party because of us.\u201d Apologised Jackie as Jessie held back tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason then felt awe full as he realised that his sister thought they were the reason he couldn\u2019t go to his party, and even though they were Jason didn\u2019t want them thinking it was because he hated them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no no no Jackie, Jessie it\u2019s not your guys faults that I\u2019m here, it\u2019s because grumpy mummy and daddy didn\u2019t allow me to go but tell you what, how about we through a party of our own huh? Like the one in Cinderella!\u201d Said Jason happy as he watched his little sisters eyes gleam in joy and excitement, with both little girls running up the stairs too get dressed in their favourite dresses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith both of them screaming \u201cthanks big bro\u201d as they got to their rooms to get dressed. Jason then went to kitchen to get a can of coke and make some PBJ for his little sisters. And as he drank his can of coke and went on his phone thinking of a lie to tell his friends as to not come over to his to pick him up for another wild night out, Jessie was busy pretending she was a Disney princess  putting on her favourite yellow sundress and signing gleefully and as Jessie finished zipping up her dress all on her own, which she was excited to tell Jackie and Jason about, she suddenly tripped over on a weird button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was then alerted that something was wrong as he heard his youngest sister begin to wail as loud as the wind howled. Jason then ran up the stairs in a heartbeat to find his little sister crying and holding her foot. \u201cOh no Jessie what happened did you trip over something.\u201d Asked Jason worried for his sisters wellbeing, while subconsciously hoping no one saw him like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessie then nodded her head and Jason hugged her. \u201cI twipped on the button.\u201d She said pointing to it in fear to which Jason picked it up confused. Why was there a big button device lying about his sisters floor<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever Jason decided to ignore the obvious questions, and instead calm his sister down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Sis did this mean old button hurt you, I bet it would really hate it if you pressed it and showed it who\u2019s boss huh?\u201d He joked as he smacked the button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessie laughed at her brothers joke and loudly said \u201cyeah take this you mean poopy button.\u201d Smacking the button, when all of a sudden a massive cloud of smoke appeared that covered the entire room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason and his sister coughed and as the smoke vanished, Jason screamed effeminately at the sight before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis four year old sister, was now no longer wearing her Favourite dress but Jackie\u2019s favourite dress, the white ones with pink flowers on them, and White sandals which bizarrely fitted her perfectly, and more than that her hair now sat long and combed with a massive pink bow in her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when Jason realised something was wrong as Jessie started laughing in joy. Jason was now dressed in a yellow sundress, with his groin being crushed by the new girly diapers  around his waist now, Jason also realised his hair was now in pigtails just like his sisters usually was. And that he was wearing his sisters favourites sandals<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou look like a giant version of  Me Big bro\u201d. Laughed Jessie as Jason blushed shocked that his sister was laughing at him. Jason decided to try and grab the button and press the button to swap them back. The smoke then appeared again only with Jackie now standing in the door way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoah bro, sis did you see what happened I was dressed as Jason, I had that tee shirt from the band metal lick a\u201d. Poorly explained Jackie as Jason knew she meant Metallica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessie meanwhile was still laughing. \u201cBig bwo looked like me.\u201d Shouted Jessie making Jason blush as Jackie burst out laughing, mockingly singing \u201cyou looked like a girl, you looked like a girl.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessie then had an idea form in her head about how to have some fun. \u201cHey I had a idea, what if we swapped again and pwetended to be each other that way I get to be the big sis.\u201d Explained an excited Jessie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie then became excited as well. \u201cYeah yeah I wanna swap again too that way I get to be the cool babysitter again.\u201d Jackie added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason then blushed as he realised what that would mean for him. \u201cThat means I\u2019d have to act and look like the baby sister though.\u201d He said in horror looking at his adorable little sister glee with excitement at the idea. Does he go along with it?</span></div></div>",

She actually doesn\u2019t hate everybody she meets. Except for Michelle and her bitchey cheerleader friends, they always were rude to her and openly mocked her. But Rachel hated Michelle the bimbo with dreams of becoming a fashion designer the most as she had made the school get rid of their gothic occult club, which she was an avid member. Now what was in its place was a stupid photography club which she was forced to attend to ensure she had a more respectable extra curricular activity on her application for Yale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle Williams: (age 18) is a busty blonde cheerleader who is the most popular girl in school, who  has big dreams of becoming one of the worlds most famous fashion designer.

However theirs just one problem in her dream for perfection. Rachel, a icky goth girl who rivalled Michelle in class for best grades and being in every curricular club, which she bested Michelle in for a while with the Goth occult club, however thanks to her influence with the students, and a buttload of daddy\u2019s money, the club has been scrapped for a replacement photography club which made Michelle happy as she thought about how this would help her learn how to command models to pose for her photos, she has been enjoying the club for a month now as she gets to learn how to command photoshoots at school and at home with her 16 year old sister Daisy, who looked almost identical to her and loved modelling. Michelle loved her sister and her cute dreams of being a model for Michelle. However Michelle always wished she could make Rachel her model and force that gross goth to learn her place, he\u2019ll if she could use a magical device to make Rachel like her sister she could force her to become her model and secure her chances at going to Yale at the same time, however such a thing was unlikely to happen unless Rachel joined the photography club, Right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo are you interested?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was the head of the club and loved it dearly and had such fun making friends with its members who all showed interest in it, and enjoyed exploring the schools own haunted history and disturbing events, especially about the ones that involved the apparent magical artefacts that the native Americans created, which were said to be reality altering and grand in power, the chief of the tribe said they were weapons of good when in right hands and weapons of evil in left hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel never got what that meant and always found that part of the story confusing, but maybe that was because she was right handed and not left handed. But that bitch Michelle, the aforementioned Bimbo was and Rachel had no doubt she was evil, as Michelle had used her dads money and influence as the most popular girl in school, to get the \u2018creepy and satanic\u2019 club replaced with a photography club, which would oddly benefit her and her little bimbo sister, who exclusively wore slutty pink dresses and heels with both dreaming of entering the fashion industry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd at this point Rachel though to herself \u2018why do I even want to go this stupid club?\u2019 But Rachel already knew the answer to that, because she needed the extra curricular activity to apply to Yale, which Michelle also needed too as both girls were fighting for the last application to Yale from Shakey Bones High School, with Rachel finding it annoying how the world force her to do something Michelle wanted rather than vice versa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel then sighed as she entered the class. She wanted to scream when she saw the black walls covered in horror movie posters, was replaced with baby pink walls covered in photos of Models, and nature. Their was no one in the class except for the teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh hello Rachel, the principal said you\u2019d be joining us today are you excited to ditch all that creepy ghoul stuff and learn about how to take photos?\u201d Asked Mr Prance, a skinny 40 year old man with a receding hairline who everyone knew was a spineless teacher who would bend to the whim of any student with authority.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel sighed as she sarcastically replied \u201csure I look forward to taking photos of brainless models, and trees that have two orange leaves on them.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr Prance then went quiet as Rachel went to put her stuff in the class locker. She opened what she thought was her locker only to find out that it belonged to the head cheerleader. upon opening the locked she saw something that almost made her puke, inside the locker was a hot pink bra, pink and white stripped panties, the blue top and white skirt that the cheer squad wears and of course her signature yellow ribbon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel blushes as she suddenly heard a voice behind her smugly say. \u201cHey fashion reject I know you wish you could dress as good as me but don\u2019t even think about stealing my clothes!\u201d She mocked making the gaggle of cheerleaders behind her giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel sighed as she turned around to see her tormentor and annoying rival Michelle, wearing her regular clothes which consisted of a with boules a pink double breasted blazer and pink business pants. Michelle always took pride in her appearance as she loved looking like the professional she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel states dagger at Michelle as she mocked her saying \u201coh hello Michelle I see you\u2019re in the club you bought with daddy\u2019s whore money, I\u2019m surprised you\u2019re not grounded.\u201d Which made the cheerleaders gasp in shock as Michelle growled in anger for a short second before containing herself as she smugly smiled at Rachel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh ignore her girls, she\u2019s just still pouty about losing her nerdy ghost club.\u201d Mocked Michelle as the cheerleaders behind her giggled, even if some didn\u2019t find the joke funny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel then crowned as the girls walked past her laughing with Rachel finding her locker and putting her things in it, she also was surprised to suddenly see the empty class that looked like a ghost town, now packed with Cheerleaders and her rival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel then sat down in the only seat that was available, the one next to Michelle. Mr Prance then explained that the class would split into partners and take photos of whatever they want. To which Mr prance decided that it would be a good idea to put Rachel with none other that\u2019s the blonde lefty from hell, Michelle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle felt an evil grin appear on her face as everything was going to her plan, while Rachel was confused as she realised that Michelle\u2019s dumb blonde sister Daisy who loved skimpy pink dresses wasn\u2019t in. \u201cHey Michelle where\u2019s daisy?\u201d She asked in curiosity to which Michelle shrugged and responded with \u201cUm duh Gothy she\u2019s unwell, she\u2019s taking a <b>sick</b> day\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel felt uncomfortable about this but decided that it was better to get the stupid photo shoot over with rather than talk to the bitch that stole her club away from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle then led Rachel into a room meant for photoshoots,  and snickered as she locked the door behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Michelle what are we doing in here, I thought we had to take a photo of something in the room.\u201d Questioned a concerned Rachel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell Gothy me and mr Prance had a chat, and he agreed to you posing for a few photos of me as it will help me with my career aspirations.\u201d Smugly explained Michelle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel then felt herself grow furious. \u201cWhat that\u2019s outrageous! What if I say no?\u201d Demanded Rachel as Michelle only laughed in her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then say goodbye to this club and say goodbye to Yale dummy, now hurry up and pose for the photo.\u201d Commanded Michelle impatiently as Rachel sighed and stood still as though she was posing for her school photo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle then snickered as she pulled out a mysterious hot pink glittery camera with an odd aura and took the picture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*SNAP*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe camera went with a bright flash of light, with Rachel blushing as she saw that she was no longer standing normally, but posing like a model on a runway with a phone in her hand as though she were taking a selfie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-what the\u201d said a dumbfounded and scared Rachel as Michelle laughed maniacally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOMG Rachel I never knew you were so good at posing and by the way sweetie nice phone.\u201d Insulted Michelle in delight as Rachel looked at the phone in her hand and realised it was her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly the phone was different as it was no longer her black phone case with a skull on it but rather a hot pink phone case with a tiny pink bow on it, even the phone screen of a zombie eating a man alive, had been changed to a photo of a kitty playing with yarn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell you bimbo, how did you change my phone case and screen?!\u201d Angrily demanded Rachel confused by the prank being played on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat how could I have done it I was taking the photo, and now let\u2019s take the next one Honey, I was thinking you blow a sexy kiss to the camera like a naughty girl.\u201d Smugly commanded Michelle as Rachel flipped her off in anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike hell I\u2019d blow a kiss for a dumb bi-\u201d resisted Rachel only to be interrupted by a loud <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*SNAP* <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd a flash of light as she found herself blowing a kiss right into the camera with Michelle laughing and squealing in glee. \u201cWow Rachel, who would of guessed you could be so naughty you little hottie?\u201d Mocked Michelle as Rachel blushed in confusion thinking about what was going on. \u201cAlso wow your make up is fantastic honey.\u201d Heckled Michelle further as Rachel was left confused until she looked in the reflection of the compartment mirror she was given by Michelle and screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh dear god my face I look like a bimbo!\u201d Screamed Rachel as her face was now covered in makeup, with her cheeks having blush on them, eyeliner over her eyes and worst of all, Hot pink lip gloss on her lips and a pair of Pink hoop earrings to replace her skull earrings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did you do to me you bimbo!\u201d  Demanded a terrified Rachel, who grew more scared as Michelle simply laughed at the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSimple honey, you see when I decided to check your club before it was destroyed, I found a small dreamcatcher hidden in a box, I grabbed it and when I did it turned into a beautiful hot pink camera, and I knew instantly what it could do, it was an ancient device made by the native Americans to give them whatever it wants, and I\u2019ve decided to make it mine and use it to swap you and my sister around, because if I make you into my little Bimbo model, I\u2019ll have the Yale spot without any competition, of course my sister didn\u2019t care just as long as I made her a mode once I was famous. And that\u2019s enough info for now back to the shoot Gothy.\u201d Monologued Michelle as Rachel looked on in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou crazy bitch, you\u2019ll never get away with this!\u201d Rachel screamed as she ran for the door only for Michelle to laugh and coldly say \u201coh no you don\u2019t sweetie\u201d as she took her third picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*SNAP*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Rachel found herself posing provocatively in front of the camera again with her back to the camera as if she was showing of her shoes, Rachel then looked down and shrieked in horror. \u201cAh! My boots!\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel\u2019s leather skull studded boots had now been replaced with glittery phot pink high heels that sparkled. Rachel knee this was bad as she couldn\u2019t run or walk in heels leaving her trapped at the mercy of Michelle who was laughing at Rachel\u2019s situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat pose Gothy, way to show of those Killer heels of yours, and remember you can\u2019t get away from me or this camera, now what to change about you next?\u201d Thought Michelle as she stared at Rachel.

Understand Loser?\u201d Explained Michelle as Rachel realised how bad of a situation she was trapped in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle snickered when she saw the defeated look on Rachel\u2019s face and reentered the class room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel then followed suite as she saw that class was ending and it was time to go home, Rachel then looked around and saw that no one was paying any attention o her just like usual, Michelle\u2019s cheerleader friends where giggling to themselves, and the teacher was writing notes on the computer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n which made Rachel shiver as she realised that Michelle wasn\u2019t lying and that she had to somehow steal the camera and make herself look normal again without being caught, or else be doomed to a fate of posing for Michelle as her Model and personal toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel then clumsily shuffled her way to her locker to grab her zombie bagpack only for her to hear Michelle giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I\u2019m sorry Gothy I forgot, about you\u2019re ugly school bag allow me to fix that for you.\u201d Said Michelle. As Rachel prepared for the worst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*SNAP*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Rachel opened her eyes she wanted to scream as she was suddenly posing with a hot pink handbag that was once her zombie bagpack. Rachel also saw that her schoolbooks, pencil case and Notes, had been replaced with fashion magazines a Makeup kit and a Girly diary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere we go Gothy now you look just like a pretty little bimbo.\u201d Mocked Michelle laughing as Rachel growled in embarrassment as Michelle left the class with her friends following shortly after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel then followed suite and began to struggle to walk outside , wishing that her stupid girly mother would have the decency to teach her how to walk in heels. But eventually Rachel got outside and debated what to do next? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could go home and try to change her clothes wit the ones in her wardrobe but then if Michelle finds out or follows her home, then she will just make her look like a bimbo again and change her wardrobe with Daisy\u2019s  or worse change her cool gothic room with Daisy\u2019s pink fashionista one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr she could go to the mall and buy her gothic clothes again and get her dyed back to normal, but if Michelle catches her their then she could force her look like daisy again but also go on a shopping spree for clothes which Daisy was infamous for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Rachel decided that it would be best to.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Leaving Rachel to assume that she was just paranoid after the insane day she had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever little did Rachel now how right she was to be paranoid, as standing only a few feet away from her was Michelle holding the evil all powerful hot pink camera in her hands with a smug grin on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Oh what\u2019s the matter Gothy are you scared you\u2019re being followed by you\u2019re all powerful rival. Well you should be. I bet you thought I shared all the secrets of the camera with you didn\u2019t I?, well guess what honey I didn\u2019t because this camera not only allows me to make the changes I do to you unnoticeable to people, but also make you unable to notice me.\u2019 Thought Michelle excited to our phase 2 of embarrassing her rival into action as she followed Rachel back to the middle class suburban house she lives in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel then used her key to open the door to which she was instantly bombarded with love from her girly mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh hi there Rachey, did you have a fun time at photo club sweetheart!\u201d Rachel\u2019s mother pestered which made Rachel blush in embarrassment hoping that no one saw that, while Michelle almost fell to the floor laughing at Rachel\u2019s embarrassing nickname.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh yes mom it was fine, now don\u2019t bother me I got too go upstairs and change.\u201d Rachel bluntly stated as she bolted up the stairs to her bedroom, with Michelle sneakily following behind her. Excited to destroy Rachel\u2019s plan to escape her nightmare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel then entered her room. It was dimly lit and was messy covered in notes from school, Drawings of spooky monsters and figurines of deformed zombies an iron maiden characters. Her walls were also coveredin old horror movie posters and a glow in the dark fake blood for a gothic effect. Rachel smoked when she saw the creepy room she loved to call home, while the invisible Michelle wanted to barf at the disgusting site of the room thinking to herself  \u2018I can\u2019t believe my rival works in such a pig sty, but once I get my pictures I\u2019ll sort this mess out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel then walked over to her wardrobe which was filled with black metal hoodies, messy piles of black shirts with horror references on them, sweatpants and a pile of ripped skinny jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel then ruffled her hair to make it look messier as she took of the embarrassing skimpy pink dress that Michelle\u2019s ditzy sister Daisy loved and her high heels too as she stripped down to her new embarrassing bra and panties, as she put on a pair of black sweatpants, her favourite black  sneakers and a black t shirt with the master of puppets Metallica album on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel then laughed in delight unaware of the hell that was about to await her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes take that Michelle you dumb bimbo, no matter how many of your sisters dresses  you\u2019ll  make me as long as I have my room and my wardrobe I\u2019ll still be going to Yale.\u201d She shouted in ironic triumph  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle then smugly smiled as she said \u201cwell then let\u2019s sort your disgusting problems out then Gothy.\u201d As She used the camera to change...</span></div></div>",
