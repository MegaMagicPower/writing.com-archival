            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tired beyond belief, Isaac (Our 18 year old protagonist) swung his dorm room door open and flipped the light switch. His room, while perhaps a bit untidy, was a comforting sight. After having sat through a rather difficult test, he was glad to be back in his dorm for a well deserved rest. Everything seemed just about right- his pants were on the floor where he left them (He really had to do a better job of cleaning his room) and his computer was still switched on, although it was now idle. Sighing, he shut the door behind him and picked his pants up off the floor, then lazily lobbed them into his collapsible hamper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to his bed (Which was of course, not made) he saw a sheet of paper he didn't recall leaving there. Unassuming as it was, he couldn't help but feel intrigued by this lone page, and so he picked it up, noticing almost immediately that this wasn't his paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe handwriting wasn't his, much nicer and more fluid, undoubtedly that of a female. On this paper was a short message, and oddly enough it was addressed to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear Isaac, I don't have the time to explain what will happen next, though I'm sure you'll find a way to make use of the inheritance I've left you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInheritance? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe paper wasn't even signed, and the message was of the vaguest variety. A bit puzzled but still tired from his test, Isaac crumbled the paper and tossed it into the garbage bin next to his desk. It was nearly overflowing with other crumbled papers, and nearly tumbled off the pile and onto the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing the strange message to the back of his mind, Isaac changed into his sleepwear and brushed his teeth hastily, craving the sweet comfort of his mattress. Not even bothering to switch off the computer that still hummed silently, Isaac slipped into bed and was asleep within minutes, unaware of the changes to come.</span></div></div>",

Sipping some hot chocolate, he looked around. It was raining outside, or at least he felt it must have been- something told him it was. The coffee shop was empty, except for a bear that was seated at a table near the door. As menacing as bears were, this one seemed completely absorbed in his work, namely the operation of an abacus and the recording of some data in his notebook. The bear spoke Russian to himself, but managed his order in nearly perfect English when the waitress asked him what he wanted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Isaac a few seconds to realize how ridiculous this all was. Of course, he was dreaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rather uneventful,\" Isaac mused quietly as he looked about, \"Not much of a dream here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning back to his hot chocolate, Isaac was pleasantly surprised to see that there was now someone sitting across from him at his table. A mysterious character by all accounts, the figure was cloaked and had made no noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And who might you be?\" asked Isaac, studying the character.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't matter,\" responded the cloaked person, \"What matters is that you take the inheritance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Inheritance?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac struggled to recall the message left on his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure nodded and stretched out a feminine hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take it,\" it said simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take what?\" Isaac asked, hoping he would awaken soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRefusing to respond, the character gripped Isaac's hand. His body was overrun with a chilling sensation, and he was frozen in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is done,\" said the character, though Isaac was still inanimate, \"I've given you-\"</span></div></div>",

Let alone that they were capble of abilities that Isaac up to this point thought only existed in fantasy.  But before he could ask anymore questions, he woke up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe daylight waa bright despite the lack of any sunshine.  In fact the whole sky was covered in clouds.  Issac had more questions then answers, but that would have to wait for it was time for the daily routines.  He got our of bed and was already out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow on his way to his part time job, Isaac would his up a local coffee shop for a cup and muffin.  Everything seemed normal walking in, the usual patrons were there, as was the very cute cashier that Issac kind of had a thing for.  The girl's name was Cassandra,  and she always had a bit of a smile everytime Issac walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Issac, the usual?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, oh yeah\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac blushed a little as Cassandra went off to get his order ready.  While she was gone, Issac got a good look at a patron he had never seen there before.  It was a woman, a pretty young woman, probably in her 20's.  She had dark brown hair and was actually very pretty in the face.  What was so off about her was just how obese she was.  She was easily one of the fattest women Isaac had ever met.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My god she's enormous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac thought to himself.  Indeed the woman was quite the eue opener, with a belly so large it was a mirical if she could reach the table in front of it.  Her ass was so huge that Isaac noticed she was sitting on two seats. Everything else was so bubbly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he staired at her, Issac noticed something that he wasen't quite sure was real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

He didn't have to be up for another two hours, but he felt too shocked by the dream he had just had to go back to sleep. Instead, he turned on the radio for some easy listening- there was always some station playing jazz at this hour, and relaxed in his bed. He was almost drifting back to sleep when the alarm rang, jolting him awake. He didn't feel completely rested, but today didn't seem as if it would be too bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-a full moon tonight, should be quite a beauty-\" mentioned a radio host as Isaac entered the bathroom, not even paying attention to the radio anymore. It served as white noise as he got dressed for class. He didn't even think of the strange dream which had kept him up for a few hours, blissfully unaware--for now, at least-- of how it would affect him.</span></div></div>",

When angry, Isaac would become fatter and more feminine- a sort of Hulk, if you will, but without the powers. (Unless you consider over-eating a power) However, it was more of a sliding scale of change rather than the black and white of the Hulk. Being slightly annoyed might only add a couple of pounds to his frame, or maybe make him a little shorter and more girlish, while being truly angry would cause some BIG changes on his frame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut again, Isaac was completely unaware of this as he made his way to his car. He had to run a few errands in the morning today, but afterwards he was free to do whatever he pleased. That promise of free time was the only thing that kept him going. For now, he was content, if not overly ecstatic- but he would have to get angry sooner of later. The truth of his condition completely unknown to him, Isaac backed out of his driveway and started his day.</span></div></div>",

He needed to pick up some food, as his dorm refrigerator was basically barren at this point, and also had to pick something up his amplifier from a friend who had borrowed it for the weekend. After that, he was off for the day and free to do whatever he pleased (which would probably consist of some video games or a movie). Now, all he had to do was get to the local superstore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat proved harder than he had initially imagined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you serious?\" asked Isaac with a sigh as he saw the line of cars stretching endlessly before him. What the hell could make traffic so bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Accident on the highway, northbound,\" said the radio host, almost as if he were responding to Isaac's inner question, which ticked him off a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" he muttered angrily as he flipped the station again, \"On my day off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute passed, and then another, and Isaac could swear he had moved less than 5 feet on a commute that typically took him no more than 5 minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck?\" he asked as he craned his neck forward, a little pissed off now, \"What the fuck is taking so long?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now, the curse began to take effect. Isaac's pants tightened just a bit as his rear swelled ever so slightly. Definition was lost in his midsection and his arms, and then a little pudge accumulated above his jeans, giving him just the slightest set of love handles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh-\" he said, trying to adjust himself in his seat- why did he feel so uncomfortable now?</span></div></div>",

The phantom was that of a short and plump woman. She looked to be in her thirties with long, curly hair and a full face. Compared to Isaac lower six foot stature, she was miniature with her upper four foot range. But, she made up for her difference in height with her chub. Dressed in a flowing white gown, her massive breasts peaked out from the neckline, each one almost as large as her head and free flowing. Her hips hugged tight to the dress, while her tum had a soft indentation. All in all, she handled her weight well with curves that would make any man blush. If she wasn't dead, that was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This looks like it will be a tight fit,\" said the ghost girl, chuckling as she opened Isaac's snoring maw. \"But I'll be sure to make room for all of me sooner or later. Bottoms up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being a corporeal being, the phantom was able to manipulate Isaac's gurgling mouth like she was a solid being.

With a few wild kicks, she managed to launch herself fully into his gullet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac awoke with a start, a cold sweat rolling down his back. He let out a hacking cough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?\" he asked to no one in particular.

He awoke on the floor of his bedroom, covered in sweat like he had awoken from a nightmare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn,\u201d he muttered, sitting himself up to stretch. \u201cThat was some weird dream.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stumbled around his room for abit, unaware of what today would bring for him. If Isaac had passed his bathroom mirror, he would have realized the events he thought he had imagined were not a dream. His once brown eyes now had a green glow to them as the ghost woman worked her magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThankfully this one doesn\u2019t appear too bright,\u201d she said to herself in Isaac\u2019s head. \u201cPlenty of room in his head, but not so much his body. Such a skinny little thing. We\u2019ll have to fix that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the spirit knew that even just blatantly transforming Isaac over time would cause him to notice something was wrong. She didn\u2019t want the boy making a fuss until it was too late to do anything about it. She had to be clever about the process so that this boy, Isaac, didn\u2019t notice her making him a host.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need to be subtle about this...And I need to learn more about this boy too. I know he lives alone, but I know nothing else outside of our family connection.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spirit continued to ponder her plans for Isaac as he proceeded with his own day, getting dressed and eating breakfast. The boy was still half asleep and even put his shirt on backwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose a small change wouldn\u2019t hurt,\u201d the ghost smirked to herself. \u201cNow, what won\u2019t this boob notice?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stretched out and worked her possession magic to alter Isaac\u2019s...</span></div></div>",

He was getting ready for his work study, which involved serving coffee to other tired students at the small shop on campus. It was a short job of 3 hours, but it gave Isaac a little extra money around campus. He had put on some half-decent clothes and was about to slip into his shoes when the transformation began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac felt an odd tingle in his toes as he tied his shoes up tight. He ignored it, completely unaware that the ghost was slowly starting to compress his feet to be more dainty and match her own when she was among the living. He didn\u2019t even notice the fact that his shoes, a size 12 in mens, were considerably looser than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMust be time for new shoes,\u201d he muttered as he stepped out into the bright morning light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBoy, this kid is thick,\u201d the ghost thought to herself. \u201cHere I was worried I might have to devote some of my magic to mental manipulation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the ghost didn\u2019t want to risk tempting her luck with how smooth the transformation was going. If Isaac became aware of what she was doing to him, he could fight back and even take control. She was the invader and it was Isaac\u2019s body. But the more of the ghost rubbed off on her host, the less he could fight back. That was why she planned to take it as slow as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven shrinking his foot was done in waves. The phantom did a little as Isaac walked to work, just so that his shoes were slipping but not enough so that they would fall off completely. He grumbled as he walked about how worn out his footwear was, completely ignorant to the fact that it was his own feet that were a good few inches shorter than they were at the start of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Isaac got to work, the ghost had worn herself out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn,\u201d she said as her magic fizzled. \u201cAm I that weak? This is going to take longer than I thought\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the ghost mulled over her predicament, Isaac laced up his shoes tighter and stopped into his job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small coffee shop was situated in the building of one of Isaac\u2019s campus halls, where there was a lot of through traffic for students seeking relief from exams. At the moment, there was only one person on hand working the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbout time!\u201d said the barista. \u201cI figured you had slept in or something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl was Isaac\u2019s co-worker, a short and stocky lass by the name of Emily. While she couldn\u2019t quite compare to the girth of the ghost inhabiting Isaac\u2019s body, she was definitely on the larger side. Her apron tightly clung around her bloated breasts and hips, which had expanded over the of working at a coffee store. The free donuts on hand for their service did not help her weight problem, but she was still a nice and intelligent girl two years to Isaac\u2019s senior. She had medium brown hair and glasses. She did not looked impressed to see Isaac.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, Em\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSave your apologies for later. Right now, I need your help to get some cappuccinos brewing. Go in the back and get your apron on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac mumbled his reply under his breath, though the ghost was interested in this new person, Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm...She could be of some use to me. A little on the tall side, but some of her clothes could work\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the ghost plotted her next move, Isaac was adjusting to his new shoe sizes, almost forgetting his ill-fitting footwear as he worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t until around noon when the ghost could feel some of her power returning, though not nearly enough to allow her to continue the possession. Thankfully, Isaac\u2019s growling stomach provided an alternative.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Em, want to get some lunch now that our shifts are over?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly if you\u2019re treating.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe phantom\u2019s metaphorical mouth watered. She hadn\u2019t tasted food in years and she could only imagine sinking her teeth into a juicy burger with fries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe the food would give me an energy boost and we can move this along.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two co-workers headed off to lunch, the ghost gathered up as much energy as she could and focused on something a little bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided to change Isaac\u2019s...</span></div></div>",

Same greasy ball of grilled meat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s odd,\u201d Isaac said as he compared the food to his palm, which could barely hold the piece of meat in one hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou could use the extra meat anyway. Barely a freshman and you look like you haven\u2019t gained a pound.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small talk distracted Isaac from his shrunken hands. \u201cWhat can I say? I guess I\u2019m immune to the freshman fifteen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to fix that,\u201d muttered Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh,\u201d the ghost said to herself. \u201cI think I like this girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one o\u2019clock bell on the college\u2019s clock tower rang out, signalling the time for the next class. Isaac cleaned up his plate, which was more challenging than usual with smaller hands, and stood up to begin his first lesson of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou doing anything tonight, Isaac?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust the usual. Study and games. Why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s usually movie night for me and Sarah, but she had to cancel because of exams. Want to join me instead?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think our girl likes Isaac,\u201d the ghost chuckled to herself. \u201cI\u2019m liking her more and more. I wonder if she would mind me instead?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure,\u201d said Isaac, not picking up on the subtle hints of a woman. \u201cI got nothing going on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, this might be fun\u2026\u201d the ghost rubbed her hands together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith food in Isaac\u2019s belly, the ghost had plenty of time to build up her strength over the course of the day while Isaac was in class. She had a good chuckle whenever Isaac attempted to write with his pencil using his stunted new hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI swear, things look bigger when holding them,\u201d he would whisper under his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the spirit recovered, she began to mull over what she could do next. Progress today had been less than what she hoped, with only her hands and her feet to show for it. She longed to just mold Isaac into her plaything. But she didn\u2019t know how much of Isaac she would have to convert before she could seize full control of the body. It might be that she wouldn\u2019t be able to until Isaac was an exact duplicate of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Isaac\u2019s classes were over, it was the end of the day and nearing time for dinner. Isaac\u2019s stomach growled and the ghost longed to taste some more food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI feel like I could do something big before our visit with Emily,\u201d the ghost said to herself, cracking her knuckles. \u201cWhat to change?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, the ghost decided to alter Isaac\u2019s...</span></div></div>",

In comparison to the spirit, he was a giant. She only got up to around 4\u20199 when she was among the living, almost child-like when next to Isaac. But she was about to fix that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Isaac walked to Emily\u2019s dorm, he was overcome with the slightest amount of vertigo like he had stood up too fast. His pants felt the slightest bit looser, but didn\u2019t fall off because of the belt he wore. He didn\u2019t know it, but he had suddenly dropped four inches in height, bringing him a foot away from the ghost\u2019s true size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI could do more, but anything bigger and he might notice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is up with me today?\u201d he asked, holding up his pants. \u201cAll my clothes suddenly feel bigger. Do I need to go shopping for some new ones?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGod, he\u2019s really thick.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFour inches made a huge difference in Isaac\u2019s appearance, as he went from fairly tall to average in a blink of an eye. His clothes all looked too big on him now, with his jeans close to falling off and his T-Shirt looking more like something oversized for bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, no one noticed until he got to Emily\u2019s apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis co-worker lived in the same door as him, only on a different floor. They shared a rather large building which housed a fair portion of the students who went to their small university. Being older, Emily got to live closer to the top which provided a better view of the city and a fun elevator ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily was wearing some comfortable looking pyjamas when Isaac knocked at her door. Isaac was taken by surprise at how large the girl suddenly looked, when she was normally much shorter than him. In fact everything about the dorm building looked bigger to him. Emily was 5\u20193 and normally was under his chin in height. Now, she was touching his nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ghost wasn\u2019t sure if she noticed the difference or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIsaac?\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The ghost wasn\u2019t quite sure if Emily had detected anything different about Isaac. She had just seen her co-worker a few hours ago, so out of anyone she should be able to compare that something wasn\u2019t quite right. While there was surprise in her blue eyes, she wore a pleasant smile and suggested nothing was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on in, make yourself comfortable.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac kicked off his shoes, which flew off easier than he would have expected, and entered Emily\u2019s abode. Like all the student dorms in the building, she lived in a single apartment which came with two rooms and a bathroom. The smaller room was the bedroom, which reeked of perfume and incense. The larger room provided space for the living quarters, which included a TV and couch, and the tiny kitchen off to the side. Despite being a larger woman, Emily made the 800 square feet feel roomy and cozy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what\u2019s on the showing tonight?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStranger Things.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds good to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two sat on the couch together and proceeded with the ritual of a college movie night, or Netflix show as was the case. Isaac handled most of the banter, not noticing that Emily was spending her time staring at him. At first, the ghost assumed it had to do with her suspicions of the girl\u2019s crush on her host. But then she caught Emily glancing to Isaac\u2019s feet, with loose fitting socks, and daintier hands. She also kept moving closer, like she was trying to compare heights with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHas she caught on already?\u201d the ghost pondered. \u201cI suppose there\u2019s one way to find out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spirit focused her magic again on Isaac\u2019s height, using the rest of her energy she had gathered from the time spent recharging in class. She envisioned he was like clay she could push down on and squashed him with all her might. Slowly, his body eased downwards as he sunk further into the couch. Isaac shifted uncomfortably, pulling at the collar of his shirt which was starting to slip off his shoulder. Finally, the ghost could not push anymore and settled on Isaac losing another 6 inches in height, bringing him down to a short height for a guy of 5\u20193. His head now perfectly aligned with Emily\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily picked up on Isaac\u2019s shrinking, by the way her eyes seem to gleam under her glasses. The ghost recognized a hunger in the way Emily smiled as she stared at Isaac.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m getting kind of hungry. Want to order a pizza?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac stomach growled. All that magic needed fuel and there was one surefire way the ghost inhabiting him could guarantee it. \u201cSure, but can we make it two?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily was only too happy to consent. The ghost could not tell exactly what the girl was thinking, only that she absolutely notices the changes going on with Isaac. By her demeanor, she seems to approve them. But how could she know exactly what was going on? So long as she didn\u2019t spill the beans, the ghost didn\u2019t care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the pizza came, Emily answered the door and paid while Isaac paused the episode. As she set down the pies in the kitchen and Isaac rose from the couch, his jeans slipped clean off his waist, belt and all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily chuckled heartily as Isaac scrambled to cover himself up. \u201cYou alright there, Isaac?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-Yeah, sorry about that. I have no idea what\u2019s going on with my clothes today. It feels like everything just stretched out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds like you need some new clothes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way. I just bought these like a month ago before school started.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you borrow something of mine from my bedroom?\u201d she asked. \u201cIt\u2019s better than walking around like you\u2019re a kid wearing your parents clothing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous, Em. There\u2019s no way I could fit into something of yours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac spoke without knowing that if he were to stand next to Emily, he would see that they were equal in height. Inside his head, the ghost was practically screaming to do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes! Make him do it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, Isaac. I think I have something in there that might fit you better. Just give it a try, okay? I\u2019ll prep the plates and drinks while you change.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween Emily and the ghost\u2019s encouragements, Isaac reluctantly obeyed and slumped over to his host\u2019s bedroom. Everything around him looked a whole foot bigger than it normally did and he had to reach up more to open the knob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inside of Emily\u2019s room was much like the ghost expected. Emily was a bit of a bookworm, with a full shelf of various romance and fantasy novels. There was a table for her pink laptop and a bed, perfectly folded and tidy. It was the amount of clothes in the room that really highlighted the girl\u2019s personality. She had a dresser and closet, within each was a literal mountain of clothes her size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing a big girl herself, the ghost could appreciate just how hard it was to come across outfits that fit perfectly. Emily must have collected these over the months when her weight settled down in college, as well as outfits from before she had gotten to the size she was. Her older clothes, while still meant for someone overweight, were stuffed away in the furthest reaches of the closet. It was there Isaac searched, hoping to find something that would suit him. The ghost subtly guided him in terms of fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTogether, they stumbled across two things Isaac could agree to wear. One was some grey sweatpants with an old pink v-neck T-shirt, which was the most neutral of the selections. The other was a large green robe, which could be found on the side of Emily\u2019s bedroom door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, so, many good decisions,\u201d said the ghost. \u201cMaybe I should keep him around this size and share in Emily\u2019s extensive wardrobe. What are you going to pick then, boy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe choice was left up to Isaac and he would settle on...</span></div></div>",

Being too small for Emily\u2019s massive hips now, the sweatpants did not see much use from her. However, they were still plenty spacious for Isaac and his still comparatively thin rearend. Despite being too wide, they perfectly reached his ankles in length. He tied the string tightly around his waist to keep them at his waist, but it was a much better fit than trying to wear his jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...Are these bigger than they look?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac threw the pink shirt over his head. Again, like the pants, they were a perfect fit save for the width. He played with the hewn, expecting it to ride up his stomach, but it rested nicely at his waist like a fitting shirt did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to fill these up soon,\u201d said the ghost. \u201cI can hardly wait to start giving you curves.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIsaac?\u201d Emily called out from the kitchen. \u201cPizza\u2019s getting cold.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe promise of food was enough to distract Isaac from the fact that Emily\u2019s clothes had no business being the right size for him. He beelined right for the open pie of barbecue chicken pizza, not seeing that Emily had on a satisfied smirk as he passed by her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee? I told you I had something that would work for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac mumbled something between his bites of food. He was famished for some reason. That had to do with the ghost in his head, who was running on empty after managing to shrink him a foot in height to Emily\u2019s size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe need food,\u201d demanded the spirit. \u201cWe need fuel for the magic.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac was eating faster than Emily. Within five minutes, he was on his last slice and greedily looking at the remaining half pie that Emily had of her pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, Isaac,\u201d said Emily. \u201cYou could spend the night if you wanted to. The couch is a pull out bed and is pretty comfortable.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat could work, I guess. We both have our shift tomorrow, right? You don\u2019t mind me staying?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, not at all! I could use the company tonight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac finished off his pizza, but the ghost was still not satisfied. She was regaining her strength but it was still not enough to coax another full change. With how loose the sweatpants were on Isaac, she already had an idea of where she wanted to start next. Thankfully, it was like Emily had vision into Isaac\u2019s mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about dessert?\u201d asked the hostess. \u201cI made some cookies yesterday.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily had come prepared to sate the appetite of the ghost as she produced a mountain of chocolate chip cookies from the kitchen counter. Without even waiting for her to put the plate down, Isaac got to work chowing down on the fist-sized sweets. Each cookie was like a power pellet in Pacman, combining with the pizza to give the spirit a charge of energy. By the time Isaac had his tenth, she was ready to try and work her magic again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s add some junk in that skinny ass trunk!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Isaac chowed down on his cookies, the ghost reached down and fondled his backside in manner that she could be almost considered a physical being. Where she groped, his flesh expanded like a balloon being filled with air. Only it was not air, but heavy thick fat which plumpened everywhere from his rump to his thighs. With every bite he took, the ghost could make him grow more. The flat, dead folds of the sweatpants suddenly came with a wondrous bounty. When the last cookie was eaten, the spirit drained herself of all her energy. Like a candle, all her life gave out in an instant and Isaac\u2019s butt wobbled into its new shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis waist had grow several inches, enough so that the string was beginning to cut into his side. His thighs, once so thin that he could fit both hands around them, were now thick and meaty like plump cooked sausages. But more impressive of all was his butt, which had grown tenfold. Between it and his new hips, he looked positively feminine from the waist down. And, once again, he remained completely ignorant to his growing predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily, however, watched his inflating butt with a ghoulish delight in her eyes. She spoke up when Isaac ate the last, and twenty fourth, cookie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy, you were hungry. Maybe I should make something for you tomorrow if you have such an appetite.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what came over me,\u201d Isaac said as he patted his stomach, where there was a noticeable bulge. \u201cI\u2019m so full, I can hardly move.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it is getting late and we have an early shift tomorrow at the coffee shop. Time for bed?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds good to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac waddled his way to the couch, pulled out the mattress and collapsed. Emily threw him some sheets and a pillow, but he was already out cold by the time she arrived with them. The ghost spotted her signature smirk of satisfaction as she turned off the light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI still don\u2019t know what her deal is, but whatever,\u201d shrugged the ghost. \u201cWe made good progress today with her help. And we got a long night ahead of us\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Isaac rested, the ghost was going to see to it that he\u2019d get a new surprise in the morning. She\u2019d regain her strength over the night and by daylight, Isaac would have another aspect of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was going to gain her...</span></div></div>",

He jumped off the sofa and waddled to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEverything alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d replied Emily as she leaned over and picked up the pieces of some shattered glass on the floor of her room. \u201cI just knocked over the only mirror in my apartment. I\u2019m so clumsy sometimes. Sorry for waking you, Isaac.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside his head, the ghost was chuckling at Emily\u2019s cleverness. She had woken to see the changes of what she had done to Isaac\u2019s face over a long night, then turned around to immediately remove the only way he\u2019d notice in the whole apartment. Through the evening, the ghost had sculpted Isaac\u2019s chiseled man\u2019s face into a softer more delicate persona. Gone was his sharp chin, replaced with a rounded jaw that widened his entire face. His cheeks had become fuller and fatter, with dimples to show where smiles had been. The large nose he once had was shrunk and pressed like a button. His lips were plump and full, as if they had been stung by a bee. Little had changed about his eyes, save for longer eyelashes and a smaller brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all, if Isaac had looked in the mirror, he would have been greeted by the face of a charming twenty-something year old woman rather than his own. Though the face looked out of place with his short, messy brown hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, how about some breakfast before we head out?\u201d asked Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, we\u2019re starving,\u201d said Isaac, only it wasn\u2019t his voice that came out of his throat. He coughed a few times and tried speaking again, which resulted in his normal voice. \u201cHuh, that was weird. I had something in my throat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily tried to hide her disappointment by offering him more food. \u201cSome fresh made pancakes and bacon can fix that right up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Emily set off to work cooking up a storm while Isaac rubbed at his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo close,\u201d muttered the ghost in his head. \u201cJust a little more and he\u2019ll be mine to control.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes later and a large stack of buttery breakfast goods topped with bacon called out to Isaac, as he salivated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome and get it,\u201d Emily said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ghost was filled with a new determination and energy.

He swallowed mouthfuls of fluffy and buttery pancakes, topped with sizzling bacon. As soon as the food touched the pit of his stomach, the ghost absorbed all the energy it provided and began to convert it into mass which spread all over Isaac\u2019s body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac felt a tightening of Emily\u2019s clothes as he chowed down. The ghost focused on the most important parts first, namely his lower body were his hips and thighs were, but extending it up into his belly. She didn\u2019t touch his breasts let out of fear that doing so would alert him to something being wrong and make the job that much more challenging. His big butt got enough bigger, as his soft flesh pressed closer against the fuzzy interior of the sweatpants. The rope belt cut in deeper into his waist, and he paused from eating for just a moment to undo the knot. His stomach thanked him for the relief as it surged outwards a few inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Isaac\u2019s hips had been extended a few inches wider, it was time to focus on other parts of his body. The ghost plumpened everything else on Isaac\u2019s form, sparing no expense on anything. His hands got fatter the more he shoveled in, spreading all the up to his arms and tightening the sleeves of Emily\u2019s old pink T-Shirt. Even his new face widened, particularly in the neck and the cheeks giving a soft doughy expression of gluttony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow almost one hundred pounds heavier, Isaac was starting to look more and more like Emily\u2019s clone, if still a little on the lean side. All that was missing, from an outsider\u2019s perspective, was her hair and her breasts. Emily bit her lip to contain her smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh god,\u201d said Isaac, still in his own voice. \u201cThat was so good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou liked it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe loved it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac paused for a moment as he realized what had just escaped his lips. The voice had been much more shriller than his own, and higher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhy did I say that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you look at the time?\u201d said Emily, coming to the ghost\u2019s rescue. \u201cWe need to start getting ready for work if we\u2019re not going to be late.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac nodded along between Emily and the ghost\u2019s influence. He tugged at Emily\u2019s old clothes, which were now uncomfortably cutting into his now flabby flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere, I\u2019ll let you borrow my old uniform.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily left for her bedroom while Isaac continued to ponder why he had said what he did. Ever since he had woken up yesterday, he had felt different. It was like an unseen hand had been slowly manipulating him. He felt much shorter and fatter, like he was becoming a clone of Emily. Even her clothes were starting to fit him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d he muttered to himself, ignoring the fact that he was now eye to eye with Emily in height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere you are,\u201d Emily returned with a pile of her own freshly laundered clothes and a coffee shop apron. \u201cThese should fit you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily neglected to tell Isaac that she had just given him an outfit that would fit her now, part of her everyday wardrobe. She gave him jeans that were her size and a purple top that cut off at the shoulders and came down like a dress. Isaac didn\u2019t pay it much mind, with the ghost\u2019s influence the outfit seemed perfectly normal to him. With his new weight, he almost filled the entire outfit. The only thing out of place was the emptiness in the front of the shirt, which was normally stretched to fit Emily\u2019s massive boobs. The apron went around his waist just fine, though Isaac noted that there was much less string to work with when he tied it in the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerfect,\u201d she cooed, holding up some socks. \u201cNeed to borrow a pair of my shoes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo thanks, I still got my own.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as soon Isaac slipped his foot into the soles of his old sneakers, he knew something was wrong. His feet had shrunk even further in the night thanks to the ghost\u2019s manipulations. She had fixed it so he was now exactly Emily\u2019s size, 4.5 in women\u2019s. They were looking very childlike and pudgy as he wiggled them around in the shoe, nowhere close to touching the ends of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily sensed the rising concern in him and distracted him with a pair of her own sneakers, white ones with pink outlines and cloth. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Just take one of mine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Isaac did worry about it as he slipped on the sneakers and discovered they fit him perfectly. He was starting to second guess himself. Emily had always been shorter and smaller than him, hadn\u2019t she? Then why did they seem even in height? Why were his clothes not fitting him anymore, but Emily\u2019s seemed to suit him just fine? And why did he feel so bloated?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ghost would have done more to ease these concerns, but she was more focused on preparing for the next changes. They were so close now to achieving her goal. Isaac didn\u2019t even look like himself anymore. The only reminder of what he had been was in the form of his shortcut hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat will be the next to go,\u201d decided the ghost. \u201cThen he\u2019ll need a few more pounds to fill out Emily\u2019s clothes. Not to mention her \u2018assets\u2019 and womanly parts. Much to do still.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the cost of accelerating her plans with Isaac\u2019s body, the ghost would allow him to notice something was wrong. Thankfully for her, Isaac wouldn\u2019t truly realize what was wrong with him until much into his shift at the coffee shop, when...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>From the minute Isaac got to the coffee shop, Emily began to distract him with promises of donuts and pastries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut Em,\u201d he said. \u201cYou always told me never to eat the donuts because they\u2019re for the customers and it costs the school money.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. No one ever buys them anyway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ghost called on Isaac to give her more energy and the temptation was too strong when Emily because the fresh baked ones right out of the oven. Isaac began to shovel them in his mouth from the plate left by the counter, paying no attention to just how many he was eating. The only thing that bothered him was the occasional itch on his scalp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst thing\u2019s first,\u201d the ghost made up her mind. \u201cLet\u2019s get rid of that awful hair. You\u2019re messing up my look with it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike with his added weight before, for every bite Isaac would take, his hair would grow out a little longer and curlier. After one donut, it looked like he had gone a month without a haircut. Two had his brown hair over his ears. Three made him look incredibly shaggy. Four was the longest his hair had ever been, going down the back of his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while, Emily continued to watch his growing hair. They had no customers yet, it being still in the middle of classes. She and the ghost shared the goal of getting Isaac fully groomed so that he completely had longer hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt five donuts, his hair was touching his shoulders and had exploded in volume, having a curly frizziness to it that was entirely foreign to his original straight short style. On his sixth, he finally noticed the tickle in the back of his neck and felt around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I need a haircut,\u201d he muttered. \u201cThat\u2019s strange, I just got one a couple of weeks ago.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere,\u201d Emily offered him the hair band she was wearing. \u201cTake this, it\u2019ll keep your hair out of your eyes. Have another donut.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, the crave for food overwhelmed his common sense and Isaac continued to chow down as Emily played with his hair so it would say out of sight and out of mind. She could feel it grow in her hands as she worked. By his twelfth donut, his hair was as long as hers was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIsaac?\u201d she asked. \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI feel great,\u201d he replied, though his voice cracked a bit. \u201cThough I think I\u2019m coming down with something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave some hot chocolate. That might make you feel better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac didn\u2019t question Emily\u2019s leap in logic and grabbed the cup from her. He drowned the cup all in one massive sip, smacking his puffy lips as he finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBetter?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLoads,\u201d Isaac\u2019s voice was no longer his own but that of a mature woman. Emily saw the green glow in Isaac\u2019s eyes. The ghost was rewriting things to make the voice sound completely normal to him, or dampening what it sounded like in Isaac\u2019s own ears. \u201cThe class rush should be coming soon, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep! I\u2019ll be in the back making some more donuts.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery time classes ended, all the students and teachers would scramble out into the halls and courtyard. The through traffic meant that the coffee shop was a prime stop to refill before a class or unwind at the end of the day. Exams were going on, so their customers were many and manic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Emily worked the backroom, she passed along pastries and coffee while Isaac took people\u2019s orders. It seemed like just a normal day, if a bit busier than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere you are,\u201d he said to his first customer, a tall girl in Emily\u2019s year. \u201cHot chocolate and a scone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat!\u201d said the customer. \u201cThanks, Em!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac looked behind him to see if Emily had been in sight of the customer. But she was out of sight, still in the backroom baking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho are you talking to?\u201d Isaac tried to ask, but the upperclassman had already been replace by the next person in line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings got even weirder when more and more people started to confuse Isaac for a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, miss.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooking good, girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you lose weight, Em?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the rush died down, Isaac was a bit cross.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell\u2019s going on? Why is everyone confusing me with Emily?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stumbled around at the counter, bumping into more things than he was used to with his wide hips. He felt clammy and bloated, like he had eaten five Christmas dinners back to back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEm,\u201d he mumbled, holding his stomach. \u201cI think I\u2019m going to go to the bathroom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat!?\u201d Emily dropped was she was doing in the backroom. \u201cYou can\u2019t leave the front, Isaac.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy not? Rush hour\u2019s over and I could use a break. I haven\u2019t peed since this morning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo bathroom breaks! Have another donut.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ghost shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s too late for him to do anything now, Em. Though you\u2019ve been a doll in your help. Let him see the fruits of our labor.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac headed straight for the men\u2019s room. Thankfully, the slowness of the day meant that no one was inside. As Isaac passed the mirror, he noticed a large shape in the reflection. He paused and looked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw a large girl with long, curly brown hair staring right back at him. He spoke his first thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEmily? What are you doing here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could process that the figure in the mirror was, in fact, himself, there was movement behind him. Another female appeared in the reflection, leering over the shoulder of the first one whom he thought was Emily. As she came into focus, Isaac saw that it was...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cHello, Isaac,\u201d said a woman who almost looked like Emily but not quite. \u201cI trust you like what I\u2019ve done with the place?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slow realization settled in that Isaac had been staring at himself, only his own face was completely foreign. He looked female, for one, with long hair and a pretty face. Also, he had gotten fat, putting on at least one hundred to one hundred and fifty pounds. Most of it was carried in his hips. On top of everything, he had lost over a foot in his own height. It was like a haze on his mind had been lifted as he reached up and touched his own new face in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the fuck\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was expecting who are you,\u201d said the woman behind him. \u201cBut that\u2019s a fair question too. I removed the fog I placed on your mind all this time, so you should be able to think straight. What do you think of your new body?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurreal was the operative word Isaac was thinking. Until just a few seconds ago, he had painted a vivid mental of himself. Now, that was shattered and his mind was trying to adjust to the fact that he looked like a fat woman. He patted himself around the groin and was surprised to feel his members still in tact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t you worry,\u201d said the mysterious woman. \u201cWe\u2019re not quite finished with the process yet. However, you are ready for the next big step. Speaking of which\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac was powerless to stop the woman as she rested her chin on his shoulder and proceeded to grope his chest. His hands passed right through her as if she wasn\u2019t real. Or a ghost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing to me?\u201d moaned Isaac as butterflies tickled his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGranting you my most important boon. I thought all men liked big boobs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere the woman touched tingled and she began to gently massage the skin around Isaac\u2019s nipples. He continued to groan at how sensitive it was feeling, causing some arousal below his fat waist. The woman began to pull at his chest, like she was coaxing them outwards. As Isaac watched his own female face begin to twist in pleasure, he noticed two bulges underneath the purple dress shirt he had borrowed from Emily. Looking down confirmed his fears. He was developing breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more the woman rubbed, the more swollen Isaac became. While, at first, he could pass the extra puff for manboobs, now they were looking more and more like developed breasts, completing his appearance of girl in the mirror. Soon, he could grab a handful of the fatty flesh as his fingers passed right through the woman behind him, He couldn\u2019t slap her away and something froze his feet in place. He could only watch as he grew more and more bigger. As the first signs of cleavage popped out of Emily\u2019s top, he made a realization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI look like Emily!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman only smiled in response as she continued her work. She pressed tighter against Isaac as he surged forward, causing his new breasts to push against the cloth of Emily\u2019s shirt. They trailed past the hurdle of C-cup in territories that looked incredibly large indeed. Isaac\u2019s back started to ache as they started to look more like melons than breasts. He pushed his new orbs together, causing a mountain of cleavage to form. They felt real. This was real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey bounced to a stop only when each one was about the size of his size. Though no expert in women\u2019s bras, Isaac guessed that he had to be a size G, at least, with a band of 40 given how fat he looked. The only thing left of him now to prove his once male status was his member, which remained rock hard at the changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman seemed to notice it pressed against his jeans and reached down. \u201cOnly one thing left to do before I assume total control.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d cried Isaac. \u201cGet away from him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Somehow, Isaac managed to stumble his way out of the bathroom and into the coffee shop. Emily was managing the front and her eyes widened at the sight of Isaac\u2019s new assets bouncing around, he had gone to work braless after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEmily,\u201d Isaac knew she had something to do with this mess he was in, but he didn\u2019t care. \u201cYou gotta help me\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou look perfectly fine to me, Isaac--\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d he shouted with a shrill voice. \u201cDon\u2019t you give me that! Yesterday I was a normal guy! Now I\u2019m a short, fat, girl!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily\u2019s brow furrowed at the \u2018fat\u2019 comment. \u201cThen maybe you should stay that way and learn a little humility.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEm, come on! If you know what the hell is going on with me say something! Before--\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac cut himself as he felt a tingling in his pants. Underneath his boxers, which he had worn with Emily\u2019s clothes, his boner was getting smaller. This was no natural reaction, but a drastic change in his genetic makeup. His member was getting shorter, sinking into the void that would soon follow and welcome Isaac into the world of womanhood. He dreaded the thought of losing the only thing still manly about him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf I were you, I\u2019d start asking nicely, Isaac.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his manhood slowly shrinking into his body, there was little time to argue with her. \u201c I\u2019m sorry! Please, Em! What is happening to me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a start. But you still have that cocky attitude and that\u2019s exactly why I cursed you to have one of my family\u2019s ancestors inhabit your body and see how you like being a fat girl for a change?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou did what!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d the ghost suddenly appearing spectral form behind Isaac, but in reality she had never left him. \u201cNow I remember who I am. Priscilla Hex. I died ten years ago.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen I was just a teenager,\u201d Emily said, clearly seeing the ghost hovering over Isaac. \u201cI\u2019m Emily Hex, your niece and a fellow witch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEm, you\u2019re a witch?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd soon you will be too,\u201d said Priscilla as she reached down and applied pressure to Isaac\u2019s groin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, don\u2019t!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a gentle hand, the ghost pushed the rest of Isaac\u2019s manhood into his body. Isaac felt a punch to his gut as his reproductive organs reorganized themselves to make room for a womb and uterus. Isaac could no longer call himself male. She was, biologically, female now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere we go,\u201d cooed Priscilla as she leered over Isaac\u2019s mouth. \u201cNow make room. Mama\u2019s coming in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac gagged as the ghost surged forward into her gullet. The taste was like cotton candy as the phantom forced her way down Isaac\u2019s throat. Isaac\u2019s cheeks swelled just trying to fit all of Priscilla inside of her while she forced her breasts over Isaac\u2019s lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Isaac apparently ate Priscilla, there was a tightness in her clothing. She became aware of the fact that the more of the ghost she allowed to enter her body, the bigger she was becoming. Everywhere was filling out, from her legs to her arms to her already big boobs. She was going beyond Emily\u2019s size in mass, becoming fatter and straining her clothes. While not growing any taller, Isaac began to feel like a marshmellow being heated up in the microwave. Her breasts bloated outwards like zeppelin, starting to match her butt in scale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Priscilla wiggled her legs in, Isaac had already gained at least one hundred pounds in fat spread across her body but focusing mostly on her chest and hips. Her hips now passed 60 in size and had exploded the button of Emily\u2019s jeans. Her breasts ballooned up to an amazing I cup with a 52 band. Isaac had never felt so full and gulped at the sight of herself. She now dwarfed Emily by fifty pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEmily, please,\u201d Isaac begged, though she was fast losing control on herself and her eyesight was blackening. \u201cI\u2019m begging you\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her vision darkened completely, Isaac feared the worst. Though confronting Emily had given her some sort pity in the young witch, who didn\u2019t like seeing her friend vanish before her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat said, she wasn\u2019t about to let Isaac off the hook from her own agenda. With a snap of her fingers, she stopped the complete possession. But she had her own rules in place...</span></div></div>",

Emily looked over him with a sad smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGlad to see you\u2019re coming to. You had me worried there for a second.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEm?\u201d Isaac asked in a voice that was his own. \u201cI had the craziest dream, I--\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Isaac sat up, he noticed something strange. On his lanky, tall body, he was wearing jeans and a purple skirt shirt that were both much too small for him. His feet had exploded out of the white sneakers he had been wearing. Strangest of all was the woman\u2019s voice in his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a dream, numbnuts,\u201d said the ghost. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky Emily took pity on you else your body would have been all mine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEm...What\u2019s going on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis friend sighed and folded her arms. \u201cI told you already, I summoned the ghost of my dead Aunt Priscilla to inhabit your body. She was about to take full control until I stopped her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d asked Isaac. \u201cWhat did I do to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you have any idea of insufferable it sounds when you make fun of people like me while we\u2019re at work? You don\u2019t think I hear you comment on the overweight people that visit the coffee shop? I thought we were friends.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe are!\u201d Isaac remained completely ignorant to the fact that the real reason Emily was torturing him was because she wanted to ask him out but was afraid to. Making him look like her put them on even ground, at least. \u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry for making fun of people. I\u2019ll stop. Just please, stop the creepy voice in my head.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s not just a voice in your head, Isaac. She\u2019s a part of you now and you need to learn to share your body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShare!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, for heaven\u2019s sake,\u201d muttered Priscilla. \u201cThat\u2019s it, Emily. I\u2019m exerting my will over him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Isaac could question what that even meant, his entire body lurched on the floor like something had seized him by the back of his neck. Though sitting up, his eyesight was trying to shrink at a rapid rate. In addition, there was a familiar feeling of fullness creeping over his entire body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d Isaac asked, his voice becoming shriller and his hair growing in front of his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re losing control of your body,\u201d explained Emily. \u201cSo, Priscilla is going to take form.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Isaac hadn\u2019t already been through this transformation before, he wouldn\u2019t believe his eyes. As he became shorter, dropping from his sizable height of 6\u20193, he sunk into the shredded remains of Emily\u2019s jeans and purple shirt. His butt began to see some cushioning as it bloated outwards, like a balloon being squashed to the ground. The rest of him was starting to catch up in weight as he felt puffy and flabby again. He could feel his very face softening to Priscilla\u2019s persona, losing his angled chin in favor of a rounder appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do I stop her!?\u201d Isaac asked, his voice now clearly female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFight back. Exert your will over hers. She wants to make your body her own, so you need to imagine you as your old self. But the more of yourself you lose to her, the more of her aspects you\u2019ll take on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIsaac, I\u2019d stop asking questions and start fighting back. The longer you stay completely as her, the more damage there will be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried his best, but with everything happening at once it was hard to stay focused on one thing. Keeping the vision of his old self, Isaac could feel his body fighting back against Priscilla\u2019s influence. Slowly, but surely, his body began to take on its old shape. Little did he know, Priscilla was barely putting up a fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m just testing you, kid. If I really wanted control of your body, I could have it so easily with the way you are now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac felt an immense release of pressure as his body grew back to its old height in an instant. Vertigo overtook him as he tried to stand up, inspecting if everything was back to normal. But even a little time with Priscilla exerting her will over him had left her traces on him. Isaac...</span></div></div>",

All right, I can provide some sort of help, before draining all out\" the ghost said before fogging Isaac's mind once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Isaac felt a odd sensation he could only associate to shame. He quickly exited the bathroom he was in and entered the one directly near. The women's room. He approached the sink without looking up, opening the sink to drink some water.<br>\r\nAgain,  the slowness of the day made even this bathroom empty. Emily followed him close, with the carton in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is everything ok?\" she asked touching faintly his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Em..I was just..I don't know. I think I've had a panick attack\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here...come here you\" Emily placed the caron on the sink, before hugging Isaac. If someone would have entered the room he would have thought that two sisters were hugging \"Better?\" Emily said massaging Isaac's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac relaxed a bit, before feeling a little hardness under his fat belly. Emily wasn't his typical girl, but these last days he felt her closer and closer. If the ghost would have removed the fog on his mind he could have understand why, but that wasn't the case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Emily smeels nice</i> he thought smiling <i>but she will feel it if we stay any more seconds together</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly he felt Emily playing around his back, till she removed the apron from his<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Em?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily looked worried and stern at the same time. She placed Isaac's apron on her shoulder and placed her hands under Isaac's chin:\"Listen up blockhead, you're tired I get it. I feel the same once in a while. You need to give a little rest to your body\" she said before looking him up and down. She smiled, he was more and more like her. She took the carton and put it in front of her for Isaac to grab it:\"Here. I thought you can use a little help. They're double chocolate donuts. This is a box of twelve. I did it for the caf\u00e8, but seeing you know made me realize it's better if you take them. You need a little of sugar, hon\" she said placing it on Isaac's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain Isaac felt the urge to grab the box:\"Thank's Em..you know for everything..\" he said as he felt tears coming to his eyes. It was odd. He didn't think he would have cried in front of strangers, especially in front of Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily just smiled back, as even her eyes seemed wet:\"Take a break, eat the donuts, then go back to the back room to bake. I've made enough for stay at the register for 20 minutes\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac firmly nodned:\"Thanks...but Em, you know I can't bake as well as you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily smiled back again:\"Don't worry, I know it will come natural to you...\" she said before opening the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac was puzzled, yet he didn't want for Emily to go back so soon:\"Em..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily frooze on the door:\"Yes...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac smiled:\"You're the blockhead\" he said like whispering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily stuck his tongue out, before smiling again and leaving the room once for all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally something between them\" the ghost said entertained \"I was wondering how much it would have taken. Now Isaac, grab those donuts, you still need a little more curves on this body of yours\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac opened the box and admired its contents:\"They really look tasty\" he said before taking a quick bite. As the first mouthful entered his body, the ghost placed her hands on Isaac's breats, melting his nipple and leaving two brown and large areolas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Better if I eat in the stall, I didn't want someone to notice</i> he thought before closing himself in and sitting on the toilet. He fail to notice however that his ass was jutting out from both sides, while his new meathy arms kept brushing the wall of the stall.</span></div></div>",

Even his voice now sounded like Emily, high pitched with some low note due to his fat cheeks and bigger neck. The ghost was gently caressing his head, like a mother with his children, to soothe him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emily sure played his cards well\" the ghost said before briefly touching Isaac neck \"Little Isaac here won't suspect a thing as long as he stuff himself\" she moved her hand to his chubby cheeks \"Don't worry my dear Isaac, I'll make a babe out of you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac never felt so good. He had eaten half of the box when he felt a itch on his member. He quickly scretch his groin through the jeans, before looking around:\"Damn, I didn't remember the stalls were this small. I'm feeling claustrophobic\" he said placing an hand on the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was close\" the ghost thought moving her hands away from Isaac's dick. She could only reduce his size briefly before Isaac noticed \"Isaac you should finish the donuts and go back to the kitchen. Emily may be in difficulty without you\" she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac suddenly looked around:\"Anybody there?\" he said without breathing. But no one answered. He raised his shoulders:\"Must be my imagination. Emily was right. I'm still feeling funny. I hope I didn't catch a flu or something\" he said before shoving a donut inside his mouth. His fat fingers were starting to get greasy with the chocolate and the icing. He placed his fingers in his mouth and started to lick off the chocolate:\"Hmmm they are really terrific\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ghost smiled, seeing the progress Isaac was making. Little by little he was transforming in the perfect fatty. Every bites Isaac made, the ghost groped his nipples, pushing the skin a little further.<br>\r\nWhat you could have called man boobs was starting to get rounder at every donuts. After Isaac finished the box the ghost had already swell his breasts till the 30DD still small in comparison with Emily's but enough to show something under Isaac's top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompletely unware of the changes, Isaac licked his lips with delight and left the stall. If he would have looked his reflection he would have seen he was getting more and more like Emily, but he felt the urge of return to the Coff\u00e8 Shop to help Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he reached the backroom of the shop, he heard Emily at the register talking with a client.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, time to work now\" he said recovering his apron from a chair. As he tied the cord behind him, he suddenly became aware of his new mass in front:\"Well I guess it's normal to feel bloated now, after all those donuts\" he said to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right Isaac. Everything's normal. Get back to work now\" the ghost whispered to his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac froze suddenly, looking around. Why was he feeling weird today?<br>\r\n\"I must get back to work now\" he replied without much thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ghost smiled.

After waking in the middle of the night, he had stumbled into the bathroom and drunk a glass of water. It took an hour to go back to sleep and he didn't wake up until nine. That was when there was a knock at the door and Isaac discovered a box this time instead of a note.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe brought it into his apartment's kitchen table and ripped opened the packaging. He wasn't sure what he was expecting, having not ordered anything or knowing anyone who would send him something, but he didn't think he'd find clothes. Let alone clothing for women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?\" he asked. \"Was there a mix up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac checked the address on the box and, sure enough, it had his name and address on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon further inspection, he found a complete selection of an entire outfit. It came with leggings, fuzzy socks, a pair of heeled shoes, a simple shirt/skirt piece, and a thin buttoned pokadot jacket to go over it. There was even a huge bra and matching panties. Holding up the bra, Isaac had never seen one so big before. What was most odd of all, he had the strangest urge to try all of this on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with me?\" he muttered. He truly could not think of anything else but to wear the pile of clothes before him. Even the bra, which he had held up to his chest to imagine just how large a pair of breasts would have to be to fill it. A quick look at the label revealed it to be a size 40G and he could fit two hands into one cup. The shoes looked like for someone with petite feet and, sure enough, when Isaac checked the size he found it was a women's size 4 to his men's size 13. He winced at trying to imagine squeezing himself into them and probably ripping the polished leather. The socks were one of those comfort pairs that girls often wore around the house when trying to relax. He had to admit the material fit nice in between his fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the temptation to wear something was becoming intense. Isaac decide to...</span></div></div>",

I can see why girls like these things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac then proceeded to what he was going to do on his day off. Play video games and veg on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went for his slippers and propped up his legs on top of the coffee table while he grabbed his controller in preparation for some good old fashion Xbox. That's when he noticed something was wrong. His feet were falling out of his slippers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting up he leaned in for a closer look. Sure enough, the slippers were now too big for his feet. And by a wide margin. He wondered how he could miss such an oversight. When his slippers fell off his feet, he made another discovery.</span></div></div>",

It took Isaac a moment to realize that he was not in control of anything from his shins down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, stop!\" you tried to yell. \"Hold it! Cease!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey didn't stop until they reached the table where all the other clothes were. Isaac tried to move away, but the feet remained planted firmly on the ground and he only ended up falling on his butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow...What the hell? This is too weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis feet allowed him to stand up, but it was clear what they wanted. They wanted him to try on more of the mysterious clothes. At first, Isaac thought to try and remove the socks, but with his feet planted he couldn't get them past his ankles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I wear more of these does that mean I'm going to lose control of different body parts?\" Isaac wondered aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis feet tapped their toes impatiently in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt being the first thing in the morning, Isaac's train of thought wasn't boarding the station yet and he couldn't think of a better way out of his predicament without wearing more of the clothes. A part of him was curious to see what else would happen as it looked like his feet shrunk to match. It would be the same for all the other clothes? Would his body change to fit them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was only one way to find out with his feet disobeying him. Isaac surveyed the box and its contents. There were the black leggings that looked as if they would fit him around the waist just fine, being designed for a woman of a larger body type. Did that mean if Isaac put it on he would assume the curvy shape of the intended wearer? he had already given up control of his feet to whatever possessed them, what difference would his legs make?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac also noticed something new underneath the mound of clothes. A single hair barrette that he missed in the initial sweep. There were no hats of any sort, so would a hair barrette count for heading Isaac's head? Isaac assumed so, considering it had come with the mysterious package. If someone was controlling his feet, maybe changing his head might get him some answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich item would he choose next?</span></div></div>",

Isaac was hardly an ugly boy, but not all that attractive either. He had short brown hair and blue eyes. He had to find a lock of hair long enough to fit the barrette and snapped it into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs before, there was a second when nothing happened. Then a tingling sensation, akin to his foot falling asleep, spread throughout his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt started with a few red hairs sprouting from the top of his head. Like a fire, soon his entire crown took a deep scarlet hue. He reached up and touched a few of the locks. It was a far cry from his usual straw-like hair. The new style was soft and lush. It thickened within his grasp. That's when he realized it was growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac watched as his entire look changed. It appeared like he had donned someone's wig, though it was very convincing. His hair did't stop growing out until it reached past his shoulders, then it styled itself to look like he had been using conditioner his whole life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is unreal,\" he said. It was one thing to notice his feet had suddenly shrunk, but a completely other to see his hair transform before his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the changes didn't stop there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing Isaac noticed was his large nose not looking quite as big anymore. His lips looked fuller, as did his entire face which was becoming more round as opposed to solid and sharp. The cleft chin he was sporting became far less pronounced. Even his eyebrows slimmed down. Most of all, his cheeks and neck plumped up slightly with a rosy hue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin seconds, it wasn't Isaac looking at himself in the mirror. It wasn't even a female version of himself, the features were too different. There was a completely other person looking back at him, a chubby redhead. And he looked just like her from the neck up.</span></div></div>",

He did the only thing he could do and reached up for the hair barrette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, stop!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac stopped but only because the shrill voice of the entity caught him by surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I get it. This is all really weird to you. You don't just put on a hair clip and have someone take over your head every day. But hear me out for a minute. You can take off my clothes at any time and undo all of this at any time considering you have control of the hands. Here, I'll even give you control of the head so you can talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac was expecting something to change, but instead he found his neck a lot less stiff. He could move it again, though his feet remained planted firmly in the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" he tried, adjusting to the fact that the voice coming from his mouth was clearly not his own. \"For starters, who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A relative,\" answered the parasite. \"You don't know who I am and we only have a loose connection. And I'm dead. Well, technically dead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Technically?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The details of my 'dying' are rather shady, I won't get into it. But you can call me Sara. I've been dead for a while and have been traveling the world to find the perfect host to bring me back. It just so happens to be you, kid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...You're inside me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have been since last night! You're a heavy sleeper, Isaac.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you know my name...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I wanted to learn more about my honorable host before invading his personal space.

The fuck is all this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of him wanted to just drop the book back into the box and go knocking around his neighbor's to see who had mistakenly dropped this off at his door. That was until he remembered the letter he had received the other day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this the inheritance that the note told me about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe just wanted to scuff and laugh it off. But a voice inside of his head was curious what there was to this strange gift. He flipped through the pages, wondering if he should try casting a spell or making a potion of some kind.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A strange necklace on top of some large women's clothes was in the box. Issac thought this was strange but slipped on the necklace and found a note underneath. It was from his aunt and said, \"Dear Issac,  I know it doesn't appear to be much but things are not always what they seem.\" What he didn't realize was as he reached into box for the note the necklace brushed one of the items of clothes. He also didn't feel the small shock that resonated from the necklace. He then went on looking for any other items that were hidden in the box but all he found was very large dresses and the lingerie that went with them. Well it looks like this inheritance was a bust but what did that note mean? As he said this he suddenly felt a tightness in his pj's. It was like he was inflating. After a sudden boost of adrenaline he jumped up to his bathroom suddenly feeling jiggling over his whole body his thighs felt like they were rubbing together. His face felt loose like it had swollen up from a bee sting. That's when he met his reflection further down the mirror than he was used to. What's happening to me?! He saw someone completely different in the mirror. His hair was red and growing further down to his shoulders his face was fatter but at the same time he was looking older with lines and wrinkles starting to develop on his face it looked like he had aged at least 15 years. His chin was no longer chiseled but lumpy and multiplying as jowls blended into his new double chin. Almost completely mesmerized by his face Issac almost forgot what was happening to the rest of his body. By the time he had noticed and stripped off his too tight clothes he had already doubled in size. His breasts?! were huge and starting to flow down to his newly formed belly. Large nipples grazed the top of his belly which was starting to sag down to his thighs. His love handles and waists were expanding starting to give him a pear shape. He tried to turn around and see the damage on his back but his now large and heavy arms got in his way. After maneuvering enough he was able to see rolls of fat forming on his sides all the way around to his back. He looked down and found a colossal butt that was sticking out like a table. Then he noticed his bulge was no longer there and felt like it had been replaced by slit that he concluded somehow was a vagina. As if that wasn't enough he felt his thighs start to spread his legs apart as they grew into two large trunks. The effects slid down into his calves and ankles as they disappeared into a thick layer of fat. 30 minutes had passed and the changes had appeared to stop. In the mirror he saw a large woman that appeared to be in her mid thirties. She had long fire red hair that touched the top of her shoulder blades. Issac tried to speak but the higher pitch threw him off finally he said \"oh my god how did this happen\" . He looked down between his newly formed breast and saw the Medallion. He hadn't noticed but it appeared to have some sort of fairy or angel on it. It all started when I put this on. He reached for it and pulled it off. He waited a few moments but nothing happened. In fit of terror Issac ran back to the box this time jiggling heavily. He dropped down on his knees feeling his fat thighs and massive butt squish down into his calves and started pulling everything out of the box looking for answers. He noticed a piece of paper that was stuck in the bottom that he hadn't seen before. Hoping for an answer he quickly read it. Dear Isaac, depending on your patience you may already know what the big deal about this box is. If you look like me when I was 35 then you have discovered the power of the Medallion of Zulo. This medallion should not be taken lightly as it has the power to make dreams come true and to curse. It will allow the wearer to change their appearance by touching an article of clothing. If it's been worn before the wearer will change into the person who wore that clothing last. If it hasn't been worn then it will modify your current body to fit that clothing. Lastly it will also swap two bodies in the other person's skin is touched. Be careful not to use with a pregnant woman or go too young this medallion punishes the foolish. You can change yourself again after 12 hours so have fun! Don't worry about me I'm not actually dead I have just moved on to another chapter of my life. At that Issac was still freaked out but was also more curious. If this is isn't permanent then I might be able to have a lot fun. What should I do now he said as he worked to get his large body up. I could take a shower and get a better look at this body or I could just skip the shower and go right to the fun. He looked at the box his aunt gave him and noticed she gave him everything he needed to go out. Maybe I should go out into the world and see what happens. </span></div></div>",

The only thing on his mind right now was relaxing. He went back to bed until 12 P.M. and then groggily arose from his slumber once more. Now ravenously hungry, he ordered an XL pizza, a half-dozen order of garlic rolls, and a 2 liter bottle of Pepsi from a local pizza place as he flipped through the channels on tv. The pizza couldn't get there fast enough, but once it did he tore into it with reckless abandon. He left only a slice of the pie and a single garlic roll, consuming an unbelievable amount of food in a single sitting, especially considering he had been the exact opposite of active all day. The TV was left on but he drifted back to sleep for another couple of hours before waking up at 5 P.M. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God,\" he thought, \"what a waste of a day.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fact that he'd easily had one of the unhealthiest days of his life did not cross his mind, then.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The powder in the tub was already nearly gone; Isaac had become practically addicted to the delicious beverage; despite this fact, he had only been to the gym three times in as many weeks, and the last time he had gone he had stayed in the locker room, too embarrassed to work out in his gym clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Isaac now stood in his bedroom, attempting to fasten what had once been the bag first jeans he owned; they now appeared to be painted onto his thighs, and the waistband cut mercilessly into his midsection as a small layer of chub gently oozed up and out of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFembulk had certainly lived up to its name--he had bulked up in the last few weeks, but it was anything but muscle. In fact, Isaac was sure he had rapidly been losing weight. Although he had been quite slim, Isaac had always had a V shape, with broad shoulders tapering down into a well toned torso, but now his shoulders had withered and, standing here without a shirt on, they appeared quite rounded and soft, instead of the jagged, firm ones he was used to. The V had now practically completely disappeared, and, although his torso still tapered in towards his waist, it had inexplicably begun to flare outwards starting at his navel and continuing into his hips, giving him a shape much closer to an X instead of a V.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scale that morning had read twenty pounds heavier than it had three weeks ago. And while twenty pounds was not, on the surface, an incredible amount of weight for his slim frame, the facts that he had lost a significant amount of muscle and the added weight was purely fat, made it much more pronounced. Even more disturbing was how the weight had distributed itself, settling almost exclusively in and around his hips, thighs, and buttocks. He had, previously, had a stereotypically flat bottom, accompanied by slim, lean muscled legs. Those were gone now, cocooned in a not insignificant layer of fat, which now caused his burgeoning booty to pop quite a bit more than he was used to. It was on the verge of becoming a bubble, at this stage, and was the most disconcerting development in his opinion this far. His thighs, meanwhile, had practically exploded in size, giving them a soft, feminine taper down to his once bony knees, now also softened, and creased considerably now in the back. Further along down his legs, his calves had lost their heart shaped muscling, and hardly tapered at all as they made their way down to his increasingly chubby ankles. His hips, meanwhile, flared out dramatically, now, practically matching the width of his dwindling shoulders. Other areas had not been neglected by this sudden change; where once his firm abs had been, a small, puffy pooch now sloped outwards, flanked by two small, but developing love handles. Further north, where his pectorals had been, was now puffy, and had no semblance of firmness about them. His arms had lost their tone, but ha seemingly remained the same size, if not slightly bigger. The sleeves of his fitted t-shirts had begun to sink into them with little resistance, squeezing them tightly. His face was also changed dramatically. The sharp angles had been replaced by rounded lines. His jawline had softened, and his cheeks had inflated slightly, giving him the flight appearance of dimples when he smiled. His eyes, too, seemed bigger, and his nose somehow smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Isaac wrestled the too tight jeans off from his legs, and settled on the pair of sweatpants he had found himself wearing more and more often--although even these were becoming snug, and his prominent behind pressed up against the fabric conspicuously, and looked considerably feminine when viewed from the rear. He pulled on one of his remaining baggy t-shirts, and made his way to the kitchen, a place he found himself more and more often.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe it was time for him to go shopping, he thought. Or had he just heard a knock at his door?</span></div></div>",

He had an unmistakably feminine sway to his stride, and the snugness of his sweatpants exposed the slight jiggling of his newly prominent ass. Becky wasn't sure if she could be much help to him at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac returned with the laptop shortly, and Becky typed the url into the web browser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a moment, the FEM-BULK website was loaded. The product itself was displayed prominently with a large image of the same container that had come in the mail; next to it was a description of the product declaring that it was a quick and easy way to put curves on in all the right places and keep them there with an experimental new formula. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep them there?\" Isaac nearly shrieked. \"What does that mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure it just means if you keep taking the product\" Becky assured him. \"Let's try to get some contact information.\" she said, navigating to a page with a phone number and e-mail address for customer support. They dialed the number and were connected with a chirpy representative.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, I was just wondering...are there any side effects from taking Fem-Bulk?\" asked Becky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no\" responded the associate, \"as long as you're a healthy young woman you should be fine. Of course women who are pregnant should avoid it, due to the hormones, but otherwise, everything should be normal...except for the added weight, obviously.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great...and what if a man were to take it? Hypothetically.\" Becky continued her line of inquiry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's not meant for men. Taking Fem-Bulk would have similar results to a person on hormone replacement therapy. Fem-Bulk has synthetic hormones, blockers, and other chemical ingredients to promote the customer's development, and are much more potent. A man taking our product could see drastic changes within the first month, at least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. But suppose a man had taken, like, a whole bottle. All of that would be flushed out of his system after a while, right? It would just be temporary...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no. Fem-Bulk works by altering the customer's physiology. If a man took it for more than a couple of weeks, it would most likely alter his hormone levels permanently. It's all right there on the bottle. Of course if it's stopped before then there shouldn't be a problem, and the customer would return to normal with a healthy diet and exercise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's she saying?\" Asked Isaac, impatiently. \"Can they fix it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky bit her lip nervously. Maybe it wasn't too late for Isaac. Maybe she should just take the bottle and what was left of the product and leave, and he would return to normal. Or maybe she should be honest with him and let him know that this might not be going away anytime soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isaac, You're...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Isaac stared at the scale in disbelief; The readout was 25 pounds more than it had been a month ago--he had to lean forward just to see past his now protruding belly. He pushed a lock of his increasingly shaggy hair behind his ear, and stepped down from the offending piece of technology.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking out of the bathroom, Isaac set about looking for his phone. He should have been back to normal by now, not worse--and, while the current gain had been slower this past month than it had been in the initial three weeks, it had been without the Fem-Bulk, and should have been a loss, not the other way around. He needed to get a hold of Becky somehow. Finding his phone was a bit difficult in the clutter of his living space--empty food containers littered the place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was clad in the only t-shirt he had left which would fit--if you could call it fitting; it rode up his developing potbelly, and despite tugging it down constantly, it would always inch back up to sit atop his now prominent love handles which erupted violently from his waist and merged with his prominently flared hips in a distinctly feminine curve; the sleeves dug fiercely into his upper arms, encasing them like sausages--and a pair of horribly strained spandex blend boxer briefs, which had somehow managed to hold together, but hadn't managed to resist being sucked into the crack of his expanding backside. The sweatpants he had resorted to wearing had given out some time ago, and the replacements he had gotten for them had begun to be uncomfortably tight, but he hadn't left the house in weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, he came across the phone, and managed to find a number for Becky. He dialed her and waited for her to answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" she asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Becky, it's Isaac.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isaac who?\" she asked, genuinely forgetting anyone by that name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isaac! I had your Fem-Bulk, remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Oh!\" she exclaimed, realizing that he had probably realized that everything was not, in fact, okay. \"What...uh, what can I do for you?\" she asked, biting her lip nervously, trying to think of a way to get rid of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's about the Fem-Bulk! I don't think it wore off! I haven't lost weight...actually, I've put on some!\" he said, the reality of the situation hit him suddenly, and one of his hands squeezed at his exposed chubby midsection, as he became increasingly hysterical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well. Um...\" Becky tried to think of something to say. \"Well have you been exercising at all? How's your diet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" he lied, then rethought his position. \"I mean...not exactly as much as I used to...but I'm so tired all the time. And I don't eat that much...really.\" Isaac examined himself in the full length mirror on the door of his closet as he spoke. Besides his growing belly and rounded hips, the damage to the rest of his body was noticeable as well.His thighs were touching, and his calves looked soft and chubby. The tight t-shirt revealed that his chest had softened considerably, and they now carried a considerable amount of flesh, not all of which, it seemed, was fat. He fondled the area, and his swollen nipples tingled slightly; he definitely had moobs now, and was fast approaching what looked like legitimate breasts. Further up his face had chubbed up noticeably, his face was now soft and lacked any kind of masculine features, buried under a soft layer of fat. His cheeks were rubbery and full, and had begun to press in towards his nose. Dimples had also formed almost permanently. He lifted his chin, and pressed his fingers underneath; even that was becoming doughy, and looked as though he would sprout a second chin at any time. He examined his hand, which hadn't been overlooked in his recent weight gain; his digits appeared puffy and soft, and the spaces in between had been filled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I told you\" she said. \"How do you expect to lose weight if you don't diet and exercise? I'm sure it's only a matter of getting into the gym.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but...\" Isaac tried to contain his emotions, but he had found that difficult to do lately. They bubbled to the surface, and he failed to contain a sniffle. \"I could really use some help!\" he pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky was torn. It wasn't her fault, after all; he had done this to himself, and he should handle it by himself, she just wanted out of it. On the other hand, it seemed pretty scary, even his voice had sounded different on the phone; and she was curious to see the results of the weight gain, considering her results since starting on the powder herself.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He knew he had read something about having fat friends making you fatter, statistically speaking- but he didn't know who else to turn to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you could, I dunno-\" he scratched his head, \"At least motivate me a bit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe you could remind me to work out, help me watch what I eat and stuff!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Becky scratched her head with her free hand, almost forgetting she still had a twinkie in it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\" she asked, hoping she could wiggle her way out of it somehow, \"Don't you have anyone else that can help you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really don't.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, no one I could live down seeing me like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?

Okay, it's bad,\" he admitted, \"Please come over, I could use the company.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe paused, then remembered that he wanted more than just company.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And of course, some friendly motivation to be healthier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be over there tomorrow,\" Becky said, polishing off the twinkie in her hand, \"I'm a little busy right now, but you can expect me around 9 am. Is that fine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" Isaac blurted out entirely too eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you still know how to get to my house?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll manage,\" said Becky, already a little eager to see how Isaac's body had changed. Was it sadistic of her to think of that with a little bit of a chuckle? Perhaps, but she thought it nonetheless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, 9 am!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Isaac was awoken by a sharp knock at the door. His eyes shot open and struggled to find the clock. It was just after 9. Becky!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had passed out on the couch with the television on, surrounded by empty containers of foodstuff. He had told himself he would clean the place in the morning, but had neglected to wake himself up earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe knock came again. Becky's voice came muffled through the door, but he couldn't make out what she was saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a minute!\" Isaac yelled at the door, his voice cracking. He blamed it on his dry throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe suddenly realized he was practically naked, wearing only his ill-fitting underwear and a t-shirt still. He searched around for some kind of pants, and settled on the sweatpants. He struggled to pull them up his thick legs, swaying his hips back and forth until they finally settled below his waist, barely able to contain the globes of his ass. There was a definite gap between the pants and the shirt, which Isaac tried several times in vain to close, but the shirt rode up each time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemembering that Becky was a girl, Isaac did a quick check in the mirror before opening the door. Brushing his hair out of his face, then, putting it off no longer, he answered the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe results of the powder hadn't spared Becky, who had become definitely chubby since the last time Isaac had seen her. She carried the extra weight in an exaggerated hourglass, which, even under her slightly baggy clothing, was unmistakeable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac motioned for her to enter, and he quickly shut the door behind her. Becky was surprised at the state of the place. No wonder he's been gaining weight, she thought, observing the type of food he had apparently been eating. Then she turned and looked over Isaac for the first time. It was impossible to hide her surprise. His clothes didn't even fit, and they showed every bit of his new curves. Isaac noticed her looking at him, and self-consciously crossed one arm over his chest while the other was used to pull at the bottom of his shirt. He looked at the floor, and blushed a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky wasn't sure where to begin. Not wanting to embarrass him, she decided not to mention anything about his body just now. \"I think we should start my cleaning this place up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac agreed, and thanked her for her help, as the two set about straightening up the apartment. As they did so, Becky couldn't help stealing glances at Isaac's pudgy body. His butt looked bigger than hers, and she was sure he could do with some support up top, although they weren't nearly as impressive as her own newly improved bust. He could probably pass for a girl easily, at this point, with the right clothes and a little makeup. He might even be able to pass as a model on a website like hers. She giggled at the thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. That's one less thing to worry about.\" said Becky after they had finished. \"But I think I've worked up an appetite. Do you want to get some lunch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't really have anything to eat in the house.\" Isaac said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's okay.\" said Becky. \"You can take me out to eat for helping you out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Out? But...I can't go out like this.\" Whined Isaac.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't just stay in your apartment the rest of your life. You've got to get active! But you're right, you should probably change first into something that fits better.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...haven't really got anything that fits...\" Said Isaac.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky thought about it for a moment. \"Well, you're not quite as big as me. I could give you some of my clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girl's clothes?\" protested Isaac. \"I'm not wearing girl's clothes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would just be some pants and a sweater! You wouldn't even be able to tell!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\"</span></div></div>",

She rummaged about in her trunk, where she did in fact have a few pieces of clothing that Isaac could probably use. Her mind, however, was focused on Isaac and his predicament. What could she really do for him at this point? He seemed set in his ways. Pigging out on junk food was obviously comforting for him now, and the chemicals and hormones now coursing through his pudgy frame would do nothing to help him if he wanted to change. Perhaps, she thought, the best thing she could do was teach him to accept himself. THAT was the real issue, wasn't it? Isaac did not accept himself as he was, and as he was becoming. It was just a thought, one she pushed to the back of her mind as she found the clothes she had thought would work best. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a laugh, she had considered entering with a peach pair of skinny jeans and a pink sweater, but knowing that Isaac wouldn't take to those articles of clothing very well, she instead selected a gray pair of sweatpants and a mint green sweater. The pants were pretty good, if you didn't read the tag you wouldn't have known they were made for women. The sweater was just a bit girly, but Isaac's current shape was already pretty girly- a manly sweater would do nothing to conceal that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky re-entered the house, where Isaac waited, scrolling through status updates on his phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here,\" she said, handing him the clothes, \"These should do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac eyed the green sweater disapprovingly, but vocalized no complaints as he entered his bathroom to change. He emerged about a minute later. The clothes fit well, if just a bit loosely, and his gratefulness was painted on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Becky,\" he said, \"I definitely owe you, what do you want to eat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky considered her options. Isaac would be better off eating something healthy- something low-fat, low-calorie and all that. However, he did say that it was her choice, and she was feeling pizza right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Maybe the best she could do was provide him with a friend, someone to experience these changes with. It was either that, or she was just extremely lazy and hungry, so she uttered the following pretty quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pizza!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac shifted about nervously in her clothes, \"I dunno- don't you think I should lay off the junk food.

His white t-shirt showed off his blossoming breasts and his large, erect nipples glared through the fabric.  His bottom half was more feminine; the sweatpants he had on were incredibly tight, and really showed off how large his butt had gotten.  His hips were wider too, he realized from the neck down that he looked like a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed his computer and waddled over to his couch.  His thighs were rubbing together and it caused him to swing his butt more side to side.  He pulled up google shopping and went to the pants section.  Still somewhat in denial of the whole ordeal, he purchased mens XL sweatpants and jeans, and 2 white XL tshirts.  He contemplated looking at bras, he couldn't stand how itchy they were all the time and how they moved around under his shirt.  He found a sports bra/camisole and settled on that.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey arrived 2 days later.  Issac quickly opened the package and tore out his new clothing.  Coming first across his bra, he tossed it to the side.  He found the jeans next, and stood up to try them on.  He stuck his leg in and became discouraged very quickly.  His fat thighs barely made into the leg holes.  He tore them off and grabbed the sweatpants.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, they were not much bigger.  They were just as tight as his old ones and threatened to rip at any moment, he cried to himself as it began to dawn on him how much fatter he had actually gotten.  Issac grabbed the tshirt and pulled it over his head.  As he pulled it over his nipples, he felt an incredible itching sensation.  He quickly took off the shirt and looked at the camisole bra.  He took it out of its packaging and stared at it in horror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the point of no return, he thought as he pulled it over his head.  He cringed as he slid his breasts into place.  Looking in the mirror, he broke down, terrified to see his breasts push against the bra and create a noticeable cleavage.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at himself in the mirror.  He looked like a fat girl in way too tight clothing.  This was not him, he thought, it can't be.  I use be so skinny and good looking.  He needed to get clothes that weren't so tight, then he wouldn't look so girly.  \"Yea, thats the problem\" he thought to himself.</span></div></div>",

Everyone knew he would have a bra on and that was completely unacceptable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe struggled to get his shirt over his head, once off he tossed it to the floor and quickly took off his bra, moaning as the cool air hit his nipples.  He pulled his shirt on and grimaced from the pain in his nipples.  They were erect from the cold and stuck out like pencil erasers through his shirt.  They itched like hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIssac knew he had to suffer through it.  He walked out of his apartment and decided to head for the stairs.  As he began taking the stairs, he felt his breasts bob up and down with each step, painfully rubbing his nipples.  In an attempt to alleviate the pain he grabbed his breasts, one in each hand, and held them as he ran down the steps.  A man entering the staircase looked up and saw Issac, who panicked when he realized the man was watching him grab his breasts as he ran down steps.  He quickly made his way out to the parking lot, horrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon entering the retail giant, he smelled the sub shop inside.  His hunger forced him to walk closer.  He did his best to turn the other way, but to no avail.  Issac walked up to the counter and ordered a large sub and three cookies.  He couldn't help himself and felt terrible as he stood there waiting.  When it finally arrived he quickly devoured the meal and his clothes were tighter then ever.  As he made his way into the clothing section Issac received a few stares from people, but nothing he couldn't handle at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing through the women's section towards the men's, his cell phone rang, Issac figured it was his parents, but as he went to check, he dropped his phone on the floor.  He bent over to grab it and heard his pants burst open with a loud RIIPPPPP.  Horrified he hunched down and grabbed a pair of gray sweatpants to his right.  He could only see the front but he threw it under his arm and hustled to the changing room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside, he tore off his torn pants, nearly in tears.  He put on the new pair he had grabbed and quickly tried them on.  It fit perfectly, but once he turned around and looked at his butt, he gasped as he saw JUICY stretched across a wide, fat butt.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Staring at his own ass, Issac felt his groin begin to stiffen.  A rush of heat came over his body as his nipples hardened, becoming painfully obvious through his shirt.  He broke down, sobbing in the changing room disgusted with himself.  \"What kind of sicko gets aroused from his own fat body,\" he thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter collecting himself and wiping the tears from his eyes.  He decided to venture into the store to purchase the remainder of his clothing and get out of there ASAP.  Out of the dressing room, he turned right and saw he was in the bra section.  Issac swore to himself that he wouldn't buy one; \"they are for chicks,\" he rationalized.  After passing several racks of them, he stopped.  His nipples were aching worse than ever and he couldn't bear the pain.  He saw a plain black one with no laces or frills.  He grabbed it off of the shelf and checked the size, 34B.  From his experiences with the ladies, he figured it would fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIssac figured that if he wore sweatshirts and other heavy clothing he could easily conceal them.  Walking past the men's shirts, he grabbed two XXL, one white, one black.  In the sweatshirt aisle, he saw a gray XXL and tucked it under his arm as he made his way to the register.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped as he realized that he only had one pair of pants, the JUICY brand ones he was wearing.  He worked his way to the men's pants.  He looked around and heard someone behind him.  \"Miss, the women's section is behind you.\"  Isaac cringed as he heard those words, it reminded him how he actually looked from behind.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around with a puzzled look, Issac watched the woman's eyes scan up his body.  They stopped at his nipples, focusing on their prominence.  As she looked at Issac's distraught, puzzled face, her cheeks turned bright red.  She began to realize that he was in fact a man.  \"I am so sorry sir\" she said as she quickly turned around and scurried away.  Issac felt another round of crying coming on, so he quickly made his way to the register and out the door.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking to his car, he began breathing heavier, his arms began to ache from the bags and his legs were getting tired too.  He hadn't quite realized it yet, but his enlarged thighs and hips made him swing his hips when he walked, producing a clearly feminine gait.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis only heightened Issac's insecurity.  He finally made it to his car and plopped into the seat.  He began crying as he put his keys into the ignition.  He pulled down the vanity mirror and saw a fat face staring back at him.  His once angular face was now rounded, his chin length hair not helping his case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to get a haircut, that will help me look more masculine.\" He thought to himself.  Tired from a long day of walking, he headed home, ready to try on his new clothes.  </span></div></div>",

As he made his way up the steps, his breasts resumed bouncing around and irritating his nipples. Once through the hallway and into his apartment he realized he forgot the bags.  Cursing at himself, he walked all the way back to the car.  He began breathing heavier and sweating.  Getting to his car, he grabbed the bags, forgetting how heavy they were.  He looked back towards the steps in fear and began his journey back to his flat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing up the first few steps, his arms began to ache.  Issac began to panic at how weak he had become.  He could hardly move his fat body, let alone a few bags of clothes.  Finally making it into the hallway, he felt sweat dripping down his breasts.  He cringed at how horny it made him, his dick stiffening harder than ever.  Entering into the room Issac dropped his bags and plopped onto the couch, panting.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ripped off his new pants and took his underwear off.  His dick was still rock hard and needed attention.  He took off his shirt and felt the cold air soothe his nipples.  He grabbed one in his hand and felt waves of pleasure rock through his body.  He began stroking himself and came almost immediately.  It felt incredible, he couldn't help himself as he kept stroking and massaging.  Now just as hard as before, he came yet again.  The pulses of pleasure left him in pure bliss for what felt like hours.  He came down from his euphoria and started to realize what had just happened.  Issac was terrified of what he was becoming.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got into the shower to clean himself off and was sure not to touch his breasts.  Drying off his body, he began to work on his hair.  He hated how much there was and needed to get a hair cut.  He walked through his dirty apartment, littered in food containers from nearly every place in town.  He grabbed the bags and dumped the contents onto the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo stop the jiggling, Issac put on the bra first, fortunately, and unfortunately, it fit rather well.  It made his breasts stick out much further than without one but they felt much more stable and less irritable.  He was confident his sweatshirt would be able to cover them.  He put on his white shirt, and was startled by the black bra glowing through.  The shirt was a little big and rested on his breasts.  Issac made a promise to himself these would be the largest set of clothes he would ever own.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final test was the sweatshirt, Issac pulled it over his head and looked into the mirror.  He could see the faintest outline of breasts, but only if you were really looking hard.  He sighed in relief, though still concerned with his face which didn't look very masculine at all, especially with all that hair.  Suddenly, a rash of hunger began sweeping over Issac, he couldn't control himself as he pulled out his phone and ordered 3XL bacon pizzas, 2 orders of cheesesticks, and fries, already forgetting his promise.  </span></div></div>",

He stepped out and felt his nipples harden from the cool air they became exposed to.  On cue, he felt his member grow rock hard.  He couldn't help himself as he began fondling his breasts and stroking himself.  It had become a daily ritual, wake up, shower, masturbate, then eat.  His stomach growled as he finished cleaning himself off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking naked towards the bathroom, he felt his entire body jiggle.  HIs breasts were swinging like pendulums, countering his every move.  He hadn't looked in the mirror in 3 days, he was terrified of what he might see.  Putting on his bra, he cringed as he saw his boobs bulging above the cups.   It was becoming painfully tight, as were the rest of his clothes, and Issac knew he had grown even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis sweatpants were very tight and showed every inch of his bubble butt and expanding thighs.  Even his calfs were thick and meaty.  Not neglected in the growth was his hair, Issac had become so annoyed with it that he resorted to wearing it in a ponytail.  He put on his shirt and saw his own cleavage through the neck hole.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIssac absolutely did not want to venture into public again (last week's trip was a disaster) but he needed a bigger bra and new pants.  He hadn't worn his sweatshirt since he tried it on last week, but Issac was confident it would still conceal his twins.  Issac was wrong.  His larger breasts protruded from the sweatshirt and he could easily see them just by looking down.  Then it was time for the real test, the mirror.  Taking off the cover, Issac shrieked when he saw his reflection.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw a fat girl looking back.  There was no denying it now.  His face had softened to the point where he nearly didn't recognize himself and his ponytail sealed the deal.  Looking at his body he saw boobs sticking out from his chest, absolutely noticeable despite the sweatshirt.  His lower half jutted out from his soft waist and gave him an obvious pear shape.  Issac felt defeated, he was officially a chick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO\" he said to himself, \"this is not me and I am changing now!\" Issac rationalized that there was still a chance to save his body, he needed to goto the salon to get his haircut and then join the gym to start his re-transformation.  Issac decided he was going to take his body back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe now confident Issac grabbed his keys off the counter and waddled to his car. Turning the key in the ignition, he realized he had skipped breakfast and was now hungry.</span></div></div>",

It was located in the back of the strip mall so very few people passed by it.  Issac figured it'd be the best spot to avoid being seen by anyone he knows, if they would even recognize him by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked through the doors of Ms. Lee's, pushing his hair out of his eyes.  Ms. Lee motioned for him to sit down on the shampooing chair and place his head back in the sink.  Issac felt the warm water rush through his hair; then Ms. Lee asked him what type of cut he would like in very broken English.  He explained that he wanted his hair really short.  Ms. Lee asked \"Like a boy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded his head and hoped she understood what he was looking for.  After she was done rinsing, she brought him over to the chair and began cutting.  Issac closed his eyes, not wanting to look in the giant mirror in front of him.  After another 10 minutes, she had finished cutting and grabbed the styling gel.  Issac's heart dropped when he finally opened his eyes.  He still looked like a girl, now he just had short hair.  Ms. Lee had thought he was a girl and wanted cute, short hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIssac quickly paid and waddled out of the store and into his car, nearly in tears.  He stopped by Mendy's again, the drive-thru operating chuckling as he saw a fat girl purchase the same huge meal twice in two hours.  Getting home, he tore into the food, devouring it all rather quickly.  He felt his shirt getting tight and glanced down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis stomach stuck out and made him look pregnant.  Issac had a massive food baby and could barely lift himself off the couch.  He had become so lethargic and weak lately that even simple motions like getting up were becoming quite difficult.  Walking into the bedroom, he glanced at himself in the full length mirror.  He should have been shocked and disgusted with what he saw, but for some reason he began to expect seeing a fat girl looking back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clothes he promised would be the largest he would ever own were becoming too small for him to wear.  Issac knew he had completely lost control; every time he thought about food, he had to eat as much as he could.  Exercise was out of the question as he could barely walk through his home without sweating.  Issac stood up and pulled off the sweatshirt and scanned his body, stopping on his tits.  He kept staring and felt his member stiffening.  Unable to control himself, Issac began moaning as both hands went to their familiar places.</span></div></div>",

He couldn't possibly face everyone how he looked now; he would be the laughingstock of the entire university.  Restarting as a girl would be impossible, he couldn't just create a person.  Now, his bank account is dwindling, falling victim to the countless purchases at fast food places and ice cream shops.  He needed to get a job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChecking himself over in the mirror, his shirt was too small and showed off all of his curves.  His bra he now had to wear was visibly evident through his shirt.  Issac broke down again, cursing himself for ever trying a stupid powder he got in the mail.  Fembulk had ruined his life.  He went from great student with a bright career path to a fat girl getting dressed to interview at Mendy's, the only place that will ever hire her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking into the store, she looked behind the desk at the manager, the same one who was laughing at him last time.  Now incredibly insecure, Issac delicately approached the man and timidly asked for a job application.  Issac watched the man scan his entire body, checking out his wide hips and big tits.  Issac was terrified, he hadn't been looked at like that before and didn't know how to react.  The man smiled and said my names Max, welcome aboard!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIssac feebly smiled and followed the man behind the counter.  Walking over to the closet, he pulled out a pair of black stretch pants and three polo shirts.   Max gave the clothing to Issac who made his way to the women's bathroom to change.  Putting on the pants, Issac hated how they clung to his body.  It made his ass look huge and he could feel it jiggle with every step.  The polo shirt came on next.  Realizing he couldn't wear his long sleeve shirt underneath he opted for just the polo and his bra.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling the medium sized one on, he quickly realized it wouldn't fit.  Grabbing the large, which was huge, Issac pulled it over his fat, feminine body.  Cringing as he pulled it down, he noticed the valley of cleavage forming down the neck line, he tried to button it up.  His big boobs prevented even the bottom button from closing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at himself in the mirror, he saw a big girl wearing a revealing polo and tight black pants.  Issac cringed as he headed out the bathroom door to see Max, now realizing why he was hired so quickly.</span></div></div>",

It was his Ex-Girlfriend, Ashley. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley had been chunky last he saw her, remembering that he had dumped her for gaining the freshmen fifteen that turned into thirty, but that had obviously changed. It was a harsh breakup, with him talking about how she was turning into a fat pig. She had run away crying, leaving him to believe she aimed to feed her sorrows and get even fatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slender brunette saunters into the store, setting herself into the line as she takes out her phone, idly playing with it while waiting. Taking a moment to consider trying to get another cashier instead the person in line began to snap his fingers repeatedly in front of Isaac's fat face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I said I'll take a double cheeseburger and a diet coke.\" The rude burly man shouts out, annoyance radiating off him as he gestures out with either arm beside him and bopping his head back and forth. \"I'm sure even you can handle that, make it snappy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe breaks away from that panic doing his best to sound feminine. \"Coming right up sir, sorry...\" He squeaks out, setting the order into the computer. \"There you go sir, will be ready in no time.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrder after order arrived, Isaac biding his time for when he could finally take a break as finally, Ashley walks up. Her eyes flicker up at him. \"Yeah, I'd like a coffee and parfait...\" With a faint expression of confusion, she looks Isaac right in the eye before finally going over his plump cheeks, thick double chin,  busty boobs, jelly belly and flabby bingo wing arms. \"You wouldn't happen to be related to Isaac, would you?

I\u2019ve just let myself go a bit and have this hormonal imbalance thing going on.  I\u2019m working on it I would appreciate it if you would stop laughing.\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled her head back and let out a laugh.  \u201cMy my how the tables have changed eh?  You were not so kind to me when I had my weight problem when we were dating.\u201d  Some of Isaac\u2019s coworkers began to look up and a few customers were staring now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey some of my old sweats might fit you.  You are looking a little girly there buddy.\u201d  She looked over the counter obviously staring at his ass.  \u201cI can bring them over next weekend when I am back in town how about that?\u201d  She asked with the evilest of grins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac could hear some of his coworkers chuckling behind his back and he heard a shocked customer say to his wife \u201cThat\u2019s a man?\u201d  He was so humiliated.  He was also broke and couldn\u2019t afford to turn down an offer for free clothes like this the way he as been outgrowing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reluctantly agreed to Ashley\u2019s cruel delight. They exchanged numbers and agreed to meet at his place next weekend.  Isaac wasn\u2019t just going to use this visit as a way to get new clothes however.  He planned on trying to get revenge for the humiliation she put him through today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he got home he went back to the FEM-BULK website and looked through their products.  He planned on spending the last of his money on some products.  He was hoping to spike some food and hoped he would find a way to sneak it to Ashley during their visit.  He planned on ordering some more powder then a new product caught his eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a new line of super concentrated liquid FEM-BULK.  It came in bottles and was very potent apparently.  He had to check all of these boxes and filled out a form pretending to be a company purchasing this to create weight gain drinks.  The website said to be very careful with this new product.  Only a little was to be added to a drink and it would have an effect even stronger than their powdered products.  There were plenty of disclaimers warning against the synthetic hormone chemicals potentially drastically changing ones hormones and metabolism potentially forever if misused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerfect\u201d Isaac said with a smile.  He wondered how it would affect Ashley if he added much more of the recommended dosage to a drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few days later a package arrived.  It clinked heavily as he heaved it into the kitchen.  Inside were many cylindrical glass bottles filled with a dark amber liquid.  He opened one and smelled it.  It smelled almost sickenly sweet and very potent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began baking it into pies, brownies and cookies.  He mixed it into home made ice cream and made cupcakes and other snacks.  His fridge was full of this tainted food.  Ashley was to arrive later today and he wanted have a lot of options available to her.  He even brought out a few bottles of alcohol and some things to mix drinks with.  He planned on giving her a very sweet fruity drink.  He didn\u2019t know how this stuff would taste in food especially in these ridiculously high dosages but hopefully the other flavors would mask it enough for her to get hooked and hungry for more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe texted she was on her way and he began feeling nervous.  What if this food tasted funny from the concentrated FEM-BULK?  He considered giving a brownie a taste.  He put a hand to his gut and groaned.  This would be terrible for him.  His metabolism is already ruined and he\u2019s been doing so good on his current diet - only eating out at McChubbies every other day instead of every day.  And he only had half a pizza last night as a reward for his diet.  But this food could seriously throw him off track.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes he try a brownie or save it all for Ashley?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That was a lot of Fembulk he had just consumed, and quick enough but at least this test had displayed how it should work, at least he hoped so. Picking up the pan he sets it into the sink, his hand digging at his waistband. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any weight I gain to put a double chin on that skinny bitch is worth it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was resolute in his mission, to ruin his ex-girlfriend's figure with malicious intent. With a sway, he turns towards his fridge, his mind going over the other treats inside. There was plenty of food, another slice would not hurt after all. Surely it would not hurt, he had been good on his diet after all. Licking his brownie covered lips he instead turned away and took out his phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTake out would be healthier after all, at least if his appetite was not going out of control. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take two large pizzas, a side of breadsticks and a two liter of coke-\" His eyes shift down towards his protruding belly, a faint tremor going through it from moving moments ago. \"A two liter of diet coke, watching my waistline. Cash.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weekend was fast approaching and Isaac had been eating his fill. The previous days of the powder had been devastating to him, but that liquid had been on a noticeable amount on his wide flabby ass. There was a struggle to pull his pants up, the sleeves on his shirts felt as if they might explode and he had to order a larger size of his work uniform already, more chuckles and snide comments being thrown his way by coworkers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet as he managed to bake up another batch of brownies for the soon to be fatty he felt accomplished, happily risking being around these fattening treats if it meant taking her back. He just ignored the rather unhealthy uptake in his own diet just to resist the urge to eat the tainted treats, his hand reaching out for another oreo as he sets the brownies on the counter to cool. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley was coming over later today, and he was ready to see her ass expand. His mind was imagining the doughy double chin she would receive, the hefty shelf of an ass she could grow and could not wait for the day she would come groveling back for her fat girl clothes from him. Laughing to himself he imaged her having those curves, only to wince as the image was turned back to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got to make her weightier then me, show her who the real lard ass is.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden knock on the door threw Isaac off his fattening fantasies as he wobbles his thunder thighs towards the door, feeling a brief bit winded as he opened it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Isaac, looking-\" Ashley's hand runs over her mouth as she had a giggle fit, snorting out as she walks straight past Isaac with a bag of clothing in her grasp. \"Robust. Really working out those...\" Her eyes linger over Issac's vast behind, another fit of giggles escaping her. \"Glutes! I came here just in time it seems.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hand comes out to slap at Isaac's slightly exposed belly, it was now set to motion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac simply smiles at the insults, ignoring the clothes and instead shuffles towards the kitchen. \"Can I get you anything to drink?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could even answer he takes out the fruity drink he had set up, offering it out towards Ashley. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes she drink it?</span></div></div>",

Unable to stop himself he tilted his head back and downed the entire glass.  Some of it dribbled down his cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stumbled back and gasped in horror at what he just did.  He reached to the counter and ripped open a pack of oreos and began stuffing one in his mouth after another.

The high amounts of super concentrated Fem-Bulk taking over his senses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some time he passed out into a food coma.

A faint smile brushes across her face as she decides to write a note for the passed out fatty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*\"Isaac, I forgot a few things back at my place and will be back tomorrow. Forgot some of my larger outfits, you certainly could use them judging by all these sweets.\"*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day Isaac felt as if he was getting over a hangover, or he would if he had stopped eating since then. He had made a quick stop to get two dozen donuts at the shop, along with a bag filled with breakfast sausages and biscuits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better than losing myself and eating more of those tainted treats,\" Isaac muttered out as he stuffed another donut in his mouth, trying to convince himself as he kept setting up the place. There was a flicker of excitement rushing through him at getting another chance to feed Ashley, but that flicker was overshadowed by the overwhelming hunger he felt. Downing that much had left him feeling as if he was starving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a break to stop stuffing his fat mouth he began to get dressed, using the things Ashley had left behind. Most of it had been girly, something that did not overly surprised the boy considering her tastes and dislike of him but the light blue sweat pants had a decent fit along with the somewhat gender neutral black blouse left him feeling better. The pants felt tight around his massive ass, which let made him sour. He just hoped that Ashley's fattest clothes were not too tight on him either, being even more bottom heavy than her at the fattest would have been humiliating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac had more plans to help fatten her up. He realized it was heavy handed to try and just shove it into her face, instead he would offer to get them both drinks, the bottle itself is laced. He would be forced to drink more, but at least he would get the seed planted in her too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a knock on the door Isaac heads over, trying to pull the tight shirt over his belly and adjusting the sleeves before opening it up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a wide smile, it revealed Ashley, holding a large box of clothes in one hand and bag filled with Chinese take out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Just thought since you made all that food for me yesterday that I'd bring over some for us to share.\" Taking a moment to gaze over the flabby Mendy's worker she offered a smug smile before sliding past the round and doughy boy. \"Now why don't we get started?\"</span></div></div>",

Curse this damn Fem-Bulk! He didn't even like Chinese food all that much, but right now all he could think of was grabbing it out of Ashley's hands and greedily tearing into it.<br>\r\nHe had- for now, at least- enough restraint to try and stick to the plan. He waddled behind the counter, adjusting his pants again,which were biting mercilessly into his flabby flanks and giving him a very serious case of muffin top. He had neglected weighing himself for some time now (after all, the tightness of his clothing every so often told him everything he needed to know about his weight: it was steadily rising, and that was before he had infected his body with the more potent variety of FemBulk) but had he done so, he would struggle to see past his breasts and belly at a number around 280 pounds. With so little muscle on a frame that didn't even begin to cross six feet, he was clearly quite fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you have some bigger clothes in there?\" Isaac asked, making small talk as he prepared a drink for himself and Ashley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep,\" Ashley said simply, looking over every wobble and jiggle his flabby body produced, \"After I broke up with you... well... I won't get into the details, but- well, I got even heavier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" Isaac said, popping an Oreo into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" she reiterated, \"Let's just say i got with someone... conducive... to weight gain. I topped out over 300 pounds. I think I hit 330 at my heaviest, I was HUGE.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet,\" Isaac said with a smirk, seemingly unaware of the fact that he would hit and eventually bury that mark sooner or later, \"How about a drink?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley looked at Isaac's two outstretched hands, chubby digits gripping a drink in each hand and held up her water bottle in response.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trying to avoid the calories\" she said, taking a swig of her water, \"I don't want to blow up again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac frowned.

He was sure Ashley would eventually eat something, he knew how weak willed she was back when they ate. Grabbing ahold of the Oreos he walks over towards the table, sitting his wide behind down on the struggling seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, a few treats won't kill you.\" Isaac gets out, grabbing ahold of some sweet and sour chicken as he began shoving it into his mouth. \"Stop being so paranoid.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley simply smiles at Isaac as she grabs one of the boxes herself, slowly eating slowly. \"I wouldn't want you to go without, you always appear as if you're starving after all. You need all those sweets to keep that figure after all.\" A faint laugh escapes her as she continues with her meal, glancing back behind her towards the area filled with sweets. Isaac had a grasp on what her favorites were, but most of it appeared to be what he enjoyed most. A true fat girl's mindset was on display, which caused her no end of enjoyment. This was going to be easy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isaac-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching out she takes ahold of an oreo and tries to set it on Isaac's sauce covered lips. \"You really have no control over yourself, do you?

Another! Isaac wasn't sure if he was more frustrated by her apparent unwillingness to listen to more than a few of his words at a time, or the fact that he was powerless to resist any sweet she brought to his mouth. For her own amusement, Ashley tested the pathetic lardass she had sitting before her. Instead of forcing the cookies into his mouth, she began to hold them about half an inch out. He was happy to cover the distance, leaning slightly forward to take between chubby lips the cookies and treats that were meant to be settling on his feeder's hips, not his!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley proceeded with morbid fascination. Even when she had tipped scales at 350 pounds (she had lied to Isaac before, and she didn't know why. What did she have to be embarrassed about now, given the state of affairs?) she hadn't exhibited behavioir quite like this. Isaac had all the telltale signs of a compulsive eater and the bottomless pit of a stomach of a competitive one. Crumbs fell between his breasts, into his ample cleavage, and she saw his hands dig between them to fish them out and lay them on his tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac had stopped trying to speak and get her to eat something between every cookie. Soon, it was every other cookie- eventually a stream of treats flowed into him, bringing calories galore without so much as a \"try one\" escaping his lips. In his greedy stupor he almost didn't want to share.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, even he had a breaking point. The speed of his eating was winding down.

Upon it, she realized there was a tray with a single brownie left, triple fudge. She had doubts on if Isaac had remembered her favorite treat or not, but with him, all stuffed and her having nothing but a healthy meal decided to treat herself. Taking hold of it she then marches her slender legs off towards Isaac, holding the brownie up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the treats Isaac, but you didn't have to hog them all to yourself... Couldn't help yourself, I know.\" Her lips twist as she brings the brownie up. \"I used to be fed these by the pan, now you make these by the pan for yourself.\" Bringing it up to her mouth she takes just a single bite, her eyes widening from the taste. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the single most delicious brownie she had ever tasted, one that had blown away every other treat she had been fed before herself. Her taste buds were on fire, and almost automatically she began to chow down on the rest of the sweet treat. Just a few more bites and it was all gone, Ashley licking her fingers to get every last bit left, a faint laugh escaping her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll say this Isaac, maybe you bloating up like this has helped your cooking. Never knew you becoming such a wide load would help with help with your cooking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac groans out, his overly stuffed body shaking as he tried to lift himself from his chair. \"Come on Ashley, I just wanted you to enjoy some treats...\" The man knew he had to keep it cool, could not show how gleeful he was by her finally taking a bite. He may have ingested more Fem Bulk then could be fixed, but he had snared her all the same. Even if he had eaten far more then he needed, his sweats feeling tight on his bloated behind, his shirt riding up his expanded belly and his waistband digging further into his muffin top he had gotten what he wanted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley smirks as she gestures towards the box of clothing. \"Enjoy the clothing, I should be getting back. Wouldn't mind having another get together sometime, this was a lot of fun Isaac.\" Winking the girl began sauntering out of the apartment. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While Isaac didn't like working in fast food service, it did have its perks. Really, for him, it was just one perk: he could basically eat as much as he wanted. While he would get the occasional look from his co-workers for always dipping into the fries or making himself a shake every other hour or so, no one complained as long as he got the job done. While FemBulk had sapped him of his desire to improve himself, it hadn't made him stupid: he had more than enough brains to take care of business. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had been moved to the drive thru a couple of shifts ago. He wasn't aware of why, but management had decided that having such a portly person working the register might dissuade customers from buying more food and get them to think twice about eating at McChubbies. So, the effeminate, lard assed employee had been pushed to the back, where customers would only realize how much of a fatty was serving them when Isaac leaned out the window to give them their orders, his belly bobbing up and down and his breasts swinging too and fro. Still, he liked working the drive thru because it put him closer to the fries, which meant he didn't have to waddle his fat ass across the restaurant to stuff his ever fattening face. The only complaint he had recieved was actually from his boss, who had to deal with Isaac's ordering new uniforms a size up more often than any employee he had ever had. Still, this was more of a jab at his weight than a legitimate complaint, seeing as the uniforms came out of Isaac's paycheck when he needed to go a size up. The way he was eating for free, he figured it more than made up for it. He had been growing particularly quickly of late, that much he knew. He had put on ten pounds since he had last seen Ashley, at least. Still, the clothes she had brought him was fitting, so at least he had that going for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac took a long sip of the creamy shake he had prepared himself as he came into work and turned his headset on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to McChubbies, how can I help you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, ma'm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac sighed. This latest influx of FemBulk had changed him in more ways than one. The timbre of his voice had moved up slightly- not an insane amount, mind you- but enough for people to confuse his voice for that of a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis shift continued, his pants grew tighter as he shoved food in his mouth, and just before closing time, something incredible happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was still working the drive thru when a familiar voice spoke from the other end of the device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have a large number 4, extra cheese and bacon, and a chocolate shake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ash?\" Isaac asked, mid-fry, \"It's Isaac!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, she pulled up to Isaac's window, where he leaned out to say hello to her. She looked ever so puffy in the face, but she wore loose clothing. He wished desperately to see how she looked underneath, but the fact that she was here, ordering what she did, was a good sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You doing alright?\" He asked, handing her her milkshake, \"you seem off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine,\" she lied, \"Just having a bit of a- let's say, diet relapse?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac smirked, dropping an extra order of fries in her bag, \"Well, fitness is a journey. You should come around more often, I can definitely get you some free stuff!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really shouldn't be eating this, but sure, I'll swing by and say hello soon.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey said their goodbyes and Isaac saw her drive off, reaching into her bag for fries.</span></div></div>",

As the month went on the FemBulk wreaked havoc on his already war torn body. While the massive cravings and even further damage to his metabolism had been wrought, the biggest changes were the hormones. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeyond just the softer voice his face had also softened, beyond just fatter his features appeared almost delicate but still obviously him. His hair has grown softer and also grown longer, the lazy overeater not bothering to get it cut. His ass had expanded even further, sitting so far out as to make a shelf. More then once has he managed to turn around, a co-worker setting a drink on it only for it to fly off from the motion of the jiggle and spraying on the floor, just for his manager to shout at him to clean it up. His thunder thighs constantly chafed from the constant smacking from the fat, along with making every step he takes a pain in his overgrown rear end.  His breasts had grown tender, leaving him wincing whenever his shirts got too tight. Complaining about them to Ashley she had offered him a few of her bras, which he begrudgingly decided to try on, giving him some comfort even if the fit was off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of Ashley since that day at the drive-thru he has been seeing her more and more often. Whether it was from her feeling thin compared to the lazy girly fat boy he had become or simply because she enjoyed taking advantage of his cooking he could not say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven now they were having their thrice weekly lunch, Ashley sipping on a Fem Bulk tainted milkshake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This milkshake is just the best... I've tried other Mendy's trying to get them but when you make them they just taste soooo much better.\" Ashley slurps on her straw, eyes closed as she simply intakes the fattening treat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnderneath Isaac's flabby hands Ashley has found herself puffing up once again. While nowhere near Isaac she had been steadily gaining since that first taste of FemBulk, along with the other pinches Isaac has been shifting into her meals. The slender features were becoming chubby, a soft double chin now bridging itself out. Her belly began to shift upwards, making a soft layer of flab that cut into her too tight pants. Her arms had become doughy, soft thighs and her ass appeared to be a magnet for the gain. Isaac ruefully noted that her breasts were also taking on more weight than when she was this fat before, which the FemBulk's motto of adding the weight to the right places just slapped itself down hard on this chunky girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad you enjoy it... One of the perks of the job, you can mess with the mix when you're making them for yourself. How about I go get you another one.\" Isaac hefts himself up from his seat, his gigantic ass shaking to and fro as he makes his way behind the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you don't have to...\" Ashley barely gets out, going back to slurping on her shake. It appeared the more she ate the quicker she was to accept the changes. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Isaac squeezed past one of his fellow employees into the kitchen. While he had certainly put a good deal of Fem Bulk into his system, he was starting to even things out more and more. He felt his body had been very receptive to the powder when he had first taken Fem Bulk, but Ashley's was definitely taking to it much more easily. This was likely due to the fact that she had already been heavy once before, and the fact that she, as a woman, was the intended consumer of the product.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac had brought a full vial of Fem Bulk with him to work today in his lunch bag. It was funny that no one questioned the fact that he brought lunch to work and never ate anything other than the fast food McChubbies provided. He pulled down on his McChubbies polo, which was growing rather restrictive. The fact that he had been asked to button two of the three buttons on the polo because his image was \"distracting\" had been insulting, but he complied. After all, he needed this job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis shirt rode up his fattened back, revealing soft, pale flesh as he leaned over to carefully pour Fem Bulk into Ashley's shake. As he did so, one of his co-workers raced by behind him with an order, shoving him slightly as his ass had basically become a traffic jam of its own in the relatively narrow passaged of the McChubbies kitchen. The coworker's inadvertent shove caused him to nearly lose his grip on the bottle, all of its contents pouring into Ashley's shake. Isaac bit his plump lip cutely. This shake definitely had more of the concentrated product than any single thing he or Ashley had ever ingested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe even considered dumping it, but decided against it as he placed a lid on the container and stirred it a little more with a straw. As he made a beeline toward Ashley, his boss blocked his path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is that for?\" His boss asked, crossing his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac held the shake with two hands right in front of his bountiful breasts and responded meekly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My friend Ashley...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look,\" his boss began, \"we're already feeding your fat ass, and that's fine because you're an employee, but we can't afford to feed all of your fat friends too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac nodded sheepishly, \"I- already made her this shake...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you drink it,\" the boss said, tapping his foot, \"I have no issue with one of my employees eating what they will when they work here, but I'm not running a charity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac eyed the Fem Bulk laden concoction with wide eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm not hungry...\" he said, \"I'll just toss this one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leaned toward the trashcan but his manager stopped him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bullshit,\" said his manager, poking the two inches of exposed belly he was sporting in his tight uniform, \"You have like three shakes a shift, you drink THAT one NOW. If you toss it, it's your job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac's heart raced the way it usually only did when he had to go up 5 steps or when he saw there was a sale on ice cream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really shouldn't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're picking now- when your job is on the line- to want to manage your weight? Drink it. Now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis manager did not budge, and Isaac brought the straw to his pudgy mouth, then wrapped his plump lips around it and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was love at first slurp. He hadn't had Fem Bulk in at least a month (of course, it was still running through his system in massive quantities) , but it was as if he had never stopped. His manager seemed pleased with himself as Isaac slurped the sweet, spiked shake greedily. His lips did not lose hold of the straw as he inhaled and exhaled laboriously through his nose to never have to stop drinking. When the straw proved more of a hindrance than an aid, he nearly ripped off the lid (which by his current fitness standards, almost qualified as a feat of strength) and tilted the cup back, one hand on his soft, churning belly as he chugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he finished the shake, he dropped the cup right on the ground with a burp and ripped two bags of food from a coworker's hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?\" They asked angrily as Isaac set the bags down and tore into their contents. Isaac used his massive rear to bump his thin coworker about a foot away so he could keep eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?\" They asked again, then demanded \"Stop that, that's for the customer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmf\" Isaac was eating with both hands his shirt again having ridden up to reveal plump, juicy flesh around his lower back, but he could hardly care right now, \"Fuck off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis coworker walked away, annoyed and confused. Isaac barely registered that they weren't there anymore. When he finished the contents of the bag, he brushed them aside and looked for more.<br>\r\nThere was a fresh batch of fries ready for collection, and Isaac went right over, leaning slightly over the counter, his belly resting and spreading as he did so to position himself for the fries. One button popped off his polo as he ate handfuls of fries with both hands, but this too didn't seem to register with him. As more fries were jammed into his mouth, he was forced to lean more onto the table to reach. His jiggly bingo wings wobbled and shook as one hand stuffed food into his mouth while the other grabbed more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis ass and thighs, pressed against the counter, caused the seams to pop on his pants. With every handful, it seemed another stitch decided it had seen enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving polished off enough fries to feed countless customers, Isaac dropped to the floor on his wide, plush cushion of an ass, a massive jiggle of lard running up and back down his body like an adipose shockwave. The top remaining button on his shirt flew, as did the button on his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis boss looked down at him, mouth agape, and could only muster a simple phrase \"you're fired.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac rubbed his simultaneously taut and soft belly with two hands, feeling tears coming on. Another side effect of Fem Bulk: increased emotionality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you guys help me up?\"</span></div></div>",

While he had hated the people he worked with, the tasks he was set with and his manager who continued making snide remarks about his weight it was what kept food on the table, along with all that snacking at work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat along with the rather pitiful state the FemBulk had left his body in making him more than a little panicky about trying to get another one. Since he ingested that shake his body had done nothing but bloat even further, his body becoming more girly than ever before. Luckily he had plenty of extra clothes to grow into, Ashley's fat girl's clothes had plenty of extra sizes to keep him from running around naked. Even so, it felt as if he was expanding even faster, repeated usage of the FemBulk appeared to just get stronger the more he fought against it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what to do Ashley!\" Isaac cries out, stuffing a full brownie into his mouth and slurping it down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have an idea... Doubt you'd be up for it but with that fat ass-\" Ashley's eyes roam over Isaac's hindquarters that spilled off either side of his comically small appearing chair. \"You'd make a killing with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, I am up for anything at this point... I need a new job and I need it fast.\" He remarks, eyeing Ashley. She appeared to be bloating up even further, not far from around the time he was ready to shove her off from before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n*Three Months Later*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac was sitting in front of a little stand he had recently bought, pursing his plump lips and carefully applying lipstick. Beyond that, his glued on long eyelashes, rouged cheeks, and heavily powdered face did little to hide the overwhelming circle of fat that encased his once masculine face. His hair was professionally styled, something that Ashley had talked him into to the bereft of his wallet. It was cut at his shoulders, conditioned and obviously girly. Smacking his chubby and pink lips together he then stands up and checks out his skimpy little outfit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bright pink tube top displayed his bulky shoulders, revealing his now hairless arms and chest, and what a chest it was! The cleavage he now supported would have made most of the girl's he went to school with jealous, large and bouncy the only thing supporting his amble and breasts was this increasingly tight top. Gently he adjusts his breasts, wincing at the sensitivity. Below that was where the girls would stop being jealous at, which was his large and expansive belly. He felt it slip out slightly from the top with every swaying movement he could make, a large bag of fat that rested further down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around he began to mess with his spandex short shorts, wincing at the thong panties riding up his great valley of cheeks. While his bust was certainly impressive, all thanks to FemBulk his ass just took the cake, and the brownies, burgers and anything else he ate just continued to stick to it. It was one of the largest asses he had ever seen, and with a slap, he felt the attack of jiggles vibrating all throughout the offended cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gaining had slowed down recently, but that extra thirty pounds had hit him like a ton of bricks over the past months, which was not helped at all by his new job. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still don't see how people want to watch this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting his feet into his wedges he waddles his way out towards his living room, or at least what used to be his living room. Now it was where he had set up his camera, along with a tall table filled with food that would not block the view of him as he was to eat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi all of you out there today! Ilsa is here, and I've been listening to all your precious feedback!\" Isaac's voice rose several octaves, the FemBulk had played with his voice but the practice was the only thing that could help him sound like a perky bimbo. \"That's why I've invited a very important friend for today's session! Everyone, welcome Ample Ashley! Another streamer, make sure to send her a follow ya'll, I set her link in the description for today's stream!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley walks into view and she hardly even looked like the same person. Gone was that flat stomach, now replaced by a large dome of womanly fat. Her breasts were even larger than his own, outpacing the rest of her body by some margin. Her face had been eclipsed by fat, giving her a very moon shaped face, along with large and ham shaped upper arms that appeared to shake from the slight motion. Her ass had also taken its paces, trying to make it's way from her behind at an incredible speed, not that it held a candle to his own. She appeared well on her way to making it back to her former max weight, but Isaac doubted she would be there for long. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face was heavily made up not unlike his own, with her dressed in a pair of nearly bursting cut off jeans and a t-shirt riding up his belly with a cute pig set atop of it. Waddling over towards Isaac it was obvious he was still far larger than her, but now she was the only borrowing clothes from him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi everyone! I'm here today for us to play a game, Ilsa here has set all this food here just for the two of us, but it's up to you guys on who gets it shoved into their greedy mouth! Now how this works is a dollar donation with the titled Ilsa makes her force it into her mouth, but if you send a five dollar donation with the title Ilsa then I'll be shoving it into his mouth myself, making sure it gets all into Ilsa's pretty little face! Why don't we get started!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac shudders as he looks at the first donation, Ashley flashing him a bright smile before shoving the first cupcake into his mouth. FemBulk had certainly had a drastic change in his life. He had plans on going to college, making out with hot babes and getting a comfy job where he did not have to try that hard. Now he was a girly looking lard ass who fed himself on camera for cash. Who knew that getting another girl's mail could change his life this much, let alone that girl who tried to get into contact with him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky wanted to do a collaboration once he surpassed her in followers. </span></div></div>",

He tried to ignore it, but that was getting harder, with Max making lewd comments now. He was now indistinguishable from a woman save his small junk. Even his voice had lowered, with everyone he talked to by phone assuming he was a she.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only good news he had was that weight gain was slowing, but considering this was only leaving him obese this was cold comfort.</span></div></div>",

There was a certain quality to this, it wasn\u2019t just some cheap mask and there were no manufacturers markings to identify it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he noticed he had dropped a folded piece of parchment on the ground.  Picking it up revealed it to be a set of instructions.  It was the called an Infallible Woman\u2019s Disguise.  If you touched the mask to the skin of a woman it would use her form as a mold to the you transform you into an exact twin.  There were drawings of someone putting on the mask and it spreading across their face and over their body turning them into a woman, then prying the mask off and returning to normal.<br>\r\nWeird... Isaac thought.  Only one way to find out though.  He stashed it into his pocket and headed to the mall.  That might be crowded and busy enough to get close to somebody and touch them with the mask undetected.  This proved a little more awkward than he thought.  He walked close to people pretending to looking at clothes at the department store but they would move away as soon as he got close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally he spotted a mother pushing a stroller distracted by her other toddler throwing hangers around.

She didn\u2019t notice.  He grabbed a random pair of pants off a rack and went into a changing room locking the door behind him.  Isaac looked at the mask and gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was no longer pink but now looked like human skin.  It was still small and oval like it was before but there was a woman\u2019s nose, and a pair of brown eyes staring blankly ahead behind long eyelashes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes he try it on now or go home first?</span></div></div>",

Then his vision began to blur and eventually he was able to focus again and he could see his reflection in the mirror.  When he blinked he noticed the mask blink as well like it had already become part of his face.  It was so bizarre.   Then he watched it spread.  It felt like someone was wrapping rubber around his face but after it changed it then felt normal like his own skin.  His cheeks softened and his hair grew long over his shoulders.  His arms began to thicken and his chest started sprouting breasts.  The buttons popped on his shirt revealing his cleavage and he let out a surprised yelp but it was in a female voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis belly rounded out making his shirt taunt but the buttons stayed in tact.  He could feel his pants getting tighter as his hips widened and he felt himself shrink a few inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://78.media.tumblr.com/34ac76de35ff0acf980b51f975aa49ad/tumblr_p4u9xciHhr1varq9ho1_500.png\" target=\"_blank\">https://78.media.tumblr.com/34ac76de35ff...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he finished transforming he looked at his reflection in amazement.  It was liked he was looking at a complete stranger but it was him staring back.  He lifted his breasts up and let them drop with a bounce, then he turned around to give his new booty a quick shake.  As soon as he bent over his pants could not handle the stress any further and ripped from the thigh up the back with a loud tearing sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops.\"  Isaac said in his unfamiliar female voice.  He then looked really close at his reflection trying to see the outline of the mask but there was none.  As his breath fogged the mirror he felt a slight sense of panic at the idea of being stuck like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took  one of his long fingernails and dragged it along his skin down his forehead and to his relief his fingernail caught a flap of skin.  He peeled it off.  Underneath he looked exactly the same but slowly his body began to deflate and his hair shrunk until he was back to normal.  This was amazing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Isaac noticed his shredded pants hung very loosely off his normal skinny body and now his boxers were saggy and misshapen from being stretched by his growing ass.  If he walked out in those it would be public indecency.  He could wear the sweat pants he happened to grab out but how was he supposed to pay for it if he was wearing them?  There was a security tag on them so the store would beep if he tried walking out in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wished he transformed without his clothes on.  Now what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe puts on the pants and places the mask back on.</span></div></div>",

Girls showed their cleavage all of the time so he didn't think it should be a problem that he couldn't button his shirt over his bust.  If somebody doesn't like it then they should look, he wasn't supposed to stare at cleavage after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac took a deep breath and stepped out of the dressing room compartment.  There was a little boy standing next to a stroller holding two broken hangers that suddenly stared at you very suspiciously.  It must have been the son of the woman he is impersonating.  She is in the compartment next to yours.  Isaac leaned over and told the little boy.  \"I am not your mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy's eyes widened in surprise and Isaac walked away laughing.  He kind of did a strut through the store up to the register flipping his hair over his shoulder.  It was fun being a woman.  He got in line and the old lady in front of him turns around and sees his buttoned shirt barely containing his boobs and she gave him a dirty look.  Isaac winked at her.  When it was his turn to pay the lady at the counter said \"How can I help you mam?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I just wanted to purchase these pants.\"  He said.  He swung his hips up so that the item tag would hang over the counter and the machine *BEEP*ed as he went ahead and scanned the barcode.  The cashier rolled her eyes.  \"You are not supposed to be wearing these before you leave the store I can't check you out like this.\"  She told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not I like these pants so much and I didn't want to keep my old pair anyways.\"  Isaac swung his stubby little chubby leg up onto the counter to reveal the anti-left tag at the ankle of the pants.  \"Look all you have to do is remove this tag and I'll pay and be on my way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cashier gave him a dirty look. \"I'm really not supposed to do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleaase.\"  Isaac said in his most adorable voice and he fluttered his eyelashes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes the lady let him buy the pants or does she refuse?</span></div></div>",

Isaac grumbled under his breath. and left the counter.  The cashier must be having a bad day or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe headed back towards the changing room and thought about his situation.  He could always leave the store even though he didn't want to steal.  There wasn't any security guards that he could see and since he was in disguise he didn't have to worry about security cameras either.  He could wear his old shredded pants but the lady might refuse him service for not wearing pants since they were indecent. There was one other option however...  He looked over at the dressing room entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was still the woman he is impersonating.  She wore a pair of pants that would fit him perfectly since he was her now.  If she was still in the changing room he might be able to swipe them from under the changing room door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked that direction still trying to make up his mind.</span></div></div>",

He planned on stealing her pants so he could leave the store.  Thankfully the stroller was still sitting outside of her closed changing room door.  She must have a lot of clothes to try on.  The toddler saw Isaac and his eyes grew wide with fear and he hid behind the stroller.  He bumped the stroller and the woman's purse fell off it.  A small round container of makeup rolled out of the purse and under the dressing room door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Stop playing in my purse.\"</i>  a  muffled voice said.  Isaac spotted a soft hand appear underneath the door.  <i>\"Give it to me.\" </i> The woman said expectantly.  Isaac looked at his own chubby fingers which were identical to that hand and smiled.  The boy peered behind the stroller at him.  Isaac held his arms up and said<b> \"Boo!\"</b>  and hurried off into the woman's section.  Isaac laughed.  The hand retreated into the changing room.  <i>\"Is someone out there?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac huffed and bent over and reached under the changing room door and swiped her pants.  He changed right there on the spot, picked up the purse and walked out of the store into the mall.  He wasn't expecting to find a purse as well but this would be very helpful for his woman's disguise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked through the store grinning and swinging his purse.  His boobs were bouncing uncontrollably.  He wished he would have grabbed a bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then..</span></div></div>",

He pulled out what appeared to be an elastic skin, like some sort of full body costume that someone would wear. Upon closer inspection, he could see that it was actually a girl's costume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's no surprise,\" he said to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were more strange things within the box. Below the skin was a large set of silicon objects. Upon taking them out, Isaac realized that they were actually padding similar to that of a fat suit, specifically for a slightly overweight by busty woman. Below that was a red, long haired wig and a bottle of scarlet pills with the label \"Voice Compressors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac was about to question what all these things were meant for until he found a piece of paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Disguise Kit: Model BBR3. This full body disguise will allow the user to completely assume the identity of the depicted female no matter their gender. Damn damn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl in the picture on the parchment wasn't exactly thin, but she was pretty attractive even by Isaac's standards. She was definitely on the thick side, with very large breasts, well into the E cup range. Her hips were fairly wide and she had some fat on her belly, but all of it gave off a pear-shaped appearance. She was also a redhead and wearing the same clothes that came in the box.

How the hell does this disguise work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReading below, Isaac found a detailed set of instructions. At a glance, the process basically involved wearing the padding, slipping into the elastic suit, applying makeup, wearing the wig, and eating one of the pills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weird,\" Isaac scratched the back of his head, bot sure what to do with this package. He had very little desire to use it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac...</span></div></div>",

Why not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then collected the package and all its contents to bring it to his bedroom. When that was done, he proceeded to take off his pajamas in preparation for wearing the disguise's padding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I gotta figure out how to put all this stuff on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, the paper came with instructions and numbers on which pieces to put on where. Isaac set to work, starting with the leg parts first.  The silicon padding snapped into place, creating new weight on his calves and thighs. Things get even stranger when Isaac attached the butt of the costume. Only now did he realize just how huge the girl in the picture was as his new, fake ass took up much of his view when he turned around. It even jiggled like a real rump as he walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is too weird...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Isaac kept at wearing the disguise, now curious to see how far he could go to make it look convincing. Next was the belly padding, which was more like a tire around his waist. There was a little bit of arm padding for the chubby biceps and forearms. Then it was the part Isaac was secretly most excited for, the breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile his new hips had granted him an impressive amount of width, they paled in comparison to just how large the silicon boobs were. Isaac could barely fit them into his hands as he cupped them and slipped them over his own chest. They sagged just like real ones and Isaac felt his center of gravity shift upon the arrival of his new assets. They merely looked like blobs of plastic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last addition was a small neck brace which would serve as the little bit of fat on his new face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac looked over himself in the mirror and laughed. \"This looks ridiculous, though I suppose it's only the padding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext up was the skin. As Isaac grabbed it, he noticed that it had a much more realistic texture than he first thought it did. Though it could stretch a lot, it was softer than elastic. Isaac found himself uncomfortable, as if he was petting real girl's skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ridiculous,\" he muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe soon discovered that the only openings were through the mouth, butt, and vagina of the suit respectively. Not wanting to be gross, he settled on the mouth. Stretching it open to bizarre proportions, Isaac had to steady himself as he entered the skin one foot at a time. It was almost like it was vacuum tight and it took considerable effort to work the suit up his body. He felt himself and the padding getting compressed together into the shape of the woman in the picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to wiggle his toes around to slip into the feet of the skin. But the hardest challenge was fitting it over the silicon breasts. Isaac had to hold his breath to finally pull it up to his chin. The skin continued to crush the padding down to the pear shape body of the woman and Isaac felt cramped inside of the suit. With all his strength, he dragged the mask of the suit over his own face, popping it into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac turned to the mirror and was impressed with what he saw. \"Not bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rough edges of the suit had been evened out besides some clear uneven features on his face, below the neck he looked completely like a girl. He reasoned he would fix his face when he got to the makeup, but he did like the look of the giant breasts taking up most of his field of vision. Fondling them, he discovered that they looked very realistic and had the same weight as real boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad at all,\" he smiled as he finished playing with himself. \"Though I don't like the bald look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, the red wig fixed that problem right up. There was even some glue adhesive to ensure that the hair would not fall off. While Isaac adjusted the hair, he also took the time to fix up the mask of the suit with some makeup that was included in the package. A little cover up and some lip stick went a long way to enhance the illusion. When he was finished, he couldn't believe that the person staring at him in the bedroom mirror was him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah,\" he said, reaching up and touching the suit's face. \"This is very convincing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went through the clothing and started to get dressed. The bra proved difficult to slip on his first time, but it was nice to have some support for his new breasts. Even the panties were a nice fit with his manhood crushed beneath the padding. With the underwear settled, Isaac pulled up the stockings over the suit's plush legs and donned the dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt amazed Isaac how nicely everything fit him at this size. Nothing was too tight or too small. It was almost as if someone can taken his measurement into account when designing the disguise. Isaac finished up by putting on the black jacket and lacing up the shoes that came with it, again all the right size. He wore the black cat necklace that came with the package last. (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://56.media.tumblr.com/eb0deddd2247c77af0a81c04f0a6d52a/tumblr_n2undvdZyt1qzibl9o1_500.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://56.media.tumblr.com/eb0deddd2247c...</a>)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy crap,\" he said, almost jumping at his own reflection thinking it was another person. \"I look exactly like her in the picture!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only thing that was missing from the illusion was his voice. Isaac reached for the bottle, the last item in the box, and read the instructions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Voice compressors. Take one pill for a higher pitched voice. Do not exceed six pills or risk permanent damage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCuriously, Isaac undid the pill top and dropped one of the red, marble-like pills into his calm. He swallowed whole as a taste of cherry filled his throat followed by a slight tingle that made him cough. Then it started to burn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the?\" said Isaac as he noticed his voice had gotten much higher. \"Is that my voice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe now sounded nothing like the gruff tone he was used to. Instead, he had a lighthearted, almost bubbly, tone that was unmistakably female. Isaac smiled at his reflection, now a completely different person to the young man standing there just a few minutes ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Isaac,\" he moaned, finding that he could mimic a woman's seductive whispers perfectly. \"I want you to fuck me. I want you bad. So bad...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tightening underneath the padding suggested that he was turning himself on with his own voice. Running his hands over every new curve of his new body, Isaac determined that this was the perfect disguise. No one could recognize him like this. Not even his own mother. He had to get used to how certain parts of his body were sticking out now, but he was rather enjoying himself. It was fun to be someone else for a change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac was about to enjoy himself when the doorbell to his apartment rang. Without thinking, he answered it. It was...</span></div></div>",

In his stupidity, Isaac almost greeted her until he realized that he was still wearing the disguise. It must have been so comfortable that he didn't even notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hello?\" he said, praying that his earlier assertion would hold true and that not even his own family would recognize him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm sorry. I must have the wrong dorm room. Do you know where Isaac Abbey lives? He said it was room 117.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding it would be best not to lie about his room for future complications, Isaac came up with the best possible response he could think of. \"This is his room.

Do you happen to know if he got a package?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-Package? I don't know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis sister eyed him with suspicion and suddenly the padding underneath the suit was overheating him. Grace was a tall girl, even taller than Isaac. As such, she was staring down at him. Grace was a pretty normal, attractive girl with blonde hair and a cute face. But it was because she so was tall that she had trouble getting a boyfriend, as most of the men she dated eventually felt inferior to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you say your name was again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac blurted out the first thing that came to his mind. \"Isabel!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace thought for a minute and said. \"Isabel, huh?

Isaac didn't want to have to explain himself to his sister right away like that when he hadn't even considered why he had gone through wearing this disguise in the first place. Isaac was also curious about what package Grace had mentioned and if it had to do with this disguise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" said Grace, sighing as she spoke. \"If he's sleeping I'll just come back later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, wait,\" Isaac stopped her before she could leave. \"What sort of package was he supposed to get? I can keep an eye out for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you don't have to do that. It's just some inheritance from an old relative that we know nothing about. It's supposed to be junk, according to mom. So, it's nothing too valuable. I just wanted to see what Isaac got.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Junk, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep! Anyway, I have some errands tor run.

Underneath the suit, he could feel himself blushing down to his navel. One thing was for sure though, this disguise was legit. It could even fool his sister into thinking this \"Isabel\" was his girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed as he collapsed on his bed, next to the package. \"So, this is from some relative, huh? I wonder why they gave it to me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides the instructions, there was no note. Isaac's thoughts returned to the note that he had received the other day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, whoever they are, they're into some weird shit,\" said Isaac as he returned to fondling himself. \"This is scarily realistic. I can go around as an entirely different person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had the thought to go around as this Isabel character and see how different people reacted to him, but Isaac remembered that Grace wanted to speak to the real him at some point. He had at least an hour before the voice pill had worn off, so there was some spare time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac decided to...</span></div></div>",

He went to school in a relatively small college, but it was homely and everyone knew everyone else. This would prove to be a little bit of a challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac made his way towards the main buildings where he usually had his classes. While he was on break for the rest of the day, a new block was about to begin and other students were scrambling to make it to their lecture halls in time. Isaac recognized more than a few of his friends pass him. They would have usually called out to him if they had seen him and it took a little self effort to prevent himself from doing so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not Isaac,\" he whispered to himself. \"You're Isabel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe disguise was holding up incredibly well and still never failed to impress Isaac with its realism. His padded thighs and breasts wobbled around with every step he took, and he had to stop himself from holding down them down in public. This was probably what girls this size had to deal with every day. Isaac was certainly getting some stares from a few boys, who even stopped to check him out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe this was a bad idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac froze.

Despite Isaac being on the tall side of over six feet, this lady towered over him completely. It was actually somewhat awkward seeing someone so large and big out in public. She was much older than Isaac, probably in her early fifties. But every part of her body was youthful and perky. Isaac had to avert his eyes from her impressive cleavage. She seemed to notice this regardless and smiled coyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems you've been enjoying yourself, 'girl.' Come. Let us talk somewhere in private.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac gulped and followed the giant woman as to not make a scene in the middle of his school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was leading him into one of his classrooms, which was completely empty this period. As she shut the door, she dispensed all pleasantness and scowled at Isaac.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly, you men are all alike. You get a new toy and the first thing you do is try it out. Not that I can blame you. mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What are you talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come now, boy. Don't play dumb. Who do you think sent you the disguise?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You? You sent me this costume? B-But I thought it was an inheritance...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is. I'm your great, great aunt, on your mother's side.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I didn't know I had a great aunt...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you do, kid. Isaac was your name, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac glared at the woman claiming to be his family. \"You mean you don't even know my name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Do you know mine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't even know I had a great aunt until just now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get all huffy,\" his aunt folded her arms and sighed at him. \"I'm your great aunt Maggie, known scientist and dealer of out of the ordinary. So, it comes as no surprise, I suppose, that your mother never mentioned, if she even knew I existed. The family tends to keep me out of the loop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't imagine why.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like you've inherited my smart tongue, at least. Anyway, Isaac. Seeing as you've already gone through my gift to you, it will spare me some time in explaining to you what it is.

After calling his sister and lying to her about the gift from his Great Aunt, he leaned back on his computer. The suit and the padding were laid out upon the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weird day,\" he said, sighing as he browsed the internet. He was looking for any scientific articles about his supposed Great Aunt. His searches were coming up with nothing. \"I suppose I could always ask mom about it, but that might give things away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe groaned.

Hold very still.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroaning, Isaac did what was commanded, not sure what to expect.

Standing over him was his Aunt Maggie, but she was inside some underground cave of sorts. Isaac noticed that there were metal bars all along the wall, like they were in some secret base. Maggie helped him to his feet as he adjusted himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-Where are we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My laboratory, of course! I teleported you here using your phone and some coordinate guessing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't like the sound of that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hush. It's perfectly safe, Isaac. Anyway, while you're here, let's get to testing the powder. Here, give me the clothes that came with the disguise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac looked around for the outfit and found it by his side. He handed Maggie the dress and underwear that came with the suit as she ignored the padding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can throw those things away. We won't need them anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then led Isaac to the back of the chambers. There was a surprisingly normal looking washing machine and drier there, in comparison to all the other high tech devices around the lab. Without care, Maggie threw the outfit into the wash and held up a securely contained urn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See this? This a nanite infused powder that will mix in with any clothing. Upon doing so, they will analysis the body shape the clothing will fit and remember it. When a wearer then puts on the afflicted outfit, the little robots will mutate them on a genetic level to match the structure of the clothes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...In English?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you were going to college, boy.

Why you cheeky brat...I'll show you so what!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout thought, she began to tear off her own clothing causing Isaac to turn away in disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, come on now! I don't want to see that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut it, brat. Take a look now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened his eyes to see that his aunt was now at eye level with him. In fact, she looked a little slimmer in some areas while still being a big woman. The outfit, which should have been too small for her, fit on her perfectly. She was the exact shape and size Isaac was when he had put on the disguise, though she still had the same face and hairstyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah...What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you not been paying attention to what I said? Now anyone who wears these clothes will take this shape!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool...Will it work on other clothes too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie put a hand to her face. \"I am beginning to regret my choice of apprentice. Now take this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe handed him the container of powder. Isaac could smell the artificial cherry flavor just by holding it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want me to do with it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple! You're going to experiment with it! Using that suit and wig I gave you, you can now don whatever clothes you want now. I want to see what sort of ideas you can come up with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want me to wear girl clothes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't seem to have a problem wearing the disguise earlier.

He grumbled to himself as he sat back at his computer to continue vegging off, trying to forget the encounter with his crazy aunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch me closely, my ass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, he reasoned that a woman who could teleport him at will wasn't to be trifled with and he was genuinely curious about the powder. He thought about how he could acquire some girl's clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe supposed he could always go shopping at the mall for some basic outfits, though that could be expensive. There was also the opportunity to borrow some clothes from his family, namely his mother and sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat would he choose to do today?</span></div></div>",

Isaac had picked a college only a half an hour away from his parents, meaning visits home were frequent enough to not be uncommon. Isaac had brought his backpack with him, claiming that he had some homework to do while visiting. In reality, he had hidden away the suit and laundry powder for secret use. He would spend the night, do some laundry, and finish Aunt Maggie's task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Isaac,\" his sister Grace began. \"You have a girlfriend now, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac blushed, recalling his encounter with Grace while in the disguise. \"W-Who told you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She did.

His parents lived in a small house on the outskirts of a suburb. At this hour, both of them were at work. It was lucky that Grace was home visiting from her own university so that she could give him a ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac immediately locked himself into the guest bedroom. He had a few short hours to grab some clothing and run the wash before anyone got suspicious. He could always borrow something of Grace's. She was a thin girl and modestly built. But she was also in the house and might notice something missing from the wardrobe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was also his mother. Like Aunt Maggie, she was a stout lady from over the years. She was also on the shorter side, in the lower fie foot range. But from what Isaac had seen of the powder, height wouldn't be much of a problem. His mother had an extensive closet of clothes that she would never know were missing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could go with an outfit of more slimmer shape but higher risk with his sister's, or get an easier to grab outfit of his mothers but have to be heavy set again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac decided...</span></div></div>",

She did come here with a small suitcase, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his mind made up, he crept out of the guest bedroom, locking the door behind him, and heading straight for his parents bedroom. The sneaking reminded him of when he was a kid, peeking in on Christmas presents. Luckily, his parents kept their bedroom unlocked, never suspecting that someone would try to break in. Grace was much too busy chatting with friends on her phone to even notice Isaac slip into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bingo,\" he said, going straight for his mom's closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing a plus size, Isaac's mother had kept an extensive wardrobe of clothes that were just in her size. She was a heft woman, with pretty sizable breasts and wide hips. He didn't want to linger for too long and settled on grabbing a very simple looking navy blue dress with a black belt. He also snagged some stockings, a pair of shoes, panties, and a bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his prize in tow, he made his way down to the laundry room, passing Grace on the way but moving too quick for her to notice what she was holding. He jammed the clothes into the washer, filled it up with the powder, and sat back at his handy work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now we wait...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour and a half later and the clothes were done. Isaac crept back upstairs and locked his door again. The real test was about to begin and his parents were going to be home in less than an hour. Isaac stripped down to his underwear and laid out the suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs before, the suit was a snug fit on him, even without all the padding. It maintained its elastic qualities while still feeling like a real girl's skin. The wig was still attached to it, as was the makeup, and it looked like Isaac was a very tall, if flat chested girl, in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Auntie. Let's see if this powder of yours works.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started with the plain black panties first. Isaac got the impression of just how large his mother's bottom was as he stretched them out. Placing one leg in each hole, he found he had to hold them up to prevent them from falling. That was until a tingling sensation filled his body, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah...\" he muttered as it felt like pins and needles all around his waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac felt his flesh as it became all puffy and swollen. Pretty soon, he no longer had to hold the panties up his thighs and waist had practically doubled in size. Unlike with the padding, he could feel his body really jiggle underneath the suit. This was really his butt that had expanded!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could give Grace a run for her money,\" Isaac giggled as he turned around and wiggled his ass in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext was the bra, which was what he was really looking forward to. His mom was an impressive G cup, with breasts nearly the size of her own head. Isaac had to marvel at just how big the empty cups were as he fitted the bra around his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment the bra clicked into place, the tingling started up again. Isaac let out a soft moan as two breasts started to bud inside the bra. He could feel their weight and they only got heavier as time went on. This wasn't some silly cloth attachment, these were real boobs. And they were attached to him. A new sensation overcame the disguised boy as he grabbed his swelling bosom and felt them inflate between his fingertips. It was like he had two growing water balloons beneath his skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy crap, these things are fucking huge,\" he said, looking down to his belly bottom. He couldn't even see his feet anymore. Staring at him in the mirror was a very well proportioned young lady his own height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWasting no more time, Isaac fitted the stockings over his legs. This time the nanobots seemed to be mostly focusing on his big feet. Isaac watched in awe as they dwindled down to a dainty size. He could now fit inside his mother's flats with no problem. They were even pretty comfortable on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One last thing,\" he said, throwing the dress over his head. With his normal height, the hem of the outfit only came up to his thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, the tingling was much more intense. Isaac felt like he was being compressed into a tin can as he whole body began to shrink down to his mother's size. But he wasn't just miniaturizing, Isaac could feel himself expand around his arms, legs, and even tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so weird,\" he said as he dropped another inch in height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the dress was starting to feel like a comfortable fit on him. He felt dainty, fat, and soft. It was made even stranger as he kept telling himself that it was his own body that was shapeshifting. The bubbly chubby Isabel made a reappearance in the mirror. His body seemed to bounce with every step as he finally stopped at the short height of 5'2, a whole foot smaller than his original height.

What do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac jumped as he heard his sister come up and towards his room. He knew he kept the door locked, but for good measure he grasped the knob so she wouldn't get in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay!\" he shouted. \"Uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd prefer not to shout through the door, Isaac.

I should have waited until I got back at college. This needs to all go off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasted no time removing his mother's clothing. As he did, his body slimmed down and returned back to its normal flat-chested shape. However, it wasn't until he was standing naked in the suit that Isaac realized something was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell? Why am I still short?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven when he removed the suit, Isaac was still stunted at his mother's 5'2 height. It was bizarre to be a full foot shorter than he was before, especially considering Isaac was back in his normal boy body. He held up his old clothes, discovering that they were much too big on his shrunken size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap! The powder must have a side effect that Aunt Maggie wasn't aware of!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac pulled out his phone and redialed his Aunt's number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Hello?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aunt Maggie! The powder shrunk and won't change me back to normal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I am well aware of that.

Everything went black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez, you weren't kidding. You're a real shorty now, aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac awoken to Maggie staring over him, still wearing the clothes she had borrowed from earlier in the day. Isaac could smell pizza in the background and hear the washing machines going in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rubbed his head as he sat up. \"You could have at least warned me. I didn't even have time to put on clothes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hush. It's not the first time I've seen a boy in his underwear. Put on one of my lab coats.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gestured to the rack on a wall. To Isaac's surprise, they came in a wide range of sizes, from child-size to something made for a ten foot tall person. He picked one that was suited for someone in the five foot range, a little shorter on him than he would like. When he was done, he joined Maggie in front of a large computer screen overlooking the washing machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It appears I've made a small mistake,\" she said. \"The nanos are still in our bodies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, get them out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not quite as simple as that. Your body needs to naturally purge them out, which could take about a week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A week!? Aunt Maggie, I have classes to go to. And my family is going to wonder where the hell I've went!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, relax. I sent a replacement temporary clone to pose as you while you're here. He has limited vocabulary, but college students don't talk much these days anyway, do they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac could feel his fists tremble. \"Are you trying to ruin my life?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but I need an assistant and you seem to be enjoying playing along.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, fine. What can I do to help fix this problem?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple! I need you to be a test dummy for some more of my experiments. Thought, I should warn you, a lot of these will be untested and could have even worse side effects.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you crazy? Why would anyone agree to that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I used to be my own test dummy for awhile. How do you think I got so tall or so big? You never know what's going to happen in this lab, Isaac.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what you're saying is the longer I work for you, the more I'm going to become like you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie smiled. \"My research tends to favor women of my size. You wouldn't understand what I'm trying to accomplish. All that I ask is you stick around with me a bit. Trust me when I say I'll make it worth your while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. How does paying off all your student loans sound?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing from a poor family, that sounded pretty good to Isaac. He sighed and rubbed the back of his head. \"...What exactly do you want me to be doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple! I want you to...\"</span></div></div>",

The nano bots are still in you, so I'm hoping to alter what they're programmed to do. By doing so, we might be able to change you back without having to wait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, why didn't you say so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac immediately walked up to the platform and placed both his feet in the direct center. Maggie waddled over to the control panel and began to fiddle with the levers all on the dashboard. Isaac heard something hum above his head and looked up at the metal disc slowly lowering from the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, just relax,\" commanded his aunt. \"This might feel a little strange.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were butterflies in Isaac's stomach as a strange static cling caused the hair on his arms to stand up. The disc above him emitted a warm light and he felt a tugging sensation, like he would imagine being abducted by an alien would feel like. Maggie continued to manipulate the keyboard and she grabbed one lever next to the machine before saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Isaac. Going up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac felt like warm taffy getting stretched out. All of his bones lengthened and grew as he increased vertically in size. Despite feeling stretched, he still maintained his usual proportions as he grew taller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah,\" he mumbled as he bounced into place at his original height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eureka! It worked,\" Maggie snapped her fingers. \"I'm able to control the nano bots!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's great,\" said Isaac as he tried to step out of the platform only to get zapped by electricity. \"Ow! What the...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Idiot, don't leave the platform! I'm using a powerful electromagnet to manipulate the tiny robots in your body. This is supremely untested stuff, so you can't leave the ring until I've experimented fully on it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac gulped. \"Experimented fully?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I couldn't exactly do this to myself. Why do you think I needed an assistant? Now don't make a fuss.

I wonder what would happen if I completely changed your DNA.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac did not like the sound of that at all. \"H-Hey, don't change me anymore! I'm finally back to normal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not for long. my boy. You'd best get used to the fact that when you're in my lab anything can happen. Expect to become all shapes and sizes, though you might start to pick up on my preference the longer you're around me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis aunt put on a pair of goggles and tapped her lip with her pen. She fiddled with some of the knobs on the dashboard and then took his thumb to her mouth. Isaac watched as Maggie bit down and then pressed her bloodied finger on the console.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we go,\" she muttered. \"DNA being analysed. The world could always use another me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe electromagnet hummed to life again. Little strands of lightning began to strike Isaac at various points on his body and he could feel his bones turn to pudding again. This time, however, instead of the stretching sensation, he felt heavier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at the now much-too-small lab coat, Isaac saw his entire body swell up. He took on a form pear shaped form as he butt exploded outwards, followed by his hips and thighs. Like with the powdered clothing, these changes were with his real body. This was real fat under his skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything, from his arms to his hands, puffed up. Even his face softened to a more female appearance until any remnants of the young college boy was gone. His hair grew out and reddened to a rich scarlet color. The rough cracks on his skin softened to a more delicate nature, like that of a woman. But the biggest giveaway to his new gender were certain body parts that made their appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac watched in horror as the buttons of his lab coat slowly snapped open, revealing an expanding chest underneath. At last, his new breasts bounced free. Isaac blushed as he covered himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfection!\" shouted his aunt as she turned off the machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, his body stopped wobbling. Isaac had to do everything in his power just to balance himself upright. \"Wh-What did you do to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grasped his throat. It was not his voice which came out, but his Aunt's!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I made you into an exact clone of me,\" said his Aunt. \"What do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe held up a mirror as Isaac shrieked. He was now an exact duplicate of her, standing in the shredded remains of his lab coat. He did his best to cover himself as Maggie let out an awful cackle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't be so shy. There isn't anything I haven't already seen before. You're me now, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Why?\" was the only thing he could think to ask. \"Why would you do this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To prove that I can,\" she said as he hit a few buttons on the dashboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe field of electricity disappeared and Isaac could suddenly move freely again. His new center of gravity was strange and he toppled over onto the console, struggling to keep his balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Change me back,\" he demanded, still not used to his voice at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet. First we need to run some tests. Now, then...\"</span></div></div>",

With his massive curves, even walking was proving to be a strange new experience. So many bits of him bounced with every step. He sat there on the bed in a lower part of the lab, cupping his breasts and feeling exposed. He only had on his boxers, which had stretched out from his new waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then,\" Maggie chuckled. \"Let's get you covered up, at least. I hope you know how to put a bra on by now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe handed him a set of matching underwear, red leopard in print and complete with black lace. Though the fabric was very comfortable and a perfect fit, Isaac couldn't help but feel embarrassed. Without the suit, he felt exposed like this. He was still having a hard time processing the fact that he was physically a woman, let alone his aunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he slipped into the underwear, Maggie passed him a pair of glasses and a black robe to better cover himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a little something to differentiate us.

Now, you can be whoever you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why do you always focus on women who are fat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis aunt paused for a moment to consider her answer. \"I suppose it's just my preference.

Isaac's thoughts returned when he had worn the suit out in public back at his university. Most of the attention was placed on his aunt anyway, who knew how to flaunt her womanly wiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looking good, Alice,\" Maggie said as she winked at an older gentleman looking her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess...What's the point of going out in public like this though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To get you used to being someone else,\" she replied. \"In this line of work, you need to know how to interact with people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, why are we in the mall?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To get more supplies, of course! With the powder, we need to test the limits of the nanos. To do that, we need a variety of new clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...We're going clothes shopping?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, keep up, Alice. Now come on. This is my favorite store at this mall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled him into a small store off in the corner of the mall.

I'll even let you pick out something you like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac groaned and surveyed the stock of the store. There was certainly more variety in the store than he thought, but nearly everything in the store was meant for a larger woman. Maggie had wandered off to look at a few racks, leaving him to go off on his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe store was divided into a section for women of a more curvy body type and very large and wide women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac decided to look at...</span></div></div>",

He ventured into the heavyset aisle, with clothes designed more for well-rounded women rather than an hourglass figure. That wasn't to say there weren't bras of gigantic proportions, but most of the outfits appealed to bigger bellies than their counterparts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need something more casual,\" Isaac muttered. \"Something that's more comfortable to wear than a dress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clothes his aunt had provided him were meant to expose and were formal dresses, like something one would wear to a special event.

Isaac realized that he enjoyed stockings and was sure to grab a pair, as well as a matching set of bras and panties. He picked one of the largest sizes they had, as he secretly enjoyed being well endowed as long as he wasn't exposing his goods to the world.

Your aunt had arrangements made so that your stuff could be moved in as soon as she was out of there. The movers should be here in a few minutes-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" said Isaac, trying to slow this all down, \"What if I don't wanna leave this place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebbie looked around at his dorm, which while not some homely hovel, was still fairly small and relatively unadorned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me,\" said Debbie with a smile, \"You're going to want to leave this place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac shrugged, figuring he might was well be spontaneous for once. For all he knew his aunt had left him a pretty sweet setup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" said Isaac, \"I'm game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent,\" said Debbie as she bounded over to him with some papers and a pen in hand, \"I'm just going to need your signature on a few of these papers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac sighed and signed the papers, paying little mind to what they said. Perhaps this was foolish, he reasoned, but he was sure his aunt wished him no ill will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin an hour, his dorm was stripped of all his belongings, which wasn't very much, and Isaac was headed to his new house, following the movers in his car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebbie was behind Isaac in her own, rather stylish, luxury vehicle. The drive was fairly short, 20 minutes with some light traffic. It did feel a good deal longer to Isaac, who was excited to see his new house. Finally, the convoy arrived at Isaac's new abode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac was not displeased. It was easily one of the biggest houses he had ever seen, not really a house so much as it was a mansion. Before it, a long driveway which culminated in a pave stone circle anchored by a gorgeous fountain. The exterior seemed rather Gothic, and had been maintained for the last hundred years or so rather than remodeled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow-\" was all the dumbfounded Isaac could manage as he looked upon the splendid architecture. This was now his? No strings attached?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe movers were even quicker unloading his belongings than they were packing them up, and before long they were out of his way. The interior was slightly more modern and practical than the exterior, though it did maintain a certain antique vibe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, sir,\" came a voice from behind Isaac as he chatted with Debbie about the house. Startled, he turned about quickly. Behind him was a rather frail looking old man, dressed in typical butler attire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello...\" was all Isaac could manage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reginald,\" said the butler, stepping closer, \"The estate butler.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh-\" Isaac looked at Debbie, \"I'm not sure I can afford a butler.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, sir,\" said Reginald with a warm smile, \"Your aunt has arrangements made to pay me for the next 6 years or so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis deal was really getting too good to be true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, thank you Reginald,\" said Isaac, holding out his hand to shake the butler's hand, \"I won't push you too hard, I'm sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReginald merely chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't think twice about asking for my help,\" he said, \"I get bored if all I do is sit around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Reggie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reginald, please sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Reginald.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps something to eat?\" asked Reginald, \"I could prepare something for you and our guest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded toward Debbie with his final statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're very kind,\" said Debbie, \"But I really must be going now.

After dinner, he gave Reginald the night to relax, and began to explore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe majority of the mansion went as one would expect- rooms and bathrooms and hallways, all lavishly decorated but sadly uninspiring. However, at the end of a hallway, Isaac found something quite intriguing. There, hung on a wall, was a picture of a portly blonde woman. She was easily three hundred pounds, probably closer to three hundred and fifty pounds, and pears shaped. Her face, while pudgy, was still attractive. She must have been in her late twenties when this was painted- but who even had portraits of themselves commissioned anymore?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRich people, Isaac thought in response to his own question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, he was enticed. Was this his aunt? How old had she been when she died? How did she die? So many questions- he'd have to ask Reginald tomorrow. Still, he wanted to get a close look at the painting, so he lifted a candle off the wall. Much to his surprise, lifting the candle off the wall made the painting swing off the wall, as if it were a door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now this is more like it,\" said Isaac with a cackle.

It looked the the imprint of a fat woman, he could see the rolls and imprint of a wide bottom sunk into the table.  Was it his aunt's imprint?  Why was it set into this table?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext on a metal trey were two corked glass beakers.  There was no name on the label explaining what it was other than a sketch of two bottles being poured together.  Curious what would happen if the two items mixed together, he uncorked the first bottle and poured it on the operating table over the imprint of the ass.  The curved upside dome of the ass imprint would prevent the mysterious substance from spilling onto the ground.  It was a clumpy off white clay like powder.  In the other bottle was a thick murky looking liquid which was obviously supposed to be added to the powder.  Isaac poured it out over the powder.  It oozed out slowly like upturning a bottle of murky white syrup.  It looked gross.  The liquid seemed to cling to the powder causing it to expand.  He tapped the bottom of the bottle to be sure to get it all out and he stood back to watch what would happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt bubbled and swelled.  It turned into a white blob and did not stop swelling like it was jello.  \"What the hell?\"  Isaac said.  The swelling white mass expanded and filled the indent on the operating table like it was a mold.  It swelled outward off the table without spilling forming a human shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApproaching it with a mixture of intrigued and disgust he looked at it closer.  It was a perfect quivering almost translucent mold of an overweight woman.  \"What is this?\"  He muttered under his breath bringing his hand close to it and giving it a poke with his finger.  He felt an icy rush traveling up his hand and down his arm.  He recoiled.  What happened?  He put his hand closer and touched it again.  The rush happened again.  It was like someone was spraying a cold hose at his hand except he could only feel the flow under his skin.  He pulled his hand away and the white substance stuck to his hand for a second then bounced back into place causing the mold to quiver like mad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac's pants felt uncomfortable.  He went to adjust his belt when he found he had a little bit of a bulge on his tummy which wasn't there before.  Did he absorb this substance into his body?  He looked around the rest of his body.  It did seem like he put on a little weight.  \"Its like this is pure fat and it wants to enter me.\"  He said intrigued. </span></div></div>",

It is a masterful work.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Isaac didn't know any better, he'd think his aunt had been a witch. The room was a dimly lit library of sorts, with several artifacts (many of the type one would assume to have some sort of magic attributed to them). In the middle of a room was a rather ordinary looking glass container with a cork in it. Isaac stepped over to it and picked it up- it was heavier than he had imagined, though it seemed to only be filled with some sort of smoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is this thing?\" said Isaac as hie inspected it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, as if by its own will, the glass bottle jolted out of his hand and smacked right into the floor, shattering into several pieces. From the remains the smoke rose, yet it didn't dissipate as one would expect smoke to do. Isaac quickly placed his sleeve before his mouth and nose, trying to protect himself in case the smoke was noxious. However, after about 30 seconds, it was clearly starting to take some sort of shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-Isaac?\" said a voice that seemed to be coming from the fog. It seemed oddly distant and yet so very close. Isaac panicked and almost slipped as he took a couple of steps back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isaac,\" it said again, now clearly a woman's voice and far less distant, \"Is that you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry,\" said the voice again as the smoke finally took form, \"It's me, your Aunt Nora.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAunt Nora? The woman who he had inherited this house from?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I- I thought you were dead!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I wasn't in my body,\" said the fat, smoke woman before him. She was perhaps only a few years older than she had been at the time she was painted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" was all Isaac could manage in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had gotten into some-\" she twirled her ghost hair with an ethereal finger as she spoke, \"Well, witchcraft, honestly. Mostly harmless stuff, but I accidentally sealed my soul in that bottle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-right-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know it's a lot to take in,\" she said, waving at a seat, \"Sit down, if you please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac didn't need to be asked twice, as he collapsed on a seat. Nora floated over, a loving, maternal gaze in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been so long since I had seen you,\" she said, \"I'm sure you don't remember me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" said Isaac honestly, a bit sad, \"I don't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's alright-\" she said, floating over and stretching a hand out to place on his forehead, \"I j-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second she made contact with him, Isaac felt a sort of pulling sensation and blacked out. Within minutes, he had regained consciousness, but Nora was nowhere to be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aunt Nora?\" asked Isaac, worried. He looked around for some response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Isaac,\" she responded, though he couldn't figure out from where. Oddly enough, she felt closer than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think,\" she began, \"I think I'm in your head-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No that's bullshit-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Isaac felt his own hands running down the sides of his body- but he hadn't made them do that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down,\" she said, \"Just calm down, I'm sure we can figure something out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get out of my body!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't,\" she said honestly, \"I've tried, but I don't know how...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well isn't that just swell!\" said Isaac, looking in a mirror and seeing a green glow in his eyes subside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just calm down,\" Nora repeated, \"Either way- I've sort of missed having a physical form.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac considered he had been sort of mean. The poor woman was sort of dead after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" said Isaac, \"You're right. I'm sure we'll figure something out- but I'm tired, do you think we can sleep first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" said Nora, forcing Isaac to walk now. Isaac felt incredibly odd moving by actions that were not his own, but he was suddenly too tired to even care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter closing the library, Isaac and Nora made their way to Isaac's bedroom, which he had selected some hours prior. After brushing his teeth and taking off his jeans, Isaac went to bed.</span></div></div>",

However, in a dream, that wasn't so strange, even though Isaac felt he usually kept some control, or at least some illusion of control, over his dreams. Anyway, that wasn't the strange part, it was what he was dreaming about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was eating, and he was eating a lot. Before him was a sort of banquet table of sorts, nearly every inch of it filled with food of one type or another. There was a whole roast chicken, mashed potatoes, pasta, bread rolls, desserts galore- and that was only what was directly in his field of vision. Even stranger, his forearms and hands didn't seem to be his own. They were smaller hands, slightly pudgy and manicured. Something about this should've made sense to him immediately, and he knew it, but right now it was all nonsense, one of the stranger, more vivid dreams he had ever had. He belched a triumphant belch between plates of food, sure a human being actually couldn't eat this much, and it was all just a dream. Finally, he grabbed a hand mirror that was just a foot away and brought it to his face- but it wasn't his face- it was Aunt Nora's fat face! She adjusted her hair with one hand and wiped a few crumbs away from her mouth, then smiled with her pearly whites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac awoke in a hot sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something wrong, Isaac?\" asked Aunt Nora, sounding as if she had just woken up too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh...no,\" responded Isaac after a second, actually completely unsure of whether he should even share what he just experienced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just talk to me,\" said Aunt Nora.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well- were you just...uh... dreaming?\" asked Isaac rather meekly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-dreaming?\" began Aunt Nora, now a bit embarrassed, \"Oh, I guess I was. You saw that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I experienced it,\" confessed Isaac, \"As if I was in your body. It was kind of freaky, to be completely honest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah,\" said Aunt Nora knowingly, \"Yes, I imagine it could be. These last few hours being trapped in your body have been kind of strange as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah- sorry,\" Isaac realized that what he had just gotten a small taste of was what she was experiencing full force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need,\" said Aunt Nora.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two, in one body, sat in silence until Nora spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm done sleeping- how about some grub?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac smiled and stood up, feeling just the slightest tightness in his boxers. Surely, he was imagining it, these boxers had been loose last night.</span></div></div>",

Isaac was about 5 foot 8, weighed in at 140 pounds, and was in very decent physical condition. He watched what he ate, for the most part, but he wasn't opposed to an indulgence here and there.  When Nora had lived, she and Isaac couldn't have been more different. Nora was about 5 foot 3, and never denied herself an indulgence. She weighed in at 326 pounds when she had been trapped in the bottle, the heaviest she had ever been, and likely would've gotten bigger if she kept going the way she was going. Her hair was blonde, while Isaac's was black, and her eyes were blue, while Isaac's were brown. Physically and in several personal senses, the two could not have been more different, yet there they were, sharing a body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just tell the butler to whip us up something, ask him to make what he used to make me,\" sad Nora to Isaac within his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac merely groaned in response, but complied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" he said, tapping the butler's shoulder, \"Uh, I was wondering if you could make me what you used to make Nora for breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\" he asked, \"It's quite a bit of food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure I can handle it,\" said Isaac, with a bit of influence from Nora.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was quite a bit of food. It was 12 pancakes, 6 waffles, 6 strips of bacon, 4 scrambled eggs, a glass of whole milk and a glass of orange juice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" said Isaac to Nora, \"I really don't think I can handle this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh nonsense,\" said Nora, \"This really isn't all that much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac shrugged and dug into the food laid before him, fairly certain he'd be crying uncle before he was even half way through.</span></div></div>",

Isaac relived memories of Nora being picked on for her weight in grade school, running out of breath playing. However he also relived memories of being popular and sought after in middle school. He lived memories of Nora's first kiss, meals on dates with surprisingly handsome young men. Memories of bathing her plump, voluptuous body. While the horrified Isaac could not move out control her movements, Isaac could feel himself inside Nora's body in every memory. Every touch, every sensation, every taste, whether Isaac wanted to feel them or not. Each memory moved in a rapid fire series of vignettes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found himself in another vignette, this time on a pool side sharing a snack with a Hispanic pool boy. Isaac could do nothing as Nora and the boy endlessly flirted and ate way too many chocolate covered strawberries. As they shared a kiss, Isaac felt his head suddenly drop and a stillness. the boy pulled away and looked at Nora/Isaac. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"is ther samting rong?\" he asked in a thick accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac sat there still waiting for Nora's memory to continue playing out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nora?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt then dawned to a terrified Isaac that this was no longer a ride, he was in full control! He screamed a womanly scream and ran inside, his bulging womanly flesh jiggling with each step. As he reached the bathroom, he saw his full reflection, or better yet Noras reflection. He stared at his reflection, having never seen his aunt Nora in person, and now here he was in her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"god this is too freaky!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't help but be taken aback by how attractive Nora was despite her size. Her fiery red hair tied back in a ponytail, light make up on her delicate round face. Her enormous breasts spilling out of a surprisingly sexy burgundy bikini top, her big soft belly was inviting and comforting, and as Isaac turned around he saw her shelf of an ass struggling to be encased in a matching pair of panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"god this too weird, wake up wake up wake up!\"</span></div></div>",

But as she reached for a breadstick it cameback, and felt her/himself begin to bloat at an alarming rate. Just as the pressure reached its highest point, she felt it begin to go away, as if deflating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"phew! that was close!\" again Nora reached for a breadstick when she noticed that as the pressure dropped in his/her stomach, her pants began to feel tighter. Just as she looked down, POP! the pants button smacked her in the face as she was shocked to the size of her/his belly! Not only that her/his hips were expanding too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"oh crap! What have i done! What do i do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she looks down again she saw Isaacs shirt begin to rise where his chest was, as if it it was growing. All it took was one peek and she was greeted with what could easily be a cup breasts, that still seemed to be growing. \"oh God, what have i done!\" Nora kept freaking out.  At that moment she felt her conscience begin to slip from control . \"oh no...oh no!\" Isaac was waking up! Soon she was back on the side, a front seat passenger, waiting for Isaac to react to his newfound...changes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"oh God, i had more of your dreams aunt Nora, i don't know if i can keep doing this. we have to figure out-\" at that moment Isaac realized where he was, saw the pizza boxes, and the fact this was not how he was positioned our was doing when he went to sleep. \" Nora can you tell me...\" and that's when he looked in the mirror at the swollen and.. curvy midsection of his reflection. not just that his face was slightly rounder and his hair a little longer and a bit more... reddish?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!\"</span></div></div>",

As he felt it with his fingers he had never felt anything so soft and squishy, but at the same time..comforting. Hesnapped out of it once we looked at how far his good were sticking out, the tops of his thighs swollen too.

Don't you see Isaac? the world will be our oyster!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's easy for you to say, you came back to life and got a younger body and get to keep all your riches, all at the cost of ruining your nephew's life! of course aunt nora it's a win win! responded Isaac sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isaac. Soon you will realize that becoming a woman is the best thing that ever happened to you. You will realize that you simply would never have been happy being just a man. Trust me honey, Ive seen your memories. I know you Isaac. I KNOW you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac shuddered at those words being uttered inside his brain, despite honestly not knowing how she possibly think he wanted to be a woman his whole life. Just then Isaac opened his eyes and saw the beautiful voluptuous young woman in the mirror that had his face, almost as if someone had taken his head and placed it on his aunt's body. He stared at his bountiful breasts perfectly encased in a black lace bra, a little bit of soft flesh oozing out from the top of the bra. It was one of the sexiest things Isaac had ever seen, and whether he would admit it or not. He was kind of hot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"uh Isaac? Your eyes are up here.\" Nora snapped Isaac's fingers next to head to redirect his attention from his/her new tits. Nora was secretly pleased with how this was playing out, her plan coming along nicely.</span></div></div>",

Isaac sympathized with her, but he wasn't the one who had gotten himself into some weird, dark magic and trapped his essence in a bottle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac nodded at the butler as he fitted the earphones into his ears and started trotting down the driveway and into the street. At this point, Nora was mostly quiet.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jogging was harder than Isaac remembered. Of course, there was the new fifteen pounds he had to contend with, but there was something else off. He tried going faster, but he seemed to be going slower. Something very weird was going on. Suddenly, he felt as if he was being sucked back into his head- it was the oddest thing he had ever experienced... he didn't have control over his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, wow!\" he heard himself say, shocked. He didn't say that- but it was his voice! He tried moving his arms to no avail. He was slowing down even further, and now he was just walking slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aunt Nora?\" he somehow vocalized, though it was only his voice ringing in emptiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" he heard his voice, though with a slightly different inflection respond, \"Isaac, what's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wheels in his brain were turning- he had a feeling he knew exactly what was going on. Somehow, Aunt Nora had control over his body! She was in the position he had been in, and he was in her, secondary position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're in control of my body!\" he exclaimed, shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, wow- yeah!\" she said, a little happier than he'd hoped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well stop it, I want my body back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I,\" she paused, \"I don't even know how I did this- I don't know how I'd give you back control.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've gotta be kidding me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'm as shocked as you are,!\" she said, honestly, \"But I gotta admit, feels good to be able to stretch my legs- er, your legs...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, keep jogging then!\" Isaac urged, \"We still have weight to lose!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww shucks,\" she said, \"You know I'd be no good at that- but speaking of weight...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac could only see what Nora let him see. He could see through his eyes, and there were the mild feelings that he received as the secondary inhabitant of his own body, but there were things that he wasn't privy too. The second Nora took control, his body shifted slightly. Nora's hair was blonde, while Isaac's was brown. When Nora took control, Isaac's hair became just a bit lighter. His eyes were a bit lighter as well, and there was something just a tad different about his face. Then there was the weight. When Nora took control, Isaac put on another 10 pounds, bringing the grand total of his weight gain to 25 pounds. The weight settled on his lower half for the most part, plumping his ever growing rear and adding some thickness to his thighs. Having weighed in at 145 before this whole fiasco, he now lugged 170 pounds of himself. He was looking a bit chubby, at the very least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you gained a little more weight,\" Nora finished, looking down at  the slight belly their shared body was sporting now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh fuck no!\" Isaac said angrily, \"You jog my ass back to the house NOW.\"</span></div></div>",

What's so bad about it? Besides, no one around here knows you, hun. I don't think you hung around this neck of the woods very often, did you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had a point there. Isaac wasn't a street urchin, but this part of town was way out of his income bracket. The houses around him were enormous, all protected by big, ornate gates and sporting immense driveways and lawns with the most luxurious (and often garish) fountains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, you have a point there, but can't we move a little faster?\" he asked, a little more calmly now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we could,\" she said with a smirk, the hand she now controlled starting at her lower back and then roaming lower, grabbing one of the fleshier cheeks the body she was inhabiting was now supporting, \"But then THIS baby-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slapped it for emphasis, a fairly minor jiggle moving through the adipose that now coated Isaac's rear end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-Would start to hop up and down like there's no tomorrow. Now, if you DO want to draw attention to yourself, I'd say jogging around with all this junk bumping up and down behind you is a great way to start.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac groaned, Nora only smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it isn't SOOO bad,\" she said, \"I'm sure I can figure out some way to help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you know how to change me back, then you better,\" Isaac said, realizing he was hardly in any position to make threats but maintaining some aggression in his voice, which now only resonated within the confines of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't quite say that,\" Nora laughed, \"But there has to be SOME way to undo this, or at least some way to make it more bearable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, whatever- at least I can see your house in the distance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora's house was easily the biggest in the whole neighborhood, and by far the most secluded. Whereas Isaac could see a good portion of most of the houses he passed by through their gates, only Nora's gate itself tipped him off to the fact that her house was directly before them.  A long driveway and a great deal of tree cover kept her house hidden, just as Nora liked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the aunt and nephew approached the gate, Isaac felt himself shoot back to the fore in his body, regaining control. He inspected his chubbier frame with a frown, poking his muffin top and then pinching his bubble butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit, what's the gate code again?\" Isaac asked inwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"232314,\" Nora reminded him, displeased to be back in the driver's seat, \"Funny how we changed back at the least opportune time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any time is fine for me,\" Isaac said, punching in the code, and unlocking the gate. They entered the house again, with Nora glad to be out of the oppressing midday heat. Only now, however, did Isaac discover another change he was experiencing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It had been Nora's when she had her own body, and as Isaac was the new master of the house, it was only fitting that he should take over her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was it, though. He had no intention of becoming the new house \"fatty\", as Nora seemed to be hellbent on. As soon as they walked into the house, he had felt a pang of hunger so strong he was nearly knocked back by it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're hungry, Isaac,\" Nora had said, a hint of desperation in her voice, \"Why aren't you eating?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I shouldn't be hungry,\" Isaac said, clutching his pudgy midsection with one hand and grimacing at the soft give, \"Something tells me you're behind this new desire to eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please, you can't blame me every time you're hungry-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can when you just piled a few pounds on my frame when I was trying to LOSE weight,\" Isaac said, more than a little angry. He stood before his mirror now, inspecting his body. At 170, he was visibly fatter than he had been when Nora moved in. To make matters worse, it seemed he was inheriting his Aunt's biggest feature. Turning profile in the mirror, his rear had clearly grown, and was now soft with new pudge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, just perfect,\" he murmured, gripping the new flesh with his hands and squeezing it. In sweatpants, at least, he was safe. He was pretty sure that none of his jeans would fit over his new badonkadonk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, the ladies love a man with a nice rear,\" Nora comforted her fattening nephew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like this rear would only be nice on a lady,\" he responded, flipping her words on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora scoffed, \"You know you're over reacting, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac now inspected his shirtless upper body. Abs were a thing of the past, now coated in flub, but also new was the shape and softness of his chest. He brought a hand up to judge the change and was met with the oddest sensation. As soon as he touched his chest, his knees went week. He tried again, now at the nipple, and could only bite his lip to deal with the rush of new feelings in the area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell,\" Isaac frowned, now squeezing his small, but sensitive chest and nearly moaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear,\" Nora said, again trying to comfort, \"It seems you're, well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Developing- or maybe I'm wrong-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Out with it!\" Isaac cried, fearing he knew what she was getting at all too well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Developing...breasts...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac felt as if he could faint. Him? Fatter, pear shaped, with breasts? There was a bigger trend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm- am I going to turn into a woman?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only,\" began Aunt Nora, \"If we don't figure out how to stop and reverse this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" Isaac said, his will reinvigorated, \"In which case, we need to fix this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Nora said, \"Not really smart to work on an empty stomach though, right?\"</span></div></div>",

Yielding to Nora's will, he now found himself walking to the kitchen, where he assumed his butler would be. However, the kitchen was empty, and-- having never had access to a butler in his life-- was more than fine with fixing something up himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see here...\" he thought aloud as his eyes scanned the freezer and fridge, \"Geez, you guys don't really have much in terms of healthy snacks-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please, I'm as healthy as they come. Just pick something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right...\" Isaac said, dismissing Nora's plea and taking his time to search for something to eat, \"Oh sweet, an apple.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac picked the fruit with his hand and took a bite of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should at least wash that,\" Nora said, \"But fine- it's something-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac remained in front of the fridge as he polished off the apple. It fell to the bottom a of a pudgy stomach that felt like a bottomless pit. If anything Isaac only felt hungrier after eating the fruit. He remained before the fridge, fearing he was becoming a slave to his appetite, much like Nora had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, I'm still so hungry,\" he moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then keep eating!\" Nora commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really shouldn't-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac felt Nora's will overcome his as she gained control of his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally, a chance to eat!\" she said, rubbing Isaac's hands together fiendishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?\" Isaac cursed in vain from the confines of his head, \"Give me back my body, Nora!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AUNT Nora,\" she corrected you, grabbing some brownies from the fridge with a tub of vanilla ice cream, \"And I wouldn't give you back control right now even if I knew how. You're starving yourself when you're hungry. That can't be healthy. Neither is your obsession with weight. I'm going to eat until we're good and satisfied, and maybe then you can have control back, but right now I feel like this body knows I'm better at satisfying its needs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora said this and then began smashing brownies into the ice cream she had grabbed and dug into it ravenously. Isaac was so intensely overtaken with the bliss of this hedonistic pursuit that he was unable to formulate a response to Nora's rather ludicrous argument for a few seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know full well that I should- mmm- that WE SHOULD be worried about my weight- I've put on who knows how many pounds of fat since you've taken residence, and we should also be worried about you taking over, it seems like every time you do I change a little more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh nonsense, we don't know that for sure-\" Nora said as she ate, then paused and looked down, \"Er, well-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac was swelling before her very eyes. His once loose workout clothes grew tighter, especially around the rear. His muffin top grew and his hips and thighs widened and were padded with fat. His belly softened further and pressed into his shirt, the outline of his belly button, which had grown deeper, becoming visible as it did so. His chest swelled slowly as well, nipples growing on the mounds of flesh that he was now sporting. The sensitivity in that area was heightened as well. Nora wasn't one hundred percent sure, but she did feel that one thing SHRUNK rather than grew, and it was in his pants. His arms softened, now lacking any definition. The new weight of them also made Nora feel like he had lost a little his upper body, which had been converted into fat. The boy would certainly have trouble losing the weight now. Fatter, easily 190 pounds and likely closer to 200, he would have a hard time running for starters, and the fact that he had less muscle to lug this fat around would only make things harder on him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shorts he had donned this morning had grown uncomfortably tight, but Nora ignored the tightness right now in favor of eating some more ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell- I'm a cow!\" Isaac cried angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hardly a cow,\" Nora said, though she had to admit that amount of junk her nephew was now sporting in the trunk would have trouble finding a good pair of jeans in the men's section.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop eating, at least!\" Isaac pleaded, \"Can't you see what you've done to my body?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, we'll find a fix for it, I hardly think this weight will be permanent, probably-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, almost certainly!\" she said, putting down her spoon, annoyed, \"Can I finish off my ice cream in peace?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine-\"</span></div></div>",

As Isaac came to, he felt enormous, even more so  because of his decreased muscle mass, and was seated, with his belly stuffed and ass spreading below him with it's countless new pounds of padding. His greatly increased rear end had ripped through the basketball shorts that had been somewhat loose before all of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac struggled to his feet, a hand on his full belly as he did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell, Aunt Nora- look what you've done to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really love to complain, don't you?\" she asked, clearly annoyed by her nephew, \"'Aunt Nora this' and 'look at my fat ass that'. It's not a big deal. So what if you need to lug around a couple pounds of fat for a day or two? I'll get this sorted, promise. Now, can you stop freaking out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac raised his chubbier arms, feeling their new weight all the more with the muscle he had lost. He cleaned up what he- or rather, Nora- had eaten in the kitchen and then made his way back to his room, not before pulling off his basketball shorts. The underwear he had worn this morning were now closer to a thong, somehow remaining intact through what one could only call a marvel of modern textile synthesis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac wobbled to his room, where the full length mirror Nora had placed in a corner revealed the full extent of his changes. His chest had grown, as had his nipples. Pulling off his shirt revealed a small, but undeniably feminine pair of breasts. Cupping one with each hand revealed a great deal of sensitivity in the area. His hair had grown as well, now long enough to tuck behind his ears. His face had softened, losing angularity which had been replaced with a certain cherubic cuteness. He wouldn't go as far as to call it girlish, but it was far from masculine. Of course, his lower body had taken the brunt of the changes. His hips were wider than his shoulders, and his ass had grown behind him in every direction, easily his biggest feature. His thighs had to be a close second, as they grew to support all of the junk in his overstuffed trunk. Some cellulite had appeared on his upper thighs and ass, which was hardly a welcome development.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell Nora, I've got cellulite!\" he said, pinching his fat ass hard, hoping that this nightmare would end but only managing to make himself yelp girlishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what did you expect with an ass that size?\" Nora laughed at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not funny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora told Isaac about some clothes she had that might fit him, some of the smallest stuff she brought with her when she had moved to this house, much thinner than she had been in her final days but still rather chubby. One of the better fitting garments was a stretchy blue tracksuit. If it hadn't been made of a rather velvety material and if the zipper hadn't been a golden heart, perhaps it could pass as a man's clothing. Finding nothing else that was suitable, Isaac had to don her tracksuit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said you could figure this out,\" Isaac said, standing profile in the mirror, one hand under his belly and another kneading his ass, \"In that case, let's get to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, well-\"</span></div></div>",

He was in a kitchen he barely recognized (This was, after all, a new house) eating some cake right from its plate, not even bothering to cut himself a slice. What was creepier still was that he felt he had no control over his movements. After a minute or so of eating cake, Isaac finally realized what was up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aunt Nora?\" he asked out loud, forcing himself to stop eating cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Isaac-\" responded his deceased Aunt in his head, \"I thought you were asleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was,\" said Isaac, putting the spoon down and wiping a smear of chocolate from the edge of his mouth, \"But what are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I was a bit hungry... and I didn't want to wake you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Isaac realized, the woman hadn't eaten in God knows how long- and though she was some sort of ethereal being for most that time, it made sense that she should be hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Aunt Nora,\" said Isaac a bit sheepishly, \"I just forgot that you would be hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't apologize,\" she said, \"If anything I'm the one who should be sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" said Isaac, ready to drop the matter, \"I was just wondering if maybe we could eat something a bit healthier... I don't want to gain weight or anything...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You? Gain weight? Come now Isaac, I'm sure a young man like you has a metabolism that can take a full cake without so much as a shrug!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-maybe... I don't know about a full cake...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just an expression,\" assured Aunt Nora, \"But really, you needn't worry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you're right,\" said Isaac, submitting to Nora's influence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm quite sure I am,\" she said a it triumphantly, \"Now just try and go back to sleep, I'm still a bit hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac complied, and within a minute or two he was drifting back to sleep, just as Nora began to eat once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, Nora might've been right about Isaac's metabolism previously, but the truth now that she was in his body was far more complicated. With Nora's soul (So to speak) inside him. Isaac would inevitably begin to look more and more like her fairly quickly, especially if he took on her diet. This, however, was completely<br>\r\nunknown to both Nora and Isaac for the time being.</span></div></div>",

His face became more woman like and started to age with crows feet and laugh lines as well as plump up with chipmunk cheeks a double chin. His arms and legs plumped up and his third leg became a slit. As the brightness died down, what stood in the bedroom was not a boy, but a rather beautiful fat middle age woman.<br>\r\nThe new woman made her way to the bed got comfortable as she drifted off to sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She wanted YOU to have what was in the boxes in my car. I just need you to sign here and then you can take what your aunt left you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac shrugged. Maybe there was something worth his while in these boxes. After signing the paper Debbie had presented to him, Isaac walked outside and took what his aunt had so wanted him to have when she passed. Really, there were only two boxes, a long, slender one, and another more conventionally shaped box. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that it?\" asked Isaac after he took the boxes to his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty much,\" replied Debbie, \"I may need to swing by here again with a little more paper work, but we're good for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" said Isaac, though Debbie was already locking her car by the time the word had left his mouth. In a matter of seconds, Debbie sped down the road and was out of sight. After making his way back to his room, Isaac took a look at the boxes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more conventional, cube-like box held mostly family photos and what seemed to be like some old heirlooms. Cool stuff, he thought- but nothing out of the ordinary. The other box, which he had yet to open, was in the corner of his room. It was a little over four feet tall and a foot across, a rather strange shape for a box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, Isaac was rather unpleasantly surprised to find only an old mirror. Sure, it was kind of cool looking and he could use a bigger mirror in his room, but he had been hoping for something much cooler. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess I shouldn't have expected too much,\" he said as he propped the mirror up against the wall to get a better look at it. It was a rather unassuming mirror, simply dark brown wood framing a slightly dusty mirror. When he stepped back to look at himself in it, it felt as if the image was distorted. He seemed a bit wider in the mirror than usual- a bit fuller...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, looking at the mirror in the bathroom proved that the mirror was wrong, he looked like his normal self when he looked in that mirror.

If you and I keep going at this rate we are going to be huge!\u201d  He grabbed his gut with both hands and shook it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac groaned.  \u201cWhy are you doing this to us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is a curse you know.  Do things that we say and we will hold off on unwanted changes, hell maybe even undo some changes if you are obedient enough.  Refuse and you will have to be punished I\u2019m sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMirror Deb seductively crawled on her hands and knees to Mirror Isaac and gave a pout.  \u201cOh I do hope we don\u2019t have to get punished\u201d. She said in a mock pouty face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do the mirror versions of themselves ask first?</span></div></div>",

It revealed the hint of what he may have called cleavage if he was bigger up top, wincing at the sight of his body. It would be the worst thing he was forced to wear if not for the white stretchy slacks that he had on that cradled his large backside, the last week had been hell for the girly looking college boy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebbie had insisted on picking on the girliest outfits for him, not willing to risk her waistline if the Mirror Duo did not like it. What was worse was she had made him change at the place, coming out and rating each outfit with increasing ferocity. Now Isaac was the proud owner of a wardrobe a plus sized girl would be proud of, filled with skirts, leggings, halter turtle neckes, tunics, and even work out gear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n None of his friends would hang out with him anymore, and rumors were spreading about him taking female hormones behind his back. The thing that hurt the most was meeting up with Sarah and her laughing her skinny ass off at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMessing with his flowing sleeves he would then take in the changes that had occurred in his body, much to his annoyance. While his weight had firmly remained on 186 pounds that was with him working out each day, going out in the silly tank tops and gym shorts to run each day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was even stranger was how exhausted he was feeling after every workout. Each day felt as if it was getting harder, and as he grabbed ahold of his flabby upper arm with his fat hand he thought he could press into it further. The Mirror had not made him gain weight this week but he could sweat it was converting his muscle into fat. Turning around and looking at his inflated bubble butt he could swear it was sagging more than the previous week. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrimacing as his fingers dug into the wide and bloated ass he heard the doorbell and sighs. Jiggling his way towards the door Isaac opens up to Debbie, the girl smiling idly at Isaac.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This last week was amazing!\" The woman announces as she slid on in, making her way inside and winking at the plus sized loser. \"I was so scared that I was going to-\" Her eyes drift over towards Isaac's pot belly. \"Gain weight anyway but look-\" Debbie gestures over her still thin and sleek frame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They were telling the truth!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac frowns at Debbie, it looking somewhat comical with his fat cheeks and what he swears was a more pronounced double chin. Shifting along with her he gestures for her to follow him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just get this over with... I haven't gained any weight but I haven't been able to lose any. Our changes might be frozen, at least in terms of weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Isaac led them to the mirror he took note of the Mirror Duo, each one looking the same size as they had last time. Mirror Isaac wearing the same girly outfit as him and appearing even more bloated then Isaac, his shirt slightly coming over his chunky belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMirror Debbie was still only slightly heavier, her starter belly pushing at her blouse and appearing to lack definition all over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two ready for the next task?\" Debbie asks, standing behind Isaac as he hands presses against his even larger ass. \"I know I am.\" Mirror Isaac calls out, winking at Isaac as he snacks on a donut, his lips, and chin covered in glaze. </span></div></div>",

He tried his best to keep up with the exercises on his mat but he always ended up on the floor covered and sweat and breathing heavy before the hour was up.  Meanwhile Debbie sat on a yoga ball in the corner of the room texting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter his second session was up he was walking back to car with Debbie when he said.  \"You know I got the raw end of the deal.  Why is it me who has to change my wardrobe and do these stupid classes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebbie just shrugged her shoulders.  \"You gotta do it.  You know what will happen to us.\"  It was easy for her to say he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did Debbie know this was an activity she was supposed to be participating in and there was going to be consequences for sitting this out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the week was up Isaac heaved out of bed with a grunt and stood on the scale.  Still 186 pounds to his relief.  He put on a blouse and some tan slacks without even thinking about it.  He was getting used to this being his life by now.  He put the magic mirror in an empty bedroom and didn't even open the door until it was time to talk to them.  He was tired of mirror Isaac slapping his fat belly and taunting him every time he walked by.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a knock at the door.  Debbie was here.  But when he answered she was wearing an oversized sweater with the hood up looking down.  \"Uh Debbie something wrong?\"  He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lifted her sweater to reveal a pot belly.  \"It was just here this morning I don't know what happened!\"  She said miserably.  \"You must have done something wrong!\"  She accused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac backed up.  \"No way!  I didn't gain any weight!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey opened the door to the mirror room and was greeting to the familiar sight of Mirrored Isaac looking heavier than the real  thing but this time Mirror Debbie was even chunkier than before.  She was laying on a bed and mirror Isaac was putting spoonfuls of fudge ice cream into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey whats the deal?\"  Debbie said indicating to her pot belly.  Mirror Debbie sat up and wiped chocolate cream from her face and belched.  \"You went to Aerobics with Isaac, but didn't participate.  What did you expect?\"  She burst into laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't know!  I thought it was like the clothes I thought I just had to make sure he did it.\"  She said sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMirror Isaac put down the ice cream carton.  \"Maybe we need a tougher challenge this week to let it really sink in for her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The one who was able to get the closest to a full outfit would be able to lose weight, the other would gain double this round. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe you messed up this hard.\" Isaac mumbles to Debbie, his hand reaching back to adjust his black slacks. The tubby boy was dressed up and tried to style his hair to appear more girlish, trying not to appear more out of place in one of the stores. Wearing form fitting slacks, a white cardigan, and a black shirt beneath it he could have been confused for a chunky girl on first glance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me!? You should have told me it could have been like this. It's your fault.\" Debbe hisses back at him, still appearing mildly uncomfortable with the minor chub that was now encasing her slight frame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuffing the pair would arrive at the Lane Bryant, feeling the intense humiliation of having to do this task as they enter. Debbie appeared to be left alone but a helpful plucky salesgirl walks up to Isaac, marking them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you need help today, miss?\" She asks with a wide smile, looking up and down Isaac's flabby pot belly and girlish looking chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac clears their throat and tries to lighten up his voice, doing what best attempts he could do to sound female. \"N-no... I'm just looking.\" They offer back, forcing a slight smile before the saleswoman grasps his hand and aims to drag him off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense, come along now! I'll help you pick out an outfit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebbie taking note of this begins to snicker, planning to take advantage of this distraction, her eyes shifting towards a more empty part of the store for her pilfering. </span></div></div>",

How could he steal anything with all of this attention on him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman staggered back and put her hands on her mouth.  \"Sir I am so sorry.\"  She blurted out.  Isaac felt his face grow red hot.  She must have finally realized he wasn't a woman.  \"I thought you were....\"  She looked up and down at him.  He was certainly dressed like a woman.  \"Well I mean if you identify as one thats ok to... I just... uh...\"  The woman looked mortified.  She didn't know if she misgendered a male or just misgendered someone who identified as female at this point and she didn't know how to react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Debbie was pretending to look through a clothing rack and slipped a blouse into her purse.  She was good like shes done this in the past.  It was great Isaac was providing such an excellent distraction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA manager overheard the commotion and rushed to Isaac and the saleswoman. \"I am so sorry for how you have been treated.  This is absolulty unacceptable.\"  She said giving the employee and infurating look.  Let me make this up to you.  She grabbed Isaac by the arm yet again and dragged him to the front.

We don't condone that kind of unacceptable behavior at Lane Bryant and I promise you she will no longer be an employee of ours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sales woman burst into tears.  Everything was going wrong!  He needed to steal something fast but now all of the attention was soley on him!  There was a beeping at the front of the store as someone set off the security sensor.  Debbie had already left with the things she stole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no hope for Isaac at this point.  The manager was promising in addition to the gift card that he will be receiving a discount on anything in the store.  He groaned as he felt his body begin to swell.  His breasts grew two cup sizes and his belly swelled out exposing his belly button.  His waist felt constricted as his ass widened as well.  This was a lot of weight to gain this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully he had a gift card though to get  a new outfit.  This was all Debbie's fault.  The mirror wanted to show her how serious the situation was and he was the one to get fatter over it!  It was so unfair, he had been so good up to this point.</span></div></div>",

His hand was reaching back and adjusting her new form fitting leggings, upset at being the full focus by the saleswomen. It was embarrassing enough to have to try and steal clothing he did not even want but being confused for wanting this was worst. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStumbling into his room he would look for his scale, trying to take on the full scope of the change. Before this recent bet, he had upsettingly been stuck at 186 pounds, the aerobics having not helped nor his attempts at dieting. The mirror enjoyed making him work on losing weight but stopped any loss from happening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow he was up to 217 pounds from not just taking his own punishment but Debbie's too, and he looked more girly than ever. His ass had widened, being more displayed in the pants as he turned around to gave at the full moon of a behind. Wincing he set his hand on a cheek, feeling it sink in from being little more then jiggly fat. His thighs were even thicker, and smacking one another in each chubby walk, making him wince at his no confusing it for male bottom half. His belly had become softer and expanded even further out, barely contained in his newly bought blouse, causing him to wince as he set it to jiggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat really took his attention was the apparent change to his chest, or perhaps he may as well just start calling them breasts. They appeared to be breaking C cups, and as the manager insisted on measuring him for his bra that was just what they were. His shopping bags have a few pairs now, along with a sports bra for his aerobics class, he was not willing to risk growing further by quitting. The arms were wider, soft and incredibly girlish but his face took more of his attention. The thick double chin made him wince, but his cheeks had inflated further, making it even harder to tell he was a man. Groaning he would begin to waddle off towards the mirror, intent to see the reflections. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMirror Isaac was even fatter now, but what made Isaac more grossed out was the Debbie putting makeup on his face, giggling as she was helping make him look more like a girl. Both were slurping up candies during this, but Isaac could swear that this Debbie had shrunk down to the same size the other Debbie was, he supposes she had already thinned down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice new duds, really brings out the best shape in you.\" Mirror Debbie says, finally noticing Isaac as they were layering Mirror Isaac with lipstick, muttering for him to pucker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, I don't think this was fair at all and I am just paying for Debbie's mistakes.\" He calls back, trying not to sound whiny but apparently failing. \"I don't deserve to be this size, it's just-\" His eyes gaze down, wincing at his flabby belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen lard ass.\" Mirror Debbie calls back, rolling her eyes. \"You had a chance to win, maybe you shouldn't have been such a wide target for the saleswoman.\" Mirror Isaac stuffed his face with further candies, chuckling to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac blushing would tighten his lips, clearly growing more upset and embarrassed by the state of his life. His body was more suited to an out of shape fat chick, and he now had a wardrobe filled with fat girl's clothing that was now his thin clothes. \"Just help me get back at Debbie! This was all her fault, was her mirror, she just stuck it on me and this extra weight too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Mirror Duo appeared to consider that, appearing wildly amused. <br>\r\n\"Well maybe you could-\"</span></div></div>",

Mirrored Isaac looked hopeful.  \"Are they going to do it in front of us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe real Isaac took the cutting board from Debbie's hands and flung it at the mirror like a frisbee.  The entire mirror cracked until it was like a thick web of cracks covering the entire surface so that nothing could be seen through it.  \"D-did it work?\"  Asked Debbie nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Isaac could answer the mirror started to look strange. The cracks melted together then it looked like rippling waves over the surface of water.  They both groaned.  It didn't work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were shapes in the mirror but were obscured by the rippling waves.  There was an odd grunting sound and heavy breathing coming from the mirror though.  Debbie squinted trying to make out what they were seeing.  \"What is that?\"  She asked before gasping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMirror Isaac was bent over a chair and Mirror Debbie was behind him thrusting.  \"What are you doing?\" Isaac asked.  Mirror Debbie tried looking surprised as if she had no idea they were in the room and stopped humping Mirror Isaac.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you guys knock before barging in a room?\"  She asked.  She stood up and the real Debbie let out a squeak.  Mirror Debbie looked exactly as she did before, except now she had a penis standing erect for all to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?\"  Isaac said.  Mirror Debbie looked down then pretended to be surprised at what she saw as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys should not have have done that.\"  She said looking back up at them and wagging her finger with a smile.  \"The punishment isn't that noticeable though.  I've only swapped your genitals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebbie let out another squeak and  looked down in the front of her pants in horror while Isaac put a hand down to see that his manhood was in fact no longer there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean not noticeable\" Debbie stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well not noticeable yet.  There are rules.\"  Mirror Debbie said unable to hide her jubilation. \"Yes these new parts come with rules.  From now on you guys need to start using public restrooms that match your new genitalia, or else there will be consequences.  Isaac you must use the ladies room.  If you go into a men's room by mistake then your hips and breasts will grow larger.\"   Isaac gulped nervously at the thought of getting a more prominent hour glass shape.  \"And you Debbie must start using the mens room.  And don't think you can hide in the stall either.  If you try to pee in a stall instead of using a urninal like the other guys your dick will grow larger. \"  Debbie looked to be on the verge of tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait does this mean people will now think we are a different gender?\"  Isaac asked hopefully.  Mirror Debbie laughed.  \"No they are going to be wondering why you are in the wrong bathroom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMirror Debbie mounted Mirror Isaac again and resumed what she was doing earlier.  \"I mean this is all you guys had to do.  Doesn't seem that hard.  I'll see you two next weekend for the next task.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both left the room and closed the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He faced the mirror and thought about what he said earlier. \"I, uh, wonder what I'd look like if I was . . .  a girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mirror rippled again. When it cleared a plump young woman stared back at him. She was pretty in a way. Her face looked like Isaac's, only much more feminine and cute. Her nose was small and button like and slightly upturned and she had plump, pillowy lips. Her brown hair fell in curls around her face. She was dressed just like him, jeans and a blue shirt, but hers were tighter and more feminine. They clung to her body and showed off her soft curves. Her breasts were on the large size, about D cups. Her stomach was a round pot belly, probably from the 20 pounds he'd just gained. Her hips were wide and curvy, supported by thick thighs. Her ass was quite round. She was definitely pear shaped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac felt a tingle surge through his body and got light headed for a moment. When it cleared, he looked down saw that he was now the girl in the mirror. He, now a she, grabbed her breasts and poked her belly. She turned and gave her thick rump a light slap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is pretty cool. Trippy, but cool,\" Isaac said. She looked back at the mirror. She cupped her breasts. \"What if these were bigger?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mirror rippled and her reflection was now much more busty. Her breasts were about the size of her head, H cups that stretched her shirt and showed off lots of fleshy cleavage. Isaac felt a pressure in her breasts and they swelled to match. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool,\" she laughed. For some reason she wasn't very worried. She wanted to use the mirror again. She grabbed her belly. \"What if this was fatter?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, the mirror rippled and now her reflections belly was a fat gut. Her shirt was tight around it and it peaked out a bit at the bottom. Her thick love handles formed a chunky muffin top and her belly propped up her tits. She looked to have gained about 25 more pounds. She felt warmth and she fattened to match the reflection. She laughed and grabbed her gut. She shook it and watched it jiggle. It was pretty soft. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she figured that was enough. Fighting the temptation to change herself more and make her parts bigger and curvier, Isaac looked at he mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make me my normal, skinny male self again,\" she demanded. </span></div></div>",

When necessary, I provide help,\" mirror Isaac said, monotonously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...why can't I change back?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most changes are permanent,\" the mirror answered. Isaac's stomach twisted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Explain!\" she demanded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This mirror is designed to help women, and men, become their ideal woman,\" the mirror explained. \"Should a man become a woman there is no going back. Regarding your other changes, the mirror only gives you what you want. If you really wanted to be skinny it would help, but you seem to want to be fat so that's what it will do. It is possible, if you are strong willed enough, to get it change you however you want, regardless of your hidden desire, but it tempt and fight you, seeking to fulfill your wishes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I want to be a guy again!\" Isaac shouted, almost hysterically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is not change the mirror is capable of,\" and then it was silent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac settled her thick body on a nearby chair as she thought about this. She was a girl. She would always be a girl. And worse, the mirror said she wanted to be fat. She knew that couldn't be true, but she could feel. She tempted to tell the mirror to make her ass bigger, to make her thighs thicker, to make her fatter. She wanted it badly. She had to resist it though. Do something. Just keep her mind off the mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Isaac, now Isis apparently, do? </span></div></div>",

In bold cursive letters it read across the envelope: <b><i>Wishing Coin</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac laughed.  Wishing coin?  He clutched it in his fist and thought for a moment.  This was silly, but he tried to think of something he could never do to wish for for fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I had boobs.\"  He finally said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his amazement two fleshy orbs began growing from his chest pushing out his shirt.  \"Holy shit!\"  He exclaimed as he grabbed them to see if they were real.  They were C cups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down at the coin again.  This was unbelievable.  The possibilities were endless of what he could do with this.  Money, success, anything!  For now he would try to return to normal however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I no longer had boobs.\"  Nothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarting to panic he opened the envelope.  The old handwritten letter that came with the envelope read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>Wishing Coin<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWish anything of your hearts desires and it shall come true.  The coin cannot create from nothing, anything gained must first be taken from something else.  The Wishing Coin is meant to be shared not to be kept by one person.  One person cannot make two wishes in a row.  They have to take turns.  If someone makes a wish they can't make another until someone else wishes on the coin.</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreat he was stuck with these breasts until he let someone else make a wish on the coin first.  What did the note mean about anything gained must be taken from someone else?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a sobbing from outside his dorm room.  Curiously he peeked outside and saw a crying flat chested blonde girl.  She was on the phone with someone.  \"They just disappeared.\"  She said.  \"No I am not joking I have no idea what is going on!\"  She said to the person over the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac looked down at the grinning horned devil on the gold coin.  Maybe this coin was more of a curse than a blessing.  He had to be careful to word his wishes correctly or it might twist them into something unwanted.

Its contents certainly jiggled around like coffee beans. A closer look revealed a multi-colored rainbow of what Isaac thought was candy, at first. But he recognized the capsule shapes instantly. Tiny little pills, no larger than aspirin. Each a distinct color that could easily be told apart from each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In some sense,\" Debbie said, clear impatience in her voice as she checked her watch. \"Your aunt was something of an alchemist, conjuring all sorts of strange things that she kept locked away in her mansion. But I shall not go into details because they are not necessary. The only thing you need to know is that these pills are necessary in order to make you the rightful heir. Forth which, you are to consume one pill a day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One pill a day?\" asked Isaac, hosting the jar to Debbie's face. \"Do you know how many pills there are in here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Precisely three hundred and sixty five. Or one pill a day for one whole year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're crazy. Why would I want to take these pills, who will do who knows what to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because, by completing this task, you will be sole the inheritor to all of your Aunt's earthly possessions. That includes her twenty different cars. Her mansion, which alone is pegged at about five million on the current market. And her overall fortune of one billion dollars.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac's mouth gaped open. \"Say what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard me correctly. If you complete this task, whatever the outcome, you will be a billionaire. But only when I so confirm you have succeeded in this task. Believe me, I will know. No flushing them down the toilet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac continued to stammer, clutching onto the jar of pills like it was a lifeline. He couldn't even process what a billion dollars looked like. And though he was far from being underprivileged as a college student, he was about ready to say that the college life was for the birds. He could spend a thousand dollars a day (his monthly rent) and still be nowhere near done with it all after twenty years. Comfortable living for as long as he lived. It was a hard opportunity to pass up, even if these pills got him addicted to something. Hell, with a billion dollars he could just buy himself a personal rehab center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see this has left you dumbfounded,\" continued Debbie as she dug around in her pocketbook and produced a white paper. \"Here's my card. Call me when the deed is done. I'll confirm it and we'll sign the proper papers to get you your fortune.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Debbie handed over the business card, a simple card with Arial font Debbie Hawkins, Fortune Attorney scribed on it with a phone number at the bottom. She then collected her things and made a hasty exit, leaving Isaac with his jar and a choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she didn't tell him was the effect of each pill. Isaac would have to find that out on his own, in time. That was why the old crone had arranged everything just so. A slow burn so that he wouldn't suspect a thing until he was too deep into it to back out. Debbie shuddered at that thought. Even in death, the witch was cruel and cunning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in his room, Isaac eyed up the jar, contemplating the facts that the simple thing was all that stood before him and fortune for life. He unscrewed the lid and...</span></div></div>",

Stupid!\" Muttered Alina under her breath as she zipped through the air, \"How hard is it to find a stupid dorm room, Alina?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hovered in the air momentarily, perplexed by the sheer amount of rooms that the dorm building she was trying to make sense of possessed. She was new to this whole \"fairy\" thing and she had never been particularly sharp, so she was starting to get worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night was waning. Though she couldn't see it yet, the sun would begin to make its way onto the scene before long, and she knew as much. She had been looking for this Anna Winters girl all night, but she hadn't had any luck. The room she had thought belonged to her was devoid of any furniture, so she knew that wasn't right. She did know, at least, that Anna lived on the 6th floor- at least, she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn desperation, she flew through a crack in a window on the 6th floor, deciding that whether this was Anna or not, whatever girl lived here would have to do. After all, she at least knew that universities usually divided girls and boys by floor, so this would work out well enough, even if she got berated by the Head Fairy later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow within the room, she shimmered softly and grew from a minute stature of roughly six inches to her full height. Garbed in a silky pink dress and tights, she would have looked ridiculous to anyone that set eyes on her. She looked every bit the fairy, from her thin, silver wand to her ornate tiara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept she was quite fat. That came with the territory, naturally. As she was the Freshman 15 Fairy, she was tasked with picking which girls packed on weight when they shipped off to school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hum of a still idle computer masked what little noise this portly fairy made as she stepped over a pair of jeans and stood before the mass on the bed, which was covered nearly head to toe in a mess of blankets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, here goes,\" she whispered to herself, \"I think they said to just lightly tap the wand and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did so and frowned. She expected some sparks or a light glowing or something. She tapped again, and again, and again, worrying that after all this trouble her wand had been a dud. Finally, it glowed strong enough to light up the whole room briefly. She held her breath in fear, worrying that she had awoken the girl beneath the covers. A snore spoke to the contrary, and she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My work here is done,\" she whispered, particularly pleased with herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shrunk back to her diminutive stature and zipped out of the room just as the first light of day was creeping over the horizon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crucial mistake she had made was that this floor was co-ed, and in turn the room she had flown into belonged to none other than our protagonist...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was as if he was a faulty battery that would only reach fifty percent charge no matter how long it was plugged in. He rolled out of bed and pulled his boxers out from between his butt cheeks. These usually felt looser, but he was hardly in the mood to care about such trivial developments. He deftly kicked his jeans- which remained crumpled on the floor- across his room and into his hamper, then rifled through his options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled on another pair of jeans, hopping once, twice, three times to do so. Had these always been tight? He buttoned them shut and zipped them up. They fit, certainly, but they were pretty uncomfortable. He sighed, shook his head, and unbuttoned them. He tried another pair of jeans, then a pair of slacks, and then a pair of shorts. Each pair fit (after some negotiating) but they weren't the comfort he was seeking if he was going to go eat some fluffy, buttery...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGod! He was hungrier than usual! He finally settled on a pair of black sweatpants which were truly comfortable. What was the deal with him? He looked at himself in the mirror in profile. Maybe all those squats he had been doing were starting to pay off?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes later, he was in line at the campus buffet. The walk over had been more tiresome than he remembered, but he was spurred on by the promise of pancakes. He got some chocolate chip pancakes, two servings of bacon, and some eggs, and dropped his rear end into a seat not far from the pancake station. His hunger seemed bottomless today, and he had never known to do anything other than satisfy his hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone's hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac looked up from his plate for the first time to see a slim brunette standing expectantly with her own plate of food in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmf- Lucy,\" he choked down his food, \"sit down, will ya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy sat infront of him, placing her own plate of pancakes opposite his. She lived next door to our protagonist, so the two had become friends over the course of the semester.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch my stuff,\" Isaac said as he stood up to go for seconds, \"The pancakes are great today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" said Lucy, \"But if I didn't know any better I'd say you were actively working on the freshman 15. You high or something? Got a case of the munchies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both laughed as Isaac readjusted his pants and made a beeline toward the pancake line, unaware of the fate Lucy (whom Alina had been looking for the previous night) had avoided at Isaac's cost.</span></div></div>",

Where they had usually outlined his shoulders and muscled chest and been snug on his chiseled arms, they now were kind of loose there and clung uncomfortably to a somewhat doughy midsection. His midsection wasn't the only thing that was growing though. What he had originally attributed to gluteal growth as a product of increased squat weight and repetitions proved to be a double dose of adipose on his backside and thighs. They were hardly huge- in fact he now looked more normal than anything, but Isaac felt incredibly out of shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe finished off a Snickers bar as the nurse called him into her office. He tossed the wrapper as she opened the door and let him in. He knew there had to be something wrong with him- a bug he was coming down with or something...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lemme make sure I follow you,\" the nurse said, looking at Isaac and then his file, \"decreased energy for exercise, increased appetite, and a shift toward a more sedentary lifestyle...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at his file once more and couldn't even suppress a smile. She was a heavy-set matronly woman just past 40.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've even put on exactly 15 pounds since your last check up. Is there really any doubt about what happened here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"15 pounds?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, you're at exactly 165 pounds as of today. You were 150 two months ago...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But this only started last week-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wouldn't hear such nonsense, \"Look, there's nothing to be ashamed of. College is stressful. Some people eat as a coping mechanism. The very fact you've come here today is a good sign. You can easily nip this thing in the bud. You're young. With your metabolism, you can drop this weight as if it were nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just remeber, calories in, calories out. Cut out the junk food-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rolled over in her chair and wiped a bit of chocolate from the corner of his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No more of these, huh?\" She continued, holding up the napkin to him, \"and increase your cardio. Come see me in a couple of weeks and I'm sure it will all have melted off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, more cardio,\" Isaac echoed her as he stood up. She looked over his slightly expanded form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know finals are coming up, and the temptation to indulge will be strong, but you have to fight it. This freshman 15 could turn into twenty or more if you aren't careful. If you keep this up, with your fat distribution, you could end up...what to the kids call it now, thick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac's cheeks went red. Was that a comment on his backside? His hands went there instinctively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll see you in a couple of weeks. Be good now!\"</span></div></div>",

Being new at this fairy business she wanted to make sure she was doing everything she was supposed to be doing.  She hid in a bush just outside the campus building and tapped her wand on the ground magically making an old dusty tome materialize into existence.  The cover simply read <b><i>\"Rules\"</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe book was just about as large as she was.  She creaked it open with both hands to a saved spot and read: <i>\"The fairy shall check in on the young woman a week later to see how she was coping with her 15 extra pounds.  If she seemed remorseful and was exercising and eating well, the fairy's work will be done.  The young woman will learn a life lesson.  However if the young woman continued to ignore her health the fairy is to cast another spell to make her gain more weight overtime.\"</i>  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlina snapped the book closed satisfied and poofed it away with her wand.  She fluttered up to the dorm room window and lifted up a cracked window a little higher so that she could squeeze her chubby little fairy body through the crack.  She fluttered to Isaac's room and gasped.  On the bed sat a boy!  He was looking a little doughy from the weight he gained.  He was sitting lazily on his bed watching a movie and eating a snicker's bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe panicked and her mind raced.  This wasn't supposed to happen.  It was young women that were supposed to be enchanted by the freshmen 15 fairy not a boy!  She didn't dare ask the other fairy's for advice or else risk ruining her chance at future assignments.  She had to keep it going and act like everything was under control.  This boy was obviously not paying attention to his diet still.  There was a loud crack as Isaac cracked open a can of soda.

She knew she had screwed up her assignment, but there were still rules she had to follow. No course of action was particularly appealing. Reporting her mistake to the High Council was out of the question, others had lost their wings for less!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't necessarily the EASIEST option, but it was the one that would cover up her mistake the best. A wrong name in the system wasn't unheard of- but a boy? That would set off some alarms. She aimed her wand through the window, considering the parameters of the spell. This boy deserved a shot to return to normalcy like anyone else. Maybe she caught him at a bad time, after all. She tailored the spell to continue his weight gain, and slowly turn him into a fully fledged female if he reached a certain point, but she also gave him an out. If he managed to lose weight, he would start to change back to himself, gender and all. In a way, it didn't feel all that cruel to Alina. Why did the fairies only target women, after all? This was the 21st century!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer wand zeroed in on her target and the spell had been cast. Isaac tilted his head back and chugged the soda he had cracked moments before. Alina looked down at her wand worriedly- maybe she had overdone it. With that, she was off once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac put a hand to his slightly bloated stomach and frowned. He felt a renewed hunger. The nurse had warned him to change his ways, but he had already been a bit naughty today. A text buzzed his phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pizza and flash cards?\" He murmured aloud as he scratched an almost imperceptibly softer chin, \"Now that seems like a good idea!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Want another cookie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine,\" said Lucy as she looked him over. He tried to pull his underwear out of his asscheeks to no avail as he plopped back down into his seat. He had invited Lucy over for some studying and she had accepted, but she felt that he was using studying as an excuse to stuff his fattening face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you feeling alright?\" Lucy asked, \"You've been acting really weird lately, and well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac frowned. \"Well what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been a couple of days since Alina had revisited and cast another spell on Isaac. He had been eating almost nonstop. If he wasn't eating a meal he was snacking, and if he wasn't snacking he was drinking some coffee with extra cream and sugar. The effects were obvious. His black sweatpants, seemingly the only pants he would wear nowadays, were becoming quite tight. His rear was pulling it between his cheeks along with his underwear, and his waist had grown to then point that the white drawstring that ran along the pants waistband had been pulled almost all of the way inside the pants. He had put on another 7 pounds in 5 days, bringing his total increase to 22 pounds. It had become undeniable to all his friends that Isaac had changed in more ways than one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're always eating,\" Lucy said slowly, unsure of how to comment delicately, \"and you've been.... well putting on quite a bit of weight. It's not the end of the world, but you need to slow down. I don't think I've ever seen anyone put on weight like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac's face went flush with embarassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-...\" he stumbled, \"I'm going to get it under control, just need to finish with Finals week and all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy nodded quickly, regreting she had even said anything, \"Duh! I know you will. I didn't really mean anything by it. It isn't even THAT noticeable or anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was lying through her teeth now, but she had never really been one for confrontation. Ignoring the problem seemed better for them at the moment. Either way, she needed to study too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the concern though,\" Isaac said, soothed somewhat by her most recent comments as he stuck a cookie in his mouth, \"Once finals week is over I'll start hitting the gym and fix up my diet. This weight will melt right off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, of course,\" Lucy said, \"I oughta go now anyway. Keep hitting the books!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe managed a quick goodbye as Lucy seemingly peeled out of his room, leaving the expanding boy to his own gluttonous devices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the door was shut, he put his hands over his waistband and squeezed the still relatively small lovehandles that had formed there. His cheeks went flush as he felt his crotch perk up and press against the tight material of his pants. His heart raced. That was... not a welcome development.</span></div></div>",

Gaining weight and having people he knew like Lucy making offhand comments about his weight bothered him.  It would be so much worse if ended up in a situation where he didn't fit into his clothes.  Isaac's belly was so tight in his shirts that he now wore a sweater to try and hide his fat.  The black sweat pants he had been wearing was getting tight and he needed a change of clothes.  After his last final he gave in to buy a new wardrobe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all of the money he had been spending on fast food he was low on funds so he went to a thrift store.  Isaac tried on a few pairs of jeans with big waistlines.  Some of the larger ones felt find around his big hips, but were really tight in the thigh.  In the dressing room after taking off another pair of jeans that didn't fit right he looked down at his thick flabby thighs in disgust.  \"You would think they would make the thighs bigger on these fat guy jeans.  Why don't they seem to fit me?\"  He knew deep down inside that he was getting a feminine pear shape but he didn't want to think about it too much.  He reluctantly went to the womens section of the store and found jeans that fit the shape of his body better.  He got some oversized shirts and sweaters and purchased some clothes and went back to the dorm room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt home Isaac looked at himself in the reflection.  Women's jeans were almost too form fitting for his new shape.  Not trying to draw more attention to the shape of his lower body he got jeans that were a bit baggy so they would not show off his shapely behind.  He made sure not to get any jeans that said things like Juicy Couture or Apple Bottom.  Feeling a little better he looked at his rounded face.  He knew his cheeks were fatter but his face seemed different for some reason.  His features seemed softer, his eyebrows thinner, and even his lips different.  His hair was getting shaggy again.  \"Damn it I just got a hair cut two days ago why does it keep growing so fast?\"  He grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the other Room Alina pried open the window to check back in on him.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Like an invisible force pushed him from behind. His hands instinctively reached for his breasts where something was feeling odd but Alina tapped her wand again as red and yellow light reached his head this time. It was the most wonderful feeling Isaac felt in a long time. Isaac felt a floating sensation as every thought and worry in his head was wiped gently away, leaving nothing but a vague, untraceable relax. What was he doing again? Checking his hair, right? Well he looked good. He was worried before that the new clothes won't fit, but on the contrary he did look amazing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlina nooded admiring his work. By the time the supervisor would see him, it would not have guessed it was a boy anymore. With those new curves Isaac indeed seemed more a girl than a boy now. Maybe just another thing, she thought for a second as she nervously tapped her wand again two times. The pink light flew again in the room reaching for Isaac face: his already bigger cheeks melted around his cheekbones giving him a more femine form, while his adam's apple disappeared under his double chin. \"Perfect\" exclaimed Alina \"he does look like a rather chubby tomboy now\". She sheat her wand and flew away, unknown of her damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy as a blessing Isaac returned to his sofa. Something important kept scratching his head. He just returned from the mall and something was bothering him but he can't put a finger on it. Since his final was done he could spend some time with his friend. Lucy however was out of question: it seemed the only thing she was good was to criticize him. He knew he was fat but what could he do about it? He liked to eat (or however that was part of Alina's spell). He thought about it for a second: why not having a fun-night with Becky? Becky was his and Lucy friend. She did weight quiet a lot too. After the Freshman 15 Fairy hitted her the situation only went worse. Lucy of course did warn her about her gaining but only managed to push her away. Maybe Isaac could spent some time with her now, how many months did passed since they last meet? Seven? Eight? He could not remember.</span></div></div>",
