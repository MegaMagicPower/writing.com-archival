You took your bag full of money and smashed a tv store window and then jumped through the hole in the glass. There was no where else to go. After a few seconds the store became completely surrounded by cops. You began to panic but you weren't ready to surrender.

You have no loyalty and would leave your crew to die as long as you have a bag full of money. You feel slightly loyal to your friend Carlos as he saved you before as you were pinned down by 8 policemen and were cut off from your team. Here you are robbing another bank with the getaway car around the corner. You walk in and take your position and then Carlos comes in and takes his position and then the rest of your crew. Once everyone is inside you give the signal and shoot to guards dead and hear screams and tell everyone to remain quiet and then 4 members of your team go in to the safe taking all the money and you and 4 others keep lookout. You get handed a black rucksack full of millions of pounds and at the same time hear sirens going off in the distance. You take a defensive position at the door and call the getaway driver and he says be there in 3 minutes. Police cars pull up outside and you open fire killIng 6 police and shout be careful and if anyone gets trapped you leave them behind. You wait a few seconds until you see a police man look up from behind a car you quickly aim at him and pull the trigger sending 6 bullets at him and luckily for you one hits him in the head. Your mag has run dry so you change it and take a mental note that you only have 9 left. You hear over your microphone I'm ready boss! so you go up to the second floor and cover the escape and tell everyone to get to the van when it arrives. So you say down the microphone were ready now. The police start to shoot the van so you use it to your advantage and get a few more kills but more and more cars appear. You see that only four people need to get to the van so you reload and nod your head and everyone runs out and you cover them. When they get to the van they pull Carlos out and you see them drive off and the last thing you hear is you always were an idiot Kane and you hear your team laughing. You think to yourself I knew this was comming luckily I planed ahead and bring out a remoted detonator and push the button and the van blows up. The police are stunned and this gives Carlos enough time to get inside and he runs to you and says nice way to handle traitors boss. You reply yeah but we are trapped. You continue we are going to have to surrender or die. You both end up walking out with your hands up. The police sergeant walks up to you and arrests you both and throws you in a car.</span></div></div>",

A light comes to life and you see blood around the chair and all over the floor but you can tell it's old as it's dried out. You are then spoken to by what sounds like a female voice that asks why did you blow up the van? You respond they were traitors they left us to die. You then hear her say so you didnt know your bag was empty? You reply I thought they would steal my bag later not give me a empty one. A jumpsuit is thrown at you and you hear her say since you have been cooperative I won't have to fight you and for the first time you see what your talking to. Your surprised it's a beast but just glare at it with hatred. You think to yourself there's no way I can kill this on my own. She then says I'm a Nidoqueen and I'm the police chief here. You pick up your suit and she says your friend is waiting for you outside. You walk out and meet up with Carlos who shows you your cell and your surprised your in the same one. You get changed into the suit and lie down and sleep. You get shock awake by a man in his 30's with one eye and a beard he says I'm Paul and I run this joint. You aren't used to letting people walk over you so you headbut him and Carlos follows you by jumping of the top bed and landing on top of 2 thugs you both snap all there necks and the police run in and you both say to each other nice job. The police say the chief wants you now move! You both get pushed into the dark room and you hear the familiar voice saying causing fights already and killing the biggest criminal in here impressive you suddenly feel a hand touch you under your chin which shocks you and you grab the arm to find it feels like rock but fleshy. The light then comes on and Carlos covers his eyes the sudden light hurting him and you ignore the pain looking the chief in the eye and she says I can use a man like you. It will shorten your sentence to 3 years from 8 years you both immediately say you will do it. You then sent back to your cell and you thinking easy enough just kill the people she tells you to and we will be payed and given weapons. You go back to your cell and the nidoqueen comes to you much later handing you an envelope which is heavy. You open to reveal 2 pistols 2 ammo clips full and a picture of your target so you head out to were it says he will be hiding the pistols and all the police leave you alone and you get to the spot the guy is meant to be at and see that he is there with 10 guys for backup. So you wait 10 minutes and no one leaves so you read the targets profile which says he runs a gang so you think this must be his gang and let Carlos know and tell him your just going to walk up and shoot them dead and get back to the cell fast. Everything goes to plan and when you get back to the cell there's a new envelope containing 500 pounds each.</span></div></div>",

You decide to just sleep as theres no obvious way and your to tired to think straight. You wake up to a policeman shaking you violently and says in a commanding voice get up for inspection! You are then grabbed and thrown out the room skidding across the floor into a wall. You see Carlos running toward you he shouts you ok Kane? You reply yeah but I'm going to kill this guy as you get up from the floor. You run toward the policeman only to be grabbed by the chief and taken around the corner before anyone notices. Your about to punch the chief in the face but before you do you realize it's her and stop. You hear her say we have to make this look real. You reply fine and glare at her and she says sorry I didn't warn you and here's your next contract handing you a large brown envelope. She says good luck. You ask her where do you come from and she says river pine forest. You think to yourself I seen that on a map it's on the west of this island. She says goodbye and slips away so you and Carlos go back and stand in line. The police are almost done and warn everyone that they will find the inmates that are the murderers or the murderer. Your all dismissed and you go into your cell and you open the envelope to receive a page with the identity of the next hit and your surprised to get 2 assault rifles and 4 ammo clips. You tell and Carlos and he says here the old equipment handing you 2 pistols and says unfortunately we have no more clips and heres the \u00a31000 handing you a large set of pound notes. You both get ready and hide the envelops with the money but take all the equipment because you think if the police are giving away assault rifles this must be going to be hard. You and Carlos go to the courtyard and after approximately 30 minutes you see your prey he's surrounded by a gang of 15 men. You tell Carlos we will wait till some of them leave. You start to get impatient and ask Carlos can we take them? He says probably so you say let's get ready ready so you take out your assault rifle and pull the bar back and aim it and say on 3... 1... 2... 3 you both pull the trigger killing 8 instantly and injuring the rest so you run up and break all there necks to save ammo as you think to yourself I don't trust these police as you never give a prisoner a gun so you want to be prepared for anything. After killing them all you go back to your cell and open the new envelope which has another contract fresh clips and boxes of ammo. You think wow are we killing everyone? You read the contract and see it's kill a beast just like the chief. You show Carlos and he is shocked as he has no idea how to kill it and you have no idea either. So you decide to take all your guns fully loaded and try to find the beast. Eventually you find it in it's cell sleeping so you walk in and the beast wakes up and grabs you so you both start shooting it and you hear it grunt and drops you. You hear a female voice saying why you trying to kill me so you both stop firing and say there's a contract on you. She says shes innocent but you know she is worth \u00a35000 for each of you. You both look at each other and say sorry we will take the money and start shooting until she's dead and you return to your cell to see another envelope that has a note which reads nice job you two, we will have more jobs for you tomorrow. You also find the money and you were right \u00a35000 each so you put all your money in one envelope and all of Carlos in another and hide them again and the guns. You then go and get some food and then come back and go to sleep.</span></div></div>",

Carlos wants to sleep so you decide to go to river pine forest so you buy a car and get on your way. You arrive at a store called poke centre and go inside and ask the sales woman were you are and she says river pine forest. You say oh good and can you tell me were I can get a... (you spot a picture on the wall of a nidoqueen and see that the younger version is a nidoran) nidoran please. She says go outside go right and you will come to a forest and you should find some there and she hands you a poke ball and says press this button and throw this at it to catch it and press this button and throw it again to release it. You reply thanks and how much is this? She says first ones free and don't shoot anything pointing at your assault rifle. You smile and say I won't. You say goodbye and she says goodbye and walks off so you look around. You find so many things you can't believe it. The amount of different abilites and the amount of pokemon has you in a state of shock. You can't believe you had never heard of one before going to prison. After 10 minutes of looking around you decide to go and find one. The Womans directions take you to a dark forest you think that if you were a kid you might be frightened but as a stone cold killer it does nothing to you. You start to walk into the forest and you feel as though something is watching you but you ignore it. Walking on you come to a kid sitting talking to a pokemon that looks like a turtle he suddenly looks up and says hi mister never seen you around here before. You notice he's watching your gun and you think perhaps I shouldn't have brought it. He dosent mention it though he just says are you trying to find a pokemon and you reply yes a nidoran and he says oh male or female? You respond with female and he says I think I saw one go that way and he points in the direction behind him so you say thanks and walk off and he shouts anytime mister. You walk on and theres no dignity of any pokemon so you stop and sit down under a tree and get that feeling that your being watched again so you take out a bar of chocolate and start eating suddenly something drops from the tree onto your head and you look up to see a nidoran collecting oranges and it stops looks down and sees you and says sorry I didn't see you there. You reply that's ok want some help and she says yes please. So you get up and start to collect oranges and you suddenly think to yourself what's happened to me 2 years ago I would have killed these pokemon and left Carlos to die not help him and the pokemon. You shrug off the thought and continue helping the nidoran and you soon have a pile of about 50 oranges so you stop and so does she and you both start eating. People come and go some say hello some just keep to themselves. The nidoran then says wow some of those people are always trying to cache me I wonder what made them stop today. You reply I don't know. She then says want to do something and you say sure and just as you do the thing that was following you jumps out of a tree it is</span></div></div>",

She then asks weres Carlos you say at his house. You then eat another orange and offer the chief one and she takes it and says thanks and eats it. The nidoran is smiling with a face covered in orange juice and you smile and wipe it's mouth with your sleeve and she says thanks and hugs you. The Nidoqueen laughs and says I see you made a friend smiling. You pick some more oranges and set them on the pile and you say yes smiling back and hugging the Nidoran. You then see apples and start picking them and putting them on the pile and the Nidoqueen says you up for a job and you say what kind? She says take care of that Nidoran and you ask what is so special about her and the police chief says she is my daughter. You almost choke on your apple and the police chief continues I will pay you of course and after you have recovered you say keep your money I will look out for her for free. She says your not as greedy as you seemed. Suddenly people start walking past and giving you strange looks and a few ask why your taking orders from a pokemon. You reply this is the chief of police. The kids and parents say oh and walk on but some don't seem to believe you and seem to think pokemon are below them. You ask the Nidoqueen what's with them and she says there ignorant fools that think cause there rich and have lots of pokemon no one else matters. The Nidoqueen then says by the way I need you to catch my daughter in a pokeball so no one else can take her. You say uhhhh ok. you try to remember what the woman said press the button then throw it at the pokemon. You give it a try and lucky for you it works and the ball rolls and then stays still so you walk over and pick it up and press the button and throw the ball and the Nidoran appears so you pick up the empty ball and the Nidoran starts hugging you again so you hug her back feeling her rock hard skin. The Nidoqueen says I better go back to the station see you later and you say goodbye and so does Nidoran. You start to think of a way to make money.</span></div></div>",

You reply I will don't worry and then you ask were can I get a poke ball? She points behind her at a desk and says over there but they all cost different prices. You say money is not a problem for me. You walk over to the desk and see all different kinds and colours of poke balls. You take 3 of each and you tell her your ready to buy so she comes over and says that will be \u00a32500 you lift out from your pocket \u00a3100,000 and take 3 of the pound notes and she says thank you very much and hands you a bag and puts the money in the register. You then ask her what's the difference in the poke balls and she says lifting up a purple ball this is the best poke ball it will catch anything. Then she lifts up a orange ball saying this will catch nearly every pokemon. Lifting up a blue ball she says this is slightly better than the standard red poke ball so it won't catch strong pokemon. Then she says the red one is better at catch weak or weakened pokemon but some pokemon will be able to break free. You say thanks storing all this information in your head. You then say goodbye and she says have a nice day. You go out to your car and get in and start driving. The Nidoran then asks were are we going? You say my house and do you have any idea of how to make money? She says hmmmmm how about selling ice cream you say not a bad idea. You then ask how much is one ice cream worth and she says \u00a32-\u00a35 depending on what your selling you say ok. How much do oranges, apples, and bannas sell for? She replies \u00a33-\u00a35 why? You say I'm thinkin we sell ice cream, apples, oranges and bannas to the people at river pine forest town we might be able to make some money. She says nice idea. You are just about to drive into your driveway when you see Carlos comming toward the driveway so you drive into it. He says I wondered were you went you reply shopping and thinking of how to make money. He says oh ok what you have in mind? You say selling food to people. He says your joking right and you say no we made enough money in prison no sense going back for being greedy. He says I suppose your right and I'm going out now to get a car and some things. You say ok see you later and he walks away. You open your door and get out an the Nidoran does the same and gets out and closes it. You both go inside your house and she says you never told me you were in prison. You say does it matter? She says not really you seem like a nice guy to me. You make 2 burgers and the Nidoran says wow this house is huge you smile and say yes and it's our house now giving her a hug and she hugs back. You leave the burgers for a minute and put your gun away and go back to cooking.</span></div></div>",

She says yes very much and you start thinking perhaps we could sell these so you ask how much do you think we could sell these for and she says \u00a35-\u00a37 perhaps we would have to try it. After you finnish eating you decide to go and see how much a barbecue costs. You both get in your car and you drive to the nearest shop. You start looking around for the shop and you start thinking there no barbecues here until you hear the Nidoran say I think I found them and grabs your hand leading you around the shop getting weird looks from other shoppers. You find one so buy it and more burgers and ask the Nidoran if she wants to try selling them now or tomorrow and she's says now. You think to yourself I have \u00a32,200,000 so I'm rich enough but that won't last forever. You both get in the car and head to river pine forest. When you get there you see that more people are there so you ask people if they would like a burger for \u00a35 and you get 30 customers and you say hold on I will set up the barbecue so you and Nidoran set everything up and you start cooking. You give the last person her food and she says thank you very much and you say you will be here nearly everyday. Nidoran comes over and says can you get me a apple please? You say sure and ask her to put the barbecue away. She says ok and you walk away until you find a apple tree and a orange tree so you take 3 of each and head back. You think to yourself we made \u00a3150 already. You get back to see your Nidoran surrounded by kids that look to be 16 and you walk over and hear them shouting at her you think to yourself lucky I brought my pistol. You pull a kid out of your way hand your Nidoran the fruit and say what's going on here? They then say nothing that concerns you old man. You say you obviously don't know who your talking to. One kid pushes you saying this is our turf you can't sell here unless you pay us. You say this is my last warning leave or I will kill you. You put your hand on your gun that they cant see and ones about to kick Nidoran in the face so you pull it out and point it at him and you say don't even think about it. Some of them scream run so they all retreat. You think maybe next time I will bring Carlos for backup or else give Nidoran some weapon training. You then ask Nidoran if she is alright and she says yes they came at me after I put the barbecue in the car and started threatening me when you showed up. You say ok well lets go to a gun shop I'm going to teach you how to use a gun. You both get in the car and she starts eating and says thanks for getting me the food and protecting me. You say anytime. You get to the gun shop and start buying assault rifles and pistols and lots of ammo and targets. Then say ok we are ready to start training you. You both get in the car with the equipment and head home. You set up the targets and show her what to do then empty the pistol and give her a fresh clip and the pistol and say your turn. She does it expertly and you say nice job smiling and you then give her an assault rifle and she used it expertly to so you lay out all the guns and ask which one you like best?

You put your arms around her and she jumps from shock and you smile as she blushes. You spend 5 minutes holding each other and then you ask her if she wants breakfast and she says yes can I have a burger so you make 2 burgers and you both eat them and you call Carlos and say I will pick you up in 10 minutes and he says ok I will eat and get dressed and you hang up. You both finnish and you say I am going to get dressed be back in a minute and she says ok I will wait here. You put on a black tracksuit and black trainers and go out of the bedroom and get the guns. You and Nidoran get in the car and go to Carlos house and he comes out dressed like you carrying his guns. He walks up and gets in the back and says I guess there a special reason your bringing her you reply there is. He says I hope you know what your doing. You start driving to the police station and when you get there you all get out and go in and say you want to see the chief. You eventually get in and ask her about gangs in River Pine Forest. She says there's one very powerful gang why? You respond we are going to kill them all for threatening us. She says there is a contract worth \u00a3250,000 on them so you can kill them legally if you take it. You say ok thanks and you all go back to your car. You drive to a shop nearby and search for burgers and buy 100 peoples worth and some coal and matches. You go back to your car and drive on to the gun shop again and go inside. The salesman says hello again what can I do for you? I need a M249 SAW machine gun. He says ah nice choice very nice and crouches behind his desk searching until he finds the right box. He says ah here we go heaving a large crate onto the table and opens it. He says you can take outside to try so you do and say thanks. You fire off a few rounds and go back inside and say it works perfectly I will take it. He says that will be \u00a37000 so you pay him and he gives a free 1000 bullet box of ammo and you say thank you very much. He says anytime. You go out to your car get in and head toward River Pine Forest. You stop a short distance away and tell Carlos to take the M429 and set it up in a defensive position. He says ok and gets out sprinting into the forest. You drive on toward the Poke Centre and get out and set up the barbecue. You have your assault rifle under your jacket and your pistol in a holster on your left. As you start to get customers the teenagers appear saying didn't we tell you old man not to come here. You reply you kids think your tough don't you being in a gang and having a rusty pistol each. They start laughing saying big talker your outnumbered and we are a powerful gang. You notice everyone has fled to cover so you say how many of you are there? They reply 30 and with that 24 more come out from behind the poke centre. You shout so this is what you call a powerful gang. You spot Nidoran get her assault rifle without anyone noticing and taking a defensive position. You say so how much it cost to sell here? They start thinking of a number and you pretend to get your wallet and grab your assault rifle. Carlos must have noticed as he opens fire distracting the teenagers and you dive behind a thick tree trunk and see Nidoran open fire so you open fire to. The teenagers are screaming and don't know were to run there caught in a crossfire. Within a minute there all dead and Carlos comes over and you both loot the dead and say to each other that was awesome and you say to Nidoran you were the best and she hugs you. You hear something land on your car and turn around as fast as you can to see a familiar brown envelope and you open it to see a note just as exciting as always Kane and Carlos you two are good hitmen. You both smile reading this and split the 250,000 2 ways and you start cooking burgers and the crowd seems to have settled so you pretend the bodies aren't there. Some of the people from yesterday are back and get a burger for there pokemon as well and some comment on how good you 3 are with guns. You just smile at the people and take there money and give them food. You notice Nidoran sitting on her own so you go to her and ask if somethings wrong and she says no I was just thinking about what I would do without you. You say don't worry I always be here for you. She hugs and seems to be a bit happier. You see that Carlos is making the burgers so you go to the Poke Centre and find something for Nidoran to drink. You notice all drinks come in 6 packs so you buy one and give them to Nidoran. She starts smiling and says the drinks nice you smile and say good and kiss her and she blushes. You notice some people staring at you and you say what? They keep staring so you ignore them and Carlos says we are out of burgers. So you say pack up and tell the crowd we will be back in an hour just ran out of burgers so you all get in the car and drive home. You drop Carlos off and tell him to get a car as they will need it and to get 300 burgers and another barbecue, coal and matches. You then head home and when you get home you and Nidoran go inside and you put today's money you made from the burgers on the table which is \u00a3500 and you take the \u00a3125,000 you made from the contract job and give it to Nidoran and say buy something you like. She is extremely shocked and excited that she dosent know what to say and it sounds like she is saying th...th...wo..th...wo..thank you. You hug her and tell her to get ready to go shopping.</span></div></div>",

You spot a sapphire ring and think it looks nice so pick it up and you notice Nidoran is studying all the jewellery so you walk quickly over to the saleswoman again and say I will take this and she says who's the lucky lady and you say no one. She puts it in a bag and you pay her. She smiles and you smile back and walk over to Nidoran. She points out 3 things she likes 1 is a necklace, another is a bracelet and the other is a ring and each is made from diamonds. You lift them up and take them to the saleswoman again and she puts them in a bag and Nidoran says to you she wants to pay as you open your wallet so you say you sure?

You park outside and walk up and in through the main doors and tell the policewoman behind a desk that you want to see the chief and she says alright I will see if she wants to see you. The policewoman phones the chief and says I have a man and a Nidoran wanting to see you. You hear a mumbling sound and then the policewoman says you may enter. You walk down the hall and into the room the chief uses to see her siting behind her desk. The chief says you wanted to see me? You say yes we were wondering if there's a law that says pokemon and humans can't be married. She says there isn't. upon hearing this Lisa starts jumping up and down going yippee. The chief gives her a strange look and you put your arm around Lisa and say do you like the jewellery? The chief says yes but what's with the sapphire ring? You say that's my engagement ring. She then says you two got engaged without consulting me first looking angry. You reply rather quickly well it happened so fast yesterday. The Nidoqueen laughs I am just messing with you and I knew I have people watching you closely. You say ohhhhh! You then ask you got any contracts and she says not at the moment. You say wow that's the first time you never had one. She then says there is one thing the gang members you killed before at River Pine Forest unfortunately one go away and it just happened to be the leader so the gang may make a come back. You then say thanks for your time and leave. You get in your car and head to another place that the poke centre said there was pokemon at. You get out of the car and notice the area is mostly made of caves so you start to wander around and find the poke center. You go in and see to your shock the place is being robbed so you slip back out and run to your car and get the M249 and think good job I never took this out of the car. You run back to the shop and aim at one robber and you blow his head and arms off. Everyone looks at him and then you and they go for there guns so you shoot them all and they all seem to do the same as the first guy explode and/or limbs fall off. It turns out there were only 4 robbers. You go in and see civilians cowering against a wall and say is everyone all right. They all reply yes so you say ok. You take your gun and put it in your car and take the robbers guns, ammo and money but give all the stolen shop stuff back and ask what kind of pokemon can you get around here? Lots of replies are OX so you think you might catch one.</span></div></div>",

You come across 2 kids watching something so you venture forward. The kids spot you comming but ignore you and go back to watching something. You then see it's a kid getting her pokemon to fight a OX and you think perhaps there's more in here. You see the end of the battle and you realize that the girl has a Charmander and think it would be good to have one of them but one walk past and continue going until it gets so dark you cant see so you throw a flare and nearly scream as you notice there's a OX right infront of you. You quickly grab a orange poke ball and throw it at it. The ball rocks from side to side and eventually it stops and Lisa says did you get it you say I think so. You pick up the ball and head back to the car and on the way back decide to stock up on a few more poke balls. You take 2 of each and think of heading to a tournament place you seen advertised in the poke center. You ask Lisa if she wants to fight and she says no. You say ok and bring out OX and ask him do you want to fight in the tournaments and he says yes. So you get in your car and head there. You arrive and sign OX up and get ready. You go out and put Lisa on your shoulder and you tell OX to fight how he does best. He says ok and goes first and you follow behind. Your opponent comes out and faces you and he throws out what looks to be a male Nidoran and your nearly 100% sure OX can take him. It starts out bad OX gets hit in the head and stomped on until he gets annoyed and hurls himself at the male Nidoran knocking him out and catching him off guard. It's then declared your the winner and you and Lisa cheer over the crowd. You then say good fight OX. He smiles and you put him in your poke ball. You get approached from one of the owners who says here's your winnings and you can fight again or try again some other day and hands you \u00a3100 you say thanks. He leaves and you take OX out and ask him do you want to fight again and he says yes. You say try being more offensive this time. You go out again and your fight starts. You see your opponent is a young female and she brings out a female Pikachu. You think you read somewhere that OX is resistant to Pikachus attacks. The speaker announces that the fight may begin! OX runs at the Pikachu and she dodges and fires electricity at him. They keep this up for a few more hits and Pikachu gets cocky and OX changes attack and as he predicted smacks her head first and with luck she recovers but barely. OX quickly hits her again this time knocking her out. After the fight you get \u00a3200 in winnings and meet the opponent. While you talk girl, OX talks to Pikachu and Lisa sits on your shoulder. The girl asks were you found a female Nidoran and you say in River Pine Forest. She says thats the one place I hadn't looked. Lisa starts taping your face so you turn around and she gives you a kiss and the girl laughs and says you always let her do that and you say yes she's my girlfriend. Lisa then says I'm hungry and you ask what you want then? She says chips and sausages. You say ok and say to the girl want me to buy you lunch. The girl says sure.</span></div></div>",

The waiter brings your drinks and says your meal won't be much longer. You say ok thanks. You start thinking perhaps I will buy a push knife as it could come in handy if I get in a close quarter fight. You come back to reality as a plates set in front of you and you all dig in. You start to think this place does some good food and take another bite of a sausage and wonder if Lisa likes it as much as you do so you turn your head to see her stuffing 5 chips in her mouth. She seems to notice your looking at her and turns her head looks you in the eye and smiles so you smile back. You decide to put your arm around her and she moves closer to you and rests her head against you. You then kiss her and say I you love you getting strange looks from the people around you so you say what? Can't I love someone. Everyone turns away and you kiss Lisa again and she says I love you to and you both go back to eating. you finnish then pay and wait for everyone to be ready to leave. You then go out and Courtney and Pikachu go there separate ways so you put OX back in his poke ball and say I want to go somewhere before we go home. Lisa says ok. You go into the gun store and ask him do you sell push blades? He says yes but there not the normal ones these have rings which go over your fingers. You say let me see them. You notice the blades are a few inches thicker than normal to so you try 2 on and they seem to be good enough so you try putting one on Lisa and they fit perfectly so you buy 4 of them. You say I will take these 4 and he says ok that will be \u00a34000 you say ok and pay him. When you get outside you put 2 of them on and ask Lisa if she wants hers on and she says yes so you take them out and put them on her.

The movie makes you both laugh at times and it comes to a end. You notice there's another movie comming on in 5 minutes so you both wait for it hoping you will get away with a free movie. You both see that no one comes in and you both say at the same time were is everyone? Suddenly a boy and girl walk in with 2 big pokemon following. They ignore you and sit near the front of the room. You ask Lisa have you ever seen them before? She says yes they always fight with pokemon and there trainers or just wild pokemon. You then say if they do anything leave the talking to me. She says ok and hugs you. The film starts and you see it's about a man and his plan to own all pokemon and beat every trainer. You think it's a not bad movie but Lisa seems to like it and occasionally you both laugh and get dirty looks from the 2 trainers down the front. The movie gets funnier and funnier and you both laugh more and more and the 2 trainers come over and say would you 2 shut up. You stand up slipping on your push blades saying is that a order? The female says calm down we are just trying to enjoy a movie. You say wise choice. The male however thinks differently saying if the old timer wants a fight I will give him a fight! The female says no ones fighting anyone we are going to be peaceful. You are suddenly surprised and shocked to see Lisa holding her assault rifle and pointing it at the male.

You laugh watching them retreat and when the see you sit down and that you don't take the gun off Lisa they shout are you not going to take that gun off her? and you say no it's hers she can do what she wants with it.

The pokemon just stands there and takes the impact without even flinching. The pokemon repeatedly smacks OX all over his body. OX looks to be in bad shape and the other opponent shouts finnish him! so you shout OX trip him up! OX wraps himself around the pokemons legs and push himself against it toppling it. The opponent is shocked and shouts get him quick! The crowd is going wild chanting names. OX starts to wrap himself around the pokemons neck and the pokemons arms are flying across OX trying to grab him to chuck him off. OX keeps constricting until the pokemon is unconscious and you win. The opponent shouts you fight dirty! You laugh and walk off and the opponent carries off his unconscious pokemon. You say you did good OX. He says thanks but I think I will take a rest now. You say ok and put him back in his pokeball. Lisa then says let's go back to the cinema so you get in your car and drive off. You arrive and go in and take 2 seats for a random movie.

It eventually comes to a end and you see the next movie is the other guys so you sit back down and wait the 20 minutes. 6 people come in as a group and sit down near the front row. They pay no attention to you and after a few minutes they spread out and you quickly slip on your push blades as you never liked the look of this gang and the symbol on there clothes looked oddly familiar. Lisa takes out her assault rifle and pistol and loads both and hands you the rifle without anyone else knowing what was happening. One member who must be the leader walks over and says we booked this room now leave. You say is that a threat? He replies yes now get out. He pulls out a old beat up pistol and before he points it at you Lisa shoots him and you both drop to cover. You tell her I will take left you take right. She says ok. The other gang members are shouting orders and you notice how unprepared they are as some trying to load there guns dropped them. While others start approaching you from all angles. You see Lisa crawling under the chairs and think that was a smart idea. You peek around a chair and see 2 men comming at you so you wait for them to get a small bit closer. They close enough that you can easily get them in the iron sights and fire of a few rounds. You get 1 through the head and miss the other. You think ah damn it! Everyone fires at you so you stay crouched but sprint down the other side of the room and wait again. The same guy you missed comes around the corner to see a empty chair so you open fire at the unsuspecting man killing him instantly. You hear more gun fire and hear them say there under the chairs! so you stand up and open fire were you think  you heard the voice come from and hear a woman scream in shock and hit the floor like a sack of potatoes. You then think only three left and to snap you back to reality you feel a hard cold hand on your foot and look down to see Lisa smiling so you move back and pull her up. You suddenly hear footsteps and jump up and quickly aim and fire. You kill that last enemies but take a bullet in your left shoulder making your arm go limp. You grunt and say huskily I'm hit!! Lucky punk!! Lisa grabs the wound to stop the bleeding and you think I should have taught her to drive. You think quickly weres the nearest hospital.... You realize its only a few blocks away and say let's go to a hospital. You give Lisa her guns and she puts them away and supports you as you start feeling dizzy from the loss of blood. You stagger down the street and eventually make it to the hospital. A doctor sees to you straight away and you end up in the visitors ward. Within seconds of you getting there Lisa bursts through the doors and runs to your side. The doctor says that's a very loyal pokemon you have. You just smile and think to yourself has she gotten bigger? The doctor leaves and you ask Lisa have you grown and she says I think so. You think she could nearly be a Nidorina now. She says are you feeling better? You say yes. She says I phoned Carlos he says he has had nothing but gang trouble. You say hmmm another police trip is in order and so is a gun shop trip.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A few days later<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel much better and the doctor lets you out of the hospital. You and Lisa get your car and drive to your usual gun shop and go inside. You ask the salesman you got any turrets? He says yes 10 they come with security cameras. You say I will take them he hands you huge boxes and says there's a million bullets in each box. You say thanks and take them to your car and head off home. You arrive and take the boxes inside. You open the boxes and set up 2 turrets 1 at the back door and 1 at the front. You set up the security cameras so no one can see them outside. You then put a camera on your roof. You proceed to put the cameras in Carlos house the same as yours and you make sure your gun turrets are not going to shoot you when you go in by making them check your DNA and photos. You go back to your house get your assault rifle and pistol and put them in the boot. You then get in your car and tell Lisa to try driving. Lisa says ok. Your surprised at how well Lisa drives. She must have seen you looking surprised as she says am I good? You say your very good. You smile and she smiles back and then you tell her drive to the police station please. She says ok. You pull up outside the police station and you get out of the car and go inside. You go into the chiefs office and see her siting in a chair so you walk over to her. She says how may I help you? You say I want some contract hits. She says I have 3 available. You say what are they? She responds 1 is kill a gang leader, 1 is blow up a gang house and the other is wipe out an entire gang. You say I will take them. She says they pay \u00a32,300,095 each. You smile and say thank you. She then says how is your arm? Catching you off guard you stutter h.. How did you know? She says I told you I have people watching you all day. She smiles slyly. You then say better. You and Lisa walk away leaving the chief to think. You get back to your car and let Lisa drive again. You say let's go to... Opening the first envelope you see it's kill a gang leader at Ravenholm Forest.... Ravenholm Forest! You take everything out of the envelope and see 2 guest key cards so you pick them up. You finnish reading the report as Lisa parks the car. You both get out of your car and you get your assault rifle and pistol and walk over to the main gate. Upon spotting a card reader you swipe the guest passes and the gate opens. You go inside and see large swimming pools full with people and pokemon. You scan the area for your prey but don't see him so you go inside the mansion. You start wandering around trying not to appear suspicious. Approximately 8 minutes later you come across a guarded room and you ask one who's room is this? One says the leader of the Underworld. You notice some gang like tattoos and say thank you and is you leader in there? They both say yes. You walk around a corner with Lisa following and when your out of ear shot you say this is the plan, you hold off any enemies that arrive while I kill these guys ok? She says ok and hugs you. You both take put your assault rifles and pistols loading them both and taking the safety off. You say ready? Lisa says ready. Your run around the corner and surprise the guards who get cut down in a storm of bullets, they drop to there knees and puddles of blood form around them. You run to the door and kick it down and dive back to cover as a rain of bullets comes flying out of the room. You quickly hold your gun around the corner and pull the trigger moving the gun from side to side until it's empty and quickly bring your arms back into cover. You hear a few grunts of pain and some guy shouting get him! You reload and hear the enemy do the same and they start firing and when theres a gap in there fire you stick your head and gun around the corner and open fire and for the first time see your enemy and that it's only 4 men left and you have killed 3 others. 2 dodge back into cover but you hit 2 standing together that were trying to reload. You dodge back into cover reloading. The leader and his bodyguard fire off a few rounds and you hear them advancing so you retreat down the hall a few steps. The bodyguards head pops around the corner and Lisa shoots him and you can hear screams from people outside so you think I better hurry this up. You run and skid on one knee through the door guessing were the leader was and start shooting but you notice he has retreated into the back room. You think I should have bought grenades this would have been so much easier... You have had enough and think to yourself perhaps I can shoot through these walls so you take aim and shoot the wall which to your surprise is like cutting through paper. You reload and shoot all over the wall and you hear a few clicks from the other side and a few grunts and decide to investigate. You look through the doorway and see the leader lying on his back clutching a gun and blood everywere. You search his pockets hurriedly and find some money and ammo for his gun so you take his gun and when you go out the room Lisa is searching the rest. You both shoot the windows and jump out them and retreat back to your car.</span></div></div>",

Then you turn to see 2 more blocking you off completely and you recognise the 2 owners to be the people from the cinema and they say we told you not to come here. You say so you want to fight me? with what is probably your best pokemon. They say yes and there's no escape for you this time as we are prepared. Suddenly 4 more pokemon come flying toward you accompanied by 2 trainers. Lisa starts to look at you worriedly and you whisper don't worry. You start calculating your odds of winning in a gun fight and find there low and so is escaping. You hear police cars nearby and think screw it grabbing your assault rifle you start shooting the trainers and Lisa shoots at the pokemon. The trainers luckily dive behind there pokemon without getting hit but 1 pokemon collapses to his knees cause of the pain from all the bullets Lisa put in him and you see a huge pool of blood forming. You reload and start shooting again but this time at the last pokemon blocking your way to your car. The pokemon dives out of the way but is no longer blocking the way so you and Lisa run past the two trainers sticking your push blades in them until they scream. Blood oozes from their chests and the others are now extremely angry with you so you start running to your car and dive onto the seat turning the key in the ignition until you hear the car roar to life. The police pull up outside and you quickly put the car in gear and drive as fast as you can back to your house. You ditch the police but notice the trainers are still following you so you pull into a parking bay when your far enough ahead of them to have time to set up a defensive position and get out of the car. You reload your rifle and just as predicted the car comes around the corner and they see you and you start shooting aiming low for the tires while Lisa aims for the passengers. You get a luckly shot and pop a tire but they duck down so Lisa can't hit them. The car comes to a stop and you start shooting the engine but Lisa notices the petrol tank so she starts shooting it and the trainers must have known the car was about to explode as the jump out of the car and start sprinting away. You both get in your car as you hear more sirens so you decide to drive to the gun shop. You arrive at the gun shop and use his hidden parking spaces. You go inside and say what grenades do you sell? He says phosphorus and fragmental. You say I will take 10 of each and 5000 more ammo for this gun. You pay him and go back to your car and start to drive home hearing the sounds of sirens vanish.</span></div></div>",

You take the envelope over to your table and open it and tip the contents onto the table. You see a note, large amount of money and what looks to be a large bomb. You pick up the note and start reading. It says Very good job and we will arrest and frame so gang member and I hope this bomb will help with destroying the gang hideout. GOOD LUCK! You put the letter in the bin and divide the \u00a3246,754 in half and give Lisa her share. She smiles hugs you and runs into the bedroom with the money. You inspect the bomb and recognise it as a high grade explosive. You lift it carefully and take it into the bedroom and put it on the bed. You take out the contract for the gang hideout and see that it is about a mile away. You ask Lisa are you wanting to do another mission today? She says yes. So you say meet me in the car when your ready so you pick up the bomb and take it to your car and put it in the boot and get in the driver seat and Lisa comes out and gets in the passenger seat suddenly your arm sends a severe pain to your brain. You grunt audibly and Lisa's head jumps to the left and she look at you worriedly and asks what's wrong? You say through gritted teeth just my arm hurts no bid deal. She dosent seem convinced but remains quiet and you start driving. You pull up a few blocks away and leave the car and Lisa and say come around the front of that building (pointing to a mansion) in 5 minutes. She says ok. You pick up the bomb from the boot and carry it in your hands until you cone to the buildings side wall where you put the bomb on your back and try to jump the wall. You miss 2 times and think Damn this wall is high! You look around and see nothing that can help you so you try jumping again and luckily you manage to carche on with one hand and you throw your other hand over and attempt pulling yourself up. You manage to get up but stay low and see no one around so you drop off the wall and check you have the right building. You think this has to be it it's the same place as the picture. You decide to look in a window and you know immediately it's the right place as there's gang symbols spray painted all over the walls and there's armed guards standing in the room covered in gang tattoos. You quickly plant the bomb on the wall knowing that it will be strong enough to wipe out the whole block never mind the building. You finnish planting the bomb when you suddenly feel a hand on your shoulder and a male saying well well well we meet again! You recognise the trainer from earlier and the cinema and you see he's wearing the gangs symbol on his jacket. He says your comming with me. and you say no chance. Punching him in the jaw he collapses to the ground and you see he's got a radio which is turned on. You quickly turn it off as you hear people shouting report at him and he jumps to his feet and attempts to jump on you when you move out of the way he lands in a heap on the ground so you hit him as hard as you can on the back of the head knocking him out. You hear Lisa comming up the road so you jump the wall and run toward the car as people start comming out of the building they don't notice you and start searching for the trainer guy. You get in your car and blow the bomb killing everyone at the building.</span></div></div>",

You hear police sirens approaching from the opposite direction so Lisa speeds up. You arrive at your house and open the front door to another envelope so you take it to the table again and open it and pour out the contents. You see a huge amount of money so you count it and it's \u00a31,500,000 each. You give Lisa her share and her jaw drops and she takes it to the bedroom to put with the rest of her money. You notice that she seems to be growing faster and faster and you think she will soon be taller than you. You spot a note and lift it from the table and it says Congratulations Nidoran is about to evolve into Nidorina! Take good care of her! Good Luck with next job. You put the note in the bin and start reading the next contract. You see that you have to kill an entire gang which is an elite group of murderers and only has 10 members. The reward is \u00a3600,000 each so you get Lisa and some grenades and head to the location that is on the contract of were they hang out all day. You pull up outside another but much bigger mansion. You decide you don't want to look suspicious so drive up a few streets, park and get out. You sneak back up into the mansion taking out your assault rifle while Lisa enters from the back. You hear loud music playing and decide to investigate. You see 20 people in a room and ten matching the descriptions the rest are women. Lisa comes up behind you and you whisper I found them. She whispers ok how you want to do this? You say I will throw a frag and a phosphorous grenade into the room and that should kill them all or if it dosent atleast they will be badly injured. Lisa says good idea. You hear foot steps approaching from both sides so you throw 2 grenades in the room and no one notices as there to busy dancing. You reckon there all dead so you divert your attention to the footsteps comming from the left and Lisa pays attention to the right. 8 people come and you think some of them must be initiates and you notice a gang symbol on their jackets. You throw another frag grenade and start shooting. Screams fill the air and blood goes everywhere and you start to hear sirens so you shout You ready! Lisa shouts YES! You run into the blood soaked and partly burned room and jump out an already shattered window and Lisa keeps up with you and you hop into your car and drive away being followed by police! You think hmmm gotta ditch these guys so you speed up and fly around corners and after a few minutes you realise you lost them so you drive home. You arrive to yet another brown envelope and this one has \u00a3600,000 in it and the note says that was very well done come by if you want some more jobs. So you decide to watch a little tv with Lisa and then you go to bed together.</span></div></div>",

After a while you decide to go make breakfast so you turn on the cooker and start to make pizza. Lisa eventually gets up and comes out of the bedroom and asks what are you cooking? You say pizza. She smiles and says ohhh nice. You server breakfast and decide to go to the cinema again. You both finnish eating and Lisa says thank you for breakfast. You ask do you want to go to the cinema? She says yes there is a new movie I want to see. You say ok. You say I will go get dressed then we will go ok? She says ok. You put on a black tracksuit and black trainers and you both go out and get in your car. You change your mind and say I need to make a quick stop. She says ok. You drive to the nearest clothes store and go into it. You tell Lisa let me know what you want. She goes over and starts browsing the clothes. You go to the mens section and buy a black top with a red skull on it. You go back over to Lisa and shes looking at a red and a pink tracksuit and asks which is better you say they both look good so she takes them and trainers in the same style. You both go back to your car and she puts on the pink tracksuit and pink trainers and puts her jewellery on over the top. you then drive to the cinema and order tickets to the movie she wants and go in to get some seats and food. Your surprised to find the cinema room is empty again so you get some good seats and set the food down on chairs around you. You see that the movie is going to be on in 10 minutes so you say how do you like your clothes? She says I like them very much. You smile and say I'm glad. Suddenly the door opens and 2 uniformed police women walk in and you think what do they want. They walk over to middle row and sit down opening drinks and Lisa whispers I guess there off duty. You whisper yeah.</span></div></div>",

If I didn't tell the police they were going to kill me but I just wanna go home to my wife.\" You would have believed that last part if you hadn't known that he used that line before when he got captured during a heist so you say, \"How did you survive in that van, I blew it up completely?\" He replies his eyes glazing over \"We all didn't it just happens to be the police done experiments on us and managed to give us life again mostly. They used us so that they could heal innocents better.\" You smiled \"Well it's a shame that you told that lie to many times cause I would have let you go if you hadn't.\" Jims' eyes go wide open and you hold your pistol to his head and pull the trigger coldly.</span></div></div>",

Kane said in a low cold voice, \"What's the problem here I can't enjoy my drink with all this noise.\" the bikers replied, \"Buzz off twerp if you know what's good for you.\" Kane handed his glass to Lisa while saying, \"Hold this for a sec and who's first.\" all the bikers stood and the waitress quickly got out of the way.

A smaller but more muscular biker threw a kick at Kane unkindly Kane to stick his fingers in his eyes and smash hi head into a table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of the fight blood was smeared all over the bikers table and each biker lay on the floor unconscious with Kane smiling.
