            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>John slowly awoke from his slumber, and his began his daily routine.  He slowly got out of bed, made it, and dressed.  He walked to the local wagon stop, and waited for the ride to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, the wagon crept over the horizon, and stopped in front of John.  John go tin, moved to his usual seat in the middle of the wagon, and sat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost everyone on the wagon knew him.  He was the guy who everyone knew, as he was one of the friendlier ones in town.  However, today wasn't his day.  As he sat down at his seat, he felt something in the back of his head.  It was an almost painful feeling.  He reached back, and felt blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed, and realized that his fall yesterday had caused more than just a mark, it had cut through his skin.  How he hadn't noticed it before was anyone's guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long after that discovery, the wagon stopped at his work.  He payed the driver his three copper pieces, and got off.  He went inside what he thought was his office, but with the shock of the discovery of his wound, and just from being tired in the morning, he walked into the wrong building.  Once he realized this, he quickly swung around and nearly ran into his office, as the wagon barely got him there on time as it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he dashed into his office, he quickly greeted his coworkers, and got to his third-floor room in record time.  After another grueling day at work, he started the trek home.  The wagon to his work didn't come in the afternoon, and he had to walk.  He trudged his way home, greeting anyone who happened to notice him, and once he made it home, he collapsed into his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was almost asleep when his stomach growled.  He slowly got up and into the kitchen, where he kept his dried meats and freshly-picked veggies.  He slowly fixed himself a salad of sorts, ate it and went back to his bed.  There he laid until he noticed his unfinished book he was penning.  He grabbed it, and continued his work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn was only half-way through with finishing writing the book, and he had been working off and on on it for nearly three years.  He was just finishing a page when even more bad luck hit him:  the quill slipped, and at the same time the ink bottle spilled on his bed.  The quill slipping he could handle, but when the ink spilled, he practically screamed.  Not only was he tired, but he had one of the worst days in his life.  True it wasn't that bad, but he hadn't the money to buy more ink at the moment, for he was waiting for his monthly 50 gold pieces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn, with his normally cheerful demeanor, quickly calmed down.  Though he had finally pushed through his recent writer's block, he realized that it could wait.  He put the book down, flipped the matted hay over, and redid the covers.  As he settled in for the night, he heard a sound outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his earlier bad luck, he half-expected it to be a robber.  He quickly checked out of his window, and saw a figure outside, walking past his house.  John wondered who it was, and decided to go outside to check.  He slowly opened the door, and went outside.  He saw the figure more clearly, and ran out to meet the figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, a cloud moved out from in front of the moon, bathing the street, and the figure as well.  The figure was a person, and John came closer to see who it was more clearly.</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">This story is about how John or the person is slowly changing into a mystical creature.  John or the person is changing because he or the person found a mysterious stranger, actually a magical being, who didn't want to be found, and thus they punished John or the person by slowly changing them into the mythical creature of your choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, this story is set in medieval times with some more modern concepts.  It has a wagon system, much like our bus system, and instead of farming as a job, people farm veggies and fruit, and buy meat from a store-like place.  John lives in a small town of about 1,000 people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn is gentle, and kind.  If he is the one to change, he won't be a murderer on purpose.  If it is accidental or if he is in a situation where he must be violent, then it is okay, but he will not willingly kill or harm others, no matter their appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are some rules, of course:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.  The mythical creature has to be one that is feared.  No unicorns,please.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2.  John or the person is slowly changing into that creature, not quickly.  It happens over a few weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3.  The magic changing John or the person is absolutely irreversible.  Even if John or the person make amends with the stranger, even they cannot change him or the person back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4.It must remain from John's perspective.  However, if someone besides John is changing, it can switch between their perspective and his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5.  Nothing too graphic, and no toilet stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6.  No eating people.  John is gentle, and wouldn't harm anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7.  If the person changing isn't John, they must also be gentle, and go on rampages, or knowingly or purposefully kill, etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n8.  No in-depth descriptions of sex, please.  If it is mentioned, or hinted at, it's okay, but nothing detailed, please.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n9.  Make long chapters.  They must continue the storyline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n10.  Have fun!  This is for enjoyment, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI will not edit, but I may delete if the chapter is bad enough.  As long as it continues the storyline and actually has some effort put in it I will keep it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'd like to give credit to James Smith, who started The Prisoner and The Outcast, who helped inspire me to make this.</td>",
