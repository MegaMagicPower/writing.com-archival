You gasp with longing as you fondle the beautiful paintings, ornate mirrors, ancient books, and filigree jewelry that decorate its shelves and walls. You want to buy everything, but know you must settle on only one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pieces are exquisite and the prices fair, but out of your range\u2014yet you feel compelled. You must buy something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't make up your mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou practically squeal in surprise as you turn to see the old man standing behind you. Embarrassed, you lower you head and say, \"No. I can't really afford to buy anything. I'm just looking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come now. Our prices are reasonable, and we have a very liberal return policy. If you decide you don't like something, just bring it back within forty-eight hours and exchange for something of equal value. No questions asked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething about this man makes you nervous, and then you notice you're the only customer in the store. You begin to have a bad feeling. Something is wrong here. You put down the blown glass vase you've been admiring and head for the door, but the old man reaches out and grabs you by the arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Flannery Fitzgerald.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Flannery. What a beautiful name. We have a special today. A 50% off special. Before you said that you couldn't afford to buy anything, but since today is our grand opening and you are our first customer, I am offering you any one thing in the store at half-price. Have you decided?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately glance over at the full-body swivel mirror standing in the corner. It was truly breathtaking. It appeared to be platinum with a variety of inlaid jewels around the edges: emeralds, rubies, sapphires, diamonds...there were others that you couldn't identify, but of everything you'd seen, this was your favorite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah,\" the old man nodded. \"\"Excellent choice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm sure I can't afford it,\" you protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, but I'm sure that you can. What would you say a looking glass like that costs?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Way more than I can afford,\" you say. \"I don't know...I'm sure it's several thousand dollars.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much cash do you have on you right now, Flannery?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at him, suspicious once again and sure somehow you're being scammed. \"I don't know, maybe two hundred dollars.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sold! The mirror's yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlabbergasted, you start to protest, but the old man will have none of it. \"I insist. My gift to you, Flannery. I'm sure it will pay off for me in the long run because you'll love it so much you're sure to be a repeat customer. I'll even deliver it for you.

You can smell them. You can actually smell them! Birds chirp from their perches high atop giant weeping willows, and turquoise-colored streams trickle past your feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach for the mirror, and it ripples beneath your fingers. \"What the....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking one last glance at your bedroom you take a deep breath and...</span></div></div>",

All you can see and hear is water right now.  What happened to that beautiful world through the mirror?

A ray of sunshine breaks through the clouds, and you're finally able to see this fantasy world, this...other time in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA grand castle looms in the distance surrounded by a broad moat. Above the surface of the water you see things flitting about. At first you think they are hummingbirds, but soon realize they are pixies. One spots you and darts over to the door. Her hair is bright red, her skin translucent. She peers at you with her emerald green eyes and taps on the glass between you with one diminutive index finger. Her tiny wings flutter so fast you can barely see them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon others join her. Blonde ones, brunettes, males and females. Pixie children tumbled and played in mid-air and hoverd in front of you. One male even flew by on the back of a bumble bee! And they were speaking, but the glass door was so thick you couldn't understand them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the day turned black. Dark clouds formed from out of nowhere and blanketed the sky. Thunder cracked, lightening sparked, and it began to rain. Something roared from within the nearby forest, and the pixies flitted away in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>NO!</i> You think. <i> Come back!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There's an antique Chinese porcelain vase that's almost four feet tall, its surface covered with rich designs of flaming dragons in stunning cobalt blue. A large Isfahan carpet hangs from a wall, an amazingly intricate weave of red and gold arabesques. A genuine Celtic torc sits in a display window. It looks like it is made of pure gold, and one can tell that the craftsmanship is of the highest quality. Then finally among other things you spot a large chess set.

You examine the entire set closely, inspecting each piece for flaws, finding none you become increasingly astonished as every pawn is discovered to be identical, eight blue uniform pawns and eight identical red pawns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \u201cAmazing craftsmanship,\u201d you mutter to yourself.  You inspect each of the major pieces more intensely than you did the pawns, and find uncanny uniformity in each.  The Rooks are square towers with intricate etchings of the masonry used to build a medieval castle, the four sides of each piece are distinct, but each Rook has a side that is identical to the three other Rooks, four Rooks, four identical sides.  Unease seems to settle over the room as the Rooks are placed on the four corners of the boards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     The Knights are armored warriors with visors pulled down, mounted on powerful looking steeds.  The horses muscles seem to quiver with leashed power, the cold smooth crystal gives the illusion of swift, graceful, destructive strength.  Each Knight seems to have an aura of stately dignity, courteous death. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     The Bishops are plain by comparison to the other pieces, simple robed monks with the hoods pulled up, not quite hiding the face.  The only way you can describe the monk\u2019s face is <i>serene</i>, there is serenity and peace with each piece.  The robes look as if they are a course cloth and you are shocked as you touch the first of them, the crystal has a rough woolen texture and your fingers are reluctant to release each Bishop and a feeling of emptiness pervades you as you place each on the board.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     The Kings are the largest pieces, the red King is bearded, a smallish nose under clear intelligent eyes, the hint of a prominent chin beneath the beard.  He wears a simple crown of gold over a chain mail headpiece.  It is a regal figure and there is a strong assurance exuded by the piece.  Placing the King on the board you choose his opponent to inspect it.  Here is the first difference you have found the blue King has a heavy mustache, obscuring the mouth.  A strong clean chin is below the coarse mustache, a large nose above.  There is a patch over the left eye, the right is again clear and intelligent.  A scar runs from the hairline beneath the eye patch to the left cheek.  A chain mail tunic covers his chest and arms; around his head is a simple ring of inlaid silver.  You feel a calm confidence with this piece and gently place him on his rightful square.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Picking up the red King\u2019s mate you discover a woman of delicate beauty, a small nose and strong cheekbones.  She has clear eyes that are unreadable, yet soft.  Her bodice is tight and her breasts are modest, a cape covers her bare shoulders, she also has a simple crown of gold on her head and her hair is long and luxurious.  You inspect her counterpart and find differences again; the two must be sisters you think.  The blue Queens hair is shorter but just as luxurious and her eyes are identical to the red Queen\u2019s but her face is not as full and her beauty strikes you as a bit more bold.  She too wears a dress with a tight bodice and her bare shoulders are covered by a hooded cape, the hood flowing down her back.  Like her mate she has a ring of inlaid silver encircling her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     She feels unnaturally warm to your touch and panic unrecognized seeps into your soul.  You set her next to her mate and she suddenly glows softly, and then brighter, you notice the red Queen emitting light also.  The disquiet in you is palpable, and you feel the panic that is in all your crevices and hidden places.  Of their own volition each queen turns to you and the red Queen speaks, \u201cMy Lord, you must choose a side for the ensuing battle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \u201cYes mi Lord,\u201d voices the blue Queen, \u201cit is imperative that you choose a side soon, for the stakes of this battle are high indeed.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \u201cWhy must I choose?\u201d you manage to croak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \u201cIt is your soul we battle for, my Lord,\u201d they answer in unison.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What kind of synchronicity is operating in this strange, dim little store?<br>\r\n     \"Buy the ring.\" He says again. \"If you want to know what might have been, buy the ring.\"<br>\r\n     The question becomes: do you really want to know what might have been? Isn't that why you left in the first place? Because you couldn't endure the idea of settling down with a man who was content to work on a factory line all day and watch TV in the evening. You didn't want to become Mrs. Middle American Housewife, with 1.5 children and a new Maytag every fifth year. <br>\r\n     Or is that what you thought then? Have your goals changed in the years between that first kiss and the last, disappointing job? <br>\r\n     <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",
