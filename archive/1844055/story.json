He smiled, as he felt his ass fat jiggle. He greatly enjoyed being a chubby ogre. His friends Pogle, &amp; Brone were constantly teasing him for being the runt of the group. Pogle, &amp; Brone were taller, &amp; much fatter than knut. They stood at 7' tall, &amp; weighed 1,000# each. They had huge round guts. Fat, round tits, &amp; big round asses. They were well tanned, &amp; smooth. They were the piggest pigs Knut had ever known. They scratched, belched, &amp; farted a lot. They walked around Ogresville flaunting their huge bodies, &amp; piggishness. Being ogres, meant that manners didn't exist. Ogresville, being an all male town, was full of piggishness. Weather ogres were fat, or muscular. Piggishness, was a sign of ogrelyness. Knut being one of the smallest ogres in Ogresville, was determined to prove his taunting friends wrong. He was determined to fit in, whatever it takes. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
