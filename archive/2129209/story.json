(sigh) what a long busy day its being you said in a fed up tone as you exited the vehical. Once your feet touched the ground you stretched and have a big yawn man I really need to get my head down you muttered as you slowy walked towards your house your door was just a few more feet away you'd never being so happy to see that old creaky door, you where almost there just a few more steps as you slowy reached out for the door handle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could feel the could metal of your door handle on the tips of your fingers but before you could grasp the handle you saw a bright flash to your right side then everything went dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you had regained conscious you took in your suroundings and were surprised at what you saw. All around you were anthromorthic animals but you could'nt help but notice some of these anthros looked familiar, then it hit you you had somehow being transpored to the world of Zootopia and you were only an inch tall!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rose to your feet to get a better look at your suroundings from the look of things you where in.</span></div></div>",

This may have all be a dream or hallucination, but even so. Anyone who had seen so much as one of the move trailers would recognize this place was the lobby of the ZPD.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then something large and gray took up your entire field of vision,  coming down scale feet from where you where standing and almost knocking you off your feet as the ground shook. Just like that the wonderment of being in Zootopia was gone. It didn't seem to matter if you where dreaming or not as all your mind could focus on right now was a need for self preservation as you took to a full sprint. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFueled with adrenaline it took a moment for your thoughts to catch up with your feet. This didn't feel like any dream you ever had, with the hammering in your chest, it actually felt terribly real. Whatever the case running blindly was starting to seem like a dumb move as more hoofed feet and paws came into your line of sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwitching to a different strategy you made your way to the closest wall reasoning that the foot traffic would be lighter. As your hands made contact with the tan wall you felt you breathed a heavy sigh before putting your back to the cool surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick look around confirmed that you were in the clear \"for now\". If anyone has noticed your presence at all they had dismissed it as no one who even glanced in your direction. As disturbing as the prospect of being too small to be noticed was, you decide that it's probably for the best that they had not. At least not for the moment. As you turned and began to make your way more slowly along the edge of the lobby. This whole situation was really just too much and right now you needed some space,maybe find a quiet room or even an air vent where you could lay low and sort things out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what felt like hours of consciously searching. You finally reach an open doorway and to your astonishment.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The green carpeted floor was frayed and scuffed reminding you of the rambunctious antics of the officers the first time Judy had entered this very room.  All the while your feet where subconsciously taking you towards the front. As your eyes locked onto the monolithic podium where Chief Bogo gave out daily assignments, you remembered the reason you had ducked in here in the first place. Pushing your feet to go faster in case someone came in, you made a beeline for the podium, hoping  it would provide cover well you rested and collected your thoughts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your luck the building sized lectern turned out to be backless allowing its insides to be used as a small storage space. Promptly slipping inside it was mostly empty save for a collapsible step stool and hard plastic case with the stylized image of a pair of glasses etched into its top. Walking up to the glasses case which next to you was the size of a stretch limo and with a hop you manage to seat yourself on its top with your feet dangling over the edge.  Giving one more look around you finally allow yourself to relax, closing your eyes and lying back against the cool plastic. It may not have been comfortable, but right now you really couldn't care less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the adrenaline wearing off your body was starting to ache from how tired you were. the flash and subsequent blackout that had landed you here had done nothing for your fatigue. Top it off with just how long it took to get around at this size and it was  tempting to take a nap right here, but not yet. To you, being sore and tired was another reminder that this might actually be happening and you were quickly running out of alternative explanations. Your last reasonable argument being that you had slipped into a coma, not a pleasant thought. Still, your only other option was to admit that something Impossible had happened and you really were in Zootopia, but your sanity didn't want to take that leap just yet. Whatever the case It felt real and that was reason enough to start treating your current predicament very seriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour first problem was you were in the ZPD and most of the building including this room was probably off limits to anyone that wasn't a cop. Second, you were tiny. Although it was difficult to tell just how small,  what with everything being made for sentient mammals so your size was still an enigma. Still you had a fair guess that you were smaller than a mouse, maybe an inch tall and that made being here all the more difficult and dangerous. Problem number three, you where a human and there were no humans in Zootopia, not even primates if you remembered right. So you may as well have been an alien to them. Ya, that was probably going to get all kinds of awkward, but  you couldn't hide forever. Your best bet would be to find someone who would not overreact and be in a position to help you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course being in Zootopia a certain bunny came to mind, until a sudden and nasty thought put a wrench in that idea. What if this wasn't that Zootopia? True, this place looked like Zootopia, but what about the movie? Were you somewhere in the middle of it and there was a mad sheep out there darting predators with no one the wiser?  Just when were you in the time line? Had Judy even been born yet? Retired? So far all you had seen where a few random cops and ever since you were almost stepped on, you had been too focused on avoiding paws and hooves to find out who they belonged to. You had yet to see anyone you could identify from the movies main cast and the longer you thought the wilder your imagination grow. Was this place anything like the movie? There were just too many possibilities. You needed answers before you worried yourself into a frenzy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaping from the case you felt your legs throb in protest, but rest would have to wait. Right now you were determined to gather information. Anything that told you how this Zootopia compared to the one from the silver screen. A glance at the analogue clock behind the chiefs podium coupled with the darkening sky outside told you it was 8:40PM. Waiting for morning muster was out. A quick inspection of the boards and charts on the walls revealed little other then that the night shift would start in twenty minutes. For a moment you considered staying to listen in, but after finding an attendance roster for the shift and not  recognizing any of the names. You decided your time would be better spent looking to see if any of the day officers were still in the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking your way back to the door the sounds of activity from the lobby caught your ear, your pace slowed to a crawl. Giving your temporary sanctuary another look and seeing how everything here was  looming over you.  Now you where going to have to face the giants this room was meant for yet again. With a reflexive gulp of air you poked you head out at the gargantuan lobby trying to spot a familiar face in the crowd, but with each new mammal you couldn't keep your  eyes from traveling down to the intimidating steps against the hard stone floor.<br>\r\nPulling back from the sight you leaned against the door frame. No Bunnies or Foxes amongst the mass of larger officers not even the towering cape buffalo chief. If there was going to be a notable face out in that room it would be Clawhauser. The ZPD's receptionist and radio dispatcher, but the front desk was completely obscured from this angle and making your way to the center of the lobby was going to be next to impossible without being seen or worse. Of course you Knew you could just edge your way around the wall until you could see him, but just seeing him at a distance was pointless, not when what you really needed was news on this place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo your best bet was to stay away from the crowds the lobby was so big you couldn't even pick up on what any one was saying over the cacophony of noise. A brake room would be ideal for eavesdropping. The problem was you still didn't know your way around. Your only choice was to keep exploring the ZPD until you ether found something useful or were discovered. With a deep breath you quietly make your way out staying to the walls. Seeing an enormous polar bear officer disappearing into a nearby hallway you decide to take the same route out of the lobby and deeper into precinct one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Unable to keep up with the large officer you slow your pace, looking around the deserted corridor and spot several open doors. Deciding to check them out you feel a rush of relief when you notice there are small plastic placards next to each door. Grateful that someone at the ZPD had the sense to add labels. When you were close enough to the first one to read, you realize this was the entrance to...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Just being in close proximity to the ZPD\u2019s locker rooms felt like it must be braking some kind of law. <br>\r\nYour first impulse was to just move on and hope for better luck with the next door you came across. Yeah getting caught poking around the ZPD was bad enough, no point in digging a deeper hole for yourself. What could you possibly gain in a place like that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter ten steps you stopped and slapped your face in frustration, of course you just had to ask, now you couldn't shake the feeling you were turning your back on something helpful. Glancing back through the opening, from this angle you could just see the beginning of a faded stack of blue locker\u2019s, but you couldn\u2019t believe what was on them, rubbing your eye\u2019s in disbelief you saw brass name plate\u2019s affixed above their vents. Not just numbers, but actual full names, what was more you thought you recognized the top one. \u201cFrancine Trunkaby\u201d Wasn\u2019t that the name of that elephant? This was the first time you had solid proof of a canon member of the cast. If her name was there then it stood to reason there would be more inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Rocking on your heels you waged an internal battle. Even being spotted in front of this door was bad news, but this was also a grate opportunity. If Judy existed as a cop in this world, her name would be on one of those lockers, right? What other options did you really have right now to collect such useful information? A full roster of ZPD personnel wasn\u2019t going to be just lying on the floor for you and you\u2019d need to be extremely lucky to be in the right place at the right time to eavesdrop on anything worth wile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStraining your ears, you couldn\u2019t make out any sound from inside other then the distant drip dripping of water. Licking your lips, you took a breath. The coast was clear, just dash in, read some names and tail it back out. If anyone came in, you had a better chance of finding cover in there then you did in this empty hallway. No one had seen you so far anyway. So, what was there to worry about? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking off at a jog you slipped around the dividing wall into what was presumably the female locker room. Even covering that relatively small distance was wearisome and you found yourself puffing in the humid air as you took cover under a nearby bench. Still collecting your breath, your stomach lurched as you registered the sound of approaching steps echoing off the tiled room. Pressing your back to one of the legs of your hiding place and closing your eyes you tried not to tremble. If you were discovered now of all times you didn\u2019t want to see it coming. The sound drew closer until it seemed to be right on top of you, but you didn\u2019t risk turning around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soft swish of clothing was heard and you found yourself looking up as the empty cuff of a police uniform appeared over the lip of your refuge. It was followed by the dull thud of the officer\u2019s duty belt and there clipped to the belt alongside a set of hand cuffs, gleaming cold was a bronze ZPD shield, the officers name shining under the words bravery, integrity, trust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing it was highly unlikely she would remove her belt if she knew you were here you slumped to the ground in relief. This was not how you wished to introduce yourself to officer\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The other three sides of your bench were just open floor. Crossing that flat expanse was pointless. Tigers were supposed to be fast to begin with and this one was as big as an office building. You\u2019d never stand a chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sudden slam of a metal door made you wince the paw\u2019s twin came into view and to your relief Fangmeyer had turned away and headed for the back of the room. With each casual step you could see more of the tigers retreating form, bare legs gave way to a pair of blue shorts or boxers it was hard to say, then the fur of its lower back. A white towel came into view next, slung carelessly over a broad shoulder. Just as the tips of Fangmeyers ears were no longer obstructed by the roof of your hiding place offering you a full view of the felines body. The tiger slipped into one of the shower stalls and drew the curtain. The towel flopped over the curtain rod and was joined by the tiger\u2019s blue shorts a moment later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the hissing of water came to your ears and steam began billowing over the top of the stall you found your feet. Leaving was the first thing that came to mind, but it also felt like a waist to just go without getting anything for your trouble. Looking around you started to find other places you could use to keep out of sight. A chink between two lockers across the room, a laundry hamper by the last shower stall, a discarded mop head just a few yards away. Although to you it was more like a couple of hundred. Looking back to the door you wade your options. While a strait shot to the exit would take less time. Taking cover and working your way around the room might be safer and even gave you the chance to achieve your original goal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a huff you stretched your legs and prepared for another dash. It wasn\u2019t like you had a time limit or anywhere better to be. For all you knew someone might be waiting for the tiger out there. Better to find a more discrete hiding place and wait it out just to be safe. A few steps from your first resting place you slowed your pace. The sound of melodic humming had come from the direction of the occupied shower. You and half the fans of the movie could never really agree on the tiger\u2019s gender, but now it was pretty obvious and you couldn\u2019t help the grin that spread across your face when Fangmeyer started singing. There were differences from the song you knew, but you still recognized it.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

While you were busy straightening your clothes out everything suddenly got a little bit dark. You felt a great amount of fear as you looked up thinking it was another foot coming to squish you, but thankfully it wasn\u2019t. To your embarrassment you were standing between two massive legs. Looking up you saw that the person standing over you was a female Labrador and you had a clear view up her skirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly looked away thinking back to all the lessons your mother taught you about being a gentleman  and showing respect to women. While you were distracted the Labrador began to walk forward. Your eyes darted to her moving feet as they began to stomp away from you. Once you saw that things got a little brighter you looked up and got a view of the female dogs fine behind which looked like it wiggled with every step she took. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn it Jason get your mind out of the gutter\u201d you said to yourself still keeping your eyes on the dog seeing where she goes. The female lab walked up to a pare of German shepherds which were unawarely blocking a bench, the Labrador just pushed past seeing that the two canines didn\u2019t care if she wanted to get past. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two lightly glared at her before walking away. Now that the two dogs were gone you had a clear path to the bench.</span></div></div>",
