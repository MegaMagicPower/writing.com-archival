You have vague notions of having some sort of a life: a small apartment, a nondescript second-hand car, a dull office job, but none of it seems very clear. You try to think hard, remember any details to bring it into focus, but you can\u2019t. You don\u2019t know the street your apartment is on, the kind of car you drive, or even what your occupation is. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nYou suddenly catch sight of yourself in a full-length mirror on a doorway , and what you see makes you jump: You are a child again! You appear to be about twelve or thirteen years old, and you are back in the house where you lived when you were growing up. \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\u201cHow could I be here? And how come I\u2019m a kid again?  What the hell is going on? I\u2019m a grown man... or am I?\u201d You begin to have your doubts...\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\u201cMaybe this is reality, I\u2019m still a kid. Maybe I got hit in the head one time too many and all that other stuff is a dream of the future?\u201d\r<br>\n\r<br>\nYou have little time to ponder the situation: There is a loud crash from the kitchen. Dad is in a drunken rage and you can hear your mother crying. Another typical Saturday night at home... If things play out the way they normally did, Dad will be coming up the stairs to slap you around next. \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\u201cMaybe I can go to Grandma\u2019s, that used to work.\u201d you think to yourself. You pick up\r<br>\nthe phone and dial her number from memory, hoping she'll let you stay there for a while.\r<br>\n\"Hello?\" you hear her answer. \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Grandma! it\u2019s me, can I ...\u201d but you never get to finish.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n You feel a stab of pain at the side of you head as the phone is slapped from your hand and sent flying across the floor. \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"You little punk, gonna go running to your Gramma again? I'll kick your ass!\" your father rages, as he shoves you backwards. You stumble over a chair and land on the floor. \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Get up on your feet and fight like a man, you sissy!\" He screams at you. You notice the\r<br>\nbloodstained piece of pvc pipe in the corner, easily within reach. He has used this pipe many times before, to beat you and your younger sister for being \"bad kids\". \r<br>\n\r<br>\nYou notice he has also spotted the pipe, so you must move quickly. \r<br>\n</span></div></div>",

There is no traffic for quite some time, but you keep walking, afraid to look back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night is warm and dry.  Walking is comfortable and easy, giving your mind time to flash back over events.  You can't get that dream of an apartment, a used car, and a whole adult life out of your head.  It was so real, and so different from the horror of the past couple hours.  Your real childhood wasn't like this.  Somehow, deep inside, you know this, but that doesn't explain the nightmare you find yourself in now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInsects, crickets and something else, play a night melody all around you.

Very few crossroads break up the road you're on, but when they appear, the hedges are cleared for about fifty meters to either side.  You suppose you would have quite a good view of the surrounding countryside if the moon was up.  Unfortunately, it's not, so you can never see more than a few yards through the openings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the distance, you suddenly notice a new sound.  An engine somewhere down the road.  You stop walking and listen as carefully as you can.  As far as you can tell, it's a fairly new car, and coming up behind you at normal speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPraying it's not some kind of cops, you stick out your thumb and wait for it to approach.</span></div></div>",

Paranoid and not thinking too clearly, you jump from\r<br>\nthe car and start running. \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"POLICE! STOP!\" the bullhorn shouts. You jump over the railing of the overpass,\r<br>\nnot thinking, just reacting... \r<br>\n\r<br>\nBut it's a long way down. \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"...fly fly away, from this dirty boulevard \r<br>\nI want to fly, from dirty boulevard \r<br>\nI want to fly, from dirty boulevard \r<br>\nI want to fly-fly-fly-fly, from the dirty boulevard...\" \r<br>\n\r<br>\nThe Lou Reed song echoes through your head as you fly through the air to land\r<br>\nface-down on the pavement, fracturing your skull and breaking several ribs.\r<br>\nSeconds later a White Freightliner carrying a flatbed of steel comes roaring down\r<br>\nthe hill under the overpass. The driver sees you lying in the road, but by the time\r<br>\nhe reacts and slams on the brakes you are under his back tires. Your body is\r<br>\nground into hamburger on the pavement as the truck screeches to a halt...\r<br>\n\r<br>\n... If this ending is too dark for you, go back to the previous chapter and take the other\r<br>\nroute. In all fairness though, you should have known better than to jump off a freeway\r<br>\noverpass. </span></div></div>",

You and\r<br>\nyour mother explain the chain of events, and the police slap the cuffs on the old man just\r<br>\nas he is regaining consciousness. \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"I'll kill you both!\" he rages, but the cops keep a tight grip on him. \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"I'll need you two to come down town and sign a statement. With this guy's history and\r<br>\nyour cooperation, we can put him away for thirty years!\" Officer O'Malley says. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nYou and your mother agree, and you follow the police car down to the station... \r<br>\n\r<br>\nIn the coming weeks, now that your father is safely in prison, your mom really takes\r<br>\ncharge of things. She manages to get free training through a state run program to get her real estate broker's license. In the coming years she becomes quite a good agent in the booming market, an even gets an award for the most closings in the district one year. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nBy the time you graduate high school she has put aside enough money to send you to an\r<br>\nupscale university, where you major in business, eventually graduating with honors and pursuing a career as an extremely successful investment banker. You take some of your financial winnings and buy her a nice home on the island of Bermuda, where she has always wanted to live, and there she enjoys a well deserved retirement... \r<br>\n\r<br>\n... Now you know in real life, given the circumstances of the people involved, a chain of events with a fairy-tale ending like this is highly improbable. And given the dark nature of this story, such events are even more unlikely here. So if you want to find out what really happens, go back to the previous chapter and take the other path. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nBest of luck to you. </span></div></div>",
