Not even a minute ago she was the center of attention at her birthday party. Her friends all around her, and the promise of one of the best nights of her life hanging before her. Now she looked on to see she was in the center of a large barren wasteland\u2026 all around her stood her friends, but they were unaware of her. For Alina now found herself reduced to the size of a small ant in the middle of her big day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n            She stood still as a shadow engulfed her form like an eclipse. She looked up slowly as she saw her sister, Lilith, towered above her menacingly. Alina\u2019s gaze followed her sister from her crinkly black hair all the way down to the black flip flops that stood merely inches away from her. She watched, transfixed, as her sister flexed her powerful toes before her lazily. Alina swallowed hard as she remembered all the videos her sister had made about crushing everything from food to tiny people under those same feet. Now Alina was just a prop these titanic toes were used to destroying mercilessly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n            \u201cAnyone see Alina?\u201d Lilith said as she put her hands on her hips in puzzlement. To Alina\u2019s horror, everyone around her looked just as confused, no one else had even realized she had gone missing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n            \u201cI think I saw her go out to her car before, she might have gone somewhere.\u201d Rosie suggested as she walked up to Lilith.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n            Alina watched as another colossal pair of feet came her way, but this time they were headed right for her! She suddenly broke out of her frozen state as she instinctively ran to her sister for help. Leaping onto Lilith\u2019s flip flop, she rolled on just as Rosie\u2019s foot crashed down where she had been standing. Alina paused to catch her breath. Sitting up, she found herself face to face with a towering wall of flesh, known better as Lilith\u2019s big toe\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n            Alina was thrown against her sister\u2019 big toe as Lilith began walking back to the main party. Holding onto her sister\u2019s pale toe, Alina looked around to see every one of her friend\u2019s tower over her like a pantheon on goddesses. She gulped as Lilith and Rosie grabbed a beer and some food, heading back to Lilith\u2019s room for a change of pace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n            \u201cYou sure you saw Alina leave?\u201d Lilith asked, opening the door and kicking off her flip flops. Alina screamed as you held on for dear life, the bus sized flip flop underneath her raced away at a speed she didn\u2019t think was even possible for its size. That was the final straw for this birthday girl. Sinking her teeth into her sister\u2019s soft flesh, Alina shook her head back and forth as she struggled to get her sister\u2019s attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n            \u201cOuch, what the fuck was that?\u201d Lilith said as she looked down at her toe. Alina\u2019s heart leapt for joy as she felt her sister\u2019s foot start lifting up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n            Lilith gazed down at her foot intently, looking for the source of that itch she just felt. Her gaze finally came to her big toe, where she saw a tiny black speck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n            \u201cWhat the hell? That little thing?\u201d Lilith said annoyed as she flicked it off her toe as hard as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n            Alina was shocked as she soared through the air. Her sister thought she was nothing; in fact she didn\u2019t even look! But as she looked to see where she was landing, Alina became even more panicked. Screaming, she landed\u2026.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>            Alina screamed as she landed with a splash in Lilith\u2019s can of beer. Coming to the surface, she sputtered and struggled to breathe as her clothes weighed her down in the amber liquid. Alina flailed around as she looked for something to grab onto for support. The alcohol stung her eyes as the beer ran into them, making her vision blurry.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n            Meanwhile, Lilith rubber the tip of her big toe, still annoyed by whatever that little speck was that was stuck to her toe. Frustrated, she grabbed her beer and lifted it to her lips, taking a nice big sip of her favorite drink. As she felt the liquid run down her throat and warm her up, Lilith resumed talking with Rosie, completely unaware of her very little sister\u2019s plight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n            Alina finally got her sight back as she felt things around her begin to shift. Opening her eyes wide, she stared down the dark abyss of her sister\u2019s wet throat. Alina turned and started swimming in the other direction as fast as she could. As the current pulled at her body, she screamed out for Lilith to help her, to not devour her whole. Soon the current became less powerful. Looking behind her, Alina saw that her sister\u2019s cavernous mouth was now filled with a pool\u2019s worth of beer. As her black lips closed over the entrance of the can, Alina shuddered as a powerful \u201cgulp\u201d echoed inside the can. She knew that this wasn\u2019t over, not till Lilith had enjoyed the very last drop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n            As Lilith continued to eat, Alina struggled more and more to think of a way to get out of the can!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n            \u201cWhat the hell is with Alina anyway? Leaving the party I threw her! What a spoiled brat!\u201d Lilith raged as she devoured another mouthful of sandwich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n            \u201cDon\u2019t worry, she\u2019ll be back. Besides, don\u2019t act like you\u2019re not having fun here yourself.\u201d Rosie teased as she took another swig of her beer.   \u201cAh, shit. I\u2019m out! Hey Lil, give me some of yours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n            \u201cHere, drink up!\u201d Lilith says as she hand Rosie the can. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n            Alina looks up in terror as she see\u2019s Rosie\u2019s tongue lick her lips in the opening of the can. As Rosie tilted the can to her lips, Alina felt the familiar tug of a nice big swig! This time she wasn\u2019t strong enough and got sucked to the end of the can by Rosie\u2019s thirst. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n            \u201cHelp me!\u201d Alina shouted as she imagined falling down Rosie\u2019s throat at any second. To her surprise, she landed on something nice and soft.  Looking down, she saw that she rested on Rosie\u2019s massive lips. As Rosie tilted her head forwards, Alina fall back onto the cold edge of the can. As it is set down again, Alina looks up to see both giant women eating and chatting like nothing\u2019s wrong in the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n            But the peace didn\u2019t last as\u2026.</span></div></div>",

She stayed right under the tab opening, which offered the only light into the dark atmosphere she swam amongst, the girls voices were so loud that they ring Alina's ears despite her seemingly being at least a few thousand feet away in proportion with her size that is. Their voices echoed into the can making it even louder and weirder to alert Alina of her predicament. They would chomp on some chips every once in a while between the conversations. Rosie was the one who was closest to Alina and the one she could see the most clearly. The near giantess chomped on some of the chips with her carnivorous mouth, that same one that almost became Alina's tomb, the chips would be crushed and crumbled by the great white teeth, contrast to those dark but luscious lips, some of the crumbs from the chips escaped when Rosie attempted to talk at the same time, these crumbs weren't visible to Lilith unless she was to pay close attention but they were plenty visible to Alina who quickly dodged as boulder-sized chip crumbs fell through the tab hole of the can and splashed into the water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was close\", Alina muttered, shuttering when she thought of how embarrassing it would be to meet end at getting pelted by near microscopic crumbs that fell from her giant friend's mouth. Alina should've known that it wasn't safe yet as what comes with eating....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'm going to finish this up so we can go down and get some more drinks\", Lilith says reaching for the can that stood next to Rosie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlina looks up in fear as the can shifts and she can see her older sister in full view once again, her face become closer and larger as she lifted the can. Although the beer seemed deep, Alina knew that she was swimming amongst the very last sip of beer in the can, she would be drank by her own sister in mere seconds and there was nothing that she could think of doing at this point! Before Alina knew it, her world was being turned upside down and the been can opening was once again covered by her sisters sweet dark lips. The current from the beer was too strong for Alina to fight and she could only watch as she was to be drifted with the rest of the drink, into her sister's deep mouth which rang with the noise of her gulping down the liquid that already preceded her....</span></div></div>",

A tingle of euphoria tingled through her as she felt the end of this entire journey was finally near. Junping to her feet, Alina began cheering and shouting for her sister\u2019s attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n            \u201cLilith! Down here! I\u2019m down here! Let me up!\u201d Alina shouted joyfully as her sister leaned in. But as Lilith approached, it became clear to Alina that her sister wasn\u2019t coming in for the warm sisterly reunion she was hoping for. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n            \u201cWhat the fuck is that?\u201d Lilith said under her breath as she leaned into her beer can. Squinting, she could just make out a small, black speck on the mouth of her beer. Disgusted, Lilith curled her fingers up, and flicked the tiny speck off her beer. \u201cEwww! I thought I told Alina not to buy the cheap shit, they never store it well!\u201d Lilith ranted to Rosie as she straightened up.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n            Alina passed out as she sailed through the air. The impact from her sister\u2019s flick was enough to crack her ribs and knock the young woman out cold. Alina\u2019s limp body fell down off the side of the bed, heading for the carpeting below. But just as Alina was about to crash into the floor, Rosie\u2019s sneaker-clad foot sailed past, catching the tiny girl on the lip of her sneaker. As Rosie let her leg swing lazily from the side of the bed, she was unaware of her friend\u2019s sister being slowly devoured by her sneaker. By the time Alina woke up, she was already at the mouth of Rosie\u2019s sock, hanging perilously over the dark pit of Rosie\u2019s sneaker by a loose thread. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n            \u201cWant another beer?\u201d Lilith asked as she crushed the other empty can in her grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n            \u201cYeah, make it a cold one\u201d Rosie replied, licking her parched lips.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n            \u201cOk, be right back!\u201d Lilith said as she walked out of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n            Rosie sighed as she swung her leg up onto the bed, lying back on the pillow. Alina was catapulted up in the air by Rosie\u2019s unexpected movement. Alina screamed as she arched backwards, towards the musician\u2019s head. Alina imagined landing in Rosie\u2019s mouth any second now, and being washed down by the beer Lilith brought back. Opening her eyes, Alina screamed as she slammed right into Rosie\u2019s ear. Rolling inside, Alina knew her presence was felt as Rosie\u2019s finger came in after her. Breathless, Alina watched as...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Crashing into the thick, gooey surface inside Rosie's ear, Alina cringed internally, knowing that she was covered in the giant goth's ear wax.  It was the consistency of warm peanut butter, but Alina didn't want this stuff anywhere near her mouth.  Unfortunately, most of her body was covered in it, not because Rosie's ear was so dirty, but because Alina was so small that even the trace amounts of earwax that had been left in the woman's ear was more than enough to coat the tiny shrunken girl several times.  When she opened her eyes, she to the sight of Rosie's finger as it dug into the ear canal right before her.  The finger itself was larger than Alina could imagine, and she didn't want to even consider how deep she had gone inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosie's powerful, squirming finger didn't stay long though, and soon the tiny goth watched her friend's finger leave her in peace, and return light to this thick cavern of flesh, inside Rosie's ear.  The first thing she noticed, were the normally microscopic hairs that stood everywhere.  The little blonde hairs reached as hight as Alina's knees, as she managed to get to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rosie!  For fucks sake, help me dammit!\"  Alina screamed into the darkness, scared to go much deeper into the ear, for fear the earwax would get thicker and harder to move out of, it was already hard to move as it was.  There as no response from her friend, only the sound of the music pumping in the background.  Frustrated, Alina fell to her knees again, not sure if she wanted to scream or cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer indecisiveness came to a quick end though, soon, Lilith's voice penetrated through the air, louder, and closer than the music.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here ya go. Nice and cold.\"  Lilith said cheerfully, handing a new beer to Rosie, who began sitting up to receive it.  Lilith then cracked her own beer open, and took a heavy gulp from it, before taking a seat on the bed next to Rosie, brushing against her playfully.  Rosie giggled in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lilith Sat down, Alina was able to see clearly out of Rosie's ear, and watched her goddess-sized sister sit down.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lilith, you have to see me!\"  With new motivation, Alina began to run (as best as she could) towards the entrance to the cavern of Rosie's ear, hoping her sister would see the tiny, screaming little girl in the goth's ear.  For a moment, she thought her attempted at Lilith's attention had been successful, as Lilith, still smiling, turned towards Rosie.  She began to lean forward, this was it, Alina was saved!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then Lilith's position adjusted.  Instead of her eyes getting closer, to get a better look inside the ear, Alina's vision was suddenly filled with a huge pair of thick, soft, black-painted lips, that got closer, and closer.  And not only did they get closer, but those lips began to part, as well.  Her giantess sister's mouth began to open, revealing the pink, powerful cavern of devastation, teeth large enough to destroy houses without so much as a struggle.  The teeth, white as any Alina had seen, contrasted perfectly with that black lipstick, and beyond them, that soft, oceanic pink tongue provided the perfect bit of coloration to the powerful scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlina stopped in her tracks, backing away from the giant mouth, while Lilith...</span></div></div>",

She tried pushing back against the imposing finger, but her efforts were fruitless; at her current size, Alina couldn\u2019t even budge the finger holding her down. Looking over her shoulder, Alina shudders as she sees her reflection in the dark mirror of Rosie\u2019s fingernail. Alina shivered, unable to move as Rosie pressed down on her more and more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n            Meanwhile, Rosie sat lazily as she rubber her pointer finger around the inside of her ear. All of a sudden the damn thing started to itch in this one annoying spot. Frustrated, Rosie rolled her finger around, making sure to press her finger down on the spot, to rub out the itch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n            Alina whimpers as Rosie\u2019s finger pushes her further and further into the dark tunnel of Rosie\u2019s ear. Alina wanted to throw up as a strong smell approached her. She knew exactly what it was, and as Rosie dragged her, face-first, through a pile of ear wax, Alina knew she was right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n            \u201cRosie let me out of here! It\u2019s me Alina! Please!\u201d Alina begged as she spat out a mouth full of ear wax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n            Rosie\u2019s blood went cold. She couldn\u2019t tell what exactly, but SOMETHING had made a sound in her ear! Terrified it was a bug; Rosie points her fingernail down and drags the sharp edge along the bottom of her ear. She scratched back and forth, feeling the tiny object now getting stuck under her fingernail. Disgusted, she rolls her finger around, collecting wax and other objects under her nail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n            Alina felt intense pain roar through her as Rosie\u2019s nail made the first cut through her body. A searing pain raced across her back as the woman\u2019s nail ripped through her clothing. Alina screamed out, but her noise only seemed to insight the fury of Rosie even more. Rosie\u2019s nail raced across Alina, slicing her up and down like a knife through butter. Alina screamed out one last time for Rosie, but was cut off as a large pile of ear wax caught her in the face, threatening to suffocate her. Alina soon felt confined as Rosie\u2019s spazzing finger caught Alina under her nail. Alina finally grasped just how tiny she was. She too had once picked her nails, amazed at how small something was to fit under it, now she had been reduced to that something\u2026. It wasn\u2019t a pleasant revelation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n            Pulling her finger out, Rosie whined as she looked at her finger. She felt sick as she saw something twitching under her nail. Looking closely, she expected to see some kind of bug under her nail, but instead gave pause. She saw that whatever it was, it was wrapped in black, almost like fabric. Carefully picking it out, she gasped, it was a little person. No wait\u2026 it was Alina!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n            \u201cAlina? Is that you?\u201d Rosie asked hesitantly. She was shocked as she saw the small figure wave back. It was! Suddenly a very evil idea sprung into Rosie\u2019s mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Alina, why don't we....\"</span></div></div>",

She extends a can of beer to her friend who grabs it with her other hand and opens it handily, wedging her fingernail under the tab to pull it open. Alina sees this from a distance and shudders at the thought of being smashed into the tab of a can. Even such an insignificant  action could destroy her. As Rosie takes a sip, Lilith asks, \"What's got such a big smile on your face?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosie sets her can in her lap and says, \"Oh, well, I found a little someone and I think we can have some fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" Lilith opens her own can and takes a swig. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found Alina. The little brat wandered off and got herself shrunk. I found her under my fingernail. Here, look,\" Rosie says. Alina is unable to move, still trapped in a glob of earwax under the fingernail. Her giant sister's face appears in front of her. Her eye alone is many time her size, the bright blue circles like seas ready to swallow her into the blacknesses in the middles. Rosie continues, \"I think we can have some fun showing her a lesson for abandoning her own party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlina tries to protest, but Lilith's voice drowns her out entirely. \"You're smiling awfully hard there. Did you have something in mind?\" Her breath as she talks washes over the little girl. Alina closes her eyes to block some of the hot air and then braces herself for Rosie's response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we never got to cut into the cake,\" Rosie says, \"so maybe she can be a sprinkle for a lucky guest. Or a wick for one the candles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to kill her,\" Lilith says. \"She just needs to learn her lesson.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosie retracts her finger, plunging Alina into the darkness of her fist. \"Did you have any better ideas?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" she says, untying her boots, \"I wouldn't mind a foot rub from my little sis.\" She pulls her feet out of her boots, placing them on her bed, showing her black socks from under her skinny jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww,\" Rosie whines. \"I expected more from you, Lil.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith says, \"Oh, because I don't want to kill my sister you're disappointed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosie says, \"No, no, I just figured you'd have something a little crueler than a foot rub.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith says, \"Care to take a sniff? They've been in my boots all day as I ran around preparing this party.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosie laughs. \"Speaking of parties, we do have a whole party down there. Maybe they'd like to have their feet rubbed, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith thinks for a moment and says, \"I like the way you think. At her minuscule size it might take her all night just to get through my feet, though. If she doesn't pass out! Haha! But I do think we should include the other guests. Maybe we can play a little party game with them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosie says, \"Like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith says, \"Truth or dare comes to mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you in middle school?\" Rosie taunts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith says, \"We'll add a rule that every dare has to include little Alina. And can't kill her, of course. Five minds are better than two, anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two head downstairs and gather the other three girls around. Alina is finally freed from her fingernail prison, finding herself on a table with her and her sister's friends sitting around above her like gothic goddesses. Despite being her sister, Lilith in particular looks the scariest. Rosie is sitting across from her, ensuring no way of running off. Her friend Carissa looks a little concerned while Jo and Sarah are grinning. She can't quite read Kimber's expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a voice booms from behind her. It's Rosie's. \"So, </span></div></div>",

Now she would get help, see her loving older sister, get to a doctor and laugh about this later as one crazy birthday party. Alina anticipated Rosie's thundering voice as spoke almost speaking the words she thinks Rosie is going to say before she says them herself, \"Hey Alina, why don't we...\", Alina is about to smile when everything turns upside down, \"Wedge in your sister's boot treads for the walk home!\" Alina was horrified as she head the terrifying words escape out the goth giantess's black, moist lips and echo through the expanse of air all around. She let out a laugh that belonged straight out of a villain's cartoon at her idea. Alina had forgotten how much of a sadistic bitch Rosie is but she is quickly reminded. At least Lilith crushed things quickly with elegance in the videos, Rosie was flat cruel and creative. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlina quickly begins to plea, \"Rosie, NO! Y-you can't do this, please you have to help me!\" Rosie just lets her grin grow even wider at the cries of her tiny captive. She walks to Lilith's favorite pair of boots nudged the dirtiest pair over with her foot before kneeling down. Alina had long quit trying to beg for Rosie to reconsider, hoping that she was just playing around but deep down Alina knew she wasn't. She instead looked just over Rosie's dark nail and could see IT. The bottom of these boots had so much mud and dirt accumulated on the bottom of them, so much things crushed from bugs bigger than even her to simply grapes. They were filled with grime and Alina lets out a whimper while Rosie continues to grin. \"Oh, this is going to be a nice little place for you\", Rosie sneers as she starts to lower her finger with Alina encased inside the nail closer and closer to one of the treads of the nasty black boot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlina tried one last time to somehow get Rosie to stop, \"Please, don't Rosie\" to even the classic, \"Are you really going to do this on MY day!\" But either Alina was too small for Rosie to hear, or she simply ignored her. Alina did everything in her power to wriggle free of the wax, preferring to take a drop to the ground then THIS. But all became too late as first the tip of Rosie's nail crashed into the tread, Alina could see Rosie's fingernail sink into layers of grime before she tilted her nail at an angle and then let it scrape along the edge of the tread, causing all the gunk under her nail including Alina to be left and stuck inside the tread. Alina rolled for a second through this quick action before ending up being on ther back and looking downwards, encased in her wax and now the mixture of everything Lilith ever treaded through or stepped on with these boots. Rosie used her thumb nail to flick off any residue left in her fingernail and then winked at the hapless shrunken girl below. \"Have fun!\" Alina then used her foot to tip the boot back right side up, Alina screamed as it looked as if she was going to tumble to the ground and be smothered in between the boot and the carpet ground but being in between the treads caused her to be 'safe' from that danger and instead all was just dark and relatively quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours pass by, Alina has tried desperately for the first couple to attempt to break from the prison of nastiness but it has solidied and there seems to be no hope without the help of a tremendous force or a girl's... fingernail. Alina simply chills out like this although her senses really feel nullified as everything is dark, she can't hear anything not even the very loud music or talking, the smell of god knows what has been stepped on and even Rosie's earwax has made her nose useless, and her body feels numb with most of it being encased in something. She was getting bored and feeling extremely helpless when suddenly she finally heard and felt something for the first time in hours. The ground shook in a rhythm that Alina recognized as that of footsteps and even the boom with it, she could tell it was at least two people walking and that from the intensity of their steps, they were very close by before they stopped. She could only assume that this was Lilith and Rosie. She couldn't make out their voices that well from being trapped under the boot, they were muffled beyond useful translation but she thought she could make out a couple of words. \"Lets..... my place\", it sounded like the muffled voice of the bitch, Rosie. Alina's eyes then widened, this is what Rosie meant by the 'walk home'. Meaning!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith decided that her boots would be better to take the short walk to Rosie's house, although flip flops were more desirable with it being such a small walk just down the street, it rained not too long ago. She sat on her bed and put the boots on what foot at a time. Alina screamed as she could see the boot lifted just a little while Lilith has the boot supported on its heel as she put it on. She then shuffled her foot into the last boot and was ready. \"Let's go\", Lilith mumbled, noticably upset that it was the end of the party that she threw for her sister who instead seemed to decide to hang with some other friends instead. \"Forget about it\", Rosie said reassuringly to her downed friend, we'll just chill at my house and forget about it, it is HER day after all and as long as she is having fun is all that matters.\" Lilith reluctantly nodded in agreement as she started to trudge behind her friend on their way out the house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlina at first screamed for every step as she seemed to rise hundreds of feet into the air with each time Lilith raised her foot and then with a quick drop! Alina's stomach lurched and the G-force from the fall made the skin on her cheeks fold back until BOOM from the powerful impact! All was dark and quiet for less than a second before rinse and repeat. Alina had already thrown up three times by the time they made it to the front door of the house, if she survived this and grew back; she would vacuum the carpet herself to clean up the microscopic mess... after dumping that bitch into a pool of acid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosie and Lilith walked outside, it was dark by now and the ground was very wet from it pouring rain earlier. The girl's blended in with the night as they continued walking down the road with no mind for the small walk at all. Meanwhile all was chaos for poor Alina. Each time Lilith's foot hit the ground, water from the rain earlier actually filled Lilith's treads of her boots causing Alina to nearly drown in the murky muddy waters! She had to learn to breath each time Lilith's foot rised and then hold her breath when it fell, while withstanding the impact that was no amplified by her sister now stepping on concrete and road instead of the soft carpet back home. Rosie meanwhile just smiled, she felt Alina was the only thing stopping her from getting closer to Lilith and with her out the picture, she can be the one to help Lilith feel better from her 'loss'. She'll be the one there for her. It played perfectly into her hands, that she found the shrunken Alina, she even got to satisfy her sadistic side a little while getting a gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of walking the two goths (three?) make it to the house and walk inside, with their shoes being absolutely muddy and disgusting from the wet ground outside, they both take them off and head to the living room. Only Lilith accidenly kicks one of the boots on its side as she walks away from them, the boot that contained her little sister. Alina was wet, cold and miserable. She would've thrown up several other times had it not been for the fact that she had nothing left to throw up besides her guts. She nearly drowned and was breathing hard for air from the near drowning mixed with fear. After a few minutes...</span></div></div>",

To her surprise, the once solidified boundings were now soaked by the rainwater causing it to be eroded which allowed Alina to slowly make her way out of the gunk and within those few hours she is finally able to slip from off the boot tread and onto the ground. The fall actually hurt a little but a few bruises is much more desirable than being stuck there! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlina takes the time to scan her surroundings, confirming that she is definetly in Rosie's house. With Rosie being the main reason this happened, Alina knows that Lilith is the only one she can trust to hopefully get out of this crazy situation. Right now she is currently on the cold, hard linoleum floor of the front foyer. It must be very late night by now or very early morning to be more accurate. She can't hear anything really going on in the house so she assumes the girls have fallen asleep, probably on the couches in the living room. Alina walked out of the front foyer and onto the living room carpet. The carpet strands were like tall grass to her but it was so bunched up that she was able to walk on top of it. She could see the couches and furniture extremely huge like strange buildings for a city and sleeping on the couches were these massive goth goddesses. Of course Alina was eyeing where Lilith was sleeping at, so that's where she headed, treking her way through the carpet until she was just in front of the couch. She could see the coffee table in the middle of the furniture setup, it was filled with empty beer glasses and shot glasses along with various snack foods that were left open and a television the size of an imax theater was left on to some horror movie channel, meanwhile the girls lightly snored, only falling asleep just over an hour ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlina looked up the couch, knowing her work was cut out for her. The gap under the couch was already taller than her but Alina was sure she could find away to reach up and grab the couch material to climb but the hard part would be just that, the climb. Going up the couch was seemingly hundreds of feet and then she still had to find a way to get help from her giant sister who was now in a deep sleep. With a deep sigh, Alina extended on her tip toes and reached up to just be able to grab the couch material and slowly took her time to climb up the couch. Avoiding to look down at all costs. Alina was never a climber and she didn't want to be reminded by seeing how high she was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes Alina makes it to the sofa and finds herself reunited with her giant sister, although not in the way she wanted. She was by Lilith's torso, who was spread out on the couch laying on her stomach. Alina walked up along the side of her, trying to make it to her face. Walking past her now mountainous sized breats, up by her neck and finally to her face which was facing Alina's direction. A small river of drool leaked from the black lips of the slumbering goddess. Alina wondered how she was going to get her sister's help, she knew she could get to her ear but didn't want to risk getting trapped in earwax again. She decides the next best thing is to climb to her sister's eye lids and once her sister opens her eyes, she'll see her. Alina would have to walk further along side Lilith's face closer by her eyes. She starting to walk around the growing amount of drool and just made it when suddenly Lilith suddenly decided to breath in very hard in her sleep, which would be a problem if it wasn't for the fact that her breaths were like the winds of a tornado to Alina! She is instantly swept off her feet and...</span></div></div>",

Alina felt like she was swimming through the air as the strong current began dragging her towards her sister\u2019s massive nostrils. Shouting and screaming, Alina fought with all her might as she looked over her shoulder, seeing the large cavernous holes of her nostrils behind her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSLAM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlina groaned as she slammed into the columella of her sister\u2019s nose. Her back was pressed into the warm skin of her sister\u2019s nose as the air roared past her, sounding more and more like a jet engine was powering up. As the air finally subsided, Alina fell to the ground, breathing heavily as her heart hammered at a mile-a-minute. She had almost become her sister\u2019s booger! Looking over her shoulder as she huffed in as much air as she could, Alina shivered as she imagined how easily she could have disappeared up one of those dark tunnels. The lines of tiny hairs that filled the inside of her sister\u2019s nose, combined with the greenish-clear mucus that sat there made her want to hurl. The situation she was in was just too much for her to handle at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need to get out of here!\u201d she said as she began crawling away from her sister\u2019s nose, heading right for her black lips once again. Alina\u2019s hands sunk into the thin layer of lip-stick that covered her sister\u2019s massive lips. Thanks to her tiny size, what should have only been a nearly indescribably thin layer of make-up, came up to Alina\u2019s wrists. The tiny girl wretched as she shook her hands free, trying to get the lip-stick off of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMMMMMMMMM,\u201d Lilith moaned as she stretched in her sleep. Alina shivered as her sister\u2019s massive lips parted, sending forward a whirlwind of dead air from deep in her lungs. The gust whipped Alina\u2019s hair in her face, blocking her vision just long enough for Lilith\u2019s tongue to snake up and begin to lick her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSMACK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlina was sent whirling onto Lilith\u2019s cheek, covered in a thick film of saliva as her tongue smacker her to the side like an unruly crumb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck you, Lilith!\u201d Alina shouted as she wiped off her sister\u2019s saliva, instead smearing the black lipstick all over her face. Crying out, Alina laid down on her sister\u2019s warm cheek, wondering what the hell she was actually planning to do to get her sister to wake up. She had just been owned by Lilith while she remained asleep, what the hell could she even do to wake her up, much less get her attention at this size?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMMMMMMMMM,\u201d Lilith groaned as she shifted in her sleep once again, turning her head to the side. Alina was powerless to fight the force of gravity as she began rolling uncontrollably across her sister\u2019s face. Once again she rolled in front of Lilith\u2019s massive nostrils. She stared up into them in fear\u2026and for good reason. As Alina slid past one nostril and in front of the other, Lilith took in a quick breath\u2026which sucked her sister up her nose! Screaming, Alina zipped up her sister\u2019s nose, snorted like a drug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGOD DAMN IT LILITH! LET ME OUT!\u201d Alina shouted as she struggled inside her sister\u2019s nose, much to Lilith\u2019s discomfort. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSNORT!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlina was pulled up even deeper as Lilith snorted in her sleep and awoke, very confused. The giant goth could feel something in her nose, but was unsure of what it was. Wiping her nose quickly, Lilith\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Lying back against her sister\u2019s lips, Alina let loose her own breath, happy not to have been reduced to a booger in the middle of her journey. From this distance, Lilith\u2019s breathing amounted to no more than a slightly strong breeze, but nothing like the hurricane force winds that almost took her in before. This trip was becoming more and more dangerous the closer Alina got to her goal. Looking up, she could see her sister\u2019s eyes just past the large ridge of her nose. If she moved far enough to the side, she could make it to them with relative ease\u2026so long as Lilith didn\u2019t move her head in her sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s get started,\u201d Alina said as she peeled herself off of her sister\u2019s lip, her ass covered in black lip-stick from Lilith. Each step Alina took sunk slightly in on her sister\u2019s face as she circumvented her nose. The flat-ish nostrils seemed to flare every so often as Lilith inhaled or exhaled, rising and falling like her nose\u2019s pulse.  If the situation were less dangerous, Alina might have found this fascinating, but with the threat of Rosie returning any second, Alina had no time to spare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPassing by her sister\u2019s nose, Alina began to run as she got closer and closer to her sister\u2019s eyes. The ridge of Lilith\u2019s nose sloped down as Alina crossed over, finding herself between her sister\u2019s eyes. Alina looked back and forth, seeing as the granules of her sister\u2019s purple eye shadow were like little rocks to her. Lilith\u2019s eyeliner could be seen clumping in little bubbles at Alina\u2019s size that were unknown even to the most skilled make-up artist.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning to Lilith\u2019s right eye, Alina began trying to lift the lid, pushing against it with all the might her tiny body could muster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLilith, open up!\u201d Alina shouted as she began to feel Lilith\u2019s eyelid open. Falling backwards, Alina felt herself fall into something wet as she landed in the liquid covering her sister\u2019s eyeball. The eyelid quickly slid up from behind her as Lilith quickly assaulted her eye with her hands. You realized you had effectively become dust in Lilith\u2019s eye as her massive hand swept you away, knocking you towards the top of your sister\u2019s head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSLAM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d Lilith said in semi-sleep as she shifted around and resumed her nap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were battered and bruised as you sat in your sister\u2019s hair, caught in a canopy of hair that you had grabbed onto in your descent. Now you were in a pickle though. You were totally unsure of how to proceed from this point. Climbing down the hairs to her sister\u2019s scalp, Alina\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She hit the floor with a wet thwap, landing in a puddle of filthy water on the cold hard tiles by the door. She coughed and sputtered, spitting water as she tried to get her bearings and gather her strength, trying to crawl to someplace safe where she could think and decide what to do next. She could hear the rain increasing in tempo beyond the huge towering door of Rosie's house, the wind of the increasing storm whipping under the door and chilling her to the bone. She had to get to safety. She had barely gone an inch when a cold shadow fell over her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's the birthday girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlina looked up as the giant pale foot slammed down right in front of her. She screamed, tumbling back and cowering as the massive foot eased forward, the huge big toe thumping into her and sending her sprawling back into the filthy puddles by the boots she had just escaped. She slid across the floor and bumped up against her sister's discarded boot, shivering with cold and terror as she looked up and up at Rosie's grinning face looming high overhead. The Giantess was leaning over with her hands on her knees, her black hair hanging down and framing her pretty face. She giggled to see Alina cowering on the floor, the tiny girl scrambling to get away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww...\" Rosie said as she reached down, her fingers splayed to snatch up the smaller girl. \"Not the happy birthday you were expecting?\" Alina screamed as the Giant Goth's fingers pinched closed, pressing into her and plucking her up from the floor. Alina's stomach roiled as she shot skyward caught in the bigger girl's grip. Her vision swam as the world swept by, finally focusing on the huge mocking face before her as she dangled helplessly between the gigantic fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlina shivered in terror as the fleshy pads of the fingers rolled her about, pressing into her until she was squealing in pain. she pressed at Rosie's fingers, trying to loosen the grip, but her best efforts were ignored as the Giant Goth eyed her with amusement. She was starting to sweat now from the Giantess' heat, whimpering as her once friend pressed her thumb into the tiny girl's chest. \"Please... \" she cried, and Rosie chuckled, lifting her closer to her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" the Giantess said, cocking her head and flipping her dark hair away, exposing the huge silver ring and other studs piercing her ear. Alina cried out again as the fingers pinched harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please!\" Alina screamed, struggling in the bigger girl's grip. \"Don't do this! Help me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help you?\" Rosie said bringing the tiny girl before her face again. She pursed her huge black lips as though considering, then grinned wickedly. \"No, I don't think so,\" she said, her hot, beer-laced breath gushing over Alina. \"You got yourself into this mess, and you can get yourself out of it again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosie chuckled as the tiny girl struggled in her fingers. She was getting so hot to feel the little life in her hands, a life that she could snuff out like a candle if she wanted. It was the ultimate power rush, and she squeezed making little Alina shriek in agony, writhing about in her grip. She licked her lips wanting nothing more than to press her fingers together and crush the little girl like a bug, but she didn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosie wanted Lilith with a passion, but as long as Alina was in the picture, she knew that nothing would ever happen. But as much as she wanted to get rid of the little pest, Alina, Rosie knew that she would always feel that slight pang of guilt if she simply smashed her to a pulp. She would always have that nagging in the back of her mind every time she looked at Lilith and saw the loss in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, accidents did happen. And if Lilith unknowingly crushed her little sister, well, no harm or foul on Rosie's part. Rosie smiled as she looked down, ignoring the futile struggles of the tiny girl trapped between her fingers. She saw her sandals kicked to the side of the linoleum entryway by her door, strappy and high-heeled. But her eyes focused on Lilith's black biker boots, weathered and worn with the laces undone and the tongue lolling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosie was more annoyed than surprised that Alina had survived the walk from the sisters' home to her own, caught in the tread of Lilith's boots as she had been. She figured though that maybe some more direct pressure would do the trick. Smiling with ingenuity and delight, Rosie righted the boot that had been tipped on its side with a casual flick of her bare foot, then lowered little Alina towards the opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlina struggled and squealed in fear as she saw the dark maw of her sister's old leather boot swiftly approaching. She shoved at Rosie's huge fingers trying to free herself from the Giantess' grip to no avail. She kicked and squirmed as the boot got closer, already smelling the wet leather and the foul reek emanating from the insides. \"No!\" she shrieked, hammering on Rosie's thumb. The Giant girl just laughed and opened her grip letting the little Alina fall into the dark, damp leather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlina hit the insole hard, bouncing off of the worn leather and tumbling into the slick imprint of the heel. Her breath expelled with a whoosh and she lay there aching, staring up at the tall sides, whimpering as Rosie's wicked, smiling face filled the opening far above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Comfy in there?\" The Giantess said whispering down, giggling. \"Don't worry. After a little fun, soon enough we'll run out of beer or get hungry and we'll go out again. Then you'll be a little red stain in your sister's boot, and Lilith and I will live happily ever after.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlina stared up in horror as Rosie laughed, her huge face drifting out of her line of sight. She heard the receding BOOMS of her bare feet padding away, the faint rush of water as Lilith finished up in the bathroom. The television coming on...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughter...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had skidded along a textured surface and came to a rest on an odd smooth black surface. That was when she realized with panic that she was on one of Lilith's old boots!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Alina could even stand up to race to get off the boot, she fell through a small opening into the long tunnel of the boot itself. It was then she heard her sister high above say, \"Well we can't just wait here for her. We should probably go see if we can figure out where she went.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosie's voice was heard next asking, \"Why are you getting those old things?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These boots? I love these boots! That and I don't mind if I get them wet. I was just wearing my sandals around the party, I'm not going out in the rain in them. We won't be out long probably, I'll just wear my boots barefoot,\" Lilith replied and at that moment her huge fingers grabbed ahold of the top of her boot and tipped Alina all the way down to the bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tiny hands scrambled to try to grab onto the sides of the boot but to no avail. With a tiny plunk she landed on the soft insole deep within the boot. She could tell they were her sisters boots as she reconized the scent of her feet. It really wasn't a bad thing, if anything it was a comfort to smell something familiar in her panicked state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boot shook as Lilith walked over to her bed and sat down, pulling on her other boot first and then looking  down into the one Alina was in. Tiny as she was, she tried to call up to her sister. Unfortunately it was no use and soon the goth girls face was replaced with her pale sole as it slowly decended down towards her. It felt awkward to have on her mind, but all Alina could think was they wouldn't find her outside since she was trapped in her sisters boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the huge soft sole pressed her down, Lilith's eager toes began working the tiny pebble of a shrunken girl deeper into the toe section of her boot. Alina got comfortable as she relaxed just under her sisters gigantic toes near the ball of her foot. She considered that these boots, old as they were, had become loose and she may be able to climb free. It was either that or risk her sisters footsteps squishing her inside Lilith's boot.</span></div></div>",

She braced for the worst as finally the boot seemed to become weightless as it fell towards the floor. Shutting her eyes tight Alina felt the huge ball of her sisters foot mould down over her chest, but the pressure wasn't too great to hurt her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis continued on for awhile as Lilith took step after step walking through the party. Everything seemed muffled but Alina thought she could hear her sister talking to a few of the party goers high above before leaving through the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was around then she realized the comforting scent of her sisters feet that she knew wasn't so subtle when her sisters foot was planted right on top of her. Alina squirmed uncomfortably as the giant toes over her head wiggled eagerly into place as Lilith stepped outside. The smell was becoming a lot stronger and the boot was making Lilith's feet hotter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sensation was the most awkward thing Alina had ever experienced, besides being shrunken and under a titanic bare foot of course. But Alina could hear the rain pattering against the outside of the boot. Much else was muffled but it was like being in a small cabin and hearing the rain on a stormy night. Yet she knew just earlier it was only lightly raining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lilith and Rosie walked out into the rain, unaware that Alina was really trapped inside of Lilith's boot, they considered where they'd look for her first. Nearby there was a cafe they liked to relax at late at night. Maybe Alina had just decided to get away for a moment there. Something could be wrong or she could just be fed up with all the company and needing to get out for a breath of air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Alina was eager for some fresh air, however that wasn't going to happen anytime soon. She considered trying to pull herself free now and climb up on Lilith's foot but she didn't think it would help much. Even if she wanted to escape now it would be horrible to be outside in the rain and so tiny. She was safe where she was as uncomfortable as it was becoming. As she snuggled in under her sisters toes and hoped for the best the two giant girls outside decided where they would go.</span></div></div>",

Alina found each step jarring and the boot was really getting too warm for her liking. Lilith's feet had become pretty sweaty and she just wanted out of the boot finally. She had no idea what was going on as they continued walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile outside Rosie and Lilith had just reached the cafe. The two went to their usual booth and sat down for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe she's just in the washroom, there's an empty cup of coffee on the table here,\" Rosie offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith grumbled a little as she pulled one of her boots up, \"I don't know but I do want to take these off. Ugh, I havn't worn these in forever and barefoot tonight was a bad idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlina felt some rustling around down by her. She wasn't sure what was going on still but then suddenly her sisters toes pointed down towards her and began lifting away up and out of the boot. The cool air the swirled in felt and smelled so good to Alina. Breathing in deeply she tried to make her way down into the heel section which was a downhill trek at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat didn't last long as suddenly the boot was raised up and tilted sideways. It was laid down pointing out towards Lilith's striped pants. Alina instantly thought she was home free and made a mad dash towards the top of the boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she came out and realized she wasn't even at home anymore though she stopped cold. Where WAS she? It seemed like Lilith was sitting on a large bouncy red couch and was leaning on a table that was covered in gum on the underside. The spinning ceiling fans. Off in the far distance more tables. The checkered floor tile. It was the cafe!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waitress didn't notice if Alina had come in or not earlier and wasn't sure who had recently enjoyed a coffee at their table. Content to take a breather, Lilith and Rosie both ordered milkshakes and waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this size Alina was way too tiny to get Lilith's attention now. Rosie was way too far away. Unless Alina wanted to climb down her sisters pant leg and take a chance with the waitress she was quickly running out of options. Even the top Lilith had on was far too sheer to climb up on to get onto the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe there was another way to get her attention to at least get her hand down here so Alina could climb up onto her sisters fingers and at least get onto the table. It was either that, or she'd have to go back into the boots and hope to get carried back home the same way she got here and Alina wasn't looking forward to that anytime soon.</span></div></div>",

That's when she leveled her view and looked straight at her sisters pants. It was a pair with a few buckles and loops attached onto the material. Without any other ideas, Alina wandered forward wondering if she could pop one of the buckles free that would release one of the straps so that it would fall down to the floor. Surely her sister would notice that and buckle it back up again, giving Alina time to climb onto her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't so easy. Alina climbed up onto the buckle and pressed her back to the metal buckle while trying to push the metal clip free. It didn't seem to do much good at first but then she realized using her legs to push it was a bit more effective. Placing both feet on the metal buckle she shoved her legs out for all she was worth and finally with a snap the strap came free and fell to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFalling down onto the plush booth bench Alina caught her breath as she waited for Lilith's hand to come down to fix her pants strap. It was then she considered climbing down the strap to the floor instead. It would allow her to get to the floor easily sliding down that. But then what? She'd be down by Lilith's feet again and that was one place she could do without being. That and no one else would help her. After all, how many people had shrunken people run up to them at a cafe looking for help?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was the promise of moving on to Rosie though. Maybe she'd notice what was happening and help Alina get back to normal size if she noticed her. It wasn't that she didn't trust her sister, she just didn't know if she'd be able to get her attention finally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lilith's huge hand reached down and started fumbling with the buckle while talking to Rosie high overhead Alina realized she had to make her move. Grabbing onto her sisters finger would allow her to get up onto the table and then from there she could try to move around and get Lilith or Rosie to realize who she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo many ideas seemed bad. Alina cringed at the thought of her sister smacking her open palm down on her thinking she was just some small pest on the table and not really a tiny person. There was so much that could hurt her and so little that could help.</span></div></div>",

Lilith was still her sister, but she wasn't sure what she would do if Alina wasn't reconizeable at her shrunken size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing on to one of the buckles on Lilith's pants, Alina pulled herself up into a fold in the fabric and began sliding along towards her sisters knee. It was like walking on a long outstretched hammock. Progress didn't bother her at all until she passed over the edge of the booths bench and found herself high over the checkered floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next strap was near Lilith's knee and from there Alina would have to slowly climb down towards the floor. It didn't seem bad, but she still had to climb up on her sisters knee and keep from falling down out of the hammock wrinkle in Lilith's pants. A fall to the floor wouldn't kill her she assumed, since at her smaller size she seemed light weight and almost able to jump further. She still didn't like the idea of plunging all that way down next to her sisters feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding onto a stitched line along the bottom of the strap, Alina pulled herself up so she was hanging off the material. With her feet planted firmly against the giant side of the kneecap, Alina reached up higher and tried to pull herself up further. Progress was slow but eventually she was standing on the strap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down to her right she could see the huge pant leg stretching down towards the sandal clad foot of Lilith's. This wasn't going to be easy. She'd have to slowly slide down while hanging off this strap until she got down near those huge intimidating feet. Nevermind that she still had to get Rosie's attention after a long hike across the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlina began to second guess this decision but there wasn't much turning back now. Barely able to keep her balance she just wanted to get closer to some solid ground again. Looking down towards the floor Alina made her way over to the side of the strap and began her decent down towards the tiles below.</span></div></div>",

Looking down she realized that she was going down towards her sisters feet, exactly where she didn't want to be again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClinging tightly to Lilith's finger Alina heard her sister comment high above, \"Hang on I've got an itch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt regular size that would mean Lilith would scratch her leg, ankle, foot, wherever Alina was being taken, and be done with it. Meanwhile at her tiny size Alina realized that not only was this situation frightening, she was clinging to the tip of her sisters finger. Furthermore, she looked up at the blank painted nail. Lilith would use that to scratch her itch. Alina was right below that. Her mind reeled as she was moving so fast down towards her sisters foot it seemed. Itch, nail, tip of finger, Alina realized she was about to be smushed right into whatever her sister was about to scratch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she passed down past Lilith's ankle she realized it was her foot that was itching. Not a big deal until the upturned sole of her sisters left foot came into view. All Alina could thing was, 'No, not again!' as she was pushed into the soft sole of Lilith's foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was still warm from being in her boots and she was forced deep into the soft flesh. Struggling against the plush surface didn't help as Lilith's finger moved up and down as she scratched at her itch. Alina was pushed against the bottom of the giant girls foot, hugging the tip of the finger that was rubbing her into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately with how soft Lilith's foot was it didn't really hurt Alina but after being under this huge foot in her sisters boot, it was the last place she wanted to be again. Her back was forced against the yielding wall and she struggling to keep from falling to the floor as the finger moved up each time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStruggling did no good but finally Lilith was content that the itch was taken care of. Now it was time for Alina to make a decision. Hang on to her sisters fingertip and be possibly brought back up onto the booth bench or the table, or drop down to the floor and get away maybe to Rosie or someone else.</span></div></div>",

Even with the cool breeze rolling in, the inside was still humid and smelled of Lilith's feet. She walked slowly towards the toe section of the boot, feeling hopeless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boot was still turned on its side, so she walked along the what would be the wall of the shoe. She kept a hand against the insole, skimming it. It got her hand wet from the moisture left over, but she didn't mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe darkness was consuming while going deeper, so Alina just walked until her face bumped the end, sending her to her butt. She didn't bother to get up, she merely laid there, looking up at the dark. She was still for a few minutes, until Lilith and Rosie finished their shakes and Lilith was putting her boot back on. Alina was pushed to the insole from the movement, and she looked towards the entrance to see the last of the light diminishing as her foot snaked towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe watched the dark painted toes approach her, and allowed them to roll her over until they rested upon her once again. \"Hey sis...\" Alina muttered as she reached up and touched her sister's toes. Her skin was soft and warm. She realized that she may never get noticed at this size, and this could be the only contact she would receive from her big sister.

Not that she didn't like a lot of the people at Alina's birthday party, she was moreso expecting the others long ago. Sarah especially was supposed to be her ride home this evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was sitting on the armrest of an easy chair, drinking punch and relaxing quietly. As she brought the punch glass up to her black lips again however, she felt funny. Rosie paused and placed the cup down on the table next to the chair. Sliding down onto the chair itself she began to feel numb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling to herself, Rosie considered the fact that they may have spiked the punch. Which wasn't a big deal until she realized that the seat around her was actually getting bigger. The room itself was expanding outward, like the walls were growing away from her. Rosie's hands gripped the arm rests and she found they too had become larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around nervously, Rosie found herself unable to call out as she realized she was getting smaller and smaller. She was actually shrinking! Her feet couldn't reach the ground anymore and her black sandals clattered to the floor as they became too larger for her. Desperately turning to her friends, Lilith and Alina were way too busy entertaining the other guests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside she was sure she heard Sarah's car pulling up. By the time she got inside, Rosie would be probably be far too small to even notice anyway! As she panicked more ideas raced through her mind. She could side off the chair before she got too small and wander over to her friends. At such a small size though it seemed intimidating to be around Lilith's feet. After all, she'd probably enjoy teasing Rosie with them. Even Alina would probably join in and play around with their now shrunken friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she didn't do that soon she'd be stuck on this chair. The worst from that would be if someone else sat down. She'd be smushed under their butt! Rosie didn't like the idea of that, but if someone looked down before they sat, she'd be fine. After all, it was a party. No one wanted to sit in anything she was sure. Maybe that was a way to get someone's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly there was the small end table next to the chair. It had a bowl of chips or something on it and if she could get near that, surely she could get someone's attention. If nothing else she could even get into the food and get a lift up to her friends faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doorknob turned and she considered racing for that too. After all, if it was Sarah then she'd be fine. She was a good friend and hopefully wouldn't hurt a shrunken person. Rosie wondered how reconizable she was at this size. That's when she considered her clothes. No sure enough her actual outfit had shrunk along with her. Perplexed she peered down towards the end of the cushion she was on, wondering why this shrinking hadn't affected her sandals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith little time, Rosie made the first big decision of her new shrunken size.</span></div></div>",

Though she was wondering who had made her shrink. Lilith and Alina might joke around with her a bit but that was all. Sarah could just assume Rosie was a bug and squish her on sight if she wasn't in on this shrinking joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosie thought it was all safe. She'd run over to her friends, they'd have a good laugh cause they were only pretending to not pay attention as she shrunk, and they'd help her. Of course they would! That's what friends do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she slipped down off the chair, just in time as she became too small to properly climb back up on it without some serious effort, and began making her way across the wide open floor. In the distance she saw the huge sandals of the two goth sisters. It was intimidating as she approached them, their legs stretching up so high into the air above her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowed down as she approached. It dawned on her that the giant girls above her may not know she was there. One wrong step and she'd be mushed under those rubbery sandal soles. Just another smear on the floor along with dip and snack food crumbs that had been dropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when Rosie froze and watched Alina pivot her giant sandal up on her heel. Her mighty toes bent upward and rose into the air, consealing her beautiful black nail polish. She stopped admiring when suddenly the huge foot slammed down on a chip which crumbled and was crushed to pieces with just that one step. There wasn't even any pressure behind it and Alina was happily wiggling her toes along to the music and leaning on her other foot. It had just crunched. Just like Rosie would if she was unfortunate enough to wander under there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath she continued forward. It seemed safe to climb up on one of the sisters sandals and stay there. After all, she couldn't end up under those sandals then. \"Just under their feet,\" was Rosie's continued conclusion of that decision. She imagined sliding down under the soft skin of one of the giant girls and being smushed into the grimy rubbery insole of their sandal. Shaking her head she still continued on. It wasn't safe down here either and she had to do something!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime was running out. Sarah would be at the door soon and odds are one of the sisters would go to greet or help her. Running forward Rosie decided to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Of everyone here, Lilith had the prettiest feet. She took good care of them and spent a great deal of time at that. They were always neatly polished and super clean. Which is why Rosie decided that would be her best option. She was however very aware that she could easily be crushed to death by an unsuspecting Lilith. She would have to be very very careful in how she approaches this.<br>\r\nFirst things first, she had to get inside Lilith's sneakers, and fast. She quickly climbed up and ran towards the opening, just as she heard the sound of a doorbell. <br>\r\n\"I'll get it!\" Lilith's extremely loud voice almost punctured Rosie's ears. She wasted no time and jumped inside Lilith's shoes. She ran towards the front of the show and seconds later Lilith's gigantic foot went into the sneaker's. Rosie barely managed not to get crushed as she made it to the end of the shoe, Lilith's toes moved in around her. She was between the big toe and the index toe.<br>\r\nRosie let go a sigh of relief that she is still alive. She looked around her, she was hardly as tall as Lilith's big toe. <i>These are some really nice feet.</i>. Rosie's state of relaxation did not last very long. She heard the sound of the Lilith sealing her tucks. Her toes around her hugged the shoe in preparation to start walking. First everything tilted around and Rosie found herself falling towards the front of the shoe as Lilith lifted her heel. Then as her shoe flew Rosie was thrown back between Lilith's giant toes. <i>This is going to be a bumpy a ride. </i> Rosie thought. She had to do something otherwise she is going to be transformed into a ball. She hugged Lilith's big toe with all her strength. <br>\r\nLilith did not feel anything and simply walked on to the door. She greeted Sarah and let her in. <br>\r\n\"You are so late\" Said Alina laughing. \"If you had showed up any later we would have finished all the drinks.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh common, I am sure Rosie would have kept some for me. Speak of, where is Rosie?\" Replies Sarah.<br>\r\nEveryone looked around looking for Rosie. She was no where to be seen.<br>\r\n\"Maybe she went back? I thought she seemed tired?\" Said Lilith. Completely unsuspecting that Rosie was actually hugging her big toe.<br>\r\n\"Aww poor Rosie, I was supposed to give a ride home heh. Had to do lots of stuff and completely did not notice the time!\"<br>\r\nWhile the giantesses talked, little Rosie was just trying to survive Lilith's fearsome feet. She had managed to get on top of her big toe, but she was in a tight space between the toes and the roof of the shoes. But she at least could not get crushed here. She could faintly hear sounds from the outside, but it was very sound tight inside here. Barely any light came inside either. On the bright side, it smelled very nice. It was not exactly the best of smells, the air with heavy and filled with Lilith's scent. Her feet felt a bit damp from tiny sweat that no one else but Rosie could feel due to her minuscule size. She continued to hug Lilith's enormous toe with all her strength as the giantess mingled and carried on partying without feeling her. <br>\r\nIt was not until sunset when the party started slowing down and people started leaving. The two sisters where aware of Rosie's sudden disappearance but they had a big house to clean, so they would have to call her tomorrow and check up on her. Alina shook her head as she picked up the clothes that someone left. People do crazy things when they are drunk. Lilith busied herself with cleaning the kitchen and doing the dishes. She was still unaware that poor Rosie was struggling between her toes. She still had the beat in the back of her head and was wiggling her toes and tapping her foot while humming.<br>\r\nRosie was not enjoying this as much as Lilith though. Her plan of getting attention was failing miserably. She simply could not make anyone feel her at her size. Around her Lilith's pretty toes danced up and down. Rosie was being thrown from toe to toe as the foot went up and down. It took her a few minutes and a few bumps to her head to finally cling to Lilith's little toe. This time she had more space for her because this toe was significantly smaller than the first one. For the first time in the past two hours she could catch a breath and look around.<br>\r\nBarely any light made it inside here, but after so many hours her eyes had adjusted to the low light condition. She could see but not too well. She could easily make out the outline's of Lillith's toes, and see the dark shading on all of them. It was obviously newly polished, probably just before the party. After a few minutes Lilith' feet started moving again. This time she was going up the stairs. Rosie has been in this house so many times she knew exactly where every room was, and right now Lilith was heading to her room. <br>\r\nFinally! She thought. Now she might take off her shoes and see me!. Rosie was correct because indeed she heard the tucks on the sneakers unstrap. Light came in as Lilith's foot left the snickers. Rosie was still hanging to the little toe and was expecting to be seen any moment. However immediately after leaving the shoe she was engulfed by another darkness. This time fabric surrounded her from all sides. Thick warm fabric that had the faint smell of Lilith's feet within it.<br>\r\nLilith had put on her socks so fast she did not really see Rosie hanging on her little toe. Instead Rosie was moved from bad to bad. Lilith loved her stories and as she sat on the bed to read her novel, her feet hung suspended on the other side of the bed. Inside her socks Rosie was just done cursing her luck and started to see what she should do this time. It might be possible for her to crawl out of the socks and then get Lilith's attention.<br>\r\nUnfortunately Lilith still had the music in her head and went back to shaking her feet. The sudden jolt send Rosie flying to the wrong side of Lilith's foot. She found herself hanging to her white smooth sole. It was so pretty, Rosie wished she could just stay here. Her admiration lasted too long though. Lilith moved her foot to rest them on the bed as she sat in a folded legs position. Rosie didn't have time to do anything before she found Lilith's larger than life foot rest above her. Luckily for her the bed under her was soft enough for it to give in to her so she does not get crushed. But she was completely pinned, feeling the full weight of Lilith's foot on her. Tiny drops of sweat covered her whole body. Lilith definitely could no feel her. Rosie tried rubbing or even scratching the sole of Lilith's foot to get her attention but all was to no avail. She was too small. Rosie's naked body now smelled exactly like the Lilith's giant foot. The socks under her smelled like they have not been washed for a while. <br>\r\nLilith was gently rubbing her foot on the bed. Completely unaware that she was almost torturing Rosie under her feet. Rosie tried her best to crawl away from the massive foot but the subjected weight on her was so great it simply prevented her from moving. She could see the skin stretching in front of her and around her. She was being rolled right and left as Lilith' moved her foot slowly on the bed. <br>\r\nFor the first time this evening, Rosie's luck was about to change. Lilith while sitting on the bed pulled the covers on her bottom body and changed her sitting position to cross legged. She reach with her hands inside the covers and pulled the socks away and threw them away. Luckily for Rosie she was stuck to Lilith's smooth skin. But she was for the first time in hour free. It did not take her long to know where she was. It was also a dangerous place to be, she could easily be crushed if Lilith changed her position, but this was her best chance to get her attention, she must make good use of this break.<br>\r\nWhat will she do?</span></div></div>",

From her dusty hiding place she watched as Sarah came in and put two cases of beer down by the kitchen entrance and go sit down where Rosie had been. She gulped deeply when Rosie realized she would have been smushed under her friends rear end if she stayed over there on the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, something else caught Rosie's attention. A tiny guy was running across the floor! She looked on curiously and realized it looked like the guy who delivered the newspaper on this street. He was around their age, early twenties or so with a thin build and brown hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe seemd pretty determined as he ran up to Lilith and Alina. Rosie was quite surprised when Lilith looked down at him and didn't react like he was out of place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Alina, there's another one of them. I think it's your turn to take care of this one,\" Lilith calmly said as she went back to her beer and chatting with Jo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Alina had turned her attention down to the tiny guy on the floor. He wasn't running away, probably because he expected help, they usually did. She couldn't really reconize him from so high above and she wasn't sure if she really cared. Mostly Lilith and her had been stepping on them barefoot. Her sister Lilith already made videos of her feet online, and Alina saw this as a way to get involved too. No one online would suspect the tiny people were real and she was enjoying it so far. There was something exciting about feeling their tiny bodies squirming under her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSliding off her sandals Alina put her hands on her hips and looked down at the small figure, \"You'd figure you'd leave us alone after everything that's happened. Maybe you want to get stepped on huh? Been eyeing my pretty bare feet little man? I'd love to feel you squish under them, but maybe after I play around with you for a bit first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosie had no idea what was going on now. Was she part of some sort of twisted game her friends were playing? She didn't want to get stepped on. Especially not by her friends, she trusted her friends! Whatever was going on she watched curiously to see exactly what Alina had in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, run forward and hug my foot if you like them. Otherwise I may just get bored and end up smushing you right here. After all, if you're not interested in playing games and you're running up to us, you must just wanna get stepped on,\" Alina teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her surprise, Rosie watched as the tiny guy ran foward and hugged one of Alina's toes. She laughed loudly and smiled to Lilith who returned a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we've got a keeper here,\" Alina explained, \"Or at least until I get bored of him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have fun but don't wander off too long, this is your party after all,\" Lilith told her sister.</span></div></div>",

The girl with red streaks in her hair wandered over quickly with a bounce in her step and came to a stop just in front of the tiny guy she didn't even see on the floor. Like most of the other girls she had sandals on that the guy was now almost face to face with after letting go of Alina's toe and settling back down on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Happy Birthday Alina! I'm so sorry I didn't say anything sooner. I just, thought Rosie was supposed to be here by now,\" Sarah explained giving her friend a big hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat gave Alina a moment to pause. Rosie was here. \"She was around just a moment ago. I'm sure she'll be back soon. Hey, wanna do me a favour?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah smiled and looked excited, \"Yeah sure Alina, it's your special day after all. What did you have in mind?\" She casually brushed her hair back over one ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning down towards the ground Alina said, \"See that down there? I want you to take off your sandals and put your foot on it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down curiously Sarah noticed the tiny guy at her feet, \"Whoa! What in the world IS that?\" She stumbled back away from him. That even caused Lilith to look over for a moment and laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You havn't heard eh?\" Lilith explained, \"We've had these tiny people showing up around our place. They look like people in the neibourhood. We've got no way of helping them so we've been treating them like pests.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Sarah was already down on her hands and knees poking at the tiny guy with her massive fingers with dark red nail polish, \"You've been stepping on them? But, they're people! Or at least they really look like people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's been way too many,\" Alina explained, \"So much so we've made a game out of this kind of stuff. It's gotten really bad. Otherwise we just don't know what else to do. If we told anyone we'd probably end up kicked out of our house and they'd want to investigate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah looked up, brushing her hair back again and staring at Alina apologetically, \"I suppose so. But it seems so mean what you're doing. Can't feed them all and look after them if there's been that many.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you say, wanna try stepping on him?\" Lilith encouraged down to Sarah.</span></div></div>",

You finally make it home and you are about ready to relax and take a long nap when you hear the booming noise from across the street. You look out the window and take notice of all the vehicles that are parked on the house across the street. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMust be some kind of party\u201d, you mutter aloud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou really don\u2019t want to seem like some kind of jerk but you are really tired and the noise of death metal and other music at full blast, so loud that it penetrates your house like it\u2019s nothing. You can\u2019t relax like this. You stumble outside your house and make your way across the street, taking notice of the sky full of storm clouds. You are familiar with the owners of the house. Two women from what you know, one in her mid-twenties and the other in her early twenties or late teens. They seem to be what they call, goths as they wear all black and have the other\u2026 accessories, that otherwise lead you to believe. You get closer to the house and the music gets louder, you take notice of the grass in the yard being long, the trees seemingly desolated with no green leaves and of course cars still stack the driveway and are lined up along the curve. You soon make it to the front door where you take a deep breath and knock on the door three times\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing. The music must to loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time you bang on the door three times. Suddenly a streak of lightning darts down and strikes you on your back! You instantly feel a burning sensation that spreads instantly along your whole body, you honestly believe you are going to die as the burning gets so hotter and the temperature of your skin just stops right before the point where it would seem to damage the cells. You suddenly notice that everything around you grows bigger and bigger! You are in a panicked state to say the least but you have enough logic to know that the world probably isn\u2019t enlarging, no, you are shrinking! The streak of lightning seems to have an adverse effect on your body, instead of killing you with its millions of volts and temperature of hotter than the surface of the sun, it instead shrinks you until you are\u2026..<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You look around as the porch you are standing on has expanding miles and miles on either side! The seemingly smooth concrete floor now looks like rough terrain as its details are magnified, lawn chairs make for gigantic structures and the front door ahead of you is outrageously huge. The music from the house is MUCH louder than ever before, so loud that you can\u2019t even hear yourself breathe. You continue to look up at the front door, pinching yourself without looking just to make sure this is all real and of course a small pain on your arm confirms your fears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you are about to think on what to do next, suddenly the front door swings open! You crane your head back to look at the figure who opened the it. A young woman perhaps in her early twenties who seemed to be thousands of feet in height, of course she had raven black hair, green eyes with a cold pierce, she wore a silver medallion necklace, a purple tank top that exposed her stomach and black jeans which were tucked into a large pair of black boots. You were frozen as your neck was craned all the way back to see the chin under the monolithic goth\u2019s face. With the door open, the music was louder than ever and seemed to really set the mood for your crazy situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gigantic woman starts looking around, \u201cI could\u2019ve fucking swore I heard someone knock on the door!\u201d escapes a thunderous loud voice from the woman\u2019s lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She takes a step forward to get a better view outside. You look up at the giantess\u2019s enormous boot as it lifts high in the air and goes from several hundred feet away in front of you to casting a shadow right above you exposing you to the dirty underside of the deadly footwear! You are luckily on the outer edge of the shadow and you quickly dodge as the boot crashed down at your former position, making a loud BOOM proceeded by the ground shaking violently and causing a gust of wind to literally pick you off of your feet and slide you across the concrete patio floor! This all happened in an instant, contrasting your perception that giants would be moving in slow motion like the cartoons and shows depict, they move VERY fast and cover a wide-range of distance meaning that you aren\u2019t really safe anywhere! You stand up on your feet and brush yourself off, taking in deep breaths with beads of cold sweat dripping down your body. The giantess continues to scan the area as you stand still. You need to find a way to get help as you will not be able to survive outdoors at this size as most bugs can make an easy meal\u2026 no snack out of you and it also wouldn\u2019t bode well on your luck to continue to have to dodge a giant\u2019s foot every day. You are going to have to get help from one of these goth girls at this little party they are having. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the giantess continues to wonder who was at the door, you decide to take the opportunity to\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As your vision clears, you are barley able to make out a huge faded \"Converse\" logo on the surface. Thats when you realize that you are inside a shoe!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt smells quite bad. In fact, the insole still feels a little moist so you assume the owner just removed them from their feet not too long ago. Above you, you can see the shoes logo with a \"6 womens\" stamped on it. Even tho converse sneakers are unisex, theres no way any full grown man wears a size 6 shoe. So these obviously have to belong to a female. Its quite dark, but as you look around your surroundings, you can tell that these shoes are pretty worn in. Of course, now isnt the time to inspect the condition of this environment anymore. You need to find a way out of this shoe. You notice the fabric on the heel area is torn and frayed. You could use that to climb out! Just as you advance torwards it, a sudden earthquake knocks you off your feet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the??!\" You say to yourself. Just then, you hear a voice right above you looked up. You have no idea who she is, but you hear her addressed as \"Arden\".  Arden is a petite goth asian girl with black hair put up in ponytails and wearing a pink dress with black animal printings on it. She is obviously the owner of these sneakers as she is preparing to insert her nylon clad feet into them! Normally, Arden only wore a size 5/6 US womens shoe but now at your current stature her foot alone is about as large as a cruise ship! You heard something about more beer being out in somebody's car and that they want Arden to get it. You watch as Arden's nyloned toes begin to lower into the sneaker and thats when you realize you need to find a safe spot somewhere in the shoe to avoid being crushed! Quickly looking around,</span></div></div>",

The sheer gigantic proportions of everything around you had left you helplessly enthralled against your better judgment. The thunderous boom of the goth girl's foot fall had shocked you back into sense, however, and now your mind was  now in full gear, desperately trying to reason and make a plan to survive this encounter with enormity. You were lucky enough to dodge one of those lethal steps, but there was no telling whether or not that fortuity was tenable. No, you needed to get some help. Hopefully you had friends in high places.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the worm's eye view that you had at the moment, the best you could do was crane your neck as far as it would allow. The ginormous goth was looking outside, and her body had gone almost completely still. That's when the light bulb went off. If you took off for it now, you could get yourself a relatively safe position on top of the boot. Then from there you could coordinate a plan for getting her attention soon after. It would be a good way to get yourself killed if the plan backfired, but with your options so limited, it was really all you could do. Her next step could easily crush you anyway. There was really no escaping her range.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, you started to make a run for the towering edifice that was the goth woman's footwear. The closer you got to it, the more insane your plan began to feel, but you were set on it. If you stayed where you were, you'd certainly die, and trying to take off and hide would only result in the same end. You made incredible time, crossing the expanse in just about a minute. Panting slightly, you humorously think that shrinking had been the best thing to happen to your health in some time. You took hold of one the bumpy side of the leather boot closest to you and secured your footing. Here went nothing.</span></div></div>",
