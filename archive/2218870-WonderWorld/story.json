The staff, by necessity, have been organized into a strict hierarchy; with management at the top; technicians, writers, and actors a rung lower on the ladder; and sanitation, maintenance, and grunt workers at the bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActors are the most sought-after positions; for both the prestige of such a position and the benefits afterward. Contracts are set for five years at the minimum, and anyone who makes it through that crucible can get any Wondertainment-owned role they desire. The selection and training process is rigorous too, a strict regimen of lessons to teach them how to stay in-character no matter their form or situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany a proud graduate of that program have been bitterly disappointed by the nature of their assignment. Gender, age, height: all these and more are no barrier to the Wondrous\u2122 auto-surgeons of Meconstruction!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWriters are assigned to create exciting new Plotlines for their awaiting guests. There are a few that create Wonderful\u2122 experiences every time they put pen to paper, but a fair amount of the writer\u2019s room is burnt out, and just rehash usual tropes for their none-the-wiser guests. A few luminaries are employed as coaches for the actors, watching plots unfold through contact-lens cameras whilst whispering plot twists and story directions into the actor\u2019s cleverly hidden earpieces. Whether the actors listen or not is a bit of a toss-up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTechnicians are stretched to their creative limit as well by Wondertainment\u2019s nigh-unmeetable quota: designing new animatronics for creatures and roles unoccupiable by humans; new gadgets and special effects to enhance the realism of each environment; and pushing the envelope of Meconstruction\u2019s technology.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(There are rumblings of discontent among the actors about artificially intelligent robots created to take their starring roles in the park, but those are mostly dismissed with much rolling of the eyes and scoffs of \u2018Science fiction!\u2019)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWonder-World\u2019s mantra is \u2018customer-obsession\u2019, after all. Who needs to follow labor laws when you have mountains of cash?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat being said, who are you?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Here are a few of the many roles you may find yourself playing in the sleek metropolis of Wonder-City:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Captain Capable</b>; the archetypical \u2018flying brick\u2019 with a cornucopia of other Plotline-convenient superpowers and one of the founding members of the \u2018Utopian Alliance\u2019, he\u2019s a bit of a boyscout: humble in his accomplishments but steadfast in the face of the evil. His civilian identity is Chet Tompkins, a mild-mannered insurance salesman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe actors that are chosen to play him usually aren\u2019t nearly as humble or kind, however. It\u2019s one of the most sought-after positions for many a reason: the well-muscled athletic physique, the uncountable female Guests hanging off their arms, and the center-stage focus in many a storyline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, all this means that the actors for the Captain are easily shunted off to other roles, what with all the eager mummers in queue behind them\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Mighty Maid</b>; She\u2019s also a founding member of the Utopian Alliance, though you\u2019d never guess it. In her civilian identity, she goes by the name Margot Marseille, a young thing who has earned the dubious honor of the cities\u2019 top maid with inconspicuous use of her \u2018super-cleaning\u2019 powers. With an auburn bob topped by a ruffled headband, a ridiculous French accent, a nigh-physically-impossible hourglass-figure, and a penchant for getting caught in the most basic of traps, her detractors claim that she sets feminism and the reputation of a certain Western European country back fifty years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWonder-Land, of course, dismissed these opinions outright. Hundreds of trust-fund teens and lecherous old men paid out the nose for a chance to ogle the \u2018Servant of the People,\u2019 with the Writers and Technicians eagerly obliging: the former managing to get a checkbox for \u2018Mighty Maid romance,\u2019 on the Wonder-City guest application, and the latter designing intentional flaws into her corset for more wardrobe malfunctions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, Mighty Maid was the focal point of one of the company\u2019s few legal losses : the sight of a sniffling young thing tearfully telling tales about mincing around for the hungry eyes of the elite was a bit too much for the public and courts to stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe financial loss was relatively minor, in the scope of all things, but Wondertainment vowed to never let it happen again. So now, if you carefully watch the graduation ceremony of the Actor Training Program, you can see one or two young men goggling at the contents of their enveloped assignment. If you choose to follow them to the auto-surgeon, you can watch them wobble out of their appointment looking markedly different; a good amount of their former mass flushed down the medical waste chute, save for a specially preserved piece. Even if they talk after their contracts are up, who would believe them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly the actor, direct coworkers, and management are privy to this secret, the former two threatened with immediate severance without pay nor form reinstitution if they disclose the secret to any guest or refuse to play their part. Despite this, you can find quite the number of red-tressed doppelgangers in nearby cities. To this date, no one outside of Wondertainment has quite connected the dots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Black Sable</b>; real name: Carmilla Yahontov, a rich heiress who moonlights as a super-villain, pilfering the contents of vaults with usage of her super-intangibility (Which is realized in the park by cleverly hidden secret passages.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough many female actor aspirants try to snag the role of the Sterling Scoundrel with the hope of being the full-fledged badass she is on the silver screen, most are disappointed by the steady stream of moneyed masochists who come to be degraded by the near-amazon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome are fine with it, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho shall you be playing the part of, then?</span></div></div>",

The Town Hall of Wonder City, normally the site of dazzling, effects-laden battles between the forces of good-actors and evil-actors, has today been fitted out with several hundred cheap plastic chairs to accommodate the forty gowned graduates of the Wondertainment Actor Training Program and their friends and families.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there you are, front-row seat. Being here, in the vaulted halls right at the heart of the WonderWorld complex, you can't help but feel excited and trepidation in equal measure. How many thousands of actors have given their utmost to amaze the audience, to bring a touch of magic into a mundane world. How many millions of excited visitors, men and children alike, have passed through here and watched in wonder, believing for just a moment that dreams really can come true? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weight of that obligation presses down from you, made all the more real by the stern, granite visage of Doctor Wonder staring down from the stone statue of '<i>Mayor Wonder, Established Wonder City in 1837</i>' at the front of the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNervously you fiddle with the hem of the rental graduation robe. Your fiance notices and slides her hand within yours, interlacing her fingers to stop you fidgeting, and gives you kiss on the cheek. \"You're going to do great. We're all excited to see who you're going to be,\" she says warmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speak for yourself, I'm just here for the base package,\" your dad jokes, slapping you on the back so hard that it dislodges your mortarboard hat. \"Three days in WonderWorld almost makes up for the three years of tuition we paid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promised I'll pay that back.\" By which you mean, 5 years on your contract and Wondertainment will void the debt. Nobody pays off loans of that magnitude on an actor's salary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp on the podium, Mayor Hamilton Hayworth Hill III - or at least the actor now known as such - glances at his watch in impatience. The Town Hall is set aside for this occasion for one hour every year, and one hour only. In 27 minutes 14 seconds, the villain known as Firefly is due to burst through the front doors and the pyrotechnics under the floor will go off, with or without a roomful of graduates sat on top of them. Where the <i>hell</i> is Captain Capable?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry for the delay, ladies and gentlemen! Had to stop a bank robbery on the way here, you know how it is!\" comes the valiant call across the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lighting technician is at least partially on the ball. The lights dim. A spotlight swinging up to one the empty balconies of the auditorium, drawing the audience's gaze. The spotlight quickly shifts a different balcony where stands Captain Capable, his bleached white smile shining brilliantly. Striking a noble pose, he rises into the air and floats over the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More like Captain Cable, I can see the wires,\" Maria whispers in your ear. You hush her, not wanting to ruin the magic for the rest. The audience watches transfixed as the Captain makes his landing beside the podium and extends his red-white-and-blue gloved hand to shake the hands of the scowling mayor. There is a brief pause as a stage hand dressed as the sidekick Boy Competent rushes on stage to release the harness on the Captain's back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're gonna make such a better Captain than that guy,\" says Maria, looking at you with admiration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In my dreams am I going to get that lucky,\" you reply, showing her your crossed fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies and Gentlemen gathered here today...\" begins the Captain, glancing at the clock. \"... let's begin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne by one, the graduates' names are read out. They go up on stage to shake the Captain's hand, receive their diploma, an envelope containing the details of the role they will be playing, and most importantly, a few private words of wisdom from the Big C himself. Then it's your turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow, your hands are sweaty. Thank god the Captain is wearing gloves. With every eye and a swelteringly hot floodlight on you, it feels to take an age just walking to the stage. Somehow it is challenge just to move one foot after the other without tripping over the steps or themselves. How have three years of stage school not prepared you better for this moment? Your heart feels like it is beating out of your chest...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... and then it stops as a cry of \"we love you, Charlie!\" comes from your fiance. The crowd titters at the sudden outburst, and the Captain himself puts his head back and gives a theatrical guffaw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leather of the Captain's glove is worn smooth from hundreds of hands as it shakes yours. He hands you your diploma and the envelope, though his head is turned away, fixated on somebody in the front row. \"Quite a mouth your girlfriend's get on her,\" the Captain  mutters below the threshold of the microphone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah, she's got a pair of lungs on her alright\", you laugh in embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Captain leans in, your heart leaping in anticipation of his words of encouragement. \"Oh, she's certainly got a sweet pair of <i>something</i>,\" he sneers, slapping your shoulder and guiding you with a shove towards the far side of the stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe far side of the stage is dark and quiet, the sounds of the auditorium soon swallowed up by the thick red velvet curtains. A set of stairs leads down and down. As you descend, the gilded, baroque architecture of the Town Hall very quickly becomes grey concrete and stark fluorescent lighting. Yet this mundane, industrial area thrills you. This is <i>the actual</i> WonderWorld utility network! The Wonder Kingdom is fabled to have the largest utilidor system in the world, a network of tunnels running under the park to allow its actors to get from place to place out of sight of the visitors. This is where the magic is made!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a deep lungful, savouring the moment. Oddly, it doesn't smell much like magic. It smells like rust and sweat. And there is the strange, strong scent of hot fat and burnt hair which only grows stronger as you progress further down the corridor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is nobody here to greet you, and it is eerily deserted even of actors. There is just a misspelled sign - '<i>gradautes this way</i>' - pointing down half a mile of industrial corridor before there is another sign - '<i>garduates check number</i>'. Beyond, the corridor is lined on both sides with numbered doorways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stench of cooking flesh and burnt hair is overpowering here, and there is an odd, muffled noise just at the edge of hearing, a repetitive thud echoing through the concrete like somebody hammering against a wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the moment of confusion, you look to the envelope for guidance. Printed on the front in glitter is the number '7'. You step through door 7, tearing open the envelope as you go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room beyond is little larger than a closet with a bare bulb illuminating side walls of steel, a floor-to-ceiling mirror in front of you, and a concrete floor crisscrossed with drainage channels and a wide drain. The door seals shut behind with a heavy, pneumatic clunk.</span></div></div>",

A handful of gold glitter pours out when you open it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">Mighty Maid</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what.\" This is a mistake, right? No. Your name is right there at the top of the letter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMighty Maid is a joke of a character, a sexist relic of a time in the 1970s when comic books were written by misogynists and illustrated to pander to the 13-18 male demographic, after they discovered that a big breasted French maid on the front page tripled sales. Her creator, William Byrne, had been infamous for his love of bondage, and so her stories usually involved her being tied up after (once again) naively accepting the job of cleaning the evil villain's volcano lair, and typically ended with her being rescued by Captain Capable and spanked over his knee on the steps of the town hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was frankly baffling to you that company as progressive as Wondertainment had deigned her appropriate for a role in their Wonder Cinematic Universe, let alone their theme park. Fortunately they had chosen to improve the poor actress' working conditions after that disgruntled employee had come forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" you say again to the cubicle. \"I think there's been a mistake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise, with a tiny electronic click, the mirror in front of you suddenly becomes a window. A window on to a broad, darkened room illuminated by the thousands of glowing switches on banks of computer terminals, and the light that streams from your cubicle and the cubicles either side of you. Though you cannot see into the cubicles next to you, you can see the light from them playing over the faces of the men in white coats seated at the computers - some of the light is blue and ripples, as if shining though a spray of chemicals pouring down the window; another distinctly shows the shadows of arms thrashing before the bulb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man at the console situated in front of your cubicle leans towards a microphone at his desk. \"No mistake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*click* The window becomes a mirror once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What! I'm not Mighty Maid!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*click* The mirror becomes a window. \"Not yet.\" *click*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cold sense of dread is starting to form in the pit of your stomach. You bang your fist on the mirror. \"Mighty Maid's a girl!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*click* \"Do not bang on the glass.\" *click*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can picture her clearly from the news coverage - the video recordings taken by visitors of her mincing about the tropical resort on stilettos with a frilly black skirt hitched up over her backside, bending over with her feather duster to clean up every piece of trash the gaggle of leering male fans threw in front of her. You picture the middle-age men pinching the curvy cheeks of the 2D character they'd grown up fantasizing over. You slam your fist harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*click* \"I said don't touch the glass,\" says the voice icily. The man reaches for a blue dial on his desk, cranking it up. There is a gurgle above...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Psccchhhhh</i>. A mist of neon blue liquid sprays from the ceiling. In a moment, you look as if you've fallen into a port-a-potty as the acrid stuff drips down your torso, soaks through your clothes, until you're sodden to the skin. You splutter in protest. The man cranks the dial further and the mist becomes like a heavy rain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is something thicker dripping down the back of your neck. You reach your hands up to your head and pull them away covered in black goop. The mortarboard hat was... melting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, that was a <i>rental</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe letter, envelope, and diploma in your hands are becoming mush, the thick parchment like a rice paper that tears apart and dribbles through your fingers. You can feel the deep groves of the drainage channels beneath your feet, as the thick rubber soals of your shoes begins to melt and wash away. The heavy graduation gown slings to you, chunks of it bubbling and sloughing away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe treacle-like melted plastic and fabric of the mortarboard dribbles still down your scalp. You try to pull more of it out of your hair. Your fingers comes away matted in a handful of your auburn curls.</span></div></div>",

The blue gush dislodges loose strands with pressure alone and soon enough your vision is clogged with glossy clumps of blue. The constant downpour on your bare scalp is a strange feeling, but the fact that all your clothes \u2014 including your lucky boxers \u2014 have been washed down the drain is a bit more attention-grabbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cover your shame for a second, but the glass has switched back to the mirror. You move your gaze to your mechanical foe: the nozzle. Distressingly, the hand you use to protect your eyes from the deluge of blue is alabaster-pale. Even the burn scar you got as a kid has faded away, indiscernible from the rest of your arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch your arm hair get blasted off with the rivulets of pen-ink liquid, watching the little threads dance around the floor before sluicing down the drain. This has to stop. You take a deep breath and squat, tensing the muscles in your legs. You cast a baleful gaze at your quarry; it\u2019s only two-or-so feet above your head. You can do this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe glass changes with a <i>click</i>. The white-coated man leans closer to his microphone. \u201cPlease do not disrupt any appliances in the Meconstruction Chamber.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck you.\u201d you growl. The curse is strange and satisfying on your tongue: WonderCollege program discouraged the usage of harsh language, with grade-letter-reduction as punishment past the initial three strikes. You haven\u2019t said anything harsher than \u2018heck\u2019 in three years, but the moment couldn\u2019t be more appropriate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a grunt of effort, you leap into the air, clawing your fingers through the torrent of blue, before your fingers find glorious purchase on the metal nub. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA triumphant laugh peels out of your mouth! For about three seconds, because the resulting jolt coursing through you is enough to completely spasm every striated muscle. You feel the dull sensation of your body impacting the floor and of your limbs uselessly thumping against the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes you around twenty seconds for you to fully recover. Twenty seconds of blue stuff lashing down on your face, wiping any trace of follicular growth from you face, even that light stubble you were working so hard on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a <i>click</i>, the mirror changes back to a window. \u201cTold you so.\u201d the man intones, voice bereft of amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swipe the back of a hand across your lashless lids to clear the final bit of hat-goop and turn your bared orbs to the now-mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell was that?!\u201d you hiss, pointing a finger up at the nozzles. <br>\r\n<i>click</i>. \u201cAnti-tamper mechanism.\u201d A little pause, then another <i>click</i>.  \u201cFoul language is against our Wonderful Code of Conduct, please refrain from using it in whilst in our employ.

There\u2019s only one thing left to do: You struggle to your feet, fumbling a hand along the wall for support. The soreness has just start to hit. \u201cI quit, then!\u201d you choke out. The words almost hurt as they leave your lips. Your dreams feel like they\u2019re dissolving before you, much like everything else you brought into the chamber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*click* The man appears in front of you once again, but his till-now-impassive expression has a quizzical bent to it. He beckons over a neighboring man and the two confer behind their hands, before the second shrugs and walks away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour tormentor massages the bridge of his nose, before pressing the microphone button with another <i>click</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright then.

Hold there.\" The second technician is beckoned over again. The two men consult for a minute, each stepping up to the mirrored glass in turn, pressing their noses almost to the glass and inspecting you closely. You scowl back at them, though their attention is more focused on your ass than your face, and they pay you no mind. Your tormentor is unshaven, dark rims under his eyes and coffee stains about the lapel of his labcoat. He looks like a man at the tail end of an 18 hour shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe returns to the console, twisting a second dial. The gentle spray of chemicals above narrows into a tight, high-powered jet, blasting with impeccable aim down the crevice of your spread buttcheeks. Like one of Doctor Wonder's cartoons, you almost hit the roof. You might have grabbed the nozzle if you hadn't been distracted by the sharp sting in your backside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou land a gasping, shaking, dripping mess, hurling insults at the mirror that are quickly muted. The two technicians reexamine you with an impassive eye, like bored kids staring at a particularly dull slug behind glass at WonderZoo. A switch is flicked on the console. They fumble in their pockets for loose change and move out of sight of the narrow field of view provided by the booth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue has stopped. A fine mist of cold, clear water starts to fall from the ceiling, washing away the defoliant and any last trace of hair or blemish. In the mirror, your hairless male body looks odd, inhuman - like a child's doll with the hair piece and clothes removed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man returns with a plastic cup of steaming liquid, setting it down among the dozens of empty cups littering the console. He reclines in the seat and cracks his fingers in front of him, piano-maestro-style. Then with a flourish that seems to drip sarcasm and boredom, he presses a single button.</span></div></div>",

You press yourself back against the wall of the cubicle as a stream of viscous liquid begins to pour from on high. It has the consistency of honey, is a vivid neon pink colour, and smells like a pharmacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drain is no longer draining. The goo pools in the corner, slowly starting to creep up over your toes. Soon it has filled the cubicle to your ankles. Unlike the frigid blue liquid and rinse, it is hot enough that swirls of pink vapour emit from the bubbling surface. Breathing them makes your head spin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly with great effort will your feet move within the chemical gunk. You don't know what it is, or what it will do to you, but it can't be good. You try to make another leap for the nozzle on the ceiling, hoping to use it to lift yourself out, but your feet remain fixed within the thick treacle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe level has risen to your knees, and your heart rate is rising along with it. The cubicle is starting to feel <i>very</i> small. What if you're in one of those snuff films? What if there's a bunch of weirdos on the other side of the mirrored glass getting off to watching a bald man drown in pink goo. There are some very specific fetishes these days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said I'd agree to do it, alright? What more do you want from me? You want me to sign something? I''ll sign whatever you want.\" The mirror remains impassive. The goo is at your mid thigh. \"If you ki-kill me, my family are going to notice me missing! You're gonna have hell to pay if they never see me again. They'll bring the whole army-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*click* The voice has the tone of a man who has heard this all before. \"This is Florida.

Remain calm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>You</i> remain calm!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I shall,\" the man replies rather smugly from his console, sipping his coffee. \"As for your family - let me check our database... hmm... yes, they're booked in to tomorrow evening's Graduation Gala. They're down to be served by Mighty Maid herself. So I can assure you they will see you again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe level continues its ascent up over your genitals and buttocks. The temperature is making you perspire heavily, and the air is becoming harder to breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm <i>not</i> serving my own family,\" you say, the defiant tone in your voice seeming to be swallowed up by the close, gooey confines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>You</i> won't. Mighty Maid will. Your father was quite specific about who he wanted waiting on him hand and foot. Your fiance wanted Captain Capable of course.\" *click*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe goo tickles under your armpits. The thick vapours fill what remains of the air and the heat is unbearable. It feels like the flesh hidden beneath the goop is melting. You stagger and swoon, terrified for a moment about sinking beneath the liquid, but it holds you up and in place. \"So hot in here...\" you croak. \"Turn it off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*click* \"Snips and snails.

He\u2019d snagged a quick 20-min nap in the break room that only served to whet his insomnia, but now it was back to the grindstone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQA for Mighty Maid was a <i>nightmare</i>. Checking the process for the big CC was piss-easy; just make sure you had the right blend of steroids and check on the muscle grafts, then you could knock out a couple of sudokus at the console. Silver Sable was even smoother; knock them out a bit while the autodoc snips away at various tendons and bumps them up a cup size or two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Maid-to-be\u2019s had been and always would be the worst to deal with, always whining and whinging and squirming. Zach\u2019s reservoir of empathy was bone-dry by this point; you would think that they\u2019d\u2019ve caught on with WonderCollege\u2019s adage of \u2018Preparing you for <i>any</i> role.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took a sip of his stale coffee and flicked the lightswitch on the console. The pink-shrouded cubicle, however, did not light up. The damn bulbs in the ChemoPods seemed to always be on the fritz. Zach stared at the stucco tiles of the ceiling with a baleful gaze as the filament took its sweet time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, lightbulb or not, it was a sight better than when the bot did the whole thing with a scalpel. You\u2019d come back from lunch break and see a flayed skeleton, or watch a surgical saw go to town on a couple of vertebrae. It was hard to watch the minxy maid totter about the park when you\u2019d seen the gristle-covered bags of fat that served as her derriere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light finally guttered, on, lighting Zach\u2019s grimace with a pale rose sheen. Great. He\u2019d come at just the right time. The figure in front of him was a sight away from his form two hours ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust, er, not in the <i>best</i> way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkin hung off of him like ugly drapes, some of it squashed against the edges of the MetaGel mold, other flaps left to dangle.

There was much you could hide within those voluminous skirts of those ballgowns. The actors could be allowed to keep in it in their pants on the proviso that the paying public never witnessed what was hidden beneath their legs, and it worked as an excellent incentive for keeping their compliance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot so with Mighty Maid. That three-inch hemline, those delicate white panties, neither offered anything to the imagination. Combined with a wolfish audience (that was one way of putting it), there was nowhere to hide even the smallest scrap of manhood from the prying camera lenses and fingertips of her fans, not even one of the vestigial, drug-shrunk organs the princesses ended up with. It would have to go. All of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo time like the present. Right now there was a war waging inside the Maid-to-be's body between his true body chemistry and that which the corporation was wishing to install with their synthetic hormones and metabolic moderators. A few snips would quickly decide the victor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo joysticks were placed in front of the console. During the slow hours, they were used for playing Rocket League. Zach activated them, placing his fingers about their buttons. At the same time, panels opened within the cubicle and a pair of segmented, metal, tentacle-like manipulators emerged into the solidified goop. Their end of one was tipped with a steel claw much like those found in the arcade machines just 30 feet above, where children paid a quarter for a chance to manipulate the claw into grabbing a stuffed toy and depositing it into a chute. The other manipulator was tipped with a scalpel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach fancied he was getting very good at this game, as indeed it had become to him, and unlike the machines played by the visitors, this one wasn't rigged. He left the scalpel manipulator where it was for now, not wishing to accidentally nick an artery, and maneuvered the other around the leg of the mannequin-like figure. The manipulator moved through the gel like an eel through water, coiling around one thigh. The figure twitched, the vitals and accelerated heart rate spiking even higher, as the cold steel of the manipulator teased aside the folds of excess skin that draped from the stomach to find its prize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe organ was already a sad, shrunken thing. The drugs were not being kind to the actor's masculine pride. The three steel claws opened and inched forward, two of the claws snagging under the man's testicles, the other clamping down from above. Zach squeezed the button to tighten the nose, noticing his patient squirm in the millimetres available to them as the claws dug in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he drew the manipulator back, the organ popped free. The gel was making it slippery, and there was barely anything to get purchase on. Deftly he adjusted the pharmaceutical composition of the next food bolus - sildenafil, quebrachine, a few others. He watched and waited patients while the nutrient-drug mix was pumped down the man's throat. It was only a minute before the man's loins began to swell - nothing to write home about, but enough to hold on to. The last erection the gentleman would have for five years, or longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe claw gripped again. Again it slipped. With a huff of impatience, Zach jammed his thumb down on the button, the arcade machine claws closing like a steel trap about his genitals, digging deep into the soft flesh. The manipulator pulled and pulled, stretching it out away from the body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemarkable how much the patient could thrash even when their muscles were reduced to sinew, Zach thought, as the scalpel manipulator began to carefully slice away at the flesh where the penis met the torso. He sometimes wondered how conscious they really were during the procedure. This was not one of these days. His mind was primarily on what he was going to be having for dinner, as the man's manhood was neatly cut away. It came free from the claw, floating inert in the gel while the two manipulators went to work tidying up the messy gash between the legs, tying off the tubes and arteries and cutting away some excess flesh to make room for the new organs that would be stitched into place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce that was done, the genitals were snagged once more and deposited within a hatch. They would be...</span></div></div>",

Making a  new phallus was surprisingly difficult: all those tubes and flaps and bambosh were <i>hell</i> on the autodoc. Meconstruction's suggestion to save the things was a catalyst for inspiration, really; rebellious actors would be taken to the writer\u2019s office with a conspicuous organ \u2014 gussied up with a bit of the excess material from their en-maidening, otherwise the desiccated lil\u2019 thing\u2019d just look like a vaguely cylindrical cyst \u2014 placed off to the side in a conspicuous tank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a tad ironic; the Maids that clung to their manhood fervently often got the best reviews, after their \u2018motivational-meetings\u2019. Anyone who continued to protest, well\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all worked out in the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey\u2019d cross that bridge when they came to it, though, and Zach, thankfully, was not a part of \u2018they\u2019. Instead, he idly flipped through a catalog of colors, trying to find the right groin-color to match MM\u2019s pale skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wouldn\u2019t get much use out of it for the first couple months, but he\u2019d get more than a reprimandation if a bit of caramel-colour was revealed with a flip of her skirt. With a quick turn of a joystick, a small circle of gel was cleared right at the poor sap\u2019s navel. Zach looked at the catalog, then at the skin, then back again, and once more... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPretty Porcelain,\u201d he muttered to himself. It was standard for Mighty Maid bits, but sometimes the subject reacted oddly to the chemical agents. A few years back, one Mighty Maid came out virtually albinistic; the writers had thrown together some story about her coming from the Negaverse for a few days, and then quickly shunted him off to some alien love interest in WonderGalaxy, to avoid having a blistered City centerfold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe input a quick sequence of numbers into the console\u2019s keyboard, checked the vitals once again, then languidly leaned back to play a game of Solitaire. After a few hands that he actually managed to lose, a short chirrup roused him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove the pink biogenic gel were two of the segmented manipulators, one tipped with what looked like a frosting pipette, the other a claw. The claw holds something that, for all intents and purposes, looks like a small chalky softball, with a puffy pink slit in the centre.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite his sense of professional detachment and the overwhelming sense of boredom, Zach couldn\u2019t help but be a mote impressed by how quickly the vaginal graft was produced. Its NervStim function would have to be setup in a week or so, after MM got her sea legs, but that would be someone else\u2019s messy problem, thank <i>god</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach plugged the twin joysticks into the requisite USB port with a trill of his lips. The alternate manipulators sprung to lifel, and after a quick jolt from side to side to check the controls, he got to work. The claw slowly rotated the piece of artificial flesh in a circle as the other one dotted the ball with bits of orangeish ointment, until the whole thing looked like an alien fungi. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach had smelled the ointment before, when he had watched on a, eurgh, <i>manual</i> Meconstruction. It smelled like death and burning, and one of the moronic spectators who actually touched it came out with a melted fingertip. With it, though, the area around the vagina should be smooth, unbroken line of skin, vat-grown flesh indistinguishable from the real thing, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, time for the shoving. With a quick flourish of rotation, Zach navigated the manipulator down below the sunken stomach, lifted the skin once again with the ointment applicator, checked to make sure the damn thing was frontways, and shoved it in with a push forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, the limbs of the Actor shook in their tight mold, and once again Zach did not pay it much mind. He instead concentrated on moving the applicator to get the spacing of the biodegradable staples <i>juussst</i> right. It wouldn\u2019t matter much in a few days\u2019 time, but it\u2019d bother him for a few hours if he didn\u2019t get it right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He whistled a short song as the subject twitched with every fastener-injection.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A two seasoned series that \u2018was cut down in its prime\u2019 according to your dad, it followed the pompadoured space-pirate as he roamed across galaxies, thwarting the nebulous Hegemony and helping out various alien species in a way that wasn\u2019t very pirate-like at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour dad\u2019s grin widens as he watches Dylas point imperiously at his co-pilot seat.

Shields were, as they permanently appeared to be, at 13%.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How come the actors are shaking about but the golden dice hanging from the console aren't?\" you ask, pointing an accusatory finger at the obvious gaff. \"Don't they have the laws of physics in the 31st Millennium?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad points with finger-guns (or finger-phasers), doing his best imitation of Dylas Canthrope roguish mannerisms as he quips \"laws don't apply to Dylas Canthrope.\" You roll your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn screen, a sleek fighter bears down on Dylas Canthrope's ship, guns strobing. A shot from within the cockpit shows what you suspect to be an out-of-work porn actress from the 1960s, slathered in green paint and KY jelly and practically poured into a silver catsuit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about <i>those</i> for physics?\" dad says with a wink and a nod at her bountiful breasts sloshing about, barely contained, while what is clearly the arm of a stagehand wobbles the set from side to side. \"Gelatina: the most sensual single-celled organism in the Galaxy. One of Canthrope's most persistent nemeses - well, she was in two episodes anyway.\" He jabs a finger at her glistening, green tits. \"See, a lot of people complain that her outfit was exploitative, but its actually designed to maintain her shape - in her natural form she's a shapeless amoebae. The science is all there in the Universal Odyssey: Insider's Guide.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh. What's her deal?\" you ask, fishing around for a question to appear genuinely interested in the subject matter after realising you've been staring at a (probably long dead) actress' breasts for far longer than is socially acceptable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's a Space Marshall - it's her job to bring Dylas in. She aint bad but she's got one hell of a stick up her butt. See, she's terrified that if she ever relaxes, she'll lose her form completely and turn into primordial goo. That's why she's so uptight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems a little...\" Your thoughts are derailed as a proton torpedo collides with Gelatina's fighter, sending fresh quakes through the actress. \"Is,uh, she at the park?\"</span></div></div>",

Her arms are trussed to a metal surgical table, and some uniformed group of Hegemonic baddies are tic-tac-ing the zipper of her clingy catsuit down, an act that would probably discorporate her in-universe and get the show bumped up a few letter grades in the real world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrustratingly, the screen <i>plunks</i> off right after the zipper crosses the event horizon.

I wasn't interested anyway,\" you grumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe attendant remains at dad's elbow while he completes the form. She catches you sneaking a peak at the low cut of her crimson tunic and you think you catch a flicker of annoyance on her face before the corporate smile replaces it. \"I, uh, like your badge.\" You point at the metal symbol pinned just above her left breast, as if that was what had held your interest all this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" she says with a knowing, exasperated tone. She must get this a lot. She taps her finger against the badge, which gives an electronic trill.

Which is for your father to decide.\" She leans around his arm for a glance at the customization sheets dad is filling in. Judging by the frenetic pencil scritches, he is sketching something down. The pencil tip just seems to revolve in broad circular motions as he draws. Her eyes widen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad glances up, scrutinizing you. \"What would you say your volume is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My volume?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, we can extrapolate from weight, it's fine,\" the attendant assures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's 130- uh, 150 lbs,\" you reply, not wanting the girl to think you're a dweeb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continues to scrawls long enough for the arrivals hall to empty of the last plane of passengers, as each visitor is filtered away by their respective costumed attendants. You sit on your suitcase with a huff as the minutes go past, habitually checking your phone in boredom. No signal. Another thing the humongous metal dome interferes with. Fair play to the attendant, she continues to pretend to be fascinated by the scree of nonsense he is no doubt putting to paper - her eyebrows repeatedly rising or her mouth opening wide in surprise. Another one of his terrible fanfictions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps your father should become one of our writers. I'll go start making preparations, if you'll excuse me one moment,\" she titters lightly, stepping away and mincing down the hall, thought not far enough away that you can't overhear as she taps her badge and speaks into it, her girlish manerisms falling away and her tone dropping an octave as she says, \"yeah, sorry for the hold up guys, looks like I got another mega-nerd.... yeah.... uh huh... yeah, I reckon I'm gonna need a crew on this one... let's start with like a gallon of t-serum for the dad and-\"</span></div></div>",

Are you ready to begin your vacation?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we ever,\" dad cried, clapping his hands together and grabbing his case. We are led away from the initial arrivals area, down travelators that run the mile-long length of the hanger-sized terminal. Dad continues to be ebullient about his plans for the holiday, which you zone out. Dad in turn is zoning out the gentle remarks from the representative about how the role of the main character, Canthorpe, is limited in number and, since we will be sharing the Galaxy with many other visitors, the company may be unable to guarantee his first choice of character. Her polite requests if he has a second choice fall on deaf ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the far end, where the terminal splits off in many directions, are hundreds of small cubicles containing a desks and chairs. Costumed Wondertainment representatives sit in each booth, going over paperwork with the individuals or families there. There appears to be an exchange going on too - some of the visitors are being handed what look like pills, others strange coloured liquids to drink, some are opening boxes and pulling out full-body, skin-coloured suits. The sounds of the thousands of visitors is a cacophany and there is muzak being pumped in at full volume, but there are shouts of delight and surprise, and you swear you hear a distant scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA representative vacates one of the booths with a family of golden retrievers about his ankles - two adults and two puppies. The animals move ungainly on four legs, making headway mostly by the sharp tugs on their collars that the representative gives. 'Gena Nova' moves in to his vacated booth. You sit in the still-warm plastic chairs across from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo big cardboard boxes are brought to the table. They are labelled Welcome Packs. Dad takes a deep inhalation of the packaging like he's doing an unboxing video as he slowly opens his. There is a 2 litre plastic bottle of water in his, and clothing neatly folded and wrapped in a square of paper. There is a smaller box which he shakes near his ear containing what sound like metal implements or gadgets. \"That's a phaser if ever I heard one!\" he remarks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he goes to unwrap the clothing, Gena Nova says, \"we have changing rooms just in the next area. If you'd just like to drink the full two litres of liquid provided and continue down that walkway, you should be ready to change by the time you arrive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nods eagerly, lifting his Welcome Box to his chest and taking the bottle in the other. He makes a face on his first gulp, and you can smell the chemical smell from here, but guzzles it down regardless. \"See you on the other side, champ,\" he grins at you, wiping definite-not-water off his chin, before turning and heading down the indicated travelator. The costumed representatives and visitors heading that way are far more tonally consisted than the previous mish-mash of themes - an abundance of silver spandex, lycra, and naval uniforms in primary colours. This must be where people are split in to their separate resorts. Another travelator heading off in a different direction is predominantly girls in poofy ball gowns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about him. He's so embarrassing. When he starts talking about Universal Odyssey, it's hard to shut him up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all, it makes our writer's work easier when our guests know what they want. And your father certainly knows what he wants,\" she says, fixing you with an odd look. \"Speaking of which, your costume...\" She reaches over and opens your box. It is quite empty. There is just a single pill, a small bottle of water to wash it down with, and a folded polyethylene bag. \"If you just want to take the pill and then place yourself in the bag.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>In</i> the bag?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. And if you can make sure the bag is complete sealed once you are inside it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this a coronavirus thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something like that. It's for your safety. I'll give a few minutes to get changed and will be back to pick you up,\" she says, stepping out of the booth.</span></div></div>",

Feeling like somebody's packed lunch, you sit and wait for the representative to return. Your breath mists the inside of the bag, and it soon starts to get humid and close inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs this safe? Don't you need air holes? You distinctly recall multiple teachers and parents telling you not to do this exact thing in your young life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, I look dumb,\" you mutter. But what comes out is \"gawg guy gluk dung.\" Your tongue sits strangely in your mouth - it feels numb, sluggish and bloated. \"Wah dah fug?\" Your whole jaw feels loose and hangs open, a line of drool dribbling out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a queasy feeling in your stomach, as though that tiny pill is effervescing into tingling bubbles that are spreading out through your torso. You place a hand on your gut. The flesh there feels... soft. You're not saying you've ever boasted washboard abs or anything, but your fingers seem to press into the skin like you're kneading dough. Pulling your shirt up, you stare at the indentations of your fingers pressed into the flesh around your belly button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is precisely why they say to keep kids away from plastic bags! Yet when you try to grab the zipper, your fingers are too numb to manipulate it. You wrap your fingers around the the index finger of your right hand and try to rub some sensation back into them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment you apply pressure, the flesh in your finger flows to the tip of the finger in a bulge, like toothpaste being pushed down a tube. You're vaguely aware you're starting to scream as you try to squash the bulbous end of your finger back down into something resembling a finger. Your attempts only worsen things. The flesh under the skin is getting softer and softer, running like jelly, and as you try to squash the digit back into shape, it soon resembles the knobbly creation of a baby with play-doh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a sickening crunch-squelch from your knees, and your height drops by inches. Your trousers are beginning to stretch outwards, as if your legs are melting and sinking into themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try desperately to tear your way free. The plastic is tough and even your fingernails are soft. You try to bite your way out. Your teeth have all the consistency of gummy bears. A weakness permeates every muscle. You can barely gather the strength to lift an arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder the weight of your torso, your legs have concertina's to a third of their height. To your horror, the flesh of your leg starts to gloop from out of the hem of your trousers, like hot wax. There is no doubt about it now - you're melting!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour head is sinking in to your double, then triple, then quadruple chin, which in turn sinks into your neck, which is becoming one with your torso. There is a churning, boiling feeling inside of your internal organs liquefying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot exactly filled with hope but desperate to get out of here, you try to take a step and, despite the fact that your legs are now melted beyond all use, your entire body seems to surge forward against the walls of the bag, which rolls forward. Like a hamster rolling in a ball, you continue to push and the sealed bag (now more closely resembling a misshapen, flesh-coloured blob with a face) rolls out of the cubicle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This is actually becoming easier</i>, you think after a few more tentative rolls, not noticing that the rolling of the bag is churning up your body even further, like a trifle in a washing machine, mixing your clothes, your phone, your wallet, and your rapidly-liquefying limbs, torso and head together into a thick soup. You look around desperately for help, anyone but that evil woman who gave you the pill! Legs and suitcases pass you by, people paying little heed as they are steered away from the gurgling, thrashing fleshbag by their smiling attendants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour frantic rolling takes you free from the sea of cubicles. Ahead, there are four travelators. Behind, the attendant known as Gena Nova gives a cry of 'stop that bag!', bearing down on you, a silver catsuit clutched in her hand.

You wriggle your mass in a circle to view and maybe communicate thanks to your savior, but the shapeless mass of goo that your heart now is plummets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGena Nova towers above you, her pretty face etched with anger. Aside her stands a man whose uniform ripples with muscle, his forehead ridged with what appears to be bone. He holds your bag a foot above the travelator\u2019s crevice with one thick arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNova turns to the exhibit quickly, plastering a winning smile on her mug. \u201cSorry, for the disturbance, all. Me and the ensign,\u201d She gestures to the strongman beside her and he returns a look of vague offense, \u201chad to catch a rogue Ameboid!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou launch yourself against the walls of the bag, trying to share your desperation to the crowd, but they only smile briefly at the display before looking away.  Gena waves to them sweetly as she struts to and through a door marked \u2018STAFF ONLY\u2019, the \u2018ensign\u2019 following shortly after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer facade of corporate cheer sloughs off her face the moment the door clunks shut, balling her fists at her side and adding a stomp to her step that echoes down the concrete hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man holding you clomps behind her, before booming out a single word: \u201cEnsign?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNova throws her hands up and scowls at the man. \u201cI was thinking on my feet, <i>Tactical <b>Officer</b></i>.

The tiled walls have none of the sheen of the visitor area, splattered with grime and multicoloured stains. The worktops set around the walls contain implements of all sorts, and tubs and jars of chemicals. From the ceiling, hang what appear to be cybernetic limbs and other sci-fi props.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get the kid finished up quick. Can't have the dad missing his squeeze. Get it? <i>Squeeze</i>?\" Nova leers, grabbing a handful of your plastic-encased flesh and squashing it between her fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a large metal box with a funnel on top which seems to yawn like a mouth as you are carried over to it. Your body molds itself to the shape of the funnel as you are tossed in. Nova takes a knife from among the implements and plunged it psycho-like into the stretched plastic, which bursts. The horror of the knife plunging deep (albeit harmlessly) into your body is replaced by a terror and claustrophobia as your entire form swirls down the funnel hole into pitch darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you pour and settle into the container, a hand squeezes through the aperture above. The sensation of it sinking through your flesh, of your own body contracting about their wrist, is more alien than any of the rubber-headed aliens staffing the gates to Galaxy World, but not entirely unpleasant. A quiver of pleasure ripples through you as the delicate fingers sweep and search within you. They snag your twisted, sodden t-shirt. The feeling of the rough fabric being ripped from your insides is much less pleasant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, might want to wring that out. That thing is soaked. Don't want him transforming back an inch shorter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Screw it. Pudgy fucker can deserve to lose a few pounds.\" The hand descends again, fishing your trousers out. There is the creak-slam of a bin being opened and shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only light comes from the aperture above you, which is further blocked by Gena's sneering face staring down at you, but you can deduce enough by the new conformation your liquid body has poured in to. The container pressing tightly in on you is a cube about 3 feet in each dimension, and there is a circular configuration of metal teeth digging painfully into your underside. You're in an industrial blender!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, sheer terror overcomes any unfamiliarity you might have had with an amoeboid body. A jiggling pseudopod bulges up from your topside, grasping its way back up the funnel aperture. Gena shrieks and slams something flat and hard down on your appendage, which bursts, showering her in goo. You cringe your pseudopod back inside like a snail retreating into its shell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe knife jabs through the opening, plunging in to you repeatedly. \"Stop. Making. My. Job. Even. Fucking. Worse,\" Gena snarls with each strike, as goo dribbles off her chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tactical officer's chuckles echo off the tiled walls. \"Don't act like it's your first time being gooed by a visitor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's in my <i>mouth</i>, Derek!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, not the first time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are <i>such</i> an asshole! Why don't you make yourself useful and grab the food colouring?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later, a small quantity of dark emerald liquid is poured ontop of you and begins to mingle into you. A second liquid is poured in - a floral, feminine perfume, only concentrated to such industrial strength as to be cloyingly sweet. Then a third liquid. And a fourth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething is vibrating inside you, sending more waves of delight and pleasure coursing through you, encouraging the liquids to mix. It's your phone, propped up on one of the blender blades. No doubt it's mom phoning to make sure the plane landed safely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lid slams shut on the blender, plunging you in darkness except the illumination of the ringing phone. \"One teenage boy smoothie, coming up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>VRRRRR!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>/No/<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0/wait!/<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0/that/<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0/phone/<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0/is/<br>\r\n<br>\r\n/on/<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0/contract/</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n, as your thoughts are shredded into whirling confetti.

She\u2019s clad in a pink dress that\u2019s an odd mix of clingy and poofy with a neckline that practically plunges to her navel and a hemline that barely reaches her thigh. Two large masses of ballast practically yank her forward with every swish, and the long pointy ears that stand out against her long mane of blonde  currently are flattened against her head like a scolded dog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh in disgust, but you continue your scrutiny of the animated figure. Your ethos of general parent-scorning insists that you avert your gaze and maybe throw a sneer your dad\u2019s way, but your teenage libido insists that your eyes remain on the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the corner of your eye, you can see your dad in a similar state of observation, streamers of drool practically hanging from his mouth. You\u2019re not particularly sure <i>why</i> he\u2019s so engaged; he must\u2019ve seen this a thousand times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe show is \u2018Legend of the Hallowed Lands,\u2019 a kitschy pulp-fantasy cartoon-anthology series made primarily to sell toys, and the voluptuous elven figure on screen is called Princess Allaria, a functionally useless twit of a ruler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, not <i>that</i> useless; her voluptuous figure and vague wisps of clothing were probably the only reason the show has lasted long enough in the public consciousness to be purchased by Wondertainment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe on-screen princess is currently overcome with emotion, slamming her tiny fists against her ornate fluffy bed, big blue eyes teary and her chest heaving like a roiling sea. You frown; you\u2019re normally all for watching a billowing bosom, but only if it\u2019s an <i>earned</i> chest-oscilation. According to the subtitles, all Allaria had been through so far was a snide comment on her dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mental grandstanding is almost immediately contradicted as you affix your eyes on yet another bouncy fit of hysterics, the busty elf covering an exaggerated gasp with a dainty hand while the twin mountains on her chest wobble like puddings. She\u2019s received a letter from an admirer and her demeanor has switched from soul-crushing-despair to tittering jubilation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes she ever <i>stop</i>?\u201d you moan, a bit of your breakfast from five hours ago nearly escaping your stomach with another jolt of the plane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour dad rolls his eyes in response. \u201c<i>Clearly</i> someone doesn\u2019t understand the perils of court life. The wrong choice in dress could mean a lifetime of obscurity in the decadent courts of Tyr.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, <i>that\u2019s</i> why you watch this show,\u201d you retort. \u201cThe gripping political intrigue.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour argument is interrupted by the on-screen princess mincing over to her anachronistic modern walk-in closet and unlacing her corset, the curvature of the orbs visible from behind her back\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the scene abruptly cuts to some generic teen hero swording and sorcery-ing a horde of knobbly-kneed goblins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did this <i>air</i>?\u201d you ask, after overcoming the staggering sense of disappointment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTimes were different back then,\u201d your dad sighs wistfully. \u201cLess rating agencies and board of executives, more passion and dreams.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raise your eyebrows at the remark, but let it pass unretorted. Better to let him reminisce rather than suffer through a tirade of how her bi-episodic kidnappings are central to her character arc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plane screen flickers and your stomach spins in circles as the plane banks to the left. You rest a hand on the window and stare fervently at it to stave off the worst of your motion sickness, but are only greeted with something that makes you sicker. Just, uh, ideological-wise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarge swathes of fluffy green coat the ground, interspersed by small smatterings of houses, varied in size and roofing choice. Small antlike wagons clatter along dusty roads from larger settlements, each wildly different than the others. One is built on a lagoon, each building separated from the other with reservoirs of clear blue; another is hewn out of stone, with small squat prisms of rock presumably serving as houses. The entire mass of land is so big that it extends beyond the narrow aperture of your window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looks like a Luddite\u2019s wet dream, and you might be able to muster a few seconds of widened eyes if it <i>was</i> hand-built. But this is Wondertainment, after all. The trees are nature-defying constructions of concrete with tarpaulin leaves; the lagoon-city doubtless scented with tonnes of chlorine and artificial blue coloring; the entire mountain citadel a dun mass of plaster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is WonderKingdom, a branch of WonderWorld that decided to crib a fair bit of its InterStoryStructure\u2122 \u2014 God knows what that means \u2014 from tabletop games and RPGs, with a dizzying array of guilds, good-guys, and baddies of conflicting themes and allegiances, with some quest-based system to put some extra confusion in the mix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn short, it\u2019s a nerd\u2019s paradise, which means your dad is beyond amped to be here, judging by the leg adjacent to you that\u2019s practically vibrating. You discreetly follow his gaze to a particularly large tree, one that you can recognize from a brief establishing shot on his TV screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuh. At least you might get some topheavy elven eye-candy on this waste of a spring break. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Owned and operated by the eccentric but brilliant Walter Wonder, the company has as many business ventures as it has outstanding lawsuits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an odd move around eight-or-so years ago, Walter (or Dr. Wonder, as he likes to be known) purchased the pharmaceutical company Meconstruction, a contender in the growing industry of automated plastic surgery. Investors and the public were puzzled at the new move, some postulating that they were pivoting away from entertainment altogether.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMostly though, it was forgotten and dismissed as one of Walter\u2019s insane pet projects. It was a massive surprise to all parties when the 23rd annual Wondercon was not centered around movie-promotion, but the opening of WonderWorld; \u2018The Theme Park of the Future, Today!\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe park boasted a variety of environments to immerse their guests in:<br>\r\nWonder-City, a sprawling metropolis populated by a plethora of caped heroes and spandex-clad villains;<br>\r\nWonder-Kingdom, a medieval land of sword and sorcery, its forests populated with mysterious elves, and rocky plains inhabited by savage monsters;<br>\r\nWonder-Academy, a venture into the vast amounts of intellectual property purchased from Japan, where improbably-colored hairstyles are the norm and the genre can change at the drop of a hat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Other boroughs are pending, of course.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe roar of mouth-frothing fans drowned out the announcement of the extraordinarily exorbitant pricetag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIncluded in the base package are three days in the Wonder-Place of your choice and a free body-resculpting to match the locals. Additionally, you are given a basic \u2018Plotline\u2019 to follow; a recently recruited hero for Wonder-City, a new adventurer for Wonder-Kingdom, a transfer student for Wonder-Academy, etc. etc. Packages have to be upgraded if you want to inhabit the role of an established character.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny hanky-panky above PG-13 or violence beyond mild-roughhousing is strictly prohibited from both staff and guests \u2014 though one can bypass the former through underground channels. The actors in the park are well-trained, however, and can easily fake a dramatic death or budding romance at the drop of the hat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs with anything owned by Wondertainment, the cheery facade masks a dark underbelly. The staff, by necessity, has been organized into a strict hierarchy; with management at the top; technicians, writers, and actors a rung lower on the ladder; and sanitation, maintenance, and grunt workers at the bottom. Bright eyes dazzled by the magical prospects touted by employment ads and the roaring river of Wonder-media usually leave the park glassy and disillusioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActors are the most sought-after positions; for both the prestige of such a position and the benefits afterward. Contracts are set for five years at the minimum, and anyone who makes it through that crucible can get any Wondertainment-owned role they desire. The selection and training process is rigorous too, a strict regimen of lessons to teach them how to stay in-character no matter their form or situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany a proud graduate of that program have been bitterly disappointed by the nature of their assignment. Gender, age, height: all these and more are no barrier to the Wondrous\u2122 auto-surgeons of Meconstruction!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Rumors swapped amongst the maintenance staff suggest that willingness is equally dismissable, as exemplified by the impetuous thespians who left their \u2018disciplinary sessions\u2019 as legendary method actors.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWriters are assigned to create exciting new Plotlines for their awaiting guests. There are a few that create Wonderful\u2122 experiences every time they put pen to paper, but a fair amount of the writer\u2019s room is burnt out, and just rehash usual tropes for their none-the-wiser guests. A few luminaries are employed as coaches for the actors, watching plots unfold through contact-lens cameras whilst whispering plot twists and story directions into the actor\u2019s cleverly hidden earpieces. Whether the actors listen or not is a bit of a toss-up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTechnicians are stretched to their creative limit as well by Wondertainment\u2019s nigh-unmeetable quota: designing new animatronics for creatures and roles unoccupiable by humans; new gadgets to enhance the realism of each environment; and pushing the envelope of Meconstruction\u2019s technology.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(There are rumblings of discontent among the actors about artificially intelligent robots created to take their starring roles in the park, but those are mostly dismissed with much rolling of the eyes and scoffs of \u2018Science fiction!\u2019)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWonder-World\u2019s mantra is \u2018customer-obsession\u2019, after all. Who needs to follow labor laws when you have mountains of cash?</td>",
