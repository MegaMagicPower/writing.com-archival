Tobias loves his new big boy undies but he hates the potty. He hates it, hates it hates it! He will start crying whenever his mommy or daddy make him sit on it for even just a second. He will happily pee on a tree or in the grass \u2013 or, more often than not, his big boy undies or the carpet. Just not in the potty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Raphael</b>, age three. Raphael lives with his single dad and he has just discovered his new favourite word: \u2018No.\u2019 At first Raphael made good progress with his potty training, he even had had a few completely accident-free days. But recently, just sitting on the potty has become a giant power struggle with him that usually ends in tears and wet pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Noah</b>, age four. Noah\u2019s parents recently divorced. They share custody over him and he spends half the month at his mom\u2019s and the other half with his dad. Noah was fully potty trained over a year ago, but he did not take well to the stress and the new situation and right now he refuses to even sit on the toilet. He will deny he even has to go and only moments later go hide to wet or soil his pants, then he\u2019ll claim it was an accident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Logan</b>, age five. Logan\u2019s dad once told him that he had to learn to do a thing first before he was allowed to decide he didn\u2019t like it. At the time, his dad had tried to teach Logan, who could be a bit of a scaredy-cat, to ride a bike and that was what he had been talking about. And once Logan had gotten the hang of it, he actually had decided he liked riding his bicycle very much. However, he had taken his dad\u2019s advice to heart and identified a few other things in his life which he definitely knew how to do but decidedly did not like. Using the potty was one of them. His mom was not thrilled about Logan\u2019s decision, to put it mildly. Dad actually thought his little rebellion funny. Mom wasn\u2019t impressed with dad\u2019s attitude, either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday, we are going to follow a day in the life of little\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He will happily sit on his potty when he is told to, and he loves reading his picture books on it. He fully understands that pee-pee and poo-poo belong into the potty. He has no idea how they are supposed to get there. So far, he has done one poop in the potty, mostly by accident. He has also peed on about every surface in the house at least once by now, twice on the bathroom floor right after he got up from his potty. There are poop stains in all his big boy undies. One time he had been standing in front of his potty and peed himself right as his mommy had been praising him for keeping his big boy briefs dry and he had just interrupted her to correct: \u201cWet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Florian</b>, age three. Florian loves his potty and he takes it with him wherever he goes. Usually, by wearing it on his head as a hat. It makes a great hat. It\u2019s also a great place to store his toys in, it makes a decent step-stool, and he can bathe his dolls in it. It floats like a boat in the bathtub. It can be used as a bucket. On occasion, Florian even uses it as a chair. The one thing he has never done is pee or poo in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Marcel</b>, age four. Marcel has always done things at his own speed. He gets that the potty is for peeing and pooping in and he isn\u2019t opposed to the concept. However, he has a hard time understanding the difference between undies and diapers. If he is wearing any pants at all, he will use them like diapers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Stephen</b>, age six. Stephen grew up with his aunt and uncle on an old, rural farm. Stephen has spend more time outdoors, roaming the surrounding wilderness, than indoors. The only toilet at the farm was an old outhouse, basically a hole in the ground, stinky and quite scary to a young child. Stephen used it maybe once or twice in his life. Usually, he would just crouch behind a bush or pee on a tree. So to say he is unfamiliar and uncomfortable with toilets would be an understatement. He has moved to the city recently and started school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday, we are going to follow a day in the life of little\u2026</span></div></div>",

He won\u2019t even tell he has to use the potty until he is only seconds away from wet or brown pants. But Hikaru isn\u2019t doing this out of fear or spite. It\u2019s just that nobody has ever told the poor lad that public restrooms exist and other people own toilets as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Joshua</b>, age seven. Little Josh focusses on whatever he is doing a lot. A lot a lot. Sometimes so much so, he doesn\u2019t realise he has to use the bathroom. On occasion, he won\u2019t even notice when he has an accident. Other times, he will panicky realise his need once he feels the first spurt of pee dampen his pants or a little brown turtle pushing out its head. Either way, he still needs the occasional reminder to use the bathroom, or he will have frequent accidents or near-accidents in his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Linus</b>, age eight. Linus still has to wear diapers at night for his bedwetting, but at day he is fully potty trained. Technically, at least. Linus knows perfectly well when he has to use the toilet, he even knows when it is getting urgent, but he doesn\u2019t like going. So he always waits until it is really <i>urgent</i> urgent. Sadly, Linus overestimates his ability to hold it by quite a bit and often ends up with an accident in his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday, we are going to follow a day in the life of little\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hikaru was grocery shopping with his mom. He was sitting in the cart and dangling down his legs from the seat. Usually he enjoyed going shopping with his mom. grocery shopping was fun! Hikaru would help and pick up things from the shelves for his mom or put items she handed him into the cart for her. The lady behind the cold-cuts counter would always say he smiled so adoringly and give him a slice to eat for the way. There were many new and interesting things and people to discover at the grocery store, too! Hikaru had met a nice grandma before, a big dog, a small dog, a grandma with a dog\u2026 and that was only in the last month!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday, however, Hikaru was a bit restless. He really needed his mom to hurry and head to the checkout so he could go home! Hikaru nervously scissored his legs and shifted around in the cart seat. He needed to go potty! And <i>bad</i>. Like always, he had sat on the toilet before they left home, just as his mommy always told him to, because there were no toilets outside. But today his body had betrayed him. He hadn\u2019t had to go back when they left, but the urge hit him right as they pulled into the grocery store parking lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHikaru knew there was nowhere for him to go here, so he tried to ignore his need as good as he could. He would just have to hold it till they got back home. This wasn\u2019t the first time Hikaru had been in a similar predicament and for his young age he had developed a surprising ability to wait. What Hikaru hadn\u2019t taken into account, however, was the big sale that day. His mom was taking her sweet time, filling their cart with lots more stuff than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey weren\u2019t half-way through the store yet, and Hikaru already felt that he was really <i>really </i>getting to his limit. They hadn\u2019t even passed the cold-cuts counter and they still got to go through the sweets-section, too! After that they\u2019d have to pay at the checkout and then they\u2019d have to drive all the way back home. Hikaru fidgeted in his seat, feeling queasy. He willed his mom to hurry up. He <i>really really really</i> couldn\u2019t wait much longer. In fact, he wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d make it even if they started driving home right this moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHikaru frantically tried to come up with a way out, but he just couldn\u2019t think of anything. There were no toilets here. He couldn\u2019t go in his pants because first that would be embarrassing and second mommy would be upset. Hikaru\u2019s eyes grew wide. Oh no! He wore his favourite pair of undies, too! The ones with a picture of the <i>bestest </i>superhero, dinoboy on them. No, <i>no way</i> he was having an accident in his dinoboy briefs! But what other options did he have?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe\u2026</span></div></div>",

He barely said hello and thank you to the lady behind the cold-cuts counter when she handed him his slice of sausage. Hikaru gobbled down the tasty morsel and for the shortest moment it distracted him from his need to go potty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the desperation returned with all the more urgency. Hikaru squirmed in his seat. There was no way he was going to make it all the way back home to the potty! They had reached the health &amp; beauty isle and just then they went past the shelves with baby diapers. Hikaru\u2019s eyes boggled as he realised his salvation. \u201cMom! Diapers!\u201d He cried urgently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe still got enough of your night-time diapers at home, honey,\u201d his mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHikaru interrupted her: \u201cNo! Diapers, now! I need a diaper now! I gotta go potty real bad, mommy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mom looked at Hikaru with both surprise and concern. She hadn\u2019t noticed till then. Hikaru was good at hiding his need when he had to go potty, or maybe she hadn\u2019t paid his warning signs enough attention. In any case, when they were out he never told her when he had to go and when he did, it was usually too late. Maybe mommy thought she had finally solved the conundrum and it was just a fear of public toilets. Or she was too happy that Hikaru told her in time just this once. Whatever her reason, she grabbed a pack of the same diapers Hikaru wore at night and handed it to him. \u201cWe still gotta pay before I can put you in one,\u201d she warned him, \u201ccan you wait that long?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHikaru wasn\u2019t sure at all that he could, but he immediately nodded in confirmation nonetheless. He clutched the diaper package in his arms and nervously scissored his legs while his mommy quickly shoved their cart over to the checkout. Luckily there was no wait and mom immediately began to unload their groceries on the conveyor belt. Hikaru placed his diaper package with them and nervously waited for the cashier to scan all their items.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere is mommy taking Hikaru to change him in a diaper?</span></div></div>",

He is happy enough to pee in it and is almost completely accident free by now. However, he absolutely refuses to poop into anything but a diaper. Once he has held it for three days straight until his parents carved in and put him in a diaper. Nicola is strong-willed and determined and he has a surprising amount of control for his age, his mom couldn\u2019t even \u201cconvince\u201d him to use the potty with a glycerin suppositoriy. He stubbornly waited out its effect to pass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Jamal</b>, age three and a half. Jamal doesn\u2019t like the potty. He doesn\u2019t like the toilet either. Nor does he want to pee on a tree or in the bushes, he doesn\u2019t see why this would be \u201cexciting\u201d, thank you very much. Jamal understands that undies aren\u2019t diapers and can\u2019t be used as such. And he tries not to, honest! But it is hard waiting all day until he is put in a diaper for his afternoon nap or at bedtime in the evening and sometimes he just doesn\u2019t make it. If his mommy and daddy only listened to him and put him back in diapers during the day, none of them would have this problem!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Linus</b>, age eight. Linus still has to wear diapers at night for his bedwetting, but at day he is fully potty trained. Technically, at least. Linus likes the feeling of wearing a diaper. He has learned early how to diaper himself and he often \u201csecretly\u201d puts on one of his night-time diapers during the day. Apparently, his mom can\u2019t count and doesn\u2019t notice him going through diapers far faster than he should. More likely, though, she just lets Linus keep his \u201csecret\u201d. Linus doesn\u2019t really intend to use his diapers, but of cause at some point he either has to or he has to take them off to use the toilet. Since he is unhappy to waste a perfectly good diaper like that, he usually ends up holding it as long as he can before he goes in his diaper after all. He doesn\u2019t like sitting in a full diaper and quickly changes out of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Victor</b>, age thirteen. Victor recently found an old pack of his night-time diapers from back when he still wet the bed as a child. It was quite the tight fit, but out of curiosity, he tried one on. He kinda liked the feeling. And he tried using it. He kinda liked that, too. Since then, he has continued to secretly wear them and has long since used up that diaper treasure he found. Yesterday, he finally worked up the courage and bought a pack of pull-ups for bedwetters for himself. He had biked all the way to the next town over just to make sure he wouldn\u2019t run into anyone he knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday, we are going to follow a day in the life of\u2026</span></div></div>",
