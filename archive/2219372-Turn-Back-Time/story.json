            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>My name is Brian Hawkins; I\u2019m 13 years old and I live with my parents and my 7-year-old sister Mackenzie.  My life hasn\u2019t been the easiest lately, ever since my Dad was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer.  I don\u2019t think I would\u2019ve gotten through it all without my friends; Eric, Carrie and her twin brother Collin. The four of us have known each other since Kindergarten and were damn near inseparable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy am I telling you this? Because something happened to me just before I was to start 8th grade; something I can\u2019t quite explain. I was out in the woods behind my house, playing hide and seek with Mackenzie when I suddenly blacked out. When I regained consciousness, I thought that only a short time had passed.  Little did I know how wrong I was; what was only a few hours for me, was years for everyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat comes next is the story of how I attempt to rebuild my life.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><b>August 11th, 2013</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019d be lying if I said the last few days hadn\u2019t been stressful; with my dad having been admitted to the hospital after his condition took a turn for the worst.  He\u2019d been working his office when he suffered a seizure that resulted in him hitting his head on the side of his desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was just after 9:00 in the morning and my mom was getting ready to leave to visit my dad at the hospital.  I was upstairs in my room, playing <i>Dead Space 3</i>, when I heard a commotion from downstairs.  After I paused the game, I went downstairs and found Mackenzie following Mom around like a lost puppy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie\u2019s had a hard time since my dad\u2019s diagnosis; when she wasn\u2019t with her best friend Emily, she was following Mom or me around the house.  Grabbing her jacket, Mom turned to look at Mackenzie and said, \u201cMackenzie, sweetie, I know you want to come with me; but your father doesn\u2019t want you to see him like this.\u201d Spotting me in the hallway, Mom said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you spend some time with your brother; and I\u2019ll be back in a few hours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019ll admit to being slightly annoyed by mom\u2019s suggestion.  I\u2019d had a busy week at school and wanted to relax with the video games; not babysit my clingy little sister.  Choosing not to act on my annoyance, I looked at Mackenzie and said, \u201cCome on Mac, let\u2019s go watch a movie or something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Mackenzie focusing on me, Mom made a break for the door.  After a moment, Mackenzie said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we go out and play in the woods or something?\u201d with a heavy sigh, Mackenzie looked at me and said, \u201cBeing outside always makes me feel better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point I feel I should mention that, since I woke up this morning, I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that I shouldn\u2019t go outside.  It was like a part of me thought something was going to happen if I stepped out the door.  Looking down at Mackenzie, I said, \u201cI don\u2019t know, Mac; I\u2019m not really feeling it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on!\u201d grabbing my arm, Mackenzie said, \u201cIt\u2019s finally stopped raining, and mom says I can\u2019t go in the woods without you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knew enough to realize that Mackenzie wasn\u2019t going to stop until I agreed to go outside with her.  \u201cOkay fine, we\u2019ll go play some hide and seek in the woods.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYay!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie ran out the door into the backyard; I was about to follow her when I heard my cell phone ringing from upstairs.  Running upstairs, I grabbed it off my desk and saw that it was Eric calling.  He\u2019d spent the last month out in California with his Aunt and Uncle; his folks and Emily had flown out yesterday to bring him home.  Answering the phone, I said, \u201cHey man, what\u2019s up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing I noticed was Eric\u2019s voice sounded a little different; almost as if it was higher than it should\u2019ve been.  \u201cNot much; we\u2019re in Chicago waiting for our connecting flight.\u201d Taking a breath, Eric said, \u201cThere\u2019s something important I want to talk to you about; are you going to be home tonight?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, I don\u2019t have any plans.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cWhat\u2019s so important that you can\u2019t tell me over the phone?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d rather tell you in person.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cI\u2019m heading outside to play hide and seek with Mackenzie, but I\u2019ll be free tonight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, you\u2019re the best.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout an hour had passed since Mackenzie and I started playing hide and seek. We were taking turns being the seeker; it was currently Mackenzie\u2019s turn to search for me. She had just started counting and I was running to find a hiding spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments of searching, I found a small rock outcropping I could hide behind. I sat behind the outcropping for a few moments, listening as Mackenzie tried her best to find me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was watching some birds fly around overhead when I was suddenly overcome by an unbearably loud noise. I tried covering my ears in an attempt to drown it out, but it didn\u2019t work. I started feeling a little light-headed; the next thing I knew, I blacked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I woke up again, I found myself _____.</span></div></div>",

But even that knowledge wasn\u2019t enough to prepare me for the teenage girl standing in the doorway.  Her dark blonde hair was now brown, and down past her shoulders.  She was not at least a foot taller; with breasts and a figure to boot.  But there was no denying it; I knew it was her the moment she walked into the room.  \u201cMackenzie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout saying a word, Mackenzie ran over and practically jumped onto the bed in order to hug me.  I quickly reciprocated the hug; although I was more than a little disturbed by the feel of Mackenzie\u2019s breasts.  After hugging me for what seemed like an eternity, Mackenzie stepped back and looked at me.  \u201cHow is it possible you haven\u2019t aged a day in 6 years?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m as puzzled as you are, Mac.\u201d Squirming a little in bed, in an attempt to hide the erection I found myself with, I said, \u201cThe last thing I remember was the two of us playing hide and seek; the next thing I know, we\u2019re practically the same age.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot quite; I\u2019m actually 4 months older now.\u201d Wincing a little, Mackenzie said, \u201cI guess that makes me your older sister.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***********************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom and Mackenzie spent the next hour, interspersed with a few trips to the bathroom for Mom, catching me up on what I\u2019d missed.  It seems Mackenzie got worried when she hadn't seen me for 30 minutes; so she ran back to call Mom.  The police searched the area for months in the hopes of finding something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut alas they never found any trace of me.  In the meantime, Mom became involved with one of the detectives on my case; they ended up getting married a few years after I disappeared.  \u201cHenry\u2019s a great guy; I think you\u2019d like him, Brian.\u201d With a tinge of sadness, Mackenzie said, \u201cHe\u2019s been really supportive; helping mom and me after Dad died.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s everyone else been up to for the last 6 years?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Emily and I are on the cheerleading squad at school.\u201d Taking a breath, Mackenzie said, \u201cCarrie\u2019s attending college in New York; while Collin\u2019s at Penn State.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s great for them, I guess.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cWhat about Eric?  What\u2019s he been up to?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell Eric, he...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Mackenzie trailed off, I got worried that something had happened to Eric.  Looking at her, I said, \u201cMac, is Eric alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll simply say that things have changed with your friend, Brian.\u201d Looking at me, Mackenzie said, \u201cIt\u2019s not my place to say what; that\u2019s something for the two of you to talk about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay...\u201d confused, I said, \u201cDo they even know I\u2019m alive?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been in here with you for the last hour.\u201d With a bit of an attitude, Mackenzie said, \u201cWhen would we have had the chance to tell them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was more than a little put off by Mackenzie\u2019s sudden change in attitude.  \u201cGeez, I\u2019m sorry I asked.\u201d Looking at her, I said, <br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to bite my head off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Composing herself Mackenzie said, \u201cI\u2019ve been under a lot of stress lately; it just came out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom walked out of the bathroom at the point.  Looking at Mackenzie, she said, \u201cMackenzie, sweetie, why don\u2019t you head down to the car.  I\u2019ll be right there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Hugging me again, Mackenzie said, \u201cI\u2019m really glad you\u2019re back, Brian.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe too, Mac.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Mackenzie left the room, Mom turned to me and said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry for your sister\u2019s attitude just now.\u201d Sighing, Mom said, \u201cShe\u2019s had it rough the last couple weeks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t go into detail; suffice it to say, your sister is becoming a woman.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was a bit confused by that statement; until I suddenly realized what Mom meant.  Looking at her, I said, \u201cMac\u2019s having her period?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right; her first one.\u201d Sighing, Mom said, \u201cHer mood swings make the ones I experienced during my first trimester look tame by comparison.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for the warning, Mom,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, sweetie.\u201d Hugging me, or at least the best she could, Mom said, \u201cYou have no idea how happy I am that you\u2019re back; alive and well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow we just have to figure out why I\u2019m the same age I was when I disappeared.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s something we can work on tomorrow.\u201d Smiling, Mom said, \u201cYou should probably get some rest; we\u2019ll come by in the morning.\u201d </span></div></div>",

I've seen too many cases like yours end badly to look a gift horse in the mouth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad to be back too; even if I have a lot to catch up on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor came into the room at that moment.

I was feeling incredibly anxious about the prospect of seeing my friends again; wondering how they\u2019d changed and how they\u2019d react to seeing me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the nurse wheeled me into the conference room, I saw two people hanging around the table.  Even after six years, I instantly knew who they were; my friends Carrie and Collin.  Every one of them went silent when they realized I was in the room.  After a moment the silence became unbearable, so I said, \u201cHey guys.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCollin, who was no longer the short chubby kid I remembered, was the first to respond.  \u201cThis has to be some kind of joke, right?\u201d turning to my Mom, and Mac, he said, \u201cHe looks exactly the same as he did six years ago.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s really him, Collin.\u201d Pausing, Mom said, \u201cThe doctors ran a DNA test, and his fingerprints matched the ones the police had on file.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie was the next to step forward; giving me a chance to see just how little she\u2019d changed over the years.  She\u2019d always kept her hair short; to the point where she was often mistaken for a boy.  Her hair was just as short now, the only difference being that it was a light brown color now.  \u201cIf you\u2019re really Brian, then tell me something only he would know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll give it a shot.\u201d Looking at her, I said, \u201cWhen we were in 7th grade, you kissed me in the boy\u2019s locker room after school.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie\u2019s eyes went wide when I said that; while Collin laughed and said, \u201cYou kissed <i>him</i> in 7th grade?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking that Collin was teasing Carrie for kissing me, I said, \u201cWhat\u2019s the big deal if she kissed me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not what you think, Brian.\u201d With a chuckle, Carrie said, \u201cI\u2019m a lesbian; Collin\u2019s just teasing me because I kissed a boy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh.\u201d Turning to Collin, I said, \u201cSorry, I thought you meant something else.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright kiddo; you didn\u2019t know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoosing to ignore the kiddo comment, I said, \u201cWhere\u2019s Eric?  I thought he, of all people, would be here to see me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie and Collin exchanged concerned looks with each other.  It looked as though they were about to say something; when the door to the conference room opened.  I turned to find two girls, one of whom I realized was Emily, standing in the doorway.  The other one looked familiar, but I couldn\u2019t figure out why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Emily just stared at me, in shock; the other girl came over and hugged me.  \u201cI-I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re really back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was put off by the fact that an unfamiliar girl was hugging me.  Gently pushing her away, I looked at her and said, \u201cDo I know you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl, resembling a slightly older version of Emily with bigger boobs, just stared at me for a moment.  Then a look of realization appeared on her face; as if a light bulb just went off.  \u201cBrian, you knew me as Eric.\u201d</span></div></div>",

My best friend was now a girl; and I had had no idea.  <i>Or had I?</i>  The more I thought about it, the more I realized there\u2019d always been something different about Eric.  Don\u2019t get me wrong; we both liked action movies and video games.  But he\u2019d always preferred horses to cars, and almost always dressed as female characters for Halloween.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was also the time that I\u2019d gone to visit him when he was home alone; only to see him, through the window, walking around the house in his sister Grace\u2019s cheerleading outfit. <i> What kind of friend was I, that I hadn\u2019t seen that?</i> \u201cA-Are you happy...Andrea?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m very happy, Brian.\u201d With a smile bigger than I\u2019d ever seen her make, she nodded and said, \u201cI\u2019m the real me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen I\u2019m happy for you, too; I just wish I\u2019d been there to help you through this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re here now, that\u2019s all that matters.\u201d Looking at me, with a smile, she said, \u201cPlus it would mean the world to me if you approved of my boyfriend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at that moment I realized she\u2019d gotten up and was standing next to Collin.  I put two and two together when I saw her take his hand in hers.  \u201cYou guys are dating?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, buddy.\u201d Kissing Collin on the cheek, Andrea said, \u201cWe\u2019ve been dating since sophomore year, and I\u2019ve never been happier.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I lost all the weight; I knew she needed someone strong to protect her.\u201d Smiling, Collin looked at me and said, \u201cI also wanted to prove that I was worthy of her.\u201d</span></div></div>",

It didn\u2019t matter to me that Collin was now 5 inches taller than me and could easily beat me up; I wanted to punch him for saying that.  Thankfully Andrea came over before anything happened.  \u201cBrian, he didn\u2019t mean it that way.\u201d <br>\r\nGlaring at Collin for a moment, Andrea turned back to me and said, \u201cYou were gone for so long, we have to get used to having you back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I guess you\u2019re right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what; your birthday is in two weeks,\u201d with a smile, Andrea said, \u201cI promise you we\u2019ll be there to celebrate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter everyone said their goodbyes, Mom and Henry walked them to the lobby; leaving me alone in the conference room.  I started to get a little lonely until the door opened and Emily walked into the room.  I was vaguely aware that she and Mac had left earlier to go off somewhere.  Gesturing to a bottle of soda in her hand, she said, \u201cHey Brian, I thought you might like a drink or something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, Em.\u201d Chuckling, I took the soda and said, \u201cIt\u2019s been 6 years since I had a soda.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI still can\u2019t believe you\u2019re back; even though I\u2019m looking right at you.\u201d Sitting next to me, Emily said, \u201cI keep expecting to wake up and find this was all just a dream.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA part of me wishes this was a dream; that I\u2019d wake up and realize I hadn\u2019t missed the last six years.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of us just sat at the conference table and talked; in that regard, it was as if six years hadn\u2019t passed since I last saw her.  The others used to tease me for it, but I was just at home hanging out with Emily as I was with them.  It was weird to think the teenage girl sitting next to me was the same one I taught how to wrestle when she was 6 years old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Emily I remembered could have easily passed herself off as a boy; I rarely, if ever, saw her wearing skirts or dresses.  That was no longer the case now; everything from her breasts to her budding figure screamed that she was a girl.  Her brown hair had gotten darker over the years and, instead of being shorter than Mackenzie, she looked as though she was only a few inches shorter than me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was weird to think of her that way, but I couldn\u2019t help but think she was attractive now.  At that moment I realized neither of us had said anything for a few minutes; we were just staring at each other.  After a moment, Emily said, \u201cIt feels weird to admit it, Brian...but I had a bit of a crush on you when we were...I mean when <i>I</i> was younger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at Emily, dumbfounded, for a second before saying, \u201cY-You did?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I just never said anything because of the age difference.\u201d With a smile, Emily said, \u201cBut here you are now, and somehow we\u2019re practically the same age.  How is something like that even possible?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour guess is as good as mine, Em.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cI\u2019d really like to know where I\u2019ve been the last six years, and why I haven\u2019t aged.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie came into the room at that moment; an annoyed look on her face.  For a moment I thought it was towards me, but instead, she looked at Emily and said, \u201cFinally! I\u2019ve been looking all over for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry Mac; I was talking with Brian.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell come on, Alicia\u2019s here to bring us to the mall.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry Brian, but it looks like I have to go too.\u201d  Emily stood up and hugged me, \u201cI\u2019ll see you later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee you later, Em.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Emily and Mac left the room, leaving me alone once again, I thought back to what Emily had said.  She had a crush on me years ago; was there anything stopping her from acting on it now?</span></div></div>",

As we got into the car, Henry looked back at me and said, \u201cSo Brian, what do you feel like doing first?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d Buckling my seatbelt, I said, \u201cCould we just drive around a bit?  I\u2019d love to see what\u2019s changed over the last six years.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t see why not.\u201d Glancing towards Mom, a grin on his face, Henry said, \u201cI suppose I\u2019d want to do the same thing if I were in your position.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo everything decided, Henry started the car and we left the hospital parking lot.  As we drove towards town, I figured the town wouldn\u2019t have changed that much in six years.  It was one of those small, historic towns in eastern Pennsylvania; it was a big deal when Costco decided to open a location on the outskirts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did I realize just how wrong I was \u2013 the town had changed a lot since I\u2019d disappeared.  For starters; an empty lot across from the elementary school had been turned into a condo complex and even the movie theater had gotten bigger.  I was a little disappointed to find that Easy Eats BBQ, my family\u2019s favorite restaurant, had closed down.  Other than that, the town had stayed relatively the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">****************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter driving around town for an hour, Mom announced that she had to use the bathroom.  Luckily for her, we were close to a Dairy Queen so we pulled into the parking lot.  While Mom waddled to the bathroom, Henry and I waited for her by the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was clear that we were both nervous around each other.  For me, I was still trying to process the fact that my mom had remarried while I was gone.  Henry, no doubt, was trying to figure out how to act around me.  After all, it had just been him, my mom and Mac, for the last few years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter neither of us had said anything for a few moments, Henry got up from the hood of the car and said, \u201cHow about I buy you some ice cream, Brian; then perhaps we could have a little talk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Looking at him, I said, \u201cTalk about what, exactly?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s obvious you\u2019re having trouble with the fact that I\u2019m here.\u201d Leading me towards the line, Henry said, \u201cI just figured we could talk; to reassure you that I\u2019m a good guy and that I have no intention of replacing your dad.\u201d</span></div></div>",

We were both in a fragile condition, but we helped each other through it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was starting to worry about where Henry was going with this.  Looking at him, as bluntly as I could, I said, \u201cWere you having an affair with my mom?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, at least not in the physical sense.\u201d Sighing, Henry said, \u201cYour mom was an emotional wreck; what with you missing and your father in the hospital.  With no one else to support her, I guess I became her source of emotional support.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI guess I couldn\u2019t really fault them for being there for each other, but hearing this dampened my opinion of Henry and my mom.  <br>\r\n\u201cHow soon after my dad died did you two become involved?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was close to a year before we started dating, but that doesn\u2019t mean I wasn\u2019t in the picture.\u201d Looking at me, Henry said, \u201cI helped your mom with housework, and even helped Mackenzie with her problems.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat kind of problems?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat your sister went through, I wouldn\u2019t wish on anyone; losing her brother and father in the span of a month.  I\u2019d be lying if I said she handled it well.\u201d Sighing, Henry said, \u201cShe was suspended from school several times for fighting, she got in trouble for stealing a bottle of soda from a gas station.  She\u2019d even wake up screaming in the middle of the night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sat at the table; trying to process what Henry had told me.  I had a hard time believing that the person Henry was describing was my sister.  The Mackenzie I knew was not the type to get into trouble.  \u201cDoes Mac still have those problems?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThankfully she\u2019s worked past those issues.\u201d Sighing, Henry said, \u201cNow she\u2019s just a 13-year-old girl; something that brings its own challenges.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose I should be grateful that you were here for them.\u201d Taking a breath, I said, \u201cStill, I wish my dad was still here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour father was a great man, Brian.\u201d Looking at me, placing a hand on my shoulder, Henry said, \u201cI want you to know that I have no intention of replacing him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don\u2019t know what came over me at that moment; but, without saying a word, I hugged Henry.  Henry returned the hug, and that was the position Mom found us in when she walked out of the bathroom.  \u201cI\u2019m glad to see you\u2019re both getting along.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was never going to be an issue.\u201d Getting up, Henry kissed Mom and said, \u201cBrian\u2019s a great kid; you did a great job raising him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, Henry.\u201d Smiling, turning to me, Mom said, \u201cSo, sweetie, what do you say we go home?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds like a plan to me.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I\u2019m not sure how I would\u2019ve felt had it been completely different.  As the three of us got out of the car, I could hear music playing in the backyard.  \u201cWhat\u2019s going on in the backyard?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably your sister.\u201d Grabbing her purse, Mom said, \u201cShe\u2019s probably lounging around the pool with Emily and Allison.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Pool?</i> \u201cWhen did you put in a pool?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe put it in a few years ago.\u201d Looking at me, Henry said, \u201cMost of your things are in storage; so if you want to use it, you\u2019ll have to borrow one of my swimsuits.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the three of us walked in through the garage, Mom said, \u201cYou may want to ask your sister if it\u2019s alright, first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t need her permission, Maureen.\u201d Sighing, Henry said, \u201cContrary to what she thinks, Mackenzie doesn\u2019t decide who uses the pool.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d Looking at me, Mom said, \u201cAt least go out and say hello first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked through the kitchen to the backdoor; opening it to find the back deck had been expanded around a decent size in-ground pool.  I was so focused on the pool, I barely heard Mackenzie when she said, \u201cOh God, what are you doing here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI guess Henry hadn\u2019t been joking when he said Mackenzie was now a typical teenage girl.  I was amazed by the 180 she\u2019d taken since yesterday; going from being thrilled I was back to annoyed that I was in the same room as her.  \u201cMom and Henry said that I should check out the pool, so that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I turned my attention to Mac, Emily and who I could only assume was Allison; I was taken aback by their appearance.  If I\u2019d been having trouble accepting the fact that my kid sister and her best friend were now teenagers, seeing them in bikinis wasn\u2019t helping me any.  \u201cFine, just don\u2019t bother us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison, a cute looking blonde girl, looked at me in confusion.  \u201cWho is that, Mac?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat would be my <i>little</i> brother; the one who was missing for 6 years.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried my best to hide my annoyance over the emphasis Mac put on the word little.  Thankfully, before I could say something I'd regret, Allison spoke up.  \u201cWait, he\u2019s the one whose picture you have on your desk?\u201d looking at me, Allison said, \u201cIf he\u2019s been missing for six years, how does he look the same as in the photo?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo one knows.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was getting a little put off by Mac\u2019s attitude; so after introducing myself to Allison, I quickly turned around and walked back into the house.  I barely made it into the kitchen before I heard someone call my name, \u201cBrian, wait!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned around to find Emily coming towards me; giving me an up-close look at her in a bikini.  \u201cHey Em, y-you like great in that bathing suit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI swear I caught a brief glimpse of Emily blushing; before she said, \u201cThanks.\u201d Looking at me, she said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry about Em; she had a rough morning, don\u2019t take it personally.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard not to take it personally when I come back after six years and my sister wants nothing to do with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know how teenagers can be; one minute they\u2019re all happy, the next minute they\u2019re all doom and gloom.\u201d Smiling, Emily said, <br>\r\n\u201cIf it makes you feel any better, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I wonder if Emily still has that crush on me.</i> \u201cThanks, Em, that does make me feel better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you get put on a suit and come join us?\u201d</span></div></div>",

I\u2019ll admit that I agreed for two reasons; I felt like relaxing, and I\u2019d be a fool to pass up a chance to hang out at a pool with two attractive girls (and my sister).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry had an old bathing suit that fit me, so I put that on and quickly went back outside.  The first I did was a running jump into the pool; inadvertently splashing Mac and the others in the process.  That got me a glare from Mac, but smiles from Allison and Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking a few laps in the pool, I returned to the deep end to find Allison and Emily sitting on the edge with their feet in the water.  As I went over to them, Allison said, \u201cSo what\u2019s the weirdest change you\u2019ve noticed since being back?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean aside from my mom being pregnant, and my sister being four months older than me?\u201d with a chuckle, I said, \u201cHonestly, I\u2019m still trying to process the fact that I disappeared for six years.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of us spent the next 20 minutes or so talking.  Despite my best efforts, I occasionally found myself staring at Allison and Emily\u2019s chests.  I tried to look away, but I honestly couldn\u2019t stop myself; both of them were quite good looking.  Given Emily\u2019s revelation about her crush on me, I wasn\u2019t surprised to find her staring at me; I was surprised, however, to find Allison staring at me too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t look half bad in that suit, Brian.\u201d Looking at me, Allison said, \u201cI\u2019ll bet you had girls breaking down the fence for a chance to see you, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, not really.\u201d My face turning red from embarrassment, I said, \u201cThe pool didn\u2019t get put in until after I disappeared, so...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could finish my sentence, I was interrupted by Emily forcibly clearing her throat.  \u201cBrian, could you bring us some drinks, please?\u201d staring angrily at Allison, Emily said, \u201c<i>Some</i> of us need to cool off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, okay.\u201d Climbing out of the pool, barely noticing the glares I was getting from Mac, I said, \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I walked back towards the kitchen, I heard Emily say, \u201cStop flirting with him, Allison; I told you how I felt about him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stopped around the corner, out of sight, so I could hear Allison\u2019s response.  \u201cSorry Em, it\u2019s just he\u2019s <i>really</i> cute.  You might have some competition.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA big grin appeared on my face as I walked into the kitchen.  I hadn\u2019t even been back for a day, and here I already had two attractive girls fighting over me. </span></div></div>",

I followed the girls into the house to say my goodbyes.  After saying goodbye to Mac, Allison went a little overboard with her goodbye to me \u2013 giving me a peck on the cheek.  <br>\r\nBoth Emily and Mac glared at her as a result, although I suspected it was for different reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily\u2019s goodbye was a little more subdued; as she gave me a hug, she said, \u201cI\u2019m really glad you\u2019re back, Brian.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe too, Em.\u201d Hugging her, I said, \u201cI\u2019ll see you later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Mac and I waved goodbye to them, as they walked down the sidewalk, Mac closed the door.  I started heading towards the kitchen to make a sandwich when she suddenly spun me around and shoved me against the wall.

I stood there in stunned silence, trying to process what just happened.  I don\u2019t know what happened to make her that way, but <i>that</i> was not the Mackenzie I remembered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was still standing in the hallway, a few minutes later, when the front door opened.

I almost made it to the driveway when I heard Emily\u2019s voice behind me.  \u201cHey Brian, wait up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned around and saw Emily running towards me; no longer wearing the dress from earlier.  I felt a sudden pang of disappointment; because I thought she looked really great in the dress.  I shook my head in an attempt to get those thoughts out of my mind.  I shouldn\u2019t be thinking of Emily like that; just two days earlier she\u2019d been a 7-year-old girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Emily caught up to me, I looked at her and said, \u201cHey Em, what\u2019s up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s a new ice cream parlor that opened downtown; I was wondering if you\u2019d like to try it out.\u201d Looking at me, she said, \u201cIf you\u2019re worried it might be awkward, I promise it won\u2019t be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cOkay, I guess that could be fun.\u201d Smiling, I said, \u201cMaybe you can teach me how to use social media while we\u2019re there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA big smile flashed on Emily\u2019s face before she looked at me and said, \u201cSure, we can do that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two of us started walking down the road, I said, \u201cI want to thank you for being willing to help me, Em.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to thank me, Brian; that\u2019s what friends are for.\u201d Looking at me, Kat said, \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019d do the same thing if the roles were reversed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course I would.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of us had been at the ice cream parlor for close to an hour; eating our ice cream while Kat helped me with my phone.  I had a basic understanding of social media from six years earlier, but things had changed a lot since then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily, to her credit, was very helpful; she had the patience of a saint as she taught me the ins and outs of Snapchat and Instagram.  We finally reached a point where Emily figured I\u2019d learned enough; so, after getting some milkshakes, we just sat outside and talked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt must be weird for you; starting 8th grade again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI did pretty well the last time, so I\u2019m not too worried.\u201d Taking a sip of the milkshake, I said, \u201cThe weirdest thing is the fact that you and Mac will be my classmates; no offense.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI imagine you\u2019ll draw a lot of attention from our classmates, especially once word gets out that you\u2019re back.\u201d Looking at me, she said, \u201cYou\u2019ll probably even have a lot of girls after you as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing Emily say that had me thinking; there was one girl in particular whose attention I was interested in.  \u201cI\u2019ve only been back for a few days, but I think there\u2019s one girl in particular that I like.\u201d Looking at her, with a sly smile, I said, \u201cThe question is, does she feel the same way?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI saw Emily\u2019s face turn red as she started blushing.  She stared at me for a moment, silent, before she leaned over and kissed me.  <br>\r\nAfter getting over the initial shock, I reciprocated the kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe did that for a few moments until we were rudely interrupted.  \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily and I immediately broke the kiss; looking in the direction of the voice, we saw Mac glaring at us.</span></div></div>",

But before I could say anything, Emily spoke up, \u201cWe were talking about Brian starting school again, how there\u2019d be lots of girls interested in him.\u201d  Looking at Mac, she said, \u201cHe said he was nervous around girls; so I thought I would make him feel better, this kiss didn\u2019t mean anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStunned, I could only look at Emily in silence.

Looking at her, I saw her shake her head feverishly.  I sat back down and tried to calm myself; looking at Mac, I said, \u201cWhat are you even doing here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was getting my nails done with Allison; I saw you guys over here, so I thought I\u2019d stop by.\u201d Looking at Emily, Mac said, \u201cCome on Em, let\u2019s go; I think Brian\u2019s taken enough of your time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou go, I\u2019ll catch up; I have to use the bathroom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI waited until Mac had crossed the street before getting up.  Looking at Emily, feeling hurt, I said, \u201cThanks for the help, Em; I-I\u2019ll see you around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I started walking down the sidewalk, I heard Emily call after me, \u201cWait, Brian; I-I...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI rounded the corner before Emily could finish her sentence.  I was too upset to listen anyway.</span></div></div>",

We had \u2018secret meetings\u2019 that were protected by a sign that said <b> No Girls Allowed </b> \u2013 I wonder how Andrea and Carrie felt about that.  <br>\r\nWe spent whole summers zip-lining across the yard, we had a blast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe treehouse took on a new role after Dad was diagnosed; when he was having a bad day, I would climb up and think back to when he was healthy; when all he cared about was making his kids happy.  After his first round of chemo, I hung up a picture of the two of us showing off the completed treehouse.  Even after all these years, I was glad it was still there.  After everything that\u2019s happened in the last few days, I found myself wishing he\u2019d come back.  I mean, <i>I</i> came back, so why couldn't <i>he?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Emily's voice called out from the yard, \u201cBrian?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking my way to the window, I looked down and saw her standing at the base of the tree.  \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I come up?  I-I need to talk to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily was the last person I wanted to see right now, but I knew she wasn\u2019t going away.  \u201cFine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily climbed up the ladder and opened the trapdoor a moment later.  \u201cMac always talked about how you liked to come up here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you want, Emily?\u201d looking at her, I said, \u201cYou\u2019re not even interested in me, so why are you here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Emily finished climbing into the treehouse, I could immediately see that she\u2019d been crying.  \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Brian; but I <i>had</i> to tell her that.\u201d Sighing, Emily said, \u201cYou saw how she acted when she saw us; I had to lie to calm her down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYo-You lied to her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI feel the same way you do, Brian; believe me, I hated that made you doubt that.\u201d Inching closer, Emily said, \u201cI...I love you, Brian; and I think I always have.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou love me?\u201d looking at her, I said, \u201cYou\u2019re not just saying that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do love you, Brian.\u201d Leaning over, Emily planted a quick kiss on my lips. \u201cI just said that stuff to calm Mac down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re her best friend, I don\u2019t think she\u2019d hurt you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not me I\u2019m worried about, Brian.\u201d Sitting next to me, Emily said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019ve heard, but...Mac had it pretty rough after you disappeared.  She made some pretty bad choices; my dad said she had some personal demons.  I don\u2019t think those demons are gone, they\u2019re just sleeping.

I think having Allison as my sister is a big part of it; the other, well, I think I reminded Mac of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I can see that; I mean we both have the same interests.\u201d Looking at Cameron, I said, \u201cHave the last six years been as bad for her as I\u2019ve been told?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe even slightly worse than you\u2019ve been told.\u201d Sighing, Cameron said, \u201cShe got suspended for two weeks because she broke a kid\u2019s nose.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re the third person who\u2019s told me something like that.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cI\u2019m just having a hard time picturing that; the Mac I knew would never get into fights.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s been through a lot, Brian; with you disappearing and your dad dying.\u201d Looking at me, Cameron said, \u201cHaving those happen so close together would break anyone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was about to respond when suddenly there was a knock at the door.  Mom poked her head inside and said, \u201cCameron your mom called; it\u2019s time to go home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, Mrs. Tucker.\u201d Getting up, Cameron turned to me and said, \u201cIt was nice meeting you, Brian.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou too, Cameron; I\u2019ll see you around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Cameron left, Mom came over and took a seat on my bed.  \u201cYou seem to be adjusting rather well, Brian.\u201d With a sly smile, she said, \u201cNot only do you have a girlfriend, but you\u2019re making new friends.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking about, Mom?\u201d blushing, I said, \u201cI don\u2019t have a girlfriend?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh really?\u201d With her right eyebrow raised, Mom said, \u201cThen perhaps you\u2019d care to explain why I saw you and Emily making out in your treehouse.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou saw that!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave you forgotten the kitchen window looks right into your treehouse?\u201d turning serious, Mom said, \u201cI thought you were going to talk with your sister before you started anything with Emily?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was going to talk to her, Mom; it\u2019s just, everything happened so fast.\u201d My heart racing, I said, \u201cOne minute we were talking at the ice cream parlor, the next minute we were kissing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour sister mentioned something about that; only she told me Emily said it didn\u2019t mean anything.\u201d Looking at me, Mom said, <br>\r\n\u201cJudging from what I saw going on in the treehouse, I assume Emily didn\u2019t tell your sister the truth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-It\u2019s complicated, Mom; Emily didn\u2019t think Mac could handle the idea of us dating.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cBut I\u2019ll tell her when I feel the <br>\r\ntime is right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay then, that\u2019s all I ask.\u201d Getting up, Mom said, \u201cIt\u2019s time for dinner, why don\u2019t you come downstairs.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I thought it would have been a complicated thing to do, but Henry said that all I had to do was go to the courts and prove that I was who I said I was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, we all decided to watch a movie as a family.  I was in the kitchen making some popcorn with Henry, while Mac and mom were getting the movie set up.  As we waited for the microwave to finish, Henry came over and stood next to me.  \u201cYour mom told me about what happened in the treehouse.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh.\u201d Wincing, I turned to him and said, \u201cWhat exactly did she tell you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat you and Emily were tongue wrestling.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m 13 years old, Henry.\u201d Groaning, I said, \u201cIf you want to say that Emily and I were making out, then just come out and say it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, fair enough.\u201d Sighing, Henry said, \u201cSo what brought all of this on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe were hanging out at that new ice cream parlor; Emily was helping me with social media.\u201d Blushing, I said, \u201cOne thing led to <br>\r\nanother; and we started making out when Mac found us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then went into detail about what happened; from Emily lying to Mac to what happened in the treehouse.  When I was finished, Henry looked at me and said, \u201cEmily said that she loved you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, she did; and believe me, I was as surprised as you are.\u201d Blushing again, I said, \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been this conflicted about my feelings for a girl before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s there to be conflicted about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it obvious?\u201d looking at Henry, I said, \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, Emily was 7 years old only a few days ago.  Now she\u2019s an incredibly attractive girl who\u2019s my age.  I\u2019m not sure how my feelings for her won\u2019t conflict with my memories of her as a little kid.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe way I see it, Brian; there\u2019s only one person you should talk about this with.\u201d Seeing the confused look on my face, Henry said, \u201cEmily doesn\u2019t appear to have a problem with acting on her feelings for you.  You should talk with her about that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose that makes sense.\u201d Catching a glimpse of Mac walking around the family room, I said, \u201cFor now I suppose we should be careful around Mac; she seemed pretty annoyed that I was kissing her best friend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a problem for another day, Brian.\u201d Grabbing the popcorn from the microwave, Henry said, \u201cFor now, let\u2019s go watch a movie as a family.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI silently followed Henry into the family room.  As I walked behind the couch, I caught a glimpse of Mac\u2019s cell phone as I passed behind her.  I only caught a glimpse of it, but I saw that she was having a text conversation with someone about a party in a few days.  Coming around the couch, I looked at her and said, \u201cHey Mac, can I sit next to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess so.\u201d Putting her phone away, Mac said, \u201cJust try not to bug me, okay?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Walking downstairs, I saw that Mom and Mac had already left for the morning; having planned an impromptu trip to a nail salon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Henry and I had a quick breakfast, he gathered the necessary paperwork while I went outside to wait for him.  I was standing by the car when I noticed Emily peek around the back corner of her house.  Figuring Henry was going to be a few minutes, I made my way over to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could even say good morning, she pulled me around the corner and kissed me firmly on the lips.

Catching my breath, I said, \u201cI don\u2019t have time for it now, but you and I need to talk at some point.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s never good when someone you\u2019re in a relationship with says that.\u201d Sighing, Emily said, \u201cWhat did you want to talk about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want to talk about our relationship.\u201d Looking at Emily, I said, \u201cBefore we take things any further, I need to know if <i>this</i> will work despite our past friendship.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI get it; as far as you\u2019re concerned I was just a kid a few days ago.\u201d Leaning against the back of her house, Emily said, \u201cI can\u2019t say I blame you; after all, you taught me to ride my bike and suddenly we\u2019re making out in your treehouse.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want to make this work because I do like you.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cI just need to make sure it\u2019s appropriate for us to be together.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could tell that this wasn\u2019t what Emily wanted to hear, but she took it all in stride.  \u201cI waited for six years to have a chance with you, Brian.\u201d Looking at me, she said, \u201cI guess I can wait a few weeks for you to figure things out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRegardless of whatever happens, there\u2019s something I want you to know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d with a faint smile, Emily said, \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEven if we aren\u2019t a couple, you know that I\u2019ll always care for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, Brian.\u201d Hugging me, Emily said, \u201cI\u2019ll always care about you, too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry walked out of the house at that point, so I said goodbye to Emily and went to get into the car.

The two of us hugged for a few moments until I broke off the hug.  Putting aside my discomfort, I leaned back and looked at Mackenzie, \u201cHow can you possibly be 34 years old?\u201d looking at her, I said, \u201cI only saw you a few hours ago.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m at a loss to explain it myself, but I\u2019m afraid considerably more than a few hours have passed since we played hide and seek.\u201d Taking a deep breath, Mackenzie said, \u201cBrian, you\u2019ve been missing for 27 years.\u201d</span></div></div>",

After a while, she stepped out of the room to make a few phone calls; leaving me alone with my thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had just walked out of the bathroom when Mac walked back into the room; still talking on her cell phone.  \u201cI don\u2019t need a DNA test, honey; I just know this young man is my brother.\u201d Sighing, she said, \u201cI\u2019m going to stay here for a while; Allison\u2019s sleeping in one of the on-call rooms.

For a brief moment, I was concerned that more time had passed for me, but a quick look to my right showed Mackenzie asleep on a nearby chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don\u2019t know how much time went by as I lay there in bed; simply staring at Mackenzie as she slept.  I was still having a hard time wrapping my head around the fact that the woman before me was my little sister.  Guess I can\u2019t really call her my little sister anymore. She\u2019s old enough to be my mom now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter listening to her bringing me up to speed on everything I\u2019d missed over the last 27 years, I couldn\u2019t help but feel upset about it.  Collin was married to a woman named Andrea; with whom he had two 17-year-old kids.  Carrie was married to a woman, which surprised me, and lived in Maryland with her wife and 7-year-old daughter.  Emily's married and has a 13-year-old daughter; who Mac thought I was would get along with.  I was a little confused about why Mackenzie didn\u2019t tell me about Eric; despite my begging her to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was disappointed to miss all of that, but none of it came close to me missing my dad\u2019s funeral.  It seemed he\u2019d died about a month after I vanished.  It was just Mac and Mom for a while; until Mom eventually married one of the detectives on my case.  It seemed I had a half-brother now; Aaron was 21 years old and a junior in college.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat brought me back to Mackenzie; I\u2019d already learned she had three kids of her own.  She went on to explain that she\u2019d gotten her master\u2019s degree in accounting and was one of the senior accountants for a major financial firm in Philadelphia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that point I realized I had to use the bathroom so, as quietly as I could, I climbed out of bed.  Mac must\u2019ve had ears like a hawk because I barely got out of bed before she woke up and looked at me.  \u201cHey, can\u2019t sleep?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot really; trying to process everything.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to wake you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry; it comes with being a mom.\u201d Chuckling, she said, \u201cWhen Marcus was little, he used to have terrible nightmares.  It got to the point where I\u2019d wake up the moment he started screaming.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI still can\u2019t believe that you\u2019re a mom, Mac.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy\u2019s it so difficult to believe?\u201d looking at me, she said, \u201cWhen a mom and dad love each other, they...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you seriously giving me the birds and the bees talk?\u201d chuckling, I said, \u201cMac, Dad gave me that talk when I was 11.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry; Megan\u2019s at the age where she\u2019s curious about where babies come from.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s no big deal.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cNow if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019m going to use the bathroom now.\u201d</span></div></div>",

But now that I had time to process everything, I was able to recognize minute details in people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman\u2019s smile, for instance, was a dead giveaway as to who she was.  Looking at her, a smile of my own, I said, \u201cHey Emily, it\u2019s been a while.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my God!\u201d coming over, Emily practically squeezed me to death as she hugged me.  \u201cPlease tell me this isn\u2019t some twisted practical joke.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s me, Em.\u201d Catching my breath, I said, \u201cYou look good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman standing before me was most assuredly Emily, but I still had some difficulty believing it.  I felt weird thinking this, since the last time I saw her she\u2019d been 7 years old, but she\u2019d grown into quite an attractive woman.  Barely an inch taller than Mac, she could\u2019ve easily passed for a woman in her mid-20s.  \u201cOh please. I look like crap.\u201d Chuckling, Emily said, \u201cI spent the last 12 hours in surgery, I barely had time to take a shower.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Mac\u2019s phone started ringing; after checking to see who it was, she said, \u201cI\u2019ll just be a minute.  Em, can you keep an eye on Allison?  She\u2019s out here in the hall.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing.\u201d Glancing at me, Emily said, \u201cThis\u2019ll give me a chance to catch up with your brother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Mac walked out of the room, I turned my attention back to Emily.  \u201cSo what happened, I thought you wanted to be a teacher when you grew up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI did; up until my junior year of High School.\u201d Pulling up a chair, Emily said, \u201cI took an AP anatomy class, and I just got hooked.  So 11 years later, after racking up a <i>considerable</i> amount of debt, I became a board-certified pediatric surgeon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m impressed; then again I always knew you were smart.\u201d Leaning back in the bed, I said, \u201cWhat else have you been up to?  You married?  Got any kids?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have a 13-year-old daughter named Callie; I got pregnant a few months into my residency.\u201d Taking a pause, Emily said, \u201cAs for being married; well, I haven\u2019t found the right guy yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s out there, don\u2019t give up hope.\u201d Chuckling, I said, \u201cI kept forgetting to ask Mac about my friends; do you know what they\u2019ve been up to?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey\u2019re doing well; Collin and his wife, Andrea, have two kids.  Carrie lives in Maryland with her wife and...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait a minute.  Wife?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh right, you didn\u2019t know\u201d looking at me, Emily said, \u201cCarrie came out about a year after you disappeared.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI never would\u2019ve figured Carrie was a lesbian.\u201d Chuckling, I said, \u201cWhat about Eric?  What\u2019s he been up to?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily went silent for a moment; which started to make me worried.  After a moment, Emily said, \u201cEric is...well, he\u2019s been through a lot.\u201d Looking at me, she said, \u201cSo much so that I don\u2019t think you\u2019d recognized him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not my place to say, Brian; that\u2019s something you two need to discuss.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was worried; did something bad happen to Eric while I was gone?  I didn\u2019t have long to dwell on it, because suddenly a teenage girl walked into the room.  \u201cHey Mom, Allison wants something to eat from the vending machine.  Can I have a few bucks?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo long as it\u2019s not anything too sugary.\u201d Digging through her purse, Emily said, \u201cBefore you go, there\u2019s someone I want you to meet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl, who I now realized was Emily\u2019s daughter Callie, moved closer to her bed.

I reciprocated by telling her some stories about when her Mom was a kid; although I chose not to tell her anything embarrassing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe also took the time to get to know each other a little better; as it turned out, Callie and I shared many of the same interests.  She liked playing video games and going outdoors as much as I had.  \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, though; I\u2019ve got no problem showing off my feminine side if I need to.\u201d With a grin, Callie said, \u201cJust because I\u2019m a girl doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t like getting down and dirty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re your mother\u2019s daughter, alright.\u201d Chuckling, I looked at her and said, \u201cYou probably wouldn\u2019t be surprised how many times they were mistaken for boys.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I believe it; I saw some old photos of them when they were younger.\u201d Smiling, Callie said, \u201cI guess it runs in the family; when I <br>\r\nwas younger I went through a phase where the only hairstyle I would want were buzz cuts.  It made for some interesting conversations when Mom would bring me into the ladies\u2019 room.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time went by, the two of us began talking like we were old friends.  We were in the middle of talking about some TV show Callie thought I\u2019d like when Mac and Emily walked into the room.  \u201cOkay Cal, I think we\u2019ve taken up enough of Brian\u2019s time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you say so, Mom.\u201d Getting up, Callie looked at me and said, \u201cIt was nice meeting you, Brian; perhaps we can hang out once you get out of the hospital.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d like that; it\u2019s just a question of when I\u2019ll get out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Callie and Emily left, Mac turned to me and said, \u201cYou two seemed to hit it off pretty easily.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I guess.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cIt helps that we have a lot of the same interests.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnce you\u2019re out of here, I\u2019ll give you her phone number.\u201d Pausing, Mac said, \u201cIn the meantime, the doctors want to take you for an MRI.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAn MRI?\u201d suddenly worried, I said, \u201cWhat for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey noticed some peculiarities in the scans they took after you were brought in.\u201d trying to sound comforting, Mac said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s nothing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Still worried, I said, \u201cHave you heard from Mom?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot since they boarded the plane; don\u2019t worry, they\u2019ll be here soon.\u201d</span></div></div>",

As we got out of the elevator, I turned to her and said, \u201cMac, you don\u2019t need to stay with me 24/7; you have your own family to take care of.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be foolish Brian; you\u2019re my family too.\u201d Placing a hand on my shoulder, Mac said, \u201cForgive me for not wanting to let you out of my sight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI guess I couldn\u2019t blame her from wanting to be close by; especially since I\u2019d been missing for the last 27 years.  If I were in her position I\u2019d likely be doing the same thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sat quietly in the wheelchair as the nurse turned down a hallway leading to the MRI.  No one had said anything for a few moments, so I decided to break the ice.  \u201cI suppose you must\u2019ve heard a lot about me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking her head, the nurse said, \u201cNo, not really.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d I was surprised to hear that.  \u201cI thought it was a big story back then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt probably was, but I was a little girl then.\u201d Looking down at me, the nurse said, \u201cIf it didn\u2019t happen on Disney Junior, I didn\u2019t know about it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that just made me realize, even more, how much everything had changed.  My little sister was now a grown woman and my nurse couldn\u2019t have been older than 4 years old when I disappeared.  It made me wonder how many other hospital staff had been kids when I disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of us rounded a corner heading towards the MRI; the nurse was about to wheel me in when a doctor stopped us at the door.  Looking at Mac, he said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry ma\u2019am, but only patients and medical staff are allowed past this point.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s my brother, doctor.\u201d Getting defensive, Mac said, \u201cI\u2019m not letting him out of my sight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor wasn\u2019t having any of it; he looked as though he was going to call security when the nurse stepped in.  \u201cDoctor Amherst, this is the boy who disappeared 27 years ago.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor looked from me to Mac for a moment.  With a sigh, he said, \u201cOkay fine, but don\u2019t touch anything and stay out of my way.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I went to lie in bed while Mac went to get me a glass of water.  She returned a few minutes later with both a pitcher of water and some cups.  I helped myself to one of the cups and poured some water.  After taking a quick sip, I turned to look at Mac.  \u201cThanks for keeping me calm during the MRI, Mac.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting on the edge of the bed, Mac placed a hand on my shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome, sweetie.\u201d Gently starting to rub my back, she said, \u201cI remember how much you hated tight spaces.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t even faze me that Mac had called me sweetie; the only thing I could think about was how comforting it was for her to be here.

As he closed the door, feeling anxious, I said, \u201cWhat did you find in the MRI, doctor?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you remember an incident when you were 11 years old?\u201d looking at me, he said, \u201cYou were brought into the ER after a zip line accident.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI remembered that incident vividly; it was Collin\u2019s birthday and we all went to this adventure park on the outside of town.  I must not have been secured properly, because about halfway through my ride the harness snapped and I felt twenty feet to the ground.  <br>\r\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s pretty hard to forget something like that.\u201d Rubbing my head, I said, \u201cI fractured my skull in two places and broke both my legs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry doctor, but I\u2019m confused.\u201d Placing a hand on my shoulder, Mac said, \u201cWhat does an accident from 30 years ago have to do with what\u2019s going on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs you may recall, Mrs. Douglas; once we realized who your brother was, we had to search through decades-old files to find his charts.\u201d Digging through the file, the doctor placed an x-ray image on a nearby display.  \u201cThis was from the day your brother was brought in; you can see the fractures on his skull.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMac and I both looked at the image on the display; sure enough, we could both see the fractures.  \u201cI feel as though you\u2019re about to tell us something.\u201d Turning back to the doctor, I said, \u201cStop beating around the bush and get it over with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor silently pulled out another x-ray image and placed it on the display.  \u201cThis image was taken last night after you were brought in, Brian.\u201d Pointing at the image, he said, \u201cI\u2019m at a loss to explain this; but your skull fractures seem to have vanished.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d looking at the image, I said, \u201cThat\u2019s impossible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I kept telling myself, but the evidence is as clear as day.\u201d Looking at me, the doctor said, \u201cWhat\u2019s more is that there\u2019s no longer any evidence of the TBI you sustained during the fall.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat TBI had thrown all my plans for summer vacation out the window; the youth football league wouldn\u2019t let me play with an injury like that.  \u201cI'm an accountant, so you'll have to forgive my ignorance.\" looking back at the doctor, Mac said, \"What exactly are you saying, doctor?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m saying, Mrs. Douglas, is that your brother is in perfect health.\u201d Gesturing to my chart, he said, \u201cIn fact, all of his tests show that he\u2019s healthier than he was 27 years ago.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMac and I exchanged confused looks with each other; neither of us had any idea what was going on.

She had a few more wrinkles than the video call showed, and her hair wasn\u2019t as grey as I thought, but I was still able to recognize that it was her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly overcome with emotion I climbed out of bed and, before anyone could stop me, I ran across the room to Mom.  I came close to making her fall over as I hugged her; as I instantly started crying.  I still wasn\u2019t sure what was going on, but I knew everything was going to be alright now that my mom was here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter letting me cry for a moment, Mom gently extricated herself from my grip and looked at me.  \u201cI can\u2019t believe it\u2019s you, Brian.\u201d Touching my face, she said, \u201cThe entire flight here all I kept thinking about was that this was some cruel trick.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was my first thought too, Mom.\u201d Walking up behind us, Mac said, \u201cBut all the tests say that this is, in fact, Brian.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom embraced me once again, saying, \u201cDo you have <i>any</i> clue about what happened to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid not, Mom; the last thing I remembered before waking up here was playing hide and seek in the woods with Mac.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s another facet to this mystery that we just found out, Mom.\u201d Standing next to me, Mac said, \u201cIt seems that Brian\u2019s zip line injury has miraculously healed itself; there\u2019s no sign of his skull fracture or his TBI.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose there\u2019s no point in asking how something like is even possible.\u201d Holding me close, Mom looked at Mac and said, \u201cHave you been in contact with Brian\u2019s friends?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEmily stopped by earlier; I spoke with Carrie and Collin last night, they said they\u2019ll be here later this afternoon.\u201d  Gesturing to me, Mac said, \u201cHe was asking about Eric, but I didn\u2019t think it was my place to tell him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI begged her to tell me, but she wouldn\u2019t.\u201d Glancing up at Mom, I said, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on with Eric, Mom?  I deserve to know what\u2019s going on with my best friend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course you do, Brian.\u201d Sighing, Mom said, \u201cBut your sister\u2019s right; it\u2019s not our place to tell you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, I\u2019ll just ask him when he gets here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreaking away from mom, I went back to the bed just as an older man walked into the room.

Do you have any questions you want to ask me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sat in silence for a moment while I thought about a long list of questions that I wanted answers to.

Your mom helped me with that; while I helped her cope with your disappearance and your father\u2019s declining health.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cForgive me for asking this; but did you two become involved while my dad was still alive?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, we didn\u2019t become involved until about a year after your father died.\u201d Looking at me, he said, \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean I wasn\u2019t in the picture.  I helped out with the housework and  even helped Mackenzie with her problems.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMac mentioned she had a drinking problem when she was younger.\u201d Taking a pause, I said, \u201cHow bad did it get for her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t wish what your sister went through on anyone; not even my worst enemy.  Losing both her brother and her father in a month took its toll on her.\u201d Sighing, Henry said, \u201cShe was suspended from school several times for fighting; she got in trouble for stealing a bottle of soda from a gas station. We didn\u2019t find out about the drinking until she got arrested at a party a few blocks away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019d known about the drinking but the rest was all a big surprise.

Looking at Henry, I said, \u201cHow did she finally work past all that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe got through it with some help from your mom, me, and her friends.\u201d Pausing, Henry said, \u201cShe resisted at first, but finally came around after your brother was born.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMac didn\u2019t tell me a whole lot about Aaron; only that he\u2019s on Spring Break right now.\u201d Looking at Henry, I said, \u201cWhat\u2019s he like?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s a great kid; smart as a fox.\u201d Smiling, Henry said, \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll like him; you both have similar interests.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I\u2019ll just have to work past the fact that I was born before my older brother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling, Henry said, \u201cGive it some time, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll get used to it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMac came walking into the room at that moment.  \"I'm sorry to interrupt, but there's someone outside who wants to speak with Brian.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" looking at Mac, I said, \"Send them in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMac leaned out the door and waved at someone I couldn't see.  I watched as a woman, in her early 40s and wearing a business suit, walked into the room.  With everything going on, I figured she must've been from Social Services or something.  But I couldn't shake the feeling that she looked familiar.  Whoever she was, I watched as Henry stood up and made his way towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMac and Henry left the room; leaving me alone with the woman.  Looking at me, she said, \"I couldn't believe it when Mac told me you were back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, but who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I imagine I look very different from the last time you saw me.\" stepping closer to the bed, the woman said, \"My name is Andrea, but you knew me as Eric.\"</span></div></div>",

The silence in the room was deafening; as we both just stared at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment I finally got up the nerve to speak.  \u201cForgive me, but there\u2019s no way you\u2019re Eric.\u201d Looking at her, I said, \u201cI mean you\u2019re a woman, and Eric was a guy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was never a guy, Brian; it just took me a while to finally become who I was supposed to be.\u201d Sighing, Andrea said, \u201cThere has to be something I could do to prove I\u2019m telling the truth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you\u2019re Eric, then tell me something that only he would know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrea pulled up a chair next to my bed; she sat down and looked at me. \u201cWhen they brought you into the ER after your zip lining incident; the nurse asked you how many fingers she was holding up.\u201d Pausing, she said, \u201cShe was holding up 6, but you said \u2018Spider-man.\u2019\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf I had been drinking any water, I probably would\u2019ve done a spit take.  As impossible as it seemed, the woman sitting before me was my best friend.  \u201cIt\u2019s really you, Eric?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease call me Andrea; I haven\u2019t gone by Eric in almost 30 years.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI went silent again as I tried to process everything.  Andrea was an attractive woman; a little on the tall side for a woman but with a nice figure.  The more I looked at her though, the more I was able to see hints of my friend in her face.  \u201cI thought Mom and Mac had changed since I saw them last, but you\u2026\u201d pausing, I said, \u201cWhen did all of this happen?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you remember, the day you disappeared, when I called you on the phone?  I told you I had something important to talk with you about.\u201d  Gesturing to herself, Andrea said, \u201cWell, this was it.  I went to my aunt\u2019s house to start my transition in secret; you were the first one I was going to tell.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cForgive me if I\u2019m being awkward, but you look amazing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, I go to the gym three times a week.\u201d Leaning closer, Andrea said, \u201cJust between you and me; it\u2019s nice to know I\u2019m still considered attractive at my age.  My kid\u2019s friends are always complimenting me about how I look.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have kids?\u201d confused, I said, \u201cDid they make some medical breakthroughs while I was gone?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSadly no, a woman like me is still unable to get pregnant.\u201d Pausing, Andrea said, \u201cI did things the old fashion way; Emily donated some eggs while Grace carried them to term.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re an excellent mother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI like to think so, but there are times when my kids think I\u2019m terrible.\u201d Chuckling, she said, \u201cThankfully Collin is there to help clear things up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe just celebrated our 19th-anniversary last month.  I don\u2019t blame you for being surprised by that; after all, I had a crush on someone else until he disappeared on me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took longer than I wanted to admit before I realized she was talking about me.  \u201cYou had a crush on me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI had a <i>huge</i> crush on you since the 7<sup>th</sup> grade, but I never said anything because I knew you wouldn\u2019t feel the same way.\u201d Blushing a little bit, Andrea said, \u201cAfter I started my transition, I dreamed of the day when I could be your girlfriend.  But then you disappeared, and I eventually started dating Collin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor what it\u2019s worth, I\u2019m sorry you never got to be my girlfriend.\u201d Looking at her, I said, \u201cI trust that Collin and you are happy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s the love of my life and the father of my children.\u201d Pausing, Andrea said, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t trade him for anyone else in the world.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of us talked for a few more minutes about married life and Andrea\u2019s kids.  It seemed that Andrea was truly happy with her life; and I, in turn, was happy for her.  \u201cSo what do you do for a living?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m in charge of the Woman\u2019s Fashion department at Bloomingdales.\u201d Smiling, Andrea continued, \u201cIt\u2019s my dream job; even if I have a 90-minute commute each way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait a minute; its 10:00 on a Wednesday, why aren\u2019t you at work?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI had a doctor\u2019s appointment; one, I might add, that I\u2019ve had to reschedule three times.\u201d Pausing, Andrea said, \u201cI figured I\u2019d kill two birds with one stone; go to the appointment and then stop by to see you before going to work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, in that case, I won\u2019t keep you any longer.\u201d Smiling, I said, \u201cIt\u2019s great to see you again, Andrea.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s great to see you again, Brain.\u201d Hugging me, Andrea said, \u201cI never thought this day would come.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I was still trying to wrap my head around everything I\u2019d learned; my best friend had become a woman and was married to another of my friends.  Not only that, but she had two kids that were only a few years older than me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was sitting in bed when Mac entered the room.  \u201cNow you understand why Mom and I couldn\u2019t tell you what happened to Eric.\u201d Looking at me, she said, \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have been appropriate for anyone but Andrea to tell you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry for pestering you guys about it so much.\u201d  Sitting up in bed, I said, \u201cI\u2019m still trying to get a grasp on all of it; growing up, I had no idea that she was trans.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean to tell me that you had no idea?\u201d sitting in the chair next to the bed, Mac said, \u201cAndrea was your best friend; if anyone should\u2019ve noticed something it was you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked back on my memories of spending time with Andrea.  The more I thought about it, the more I realized that I had noticed some inexplicable incidents when we were kids.  \u201cNow that you mention it, I did remember catching her wearing Grace\u2019s cheerleading outfit one time.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cI did always find it weird that she always dressed as female characters for Halloween.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI assume that she told you about her crush?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, we talked about that for a few minutes.\u201d Smiling, I said, \u201cI\u2019m glad she ended up with Collin; after all, relationships at that age rarely last.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe never forgot about you, Brian; you always had a special place in her heart.\u201d Tearing up a little, Mac said, \u201cI don\u2019t know if she told you this, but she named her son after you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was my turn to tear up; learning the impact I had on my best friend\u2019s life even after I disappeared.  \u201cShe didn\u2019t say anything about that, but she did say that I would meet them at the party.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was suddenly a knock at the door, followed by mom poking her head inside.  \u201cThey\u2019re here, Mackenzie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, thanks, Mom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Mac, I said, \u201cWho\u2019s here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t want this to seem like a revolving door of visitors, but there are some people I\u2019d like for you to meet.\u201d Mac stood up as a man appeared in the doorway with a boy and a girl.  Looking at me, Mac said, \u201cYou already met Allison; so it\u2019s only fair to meet the rest of my family.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I spent almost 30 minutes talking with the rest of Mac\u2019s family; her husband Duncan, her oldest daughter Megan and her son Marcus.  While Duncan and Megan were willing to talk with me, I could tell that Marcus was less than enthusiastic.  I guess I couldn\u2019t blame him since I was the same way at that age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuncan, as it turned out, is a history teacher at the High School; Megan did gymnastics on the weekend and Marcus was on the peewee football team.  After a while Megan and Marcus left the room, leaving me alone with Duncan and Mac.  Turning his attention to me, Duncan said, \u201cSo Brian, did your sister discuss your living arrangements after you get out of the hospital?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot really, but I figured it was only a matter of time before Mom told me.\u201d Shrugging, I said, \u201cIt\u2019ll be weird moving away from here, but I think I\u2019ll like it in Florida.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuncan and Mac exchanged curious glances with each other until Mac turned back to me.  \u201cBrian, sweetie, I think there\u2019s been a misunderstanding.\u201d Sighing, she said, \u201cYou\u2019re going to be staying here with us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat wasn\u2019t at all what I had been expecting.  \u201cWhat?\u201d in shock, I said, \u201cThere\u2019s no way I\u2019m living with you guys.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid that\u2019s your only option unless you want to go into foster care.\u201d Looking at me, Mac said, \u201cThe retirement village where Mom and Dad live won't allow anyone under the age of 55 to live there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was so much about that sentence I wanted to discuss; chief being that Mac had referred to Henry as Dad.  But I decided to focus on the fact that I was being forced to live with Mac and her family.  \u201cThere\u2019s no way you\u2019ll be allowed to let me live with you.\u201d <br>\r\nScoffing, I said, \u201cYou\u2019re my little sister for Christ\u2019s sake.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn case you haven\u2019t noticed, Brian; I\u2019m a 34-year-old woman and you\u2019re only 13 years old.\u201d Getting frustrated, Mac said, \u201cYou may not like it, but I\u2019m well within my legal rights to become your legal guardian.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d live with Aaron before I lived with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMac rolled her eyes out of sheer frustration \u201cGod, I forgot how stubborn you could be.  Listen to me, young man; Aaron doesn\u2019t even know who you are.  Do you think he\u2019d let a 13-year-old boy live with him?  For all you know, he\u2019s living in some bachelor apartment.\u201d Stepping closer to me, raising her voice, Mac said, \u201cYou may not want to hear this, but I know more about how these things work than you do.  Maybe, somewhere down the line, we can discuss this some more; but for time being you have to listen to what I say.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI recoiled slightly as Mac got closer to me; taken aback by the sudden change in her tone.  It brought back memories of when Mom would use the same tone with me as a kid.  I certainly didn\u2019t like it; but Mac was right, I had to accept that she was the adult and I was the kid.</span></div></div>",
