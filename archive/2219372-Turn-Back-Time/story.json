            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>My name is Brian Hawkins; I\u2019m 13 years old and I live with my parents and my 7-year-old sister Mackenzie.  My life hasn\u2019t been the easiest lately, ever since my Dad was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer.  I don\u2019t think I would\u2019ve gotten through it all without my friends; Eric, Carrie and her twin brother Collin. The four of us have known each other since Kindergarten and were damn near inseparable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy am I telling you this? Because something happened to me just before I was to start 8th grade; something I can\u2019t quite explain. I was out in the woods behind my house, playing hide and seek with Mackenzie when I suddenly blacked out. When I regained consciousness, I thought that only a short time had passed.  Little did I know how wrong I was; what was only a few hours for me, was years for everyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat comes next is the story of how I attempt to rebuild my life.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><b>August 11th, 2013</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019d be lying if I said the last few days hadn\u2019t been stressful; with my dad having been admitted to the hospital after his condition took a turn for the worst.  He\u2019d been working his office when he suffered a seizure that resulted in him hitting his head on the side of his desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was just after 9:00 in the morning and my mom was getting ready to leave to visit my dad at the hospital.  I was upstairs in my room, playing <i>Dead Space 3</i>, when I heard a commotion from downstairs.  After I paused the game, I went downstairs and found Mackenzie following Mom around like a lost puppy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie\u2019s had a hard time since my dad\u2019s diagnosis; when she wasn\u2019t with her best friend Emily, she was following Mom or me around the house.  Grabbing her jacket, Mom turned to look at Mackenzie and said, \u201cMackenzie, sweetie, I know you want to come with me; but your father doesn\u2019t want you to see him like this.\u201d Spotting me in the hallway, Mom said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you spend some time with your brother; and I\u2019ll be back in a few hours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019ll admit to being slightly annoyed by mom\u2019s suggestion.  I\u2019d had a busy week at school and wanted to relax with the video games; not babysit my clingy little sister.  Choosing not to act on my annoyance, I looked at Mackenzie and said, \u201cCome on Mac, let\u2019s go watch a movie or something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Mackenzie focusing on me, Mom made a break for the door.  After a moment, Mackenzie said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we go out and play in the woods or something?\u201d with a heavy sigh, Mackenzie looked at me and said, \u201cBeing outside always makes me feel better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point I feel I should mention that, since I woke up this morning, I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that I shouldn\u2019t go outside.  It was like a part of me thought something was going to happen if I stepped out the door.  Looking down at Mackenzie, I said, \u201cI don\u2019t know, Mac; I\u2019m not really feeling it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on!\u201d grabbing my arm, Mackenzie said, \u201cIt\u2019s finally stopped raining, and mom says I can\u2019t go in the woods without you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knew enough to realize that Mackenzie wasn\u2019t going to stop until I agreed to go outside with her.  \u201cOkay fine, we\u2019ll go play some hide and seek in the woods.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYay!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie ran out the door into the backyard; I was about to follow her when I heard my cell phone ringing from upstairs.  Running upstairs, I grabbed it off my desk and saw that it was Eric calling.  He\u2019d spent the last month out in California with his Aunt and Uncle; his folks and Emily had flown out yesterday to bring him home.  Answering the phone, I said, \u201cHey man, what\u2019s up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing I noticed was Eric\u2019s voice sounded a little different; almost as if it was higher than it should\u2019ve been.  \u201cNot much; we\u2019re in Chicago waiting for our connecting flight.\u201d Taking a breath, Eric said, \u201cThere\u2019s something important I want to talk to you about; are you going to be home tonight?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, I don\u2019t have any plans.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cWhat\u2019s so important that you can\u2019t tell me over the phone?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d rather tell you in person.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cI\u2019m heading outside to play hide and seek with Mackenzie, but I\u2019ll be free tonight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, you\u2019re the best.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout an hour had passed since Mackenzie and I started playing hide and seek. We were taking turns being the seeker; it was currently Mackenzie\u2019s turn to search for me. She had just started counting and I was running to find a hiding spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments of searching, I found a small rock outcropping I could hide behind. I sat behind the outcropping for a few moments, listening as Mackenzie tried her best to find me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was watching some birds fly around overhead when I was suddenly overcome by an unbearably loud noise. I tried covering my ears in an attempt to drown it out, but it didn\u2019t work. I started feeling a little light-headed; the next thing I knew, I blacked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I woke up again, I found myself _____.</span></div></div>",

But even that knowledge wasn\u2019t enough to prepare me for the teenage girl standing in the doorway.  Her dark blonde hair was now brown, and down past her shoulders.  She was not at least a foot taller; with breasts and a figure to boot.  But there was no denying it; I knew it was her the moment she walked into the room.  \u201cMackenzie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout saying a word, Mackenzie ran over and practically jumped onto the bed in order to hug me.  I quickly reciprocated the hug; although I was more than a little disturbed by the feel of Mackenzie\u2019s breasts.  After hugging me for what seemed like an eternity, Mackenzie stepped back and looked at me.  \u201cHow is it possible you haven\u2019t aged a day in 6 years?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m as puzzled as you are, Mac.\u201d Squirming a little in bed, in an attempt to hide the erection I found myself with, I said, \u201cThe last thing I remember was the two of us playing hide and seek; the next thing I know, we\u2019re practically the same age.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot quite; I\u2019m actually 4 months older now.\u201d Wincing a little, Mackenzie said, \u201cI guess that makes me your older sister.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***********************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom and Mackenzie spent the next hour, interspersed with a few trips to the bathroom for Mom, catching me up on what I\u2019d missed.  It seems Mackenzie got worried when she hadn't seen me for 30 minutes; so she ran back to call Mom.  The police searched the area for months in the hopes of finding something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut alas they never found any trace of me.  In the meantime, Mom became involved with one of the detectives on my case; they ended up getting married a few years after I disappeared.  \u201cHenry\u2019s a great guy; I think you\u2019d like him, Brian.\u201d With a tinge of sadness, Mackenzie said, \u201cHe\u2019s been really supportive; helping mom and me after Dad died.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s everyone else been up to for the last 6 years?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Emily and I are on the cheerleading squad at school.\u201d Taking a breath, Mackenzie said, \u201cCarrie\u2019s attending college in New York; while Collin\u2019s at Penn State.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s great for them, I guess.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cWhat about Eric?  What\u2019s he been up to?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell Eric, he...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Mackenzie trailed off, I got worried that something had happened to Eric.  Looking at her, I said, \u201cMac, is Eric alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll simply say that things have changed with your friend, Brian.\u201d Looking at me, Mackenzie said, \u201cIt\u2019s not my place to say what; that\u2019s something for the two of you to talk about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay...\u201d confused, I said, \u201cDo they even know I\u2019m alive?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been in here with you for the last hour.\u201d With a bit of an attitude, Mackenzie said, \u201cWhen would we have had the chance to tell them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was more than a little put off by Mackenzie\u2019s sudden change in attitude.  \u201cGeez, I\u2019m sorry I asked.\u201d Looking at her, I said, <br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to bite my head off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Composing herself Mackenzie said, \u201cI\u2019ve been under a lot of stress lately; it just came out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom walked out of the bathroom at the point.  Looking at Mackenzie, she said, \u201cMackenzie, sweetie, why don\u2019t you head down to the car.  I\u2019ll be right there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Hugging me again, Mackenzie said, \u201cI\u2019m really glad you\u2019re back, Brian.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe too, Mac.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Mackenzie left the room, Mom turned to me and said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry for your sister\u2019s attitude just now.\u201d Sighing, Mom said, \u201cShe\u2019s had it rough the last couple weeks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t go into detail; suffice it to say, your sister is becoming a woman.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was a bit confused by that statement; until I suddenly realized what Mom meant.  Looking at her, I said, \u201cMac\u2019s having her period?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right; her first one.\u201d Sighing, Mom said, \u201cHer mood swings make the ones I experienced during my first trimester look tame by comparison.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for the warning, Mom,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, sweetie.\u201d Hugging me, or at least the best she could, Mom said, \u201cYou have no idea how happy I am that you\u2019re back; alive and well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow we just have to figure out why I\u2019m the same age I was when I disappeared.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s something we can work on tomorrow.\u201d Smiling, Mom said, \u201cYou should probably get some rest; we\u2019ll come by in the morning.\u201d </span></div></div>",

I've seen too many cases like yours end badly to look a gift horse in the mouth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad to be back too; even if I have a lot to catch up on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor came into the room at that moment.

I was feeling incredibly anxious about the prospect of seeing my friends again; wondering how they\u2019d changed and how they\u2019d react to seeing me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the nurse wheeled me into the conference room, I saw two people hanging around the table.  Even after six years, I instantly knew who they were; my friends Carrie and Collin.  Every one of them went silent when they realized I was in the room.  After a moment the silence became unbearable, so I said, \u201cHey guys.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCollin, who was no longer the short chubby kid I remembered, was the first to respond.  \u201cThis has to be some kind of joke, right?\u201d turning to my Mom, and Mac, he said, \u201cHe looks exactly the same as he did six years ago.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s really him, Collin.\u201d Pausing, Mom said, \u201cThe doctors ran a DNA test, and his fingerprints matched the ones the police had on file.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie was the next to step forward; giving me a chance to see just how little she\u2019d changed over the years.  She\u2019d always kept her hair short; to the point where she was often mistaken for a boy.  Her hair was just as short now, the only difference being that it was a light brown color now.  \u201cIf you\u2019re really Brian, then tell me something only he would know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll give it a shot.\u201d Looking at her, I said, \u201cWhen we were in 7th grade, you kissed me in the boy\u2019s locker room after school.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie\u2019s eyes went wide when I said that; while Collin laughed and said, \u201cYou kissed <i>him</i> in 7th grade?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking that Collin was teasing Carrie for kissing me, I said, \u201cWhat\u2019s the big deal if she kissed me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not what you think, Brian.\u201d With a chuckle, Carrie said, \u201cI\u2019m a lesbian; Collin\u2019s just teasing me because I kissed a boy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh.\u201d Turning to Collin, I said, \u201cSorry, I thought you meant something else.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright kiddo; you didn\u2019t know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoosing to ignore the kiddo comment, I said, \u201cWhere\u2019s Eric?  I thought he, of all people, would be here to see me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrie and Collin exchanged concerned looks with each other.  It looked as though they were about to say something; when the door to the conference room opened.  I turned to find two girls, one of whom I realized was Emily, standing in the doorway.  The other one looked familiar, but I couldn\u2019t figure out why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Emily just stared at me, in shock; the other girl came over and hugged me.  \u201cI-I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re really back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was put off by the fact that an unfamiliar girl was hugging me.  Gently pushing her away, I looked at her and said, \u201cDo I know you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl, resembling a slightly older version of Emily with bigger boobs, just stared at me for a moment.  Then a look of realization appeared on her face; as if a light bulb just went off.  \u201cBrian, you knew me as Eric.\u201d</span></div></div>",

My best friend was now a girl; and I had had no idea.  <i>Or had I?</i>  The more I thought about it, the more I realized there\u2019d always been something different about Eric.  Don\u2019t get me wrong; we both liked action movies and video games.  But he\u2019d always preferred horses to cars, and almost always dressed as female characters for Halloween.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was also the time that I\u2019d gone to visit him when he was home alone; only to see him, through the window, walking around the house in his sister Grace\u2019s cheerleading outfit. <i> What kind of friend was I, that I hadn\u2019t seen that?</i> \u201cA-Are you happy...Andrea?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m very happy, Brian.\u201d With a smile bigger than I\u2019d ever seen her make, she nodded and said, \u201cI\u2019m the real me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen I\u2019m happy for you, too; I just wish I\u2019d been there to help you through this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re here now, that\u2019s all that matters.\u201d Looking at me, with a smile, she said, \u201cPlus it would mean the world to me if you approved of my boyfriend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at that moment I realized she\u2019d gotten up and was standing next to Collin.  I put two and two together when I saw her take his hand in hers.  \u201cYou guys are dating?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, buddy.\u201d Kissing Collin on the cheek, Andrea said, \u201cWe\u2019ve been dating since sophomore year, and I\u2019ve never been happier.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I lost all the weight; I knew she needed someone strong to protect her.\u201d Smiling, Collin looked at me and said, \u201cI also wanted to prove that I was worthy of her.\u201d</span></div></div>",

It didn\u2019t matter to me that Collin was now 5 inches taller than me and could easily beat me up; I wanted to punch him for saying that.  Thankfully Andrea came over before anything happened.  \u201cBrian, he didn\u2019t mean it that way.\u201d <br>\r\nGlaring at Collin for a moment, Andrea turned back to me and said, \u201cYou were gone for so long, we have to get used to having you back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I guess you\u2019re right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what; your birthday is in two weeks,\u201d with a smile, Andrea said, \u201cI promise you we\u2019ll be there to celebrate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter everyone said their goodbyes, Mom and Henry walked them to the lobby; leaving me alone in the conference room.  I started to get a little lonely until the door opened and Emily walked into the room.  I was vaguely aware that she and Mac had left earlier to go off somewhere.  Gesturing to a bottle of soda in her hand, she said, \u201cHey Brian, I thought you might like a drink or something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, Em.\u201d Chuckling, I took the soda and said, \u201cIt\u2019s been 6 years since I had a soda.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI still can\u2019t believe you\u2019re back; even though I\u2019m looking right at you.\u201d Sitting next to me, Emily said, \u201cI keep expecting to wake up and find this was all just a dream.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA part of me wishes this was a dream; that I\u2019d wake up and realize I hadn\u2019t missed the last six years.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of us just sat at the conference table and talked; in that regard, it was as if six years hadn\u2019t passed since I last saw her.  The others used to tease me for it, but I was just at home hanging out with Emily as I was with them.  It was weird to think the teenage girl sitting next to me was the same one I taught how to wrestle when she was 6 years old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Emily I remembered could have easily passed herself off as a boy; I rarely, if ever, saw her wearing skirts or dresses.  That was no longer the case now; everything from her breasts to her budding figure screamed that she was a girl.  Her brown hair had gotten darker over the years and, instead of being shorter than Mackenzie, she looked as though she was only a few inches shorter than me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was weird to think of her that way, but I couldn\u2019t help but think she was attractive now.  At that moment I realized neither of us had said anything for a few minutes; we were just staring at each other.  After a moment, Emily said, \u201cIt feels weird to admit it, Brian...but I had a bit of a crush on you when we were...I mean when <i>I</i> was younger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at Emily, dumbfounded, for a second before saying, \u201cY-You did?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I just never said anything because of the age difference.\u201d With a smile, Emily said, \u201cBut here you are now, and somehow we\u2019re practically the same age.  How is something like that even possible?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour guess is as good as mine, Em.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cI\u2019d really like to know where I\u2019ve been the last six years, and why I haven\u2019t aged.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMackenzie came into the room at that moment; an annoyed look on her face.  For a moment I thought it was towards me, but instead, she looked at Emily and said, \u201cFinally! I\u2019ve been looking all over for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry Mac; I was talking with Brian.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell come on, Alicia\u2019s here to bring us to the mall.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry Brian, but it looks like I have to go too.\u201d  Emily stood up and hugged me, \u201cI\u2019ll see you later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee you later, Em.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Emily and Mac left the room, leaving me alone once again, I thought back to what Emily had said.  She had a crush on me years ago; was there anything stopping her from acting on it now?</span></div></div>",

As we got into the car, Henry looked back at me and said, \u201cSo Brian, what do you feel like doing first?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d Buckling my seatbelt, I said, \u201cCould we just drive around a bit?  I\u2019d love to see what\u2019s changed over the last six years.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t see why not.\u201d Glancing towards Mom, a grin on his face, Henry said, \u201cI suppose I\u2019d want to do the same thing if I were in your position.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo everything decided, Henry started the car and we left the hospital parking lot.  As we drove towards town, I figured the town wouldn\u2019t have changed that much in six years.  It was one of those small, historic towns in eastern Pennsylvania; it was a big deal when Costco decided to open a location on the outskirts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did I realize just how wrong I was \u2013 the town had changed a lot since I\u2019d disappeared.  For starters; an empty lot across from the elementary school had been turned into a condo complex and even the movie theater had gotten bigger.  I was a little disappointed to find that Easy Eats BBQ, my family\u2019s favorite restaurant, had closed down.  Other than that, the town had stayed relatively the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">****************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter driving around town for an hour, Mom announced that she had to use the bathroom.  Luckily for her, we were close to a Dairy Queen so we pulled into the parking lot.  While Mom waddled to the bathroom, Henry and I waited for her by the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was clear that we were both nervous around each other.  For me, I was still trying to process the fact that my mom had remarried while I was gone.  Henry, no doubt, was trying to figure out how to act around me.  After all, it had just been him, my mom and Mac, for the last few years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter neither of us had said anything for a few moments, Henry got up from the hood of the car and said, \u201cHow about I buy you some ice cream, Brian; then perhaps we could have a little talk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Looking at him, I said, \u201cTalk about what, exactly?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s obvious you\u2019re having trouble with the fact that I\u2019m here.\u201d Leading me towards the line, Henry said, \u201cI just figured we could talk; to reassure you that I\u2019m a good guy and that I have no intention of replacing your dad.\u201d</span></div></div>",

We were both in a fragile condition, but we helped each other through it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was starting to worry about where Henry was going with this.  Looking at him, as bluntly as I could, I said, \u201cWere you having an affair with my mom?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, at least not in the physical sense.\u201d Sighing, Henry said, \u201cYour mom was an emotional wreck; what with you missing and your father in the hospital.  With no one else to support her, I guess I became her source of emotional support.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI guess I couldn\u2019t really fault them for being there for each other, but hearing this dampened my opinion of Henry and my mom.  <br>\r\n\u201cHow soon after my dad died did you two become involved?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was close to a year before we started dating, but that doesn\u2019t mean I wasn\u2019t in the picture.\u201d Looking at me, Henry said, \u201cI helped your mom with housework, and even helped Mackenzie with her problems.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat kind of problems?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat your sister went through, I wouldn\u2019t wish on anyone; losing her brother and father in the span of a month.  I\u2019d be lying if I said she handled it well.\u201d Sighing, Henry said, \u201cShe was suspended from school several times for fighting, she got in trouble for stealing a bottle of soda from a gas station.  She\u2019d even wake up screaming in the middle of the night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sat at the table; trying to process what Henry had told me.  I had a hard time believing that the person Henry was describing was my sister.  The Mackenzie I knew was not the type to get into trouble.  \u201cDoes Mac still have those problems?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThankfully she\u2019s worked past those issues.\u201d Sighing, Henry said, \u201cNow she\u2019s just a 13-year-old girl; something that brings its own challenges.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose I should be grateful that you were here for them.\u201d Taking a breath, I said, \u201cStill, I wish my dad was still here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour father was a great man, Brian.\u201d Looking at me, placing a hand on my shoulder, Henry said, \u201cI want you to know that I have no intention of replacing him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don\u2019t know what came over me at that moment; but, without saying a word, I hugged Henry.  Henry returned the hug, and that was the position Mom found us in when she walked out of the bathroom.  \u201cI\u2019m glad to see you\u2019re both getting along.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was never going to be an issue.\u201d Getting up, Henry kissed Mom and said, \u201cBrian\u2019s a great kid; you did a great job raising him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, Henry.\u201d Smiling, turning to me, Mom said, \u201cSo, sweetie, what do you say we go home?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds like a plan to me.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I\u2019m not sure how I would\u2019ve felt had it been completely different.  As the three of us got out of the car, I could hear music playing in the backyard.  \u201cWhat\u2019s going on in the backyard?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably your sister.\u201d Grabbing her purse, Mom said, \u201cShe\u2019s probably lounging around the pool with Emily and Allison.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Pool?</i> \u201cWhen did you put in a pool?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe put it in a few years ago.\u201d Looking at me, Henry said, \u201cMost of your things are in storage; so if you want to use it, you\u2019ll have to borrow one of my swimsuits.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the three of us walked in through the garage, Mom said, \u201cYou may want to ask your sister if it\u2019s alright, first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t need her permission, Maureen.\u201d Sighing, Henry said, \u201cContrary to what she thinks, Mackenzie doesn\u2019t decide who uses the pool.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d Looking at me, Mom said, \u201cAt least go out and say hello first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked through the kitchen to the backdoor; opening it to find the back deck had been expanded around a decent size in-ground pool.  I was so focused on the pool, I barely heard Mackenzie when she said, \u201cOh God, what are you doing here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI guess Henry hadn\u2019t been joking when he said Mackenzie was now a typical teenage girl.  I was amazed by the 180 she\u2019d taken since yesterday; going from being thrilled I was back to annoyed that I was in the same room as her.  \u201cMom and Henry said that I should check out the pool, so that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I turned my attention to Mac, Emily and who I could only assume was Allison; I was taken aback by their appearance.  If I\u2019d been having trouble accepting the fact that my kid sister and her best friend were now teenagers, seeing them in bikinis wasn\u2019t helping me any.  \u201cFine, just don\u2019t bother us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllison, a cute looking blonde girl, looked at me in confusion.  \u201cWho is that, Mac?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat would be my <i>little</i> brother; the one who was missing for 6 years.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tried my best to hide my annoyance over the emphasis Mac put on the word little.  Thankfully, before I could say something I'd regret, Allison spoke up.  \u201cWait, he\u2019s the one whose picture you have on your desk?\u201d looking at me, Allison said, \u201cIf he\u2019s been missing for six years, how does he look the same as in the photo?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo one knows.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was getting a little put off by Mac\u2019s attitude; so after introducing myself to Allison, I quickly turned around and walked back into the house.  I barely made it into the kitchen before I heard someone call my name, \u201cBrian, wait!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned around to find Emily coming towards me; giving me an up-close look at her in a bikini.  \u201cHey Em, y-you like great in that bathing suit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI swear I caught a brief glimpse of Emily blushing; before she said, \u201cThanks.\u201d Looking at me, she said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry about Em; she had a rough morning, don\u2019t take it personally.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard not to take it personally when I come back after six years and my sister wants nothing to do with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know how teenagers can be; one minute they\u2019re all happy, the next minute they\u2019re all doom and gloom.\u201d Smiling, Emily said, <br>\r\n\u201cIf it makes you feel any better, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I wonder if Emily still has that crush on me.</i> \u201cThanks, Em, that does make me feel better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you get put on a suit and come join us?\u201d</span></div></div>",

The first I did was a running jump into the pool; inadvertently splashing Mac and the others in the process.  That got me a glare from Mac, but smiles from Allison and Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking a few laps in the pool, I returned to the deep end to find Allison and Emily sitting on the edge with their feet in the water.  As I went over to them, Allison said, \u201cSo what\u2019s the weirdest change you\u2019ve noticed since being back?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean aside from my mom being pregnant, and my sister being four months older than me?\u201d with a chuckle, I said, \u201cHonestly, I\u2019m still trying to process the fact that I disappeared for six years.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of us spent the next 20 minutes or so talking.  Despite my best efforts, I occasionally found myself staring at Allison and Emily\u2019s chests.  I tried to look away, but I honestly couldn\u2019t stop myself; both of them were quite good looking.  Given Emily\u2019s revelation about her crush on me, I wasn\u2019t surprised to find her staring at me; I was surprised, however, to find Allison staring at me too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t look half bad in that suit, Brian.\u201d Looking at me, Allison said, \u201cI\u2019ll bet you had girls breaking down the fence for a chance to see you, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, not really.\u201d My face turning red from embarrassment, I said, \u201cThe pool didn\u2019t get put in until after I disappeared, so...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could finish my sentence, I was interrupted by Emily forcibly clearing her throat.  \u201cBrian, could you bring us some drinks, please?\u201d staring angrily at Allison, Emily said, \u201c<i>Some</i> of us need to cool off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, okay.\u201d Climbing out of the pool, barely noticing the glares I was getting from Mac, I said, \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I walked back towards the kitchen, I heard Emily say, \u201cStop flirting with him, Allison; I told you how I felt about him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stopped around the corner, out of sight, so I could hear Allison\u2019s response.  \u201cSorry Em, it\u2019s just he\u2019s <i>really</i> cute.  You might have some competition.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA big grin appeared on my face as I walked into the kitchen.

I followed the girls into the house to say my goodbyes.  After saying goodbye to Mac, Allison went a little overboard with her goodbye to me \u2013 giving me a peck on the cheek.  <br>\r\nBoth Emily and Mac glared at her as a result, although I suspected it was for different reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily\u2019s goodbye was a little more subdued; as she gave me a hug, she said, \u201cI\u2019m really glad you\u2019re back, Brian.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe too, Em.\u201d Hugging her, I said, \u201cI\u2019ll see you later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Mac and I waved goodbye to them, as they walked down the sidewalk, Mac closed the door.  I started heading towards the kitchen to make a sandwich when she suddenly spun me around and shoved me against the wall.

I stood there in stunned silence, trying to process what just happened.  I don\u2019t know what happened to make her that way, but <i>that</i> was not the Mackenzie I remembered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was still standing in the hallway, a few minutes later, when the front door opened.

My stomach sank with that knowledge. I should be 19 years old. All of my friends were 19 years old. Would they accept me? Would they even want to hang out with a 13 year old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd what did Mackenzie mean about Eric? </span></div></div>",

I love you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Mackenzie hung up the phone, I looked at her and said, \u201cWho was that on the phone?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat would be my husband, Duncan,\u201d putting her phone away, Mackenzie said, \u201cI think you\u2019d like him; he\u2019s a lot like Dad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at that point I realized, with everything going on, that I hadn\u2019t thought about Mom and Dad. \u201cHow are Mom and Dad?\u201d looking at her, I said, \u201cDo they know I\u2019m alive?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI tried to call Mom, but I got her voicemail.\u201d Taking a deep breath, Mackenzie sat down and said, \u201cDad, unfortunately, died about a month after you disappeared.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I woke up a few hours later, just before midnight, to find that I was still in the hospital room.  For a brief moment, I was concerned that more time had passed for me, but a quick look to my right showed Mackenzie asleep on a nearby chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don\u2019t know how much time went by as I lay there in bed; simply staring at Mackenzie as she slept.  I was still having a hard time wrapping my head around the fact that the woman before me was my little sister.  Guess I can\u2019t really call her my little sister anymore. She\u2019s old enough to be my mom now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter listening to her bringing me up to speed on everything I\u2019d missed over the last 27 years, I couldn\u2019t help but feel upset about it.  Collin was married to a woman named Andrea; with whom he had two 17-year-old kids.  Carrie was married to a woman, which surprised me, and lived in Maryland with her wife and 7-year-old daughter.  Emily's married and has a 13-year-old daughter; who Mac thought I was would get along with.  I was a little confused about why Mackenzie didn\u2019t tell me about Eric; despite my begging her to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was disappointed to miss all of that, but none of it came close to me missing my dad\u2019s funeral.  It seemed he\u2019d died about a month after I vanished.  It was just Mac and Mom for a while; until Mom eventually married one of the detectives on my case.  It seemed I had a half-brother now; Aaron was 21 years old and a junior in college.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat brought me back to Mackenzie; I\u2019d already learned she had three kids of her own.  She went on to explain that she\u2019d gotten her master\u2019s degree in accounting and was one of the senior accountants for a major financial firm in Philadelphia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that point I realized I had to use the bathroom so, as quietly as I could, I climbed out of bed.  Mac must\u2019ve had ears like a hawk because I barely got out of bed before she woke up and looked at me.  \u201cHey, can\u2019t sleep?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot really; trying to process everything.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to wake you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry; it comes with being a mom.\u201d Chuckling, she said, \u201cWhen Marcus was little, he used to have terrible nightmares.  It got to the point where I\u2019d wake up the moment he started screaming.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI still can\u2019t believe that you\u2019re a mom, Mac.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy\u2019s it so difficult to believe?\u201d looking at me, she said, \u201cWhen a mom and dad love each other, they...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you seriously giving me the birds and the bees talk?\u201d chuckling, I said, \u201cMac, Dad gave me that talk when I was 11.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry; Megan\u2019s at the age where she\u2019s curious about where babies come from.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s no big deal.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cNow if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019m going to use the bathroom now.\u201d</span></div></div>",
