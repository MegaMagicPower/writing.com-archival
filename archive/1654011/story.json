        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">This is a Super Mario Story where anything goes. Note: THIS IS BASED ON THE MOVIE NOT THE GAME! IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE MOVIE DO NOT POST/DO NOT BITCH ABOUT THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO.<br>\r\nJust to explain a bit for you who have not seen but want to post.<br>\r\n1) Mario and Luigi are a pair of plumbers from the Bronx.<br>\r\n2) Princess Daisy (as well as all the denizens of the Mushroom kingdom) are humans that have descended from the dinosaurs and other reptiles.<br>\r\n3) Goombas and Koopa-troopers are victims of a De-evolution process by the Evil King Koopa (who was turned to primordial sludge by Mario and Luigi at the end of the movie but hey...law of the sequels.)<br>\r\n4) It is Dinosaurland not the Mushroom kingdom.<br>\r\n5) There is the city, and a desert. That's it.<br>\r\n6) Princess Peach was not revealed in the movie; Mario also already had a girlfriend, a tanning salonist named Daniella.<br>\r\n7) Yoshi is not big enough to ride, he is about the size of a medium dog.<br>\r\n8) Yoshi is a \"throwback\" meaning he is a naturally occurring de-evolved being (like if a woman gave birth to a monkey). He has a certain degree of intelligence but is mainly bestial in nature (he is the Royal pet.)<br>\r\n9) The high jumps are due to some kind of rocket boots.<br>\r\n10) the mushrooms were never actually eaten (They were Daisy's father de-evolved.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you break these rules you will suffer.</td>",
