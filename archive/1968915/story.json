The shards of stars that fall here are known as Moon Stones.\" <br>\r\n- The Official Guide to Mt. Moon<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Machoke, the Superpower Pok\u00e9mon, was a creature of habit. Every day, he went to a certain spot near the mountain top to train its body, from high noon until well after the sun had set. Every day, he drew a small crowd of younger Pok\u00e9mon, curious and in awe of the Fighting-type's strength. Every night, before Machoke went back down the mountain, he sat with the Pok\u00e9mon and watched the nightly meteor showers. A couple of the smaller ones sat on his robust shoulders, eager to watch the show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Tonight seemed like any other night. The Pok\u00e9mon sat together for the meteor shower, excited. Machoke picked up a pair of Cleffa and let them sit on his shoulders. They blushed slightly as they hugged his neck. Grinning, he looked toward the sky, as the meteor shower began. Knowing from experience that the falling stars seldom dropped in this particular area, he felt sure that the group would be safe yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n None of them knew he would be wrong this night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n High above them, a meteor had entered the atmosphere. This wasn't just any ordinary meteor, however. It had come from several galaxies away, and had collected the power of countless stars and suns. It had spent many years in space, just floating and absorbing energy. Finally, its seemingly endless voyage had come to an end. As the Earth's gravity pulled on it, the massive rock began to split into many pieces, each one falling toward a different direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n One such piece was heading towards the group of Pok\u00e9mon. All but the fearless Machoke fled from the approaching meteorite, who stood fearlessly, watching, waiting. The meteorite soon landed nearby, about 100 feet away from the Fighting-type. He waited a minute before approaching it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The meteorite was about the size of a Machop, and glowed with a faint aura. Machoke hesitated before picking the rock up, unsure of what to do with it. Less than a minute passed before the strange stone began glowing with a fierce blue light, and an even stranger feeling embraced the Pok\u00e9mon's body! He dropped it and doubled over in an odd mixture of pain and ecstasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n All over, his skin and muscles began tingling. He watched in surprise, as his great muscles began to visibly grow even bigger under his gray skin! Machoke grunted, as all over, his muscles inflated until they doubled in size and strength. His height had mysteriously increased as well, making him just over six feet tall. Another bout of growth caused his great muscles to grow yet again, until his biceps alone were bigger than his head! The power belt he usually wore around his waist fell off, revealing a rock-hard set of eight abdominal muscles, with matching oblique muscles running along his sides. Without the belt to restrain his strength, his muscles grew yet again, causing him to grow another half a foot. His tree-trunk thighs were becoming thicker than a normal Machoke's chest, as his pectoral muscles became the size of small boulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n A grunt of ecstasy escaped Machoke's throat, as he felt his lower regions stir. The size of his pecs preventing him from easily looking, he sat down on a rock, which helped somewhat, and looked down. The black shorts that the Pok\u00e9mon usually wore were being stretched by his growing groin, until with a large RRIIIIPPPP, they finally tore in two, allowing his mighty member to hang out, resting atop a pair of testicles larger than the legendary Master Ball. Machoke moaned, watching as his member lengthened and thickened until it hung down almost to his knees and almost as thick as his forearms used to be. He couldn't help but begin to stroke it, savoring the ecstatic feeling. It grew a little more as if in response, finally reaching his knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Flexing his gigantic biceps on his free arm, he continued to stroke his member, admiring his new strength and dexterity. He flexed his pecs a few times, watching as they became harder than any Rock or Steel-type. Why, with the new strength in his entire body, he could probably defeat any Legendary! After ten minutes of admiration and masturbation, his balls began to burn, and some pre-cum dribbled out. Before long, a small river flowed from his prestigious member, causing a small bout of growth to happen, leaving the Superpower Pok\u00e9mon at seven feet tall and over 500 pounds of pure muscle. Flexing his entire body at once, he came again, and finally passed out in bliss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The rest of the meteor fragments fell elsewhere, waiting to be found...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho finds a piece? (For the record, multiple people can grow at once.)</span></div></div>",

There was even a reward offered for anyone that found a piece and brought it to a pokemon center so that it could be studied.  The Machoke--which was a wild pokemon--was quickly called \"The Mt. Moon Machoke\" was featured in the news also.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                      \"What kind of a reward are they offering?\" asked Ash.   \"does anybody know?\"<br>\r\n                      \"Probably a ton of money\" replied his mother, Delia.<br>\r\n                        Ash was at his home in Pallet taking a little break from his journey.  He had woken up, heard all about the strange meteorite that broke apart and wanted to go look for a piece right away.  It was Delia that had talked him into having breakfast first so Ash was eating away from a plate filled with food.  Pikachu, Ash's ever-faithful friend, was having breakfast too...although it was Pokemon food in his case.   Delia had stacked Ash's plate filled with all kinds of breakfast foods; pancakes, eggs, bacon, toast, etc.  Delia knew that Ash was a big eater and was quite happy to cook her son a large breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                    Ten minutes later, Ash  had finished up his breakfast and was out in search for a piece of that meteorite.  After looking all over in Pallet Town, Ash decided to look for it elsewhere so he left his hometown.  It didn't take long until Ash met up with a friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                            \"Good morning, Misty\" said Ash.  \"heard the news?\"<br>\r\n                           \"Like who hasn't\" said Misty rolling her eyes.   \"I've been looking everywhere too\" <br>\r\n                            <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                           The two friends were making their way towards Pewter City.<br>\r\n                             \"I wonder where Brock is\" said Ash.<br>\r\n                            \"Probably taking care of his brothers and sisters\" said Misty.   \"if not in his gym\"<br>\r\n                             \"More than lik...\" started Ash when he tripped on a rock in the middle of the road.  Ash landed with a loud thud on the ground and glanced back to see that he had tripped over a large glowing rock.  The rock was slightly bigger than a bowling ball and it emitted a light blue glow.   It didn't take Ash long to realize that the rock must be a piece of that meteorite.<br>\r\n                               \"I say we just found a piece\" said Ash, getting back up from the ground and reached for the piece before Misty could stop him.  Ash picked up the rock.  It was quite heavy in his hands.  In fact he was barely able to lift it.  For a moment nothing happened.  Then Ash felt a tingling all over his body.   And then Ash's biceps doubled in size and muscle!   It wasn't long before the rest of Ash's body was growing...not in weight but in muscle.   His biceps kept growing until they had quadrupled in size!  He was also gaining height as his muscles grew.   And then Ash felt a tingling in his crotch.  His clothes started to rip as his pecs gained in width and size.   He now sported eight-pack abs.   His pants burst apart thanks to his legs growing longer and thicker than tree trunks.  The last clothing to go with his underwear as his member grew until it reached his knees.   Misty quickly looked away at her friend as he started to stroke his member.   The rest of his clothing was torn to shreds.   Ash continued to stroke his hardened member until he climaxed, sending a small river of love juices all over the ground.  <br>\r\n                 During all of this, Pikachu was looking at Ash with wide eyes on the ground.  <br>\r\n                  Ash was now a little over eight feet tall and he had the body of a god; all of his muscles had increased at least three times their normal size!  His biceps were thicker than tree trunks. The piece of the meteorite became light as a feather to Ash.<br>\r\n                     \"Whoa..\" said Ash, coming off his orgasmic high.   \"what a rush\"<br>\r\n                       \"I'd say\" said Misty turning around to look at her sculpted friend.  She tried her best to avert her eyes from his member but it was hard not to look at it.  <br>\r\n                       \"Wanna hold this?\" asked Ash, offering the piece of meteorite to Misty, a smile tugging at the corners of his mouth.  </span></div></div>",

Pikachu\u2019s legs started to lengthen as they started to look like human legs. Same thing for his arms. He used to not have anything between his legs but that soon changes as a bulge started to appear. His arms were rapidly getting bigger and bigger and so were his legs. He was now about 6 feet tall. His mid section started growing as well. 4 pairs of chiseled abs appear under his skin. His chest swelled into giant slabs of meat that started to block his vision. His back widens as his shoulders get bigger. Pikachu\u2019s small bulge starts to expand. A few seconds later, that small junk was now a massive god like wiener. <br>\r\n\u201cPikachu...\u201d Moaned the Pok\u00e9mon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty stared at her two god like companion and had trouble not to drool. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew what to do<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe...</span></div></div>",

He wasn't really sure where he was going but he just trying to get out. He then took a big leap to try and cover more ground.  When Ash had landed, he found himself just in front of Mt. Moon. It took a minute but Ash realized he jumped straight over  Pewter City.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You Ash?\" A voice from behind said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh turned around and saw no one but what he assumed was the Mt.

Ash looked and saw the cave was well lit. in the center of it all was a meteorite just like ash's. \"Wow...\" ash starred. \"so these things made us grow?\" \"yeah\" machoke nodded. He picked up his meteorite. \"hm... what do you think would happen if the meteorites touched each other?\" Ash asked.

They were both then surprised by the familiar tingling over their bodies. Instead of doubling over, they were unable to move. They knew they both growing but didn't know by how much. After about 15 minutes, the pain slowly subsided.  As they set the meteorite down, they finally noticed what the meteorite had given them. They both stood two feet taller, their pecs grew to the point where Ash and Machoke could no longer see past them, they each gained an extra two sets of abs, their biceps and legs got that much thicker, their testicles doubled in size and their completely hard cocks reached just under the pecs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that was amazing.\" Ash said panting<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you like it.\" the meteorite said \"I was worried you wouldn't be accepting of this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now why would you think that?\" Machoke asked as he flexed his new body<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because the sizes you are at now, are the average size for people your age on my original planet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?!\" Ash said pretty surprised</span></div></div>",

His face got a little red after noticing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you don't want me to, I won't look.\" Machoke said as he started to get up. Ash then grabbed his arm forcing him back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something wrong?\" Machoke asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about we helped each other out?\" Ash blurted out of nowhere<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you have in mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh then got up, stood over Machoke's cock, spread his butt out and slowly put himself on Machoke's cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure about this? You don't look like the type who has done this a lot\" Machoke asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure.\" Ash said with a determined look on his face<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a few moments, Machoke let out some precum making Ash's ride a little bit easier. He made it a few inches down Machoke's cock, before his ass felt pretty filled from it.  At that point, Ash took his hand off his ass and put them on Machoke's shoulders for some support. Ash then started to move up and down Machoke's cock more quickly. As Ash was doing this, he felt his own cock release some precum. Immediately after that, Ash felt a bit a pressure on his cock. He looked up to see Machoke was pushing his pecs on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want me to stop?\" Machoke asked <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!\" Ash replied back<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then picked up the pace even more, making it down Machoke's cock just a little bit more. It wasn't long before they both felt something familiar in their cocks. Machoke was the first to cum, sending a couple of spurts into Ash's ass, making him moan with each one that entered him. It wasn't long before Ash let his own load unto Machoke's chin and chest, along with a little onto his own chest, letting out his loudest and longest moan yet. Machoke then stopped pushing his pecs on Ash's cock and he slowly got off the Pokemon's huge member.  Ash then lay flat on his back on the cave floor, letting Machoke's sperm slowly leak out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for suggesting this.\" Machoke said rubbing Ash's cum over his chest.</span></div></div>",

So this is what an afterglow feels like, he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMachoke sat down beside him. He placed a hand on Ash's shoulder and regarded him with a warm smile. Ash smiled back and sighed in contentment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the afterglow died down, though, Ash's thoughts turned to what they'd just done. He frowned. \"It's so weird...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\" Machoke tilted his head slightly. \"What is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never even thought about-\" he blushed, paused to consider his words \"-doing <i>that</i> with anyone before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? But you're the one-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. But I swear I wasn't even thinking about it till I already offered. And even then, I didn't care I was doing it with another guy or even a Pok\u00e9mon. I just...did it. And liked it. And I should be weirded out by that, and I guess I kind of am, but kind of not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...\" Machoke looked away, nodded to himself. \"You're right, that is weird.\" His free hand came up to his chin while the one on Ash's shoulder tightened its grip. After a moment, he added, \"It's kinda the same for me, I think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I'd never considered mating with a human before-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh's blush deepened at the mention of mating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-but when you offered, all I cared about was if you could handle me. I didn't even think about that stuff you mentioned till you, y'know, mentioned it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence fell. Ash turned to the pair of meteorites beside him, thoughts racing. If they were able to change his and Machoke's bodies so drastically, then... Hm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanna wash up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlong with the spunk decorating his chest and spilling out his ass, sweat and dirt mixed together and left him feeling clammy all over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" Machoke pulled his hand off Ash's shoulder and stood up. \"Follow me. I know a place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh sat up as Machoke strutted his way over to a boulder, smaller than the one outside, that sat at the far side of the cave. The light played off Machoke's body quite nicely. It highlighted the curvature of his muscles, not to mention that shapely ass...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh shook his head, stood up and hurried over. Machoke shoved the boulder aside with a single hand, revealing a passageway. \"Should think about getting a bigger one,\" he said. \"Feels practically weightless now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe passage was a bit narrow, forcing Ash to follow right behind. Again, he found himself eyeing up his new...friend? Mate? What exactly were they? Things were happening way too fast...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing Ash noticed was how easily and gracefully Machoke carried his bulk. And come to think of it, so did Ash. For someone who transformed into a massive stud just a little while ago, he could walk as though he'd always been this size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thoughts returned to the meteorites. No doubt Machoke's gave him the ability to speak human. Partially a physical ability, yes, but it also took knowledge. Not to mention he didn't struggle with enunciation or grammar or anything like that. Taken at surface value, one could just see it as the meteorite preparing him for Ash's arrival. But considering their spur of the moment...er, \"session,\" and their rather blase reaction to the whole affair, their changes had to be beyond the physical level. What did the meteorites do to them? Why did they bring him and Machoke together? Would everyone who found a piece come here? What was the goal here, some sort of tribe of super buff humans and Pok\u00e9mon? Or something else...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, here we are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh snapped back to awareness. Apparently, he'd been so lost in thought he hadn't even noticed they'd exited the passageway. Or heard the waterfall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning, Machoke stepped aside as Ash came forward to take in the sight before him. The narrow waterfall poured down from somewhere high up. At its base was a pond, and a surprisingly small one at that. In fact, closer inspection revealed the whole room was on the small side. Smaller than the one they were in before, at least. It gave the place a sort of intimate feel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, where did that last thought come from?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh pushed it aside. \"I never knew Mt. Moon had an underground waterfall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most don't, I bet,\" Machoke replied. \"Never seen anyone besides me in here. Well, until now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it's your secret spot?\" Ash asked, turning to him. \"And you're okay with sharing it with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMachoke shrugged, chuckling. \"Uh, sure? It's not like it's super personal or anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" Ash gave a chuckle of his own as he rubbed the back of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I just come here to wash up after a good workout.\" Machoke glanced down at his chest, then over at Ash's. \"You mind if I join you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, go ahead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo they stepped into the pond, shivering at how cold the water was. Ash splashed some water onto his chest a few times, shivered again, then rubbed off some of the cum. A bit of it was stuck in the ridges between his pecs and abs. He drew a finger through them, stopped to stare at the cum for a moment, then shook it off into the pond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis gaze wandered over to Machoke, whom rubbed his own chest with water. Machoke's hands lingered on his pecs while his expression turned pensive. He acted pretty flippant, but for all Ash knew he could be just as concerned about their current situation, or at least tried to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the darnedest thing: No matter how hard Ash tried to ponder and fret over things, he couldn't manage anything above mild concern. It felt like some mental roadblock kept him from feeling anything stronger than a mild \"huh.\" Could've been the meteorite's influence, or it could've been his past experiences making him more accepting. One could only take so many years of strange and crazy adventures before growing numb to it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMachoke met his gaze and flashed a grin. His eyes wandered over Ash's body for a moment before he returned to washing himself. Ash watched him for another moment, then shrugged and went over to the waterfall. It roared in his ears. He felt soaked just looking at it... Though that was probably just the mist it was spraying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heavy force of the water pushed down on him, yet he somehow found it easy to tolerate. Another perk of having such a big, strong body. It was cold, though. Freezing. He could only stand under it for a few seconds before he had to get out. He hugged himself, his whole body shivering uncontrollably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" he stammered through chattering teeth, \"I think I'm clean now.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ash heard a laugh. He turned to see Machoke doubled over as he busted a gut. If his teeth weren't still chattering, Ash would have pouted. But he couldn't so he settled for glaring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why'd ya do that?!\" Machoke asked, his voice full of mirth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just trying to clean off,\" Ash muttered. The response was too quiet for Machoke to hear, but that was the point; he would just laugh even harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ash continued to shiver and rub himself, his glared softened to a regular stare. It was hard to stay mad when what he did was pretty stupid. Of course the waterfall was cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut more than that, his attention was shifting to...other things. His eyes started tracing the curves and ridges of Machoke's muscles, the wetness really bringing out their definition. They seemed to lead Ash's eyes downward, from the neck to the chest to the abs. Everything below the waist disappeared into the pond's surface. If Machoke stood up straight at least the base of his member would be exposed, like Ash's was (though it was a bit more than the base due to the extra foot of height).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh could easily picture both of them growing erect again, their heads rising above the surface as they begged for release again And they would reach for each other's-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe caught himself, shook his head. \"Don't fantasize about a Pok\u00e9mon...\" It was bad enough they'd gone a good few steps beyond mutual masturbation. It was worse that Ash had to make a conscious effort to stop thinking about his sudden attraction to the sexy beefcake of a Pok\u00e9mon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd to not think of said Pok\u00e9mon as a \"sexy beefcake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh snapped out of his thoughts. He realized he was still staring a Machoke, whom had an apologetic smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...?\" Ash blinked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMachoke rubbed his neck. \"Y'know, me laughing at you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a moment to remember what Machoke was referring to. \"Oh, well, it's no big deal,\" Ash said. He would have given a dismissive wave of his hand, but he just remembered he was still cold and continued to rub himself. \"It was pretty stupid of me. I would've laughed too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still.\" Machoke waded over to Ash and put an arm around his waist. \"C'mon, how 'bout we get out? I'll help you warm up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh nodded and let Machoke guide him to the shore. Once they were on land, he started rubbing his thighs. As he did, he couldn't help but marvel at how firm and powerful they felt. They could crush a watermelon with just a simple flex. His member was still flaccid and he thanked Arceus his earlier thoughts didn't make him chub up. As he was now, he doubted even the coldest water could prevent an erection. Every other part of his new body was powerful, so it wouldn't be too out there for him to have developed a resilience to shrinkage as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, it would be, but not in the context of this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lemme help,\" Machoke said. He knelt down and rubbed Ash's calves. Ash took a little more pleasure in the touch than he liked to admit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTogether, they dried Ash's legs and warmed them up to a much more tolerable temperature. Their rubbing moved upwards to the torso, Ash covering his front while Machoke got the back. Ash pretended not to notice the times Machoke grazed the top of his butt. Once that was done he stopped and let Machoke take care of his arms. A few gropes here and there, but he accepted those as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Machoke got to his shoulders, however, it became less like rubbing and more like a massage. Firm, but not painful. It felt nice. Ash had to remind himself he should probably protest. He looked back at Machoke questioningly and got a smile in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feel good?\" Machoke asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh considered telling him to stop, but just said \"Yeah,\" and left it at that. It was a nice gesture, after all. Felt nice too, despite Machoke still being wet. \"Don't you want to dry off too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I'm good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh... Okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe massaging went on for a little while. How long, they couldn't say. Might have been minutes. Might have been an hour. Maybe even two. It didn't matter to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey stayed silent for a while. A few times during that silence it occurred to Ash he should be worrying about...well, a lot of things. If he would ever return to normal. What to do if he never did. How to handle his sex drive. If he would grow any bigger. His friends. His dreams. The meteorite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he couldn't bring himself to worry about any of it. He couldn't even worry about his lack of worry. He just wanted to enjoy this moment with Machoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the massage slowed to a stop, though they stayed silent. Machoke moved closer and embraced Ash from behind, wrapping his arms around the waist and intertwining his fingers. Ash laid his hand on them but didn't pull them off. Part of him felt they shouldn't be doing this, but another part saw no problem with it. So he savored the embrace, and found himself especially enjoying the way Machoke's chest pressed into his back. Still a little wet, but he didn't mind it that much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt occurred to him that, were their heights reversed or at least the same, he would have felt Machoke's manhood between his ass cheeks. It made that strange new lustful part of him consider squatting a little to do just that. Maybe rub it a little, get Machoke in the mood for another round so he can ram that long, girthy, <i>throbbing</i> cock up-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh bit his lip. He felt a twitch between his legs. Bad enough he was thinking perverse thoughts about a Pok\u00e9mon again, but while they were having such a nice moment? And yet, somehow, it felt like he needed to convince himself it was bad. As if him lusting after a Machoke was perfectly natural and his nagging doubts that he dwelled on (or tried to) were the weird thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You a trainer?\" Machoke's voice was soft, as though he were hesitant to break the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm?\" Ash was thankful for the distraction. \"Oh, yeah. I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool. You been to a lot of places?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup. I've been just about everywhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. meet any good Pok\u00e9mon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup,\" Ash said again. He wanted to leave it at that, but found himself adding, \"None of them like you though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I'm special, huh.\" Machoke tightened his embrace, nuzzled into the back of Ash's neck. \"Good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh wasn't sure how to respond to that, so he decided to change topics. \"Have any trainers ever tried to catch you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMachoke hummed in thought. \"Nope. Not that I can remember, anyway. I stick around the more offbeat parts, so I almost never see trainers. Come to think of it, you're probably the first human in general I've met face to face.\" He chuckled. \"Guess you're special too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain Ash couldn't think of a response. What did that mean, exactly?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lull in the conversation. They basked in the moment, all quiet save for the waterfall behind them. Peaceful. Intimate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... That word again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite their shared body warmth, the cave's cool humidity started to bother Ash after a while. Plus being hugged from behind for so long was getting awkward. Or at least, he felt it should be awkward by now. So he spoke up. \"Hey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\" Machoke lifted his head. \"What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm kinda starting to miss the sunlight. Do you mind if we go outside? We can keep doing this if you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't plan on adding that last part; it just came out of his mouth without thinking. Still, he couldn't exactly deny enjoying Machoke's hug at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Machoke replied, \"let's go.\" Though it took him a moment before he let go. Patting Ash's lower back--and noticeably close to his ass--he walked ahead and into the passage. Ash stayed and watched a moment, his eyes drawn to Machoke's shifting back muscles, before following.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir journey back through the passage went the same as the first. Machoke led the way while Ash followed behind and pondered their current situation. Though in this case, Ash found himself dwelling on Machoke's behavior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot once during his travels had he ever come across a Machoke that made physical contact with anyone like that, even with their own trainer if they had one. Never one willing to have sex with a human either. Then again, who ever heard of a Machoke that massively ripped, or tall. Or hung. Very hung. Come to think of it, Ash really shouldn't have been able to take such a massive cock, especially without any safety measures taken beforehand. Another one of the meteorite's changes, evidently. At least that meant Machoke should be able to handle taking it up the ass himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that they should be doing that, Ash reminded himself. They shouldn't have even done it in the first place. Yes, he was the one to suggest they have sex, but that just made it all more important he cut things off before they got weird. Well, weirder. And yet...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet it took a conscious effort to keep himself from ogling. Every time he dared to let his eyes wander, they came back to Machoke. They'd start at the neck and trace the muscles down the back before lingering on that ass. And the longer they lingered, the more those perverse thoughts would wriggle their way into Ash's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped a split second before crashing into Machoke. They'd reached the end of the passage, and Machoke was opening the entrance back into the room with the meteorites. Machoke went in, Ash followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh glanced at the pair of meteorites as he passed them by. So many questions, without any answers he could only keep asking them in the hope those apparently sentient space rocks would explain what their deal was. And <i>still</i> he couldn't muster up anything even close to resembling concern....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Broad daylight was such a relief after spending so long in the cave. The sun's position suggested it was still late morning. It felt like more than that. Ash stretched, basking in the sunlight as Machoke reblocked the entrance. \"I bet I could move that thing,\" he thought aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, definitely,\" Machoke replied. He stood alongside Ash and stretched as well. \"I'd love to see you strut your stuff, big guy. Show off the goods.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I kind of already am.\" Ash looked down at his naked self. A thought occured and he scanned the area. No trails. \"Uh, which side of the mountain are we on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The trail I see travelers always using's a good ways that way-\" Machoke pointed his thumb to one side \"-so about...halfway to the other side from there. Maybe a bit more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo they didn't have to worry about exposing themselves to any unsuspecting travelers. For the most part. But that didn't account for any prying eyes from the more adventurous types. Speaking of which...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But haven't you seen anybody snooping around the mountain today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMachoke gave a questioning look. \"No, why? Am I famous now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty much.\" Ash glanced at some trees in the distance. \"I think I heard access to this place got cut off. Something about experts needing time to study the 'Mt. Moon Machoke'. That's what people are calling you, by the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh,\" was all Machoke had to say about that, and he resumed stretching. Ash watched him, noting the ways his muscles shifted and tensed. After a bit, Machoke said, \"Well if the belt fits... I mean, mine doesn't anymore but y'know. Anyway-\" he stopped stretching and wrapped an arm around Ash's shoulder \"-shall we pick up where we left off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Ash could respond, Machoke nudged him back in the direction of the cave entrance. He gave a questioning look. \"We're going back in already?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMachoke chuckled. \"Nah, not yet. I just had an idea to make it a little nicer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nicer?\" What could be nicer than a hug from behind? Some ideas crossed Ash's mind, just about all of them perverse in some way. He hoped Machoke wouldn't notice his cock's subtle throbbing. Yet at the same time-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, no, <i>stop.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey reached the mountain's base, standing to one side of the boulder blocking the entrance. Machoke removed his arm from Ash's shoulders and sat down with his back against the mountain. He looked up and pat the space next to him. It took a moment, but Ash realized the gesture's meaning and sat down as well. Much like walking, it was a surprisingly fluid motion, no struggling with his bulk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could ask why they were sitting now, Machoke leaned into him, head resting on his shoulders and arms once again around his waist. \"There we go,\" Machoke said with a grin, \"nice and comfy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh blushed. His arms were caught in Machoke's embrace, so it would have been a struggle to escape. He didn't feel like it, though. So he just grinned back, leaned back against the mountain, and closed his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe silence they shared this time felt a bit more pleasant. Perhaps it was the warmth of the sunlight. Perhaps it was just because it was less awkward than standing around. Either way, Ash couldn't deny he enjoyed the closeness, the intimacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat word just wouldn't leave him alone, would it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut whatever. Rather than panic, it was best to stay calm and approach the situation slowly, feel out the extent of the meteorite's influence. Yes, that's it. That's definitely the reason why he went along with all this. Not any perverse reasons, no sir. Definitely not. Definitely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passed, and Ash was finding it easier to set doubts aside and appreciate the moment. The combined warmth of the sun and Machoke lulled him into a light drowsiness. His consciousness wavered somewhat, not fully awake but not outright dozing off either. A quiet enough noise could catch what attention he could offer without making him stir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You're adapting to your new self surprisingly well.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soft voice, low and deep with a touch of soothingness, seemed to come from nowhere and everywhere at the same time. Like it was in Ash's head. He hummed in response, more as an acknowledgement of the voice's presence than anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You've even managed to restrain your lust somewhat. Impressive...\"</i></span></div></div>",

He tried to reach down to relieve himself, but he was still too cold to stop shivering and stop hugging himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See what I mean?\" Machoke said surprising Ash a little as he walked towards him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kinda saw what you meant the first time.\" Ash responded \"I didn't even know it was hard.\" He then noticed that Machoke was hard again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since you helped me with the last one, how about we get out of this pond and I help you out this time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good to me.\" Ash said really wanted to get out. He quickly got out and Machoke followed close behind<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how do you want to do this?\" Ash asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since I don't know much about having sex, I was just think about doing the same thing you did for me.\" Machoke replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh then sat on the floor with his back right against the wall. While he hasn't completely warm up, he wasn't so cold he didn't feel the need to keep hugging himself anymore. He then looked up at Machoke and saw that the water glistening off his body just highlighted all his muscles all the more. Ash would've tried to put it out of his mind, but there was no way he could. Machoke then spread his ass out over Ash's cock and using the water as a lubricant, he managed to get more than halfway down Ash's cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man, that is crazy!\" Ash replied as he felt his cock was being hugged in Machoke's ass. Machoke then put his hands on Ash's shoulders for support and started moving up and down pretty quickly causing Ash to moan pretty load. As this was happening, Ash could feel Machoke's cock rubbing against his abs. Liking how it felt, he decided to jack Machoke off which resulted in Machoke murring a bit. Before either of them realized it, Machoke had taken in all of Ash's cock. They could both feel the pressure building up in their cock and knew that if was going to be bigger than before. Ash had no idea where it came from, but he gave into an impulse off kissing Machoke. It was awkward at first, but they quickly got the hang of it. Ash broke the kiss only to let out a scream of pleasure as he released his load into Machoke who was quick to follow letting it out all over their chests. After all that, neither wanted to change how they were and Machoke decided to us Ash's pec as a pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how was it for you this time?\" Ash asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oddly enough, it felt more natural.\" Machoke responded \"You?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I could get used to having a Machoke as a mate.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMachoke couldn't help but smile as he rubbed Ash's arm \"Good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just kinda want to stay like this a while. That ok with you?\" Ash asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect.\" Machoke replied</span></div></div>",

It just felt too weird for them to be apart and Ash felt even weirder about the idea of ordering Machoke around in battle. So after about a few weeks of trying, Ash decided to make Mt. Moon his new home. Just to play things safe, Ash officially caught him just so no one else did it and separated them. Through the past year, they started the day waking up together, take care of each others morning wood and showered together in the pool that Ash eventually got used to. From there, they climbed to near the top of the mountain where Machoke first came in contact with the meteorite. From the time the sun was up to the time it set, they trained together and would help each other with any hardons that came up. Once the sun had set they would go down the mountain, eat their fill, have sex one more time and fall asleep in each other's arms to do it all over again. They didn't change too much physically. The meteorite also opened up about it's origins. It was originally a part of a planet where humans and Pokemon were treated as equals and they even had children together. Due to a reason that the meteorite can't remember, the planet broke apart and the will of everyone on the planet was transferred into the planet itself and the pieces became meteorites which spread across the universe.  It also slowly made Machoke grow a few feet to match Ash's height and made Ash grow a light beard. They were both a little surprised by that, but once it was fully grown Machoke liked it on him. Machoke was usually the first to wake up between the two and often watched Ash as he slept and eventually woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning mate.\" Machoke said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Happy anniversary mate!\" Ash replied back<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMachoke had a confused look on his face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess you never heard of the word before.\" Ash said as he got ready to ride his mate's cock \"It's a celebration of an event. In this case, the day we first met.. Gah\" Ash couldn't help but let out as he got Machoke's cock head in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. So how..MMM..should be celebrate?\" Machoke asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well when the meteorite...Ahh...mentioned that humans and Pokemon had kids together...Aahhhh...maybe we could try to do it ourselves?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How would we do that?\" Machoke said with a look Ash knew meant he was close<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I actually understand that you have a Pokemon known as Ditto on this planet.\" the meteorite chimed in \"It seems to have the potential to hold both of your sperm and creating a child of your own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There....you.....GOOOO!!!!\" Ash let out as came all over their chests and Machoke came in him. Ash then got off Machoke's cock and waked over to the boulder that was blocking the waterfall and pool to move it out of the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And where do you suggest we find a Ditto?\" Machoke asked as he got up and let the cum drip down his chest \"In all my time here, I've never seen a Ditto.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I overheard from some trainers passing through the mountain that there were some showing up near Cerulean City.\" Ash replied as he entered the pool \"We could head over there tonight and see if there's a Ditto that would be willing to do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, it usually doesn't take much for an egg to form.\" Machoke said as he entered the pool and entered the waterfall. Ash did the same. Once they walked out Machoke added \"You do the talking.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>They eventually separated. Ash found himself strangely reluctant to do so. Machoke seemed to feel the same. It wasn't long before they became pent up once more, so they mated again. And again not long after that. And again after that. And they would have mated yet again had their stomachs not begged for sustenance. So Machoke showed Ash a good place to find food, they ate, and they mated as soon as their hunger was satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, they woke up and tended to each other's morning wood, had breakfast, and mated over and over again, only stopping when they needed rest or food and water. The day after that proceeded in the same manner, as did the day after that, and the day after that, and so on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuestions still lingered in the back of Ash's mind. The meteorite never spoke of itself or its goals. A small nagging feeling in the back of his head told him it could be planning to use him and Machoke for something, yet while he agreed with that feeling, he still wasn't able to muster up any real concern. If anything, he hoped that whatever happened would still allow him to spend his life with his new mate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDays became weeks. The two studs gradually became accustomed to their libidos. They could restrain themselves long enough to spend part of their day doing other things, like talking about themselves. Well, Ash did most of the talking. Machoke, feeling a wild Pok\u00e9mon like him didn't have much in the way of interesting stories, preferred listening to Ash recount his travels as a trainer. And what travels they were! So many different places and Pok\u00e9mon came up in his stories, most of which Machoke had never even heard of!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And to think,\" Machoke would occasionally say, \"out of everyone you've ever met, I'm the lucky guy who gets to be your mate!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh always blushed at that. He always loved hearing Machoke say that too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, they began training together. They tested the limits of their power, lifting the heaviest things they could find and holding them up as long as possible. Machoke had an edge here, but he had to admit his mate wasn't too far behind him. He taught Ash a few fighting techniques as well, though it was just things like the best way to throw a punch or kick. Humans couldn't use Pok\u00e9mon moves, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut more than those other things, they loved wrestling. Other wild Pok\u00e9mon were too scared to battle either of them, so they made do with each other. Naturally, they got pretty touchy-feely with each other. One grappled the other, restraining them in a tight embrace, roles swapping back and forth all the while. This always ended in another mating session, of course; they were more interested in feeling each other up and rubbing their erections against one another than actual training.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs weeks turned to months, Ash grew secure enough in their intimacy to openly ogle Machoke and not feel ashamed about it. It was a silly thing to feel bashful over, considering how sexual their relationship was, but years of social conditioning were hard to unlearn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thought of his old life every now and then. Of his travels, his accomplishments, and everything else he left behind. He didn't regret it, though. Every day he spent with Machoke was better than the last. Doing everything together felt so natural, like things were meant to be this way. Maybe the meteorite was influencing his feelings on the matter, but the notion didn't bother him. He loved his mate too much to care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, a year passed. Then another. And as more passed, Ash couldn't help but notice some other developments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was growing. Not by much and at a rate to slow to notice for the first few years, but he was growing. In every direction, no less! Every year seemed to add another several inches of height, another few pounds of muscle, and even a little something extra for his cock (which Machoke had no problem handling, thankfully). Apparently, the meteorite saw it fit to make him grow even bigger and studlier over time. He tried asking it for details, but as always, it stayed silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps even stranger was how his hair grew. His body and face were completely devoid of any, but his head was a completely different story. The more time passed, the more it became apparent only the back and sides were growing. His bangs stayed the same while the rest of it developed into a magnificent, spiky mane. Neither he nor Machoke noticed till it reached the base of his neck. But they liked it nonetheless; it gave Ash a sort of untamed wild man look. Machoke also thought it looked \"real nice when it's wet, for some reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of Machoke, his growth was much the same as Ash's minus the hair. His height gains averaged a little higher, at least at points. He always came up a head short of Ash, but that suited him just fine. He loved tucking his head under his mate's chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYears continued to pass. Neither of them seemed to age much. Ash's jawline shifted to something more chiseled, but other than that he didn't look a day older than when he first found his meteorite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, a full ten years after they first met and mated, they felt more secure in their current lives than ever. Neither one could even imagine going back their old ones; Ash was way too huge and horny to go back to city life, while Machoke was just a tad too far removed from what constituted a normal member of his species. And besides, they liked living on Mt. Moon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime no longer held any meaning to them, so they weren't even aware today was their tenth anniversary. They didn't even realize today was important to them in the first place, save for a vague feeling something special would happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what, exactly, was that something special?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Revelations:</b></u> Now that Ash and Machoke have spent a full decade as their studly selves, the meteorites decide to finally reveal their plans for them and the world at large.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Overload:</b></u> They wake up, tend to each other's morning wood... But then they find themselves far, <i>far</i> more pent up than usual. And the only way to deal with that is a day-long mating session. Is there a reason for this? Are big changes on the horizon?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Evolving?:</b></u> Somehow, neither of them feel all that hungry this morning. Same goes for lunch and dinner. These smaller meals satisfy them just fine, so what gives? They don't feel sick. If anything, they feel healthier than ever...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ash stirred from his sleep. A familiar warmth embraced him. Smiling to himself, he tightened his own embrace of Machoke. His mighty chest slowly rose and fell with each breath, rubbing against his mate's. Their rock hard cocks rubbed against each other as well, both already leaking pre.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" he said softly, his voice having become a deep and sexy baritone over the years, \"you awake yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMachoke answered with an affirmative hum, not moving his head from the crook of Ash's neck. \"Morning, mate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G'morning, mate.\" Ash pat Machoke's back, stroked it lovingly. \"Let me know when you're ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey stayed in their embrace for a few more minutes. Despite sleeping on the rocky grounds of Mt. Moon, Ash could honestly say his years there had given him some of the most comfortable sleep he'd ever experienced. Probably more of the meteorite's influence, but he liked to think having Machoke around helped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMachoke took a deep breath and slowly pulled himself out of Ash's arms. Now on his hands and knees, he began to turn around while Ash remained laying on the ground. They moaned, taking pleasure in the sensation of their cocks dragging over each other's bodies and leaving streaks of pre in their wake. Machoke stopped once his head was directly above Ash's cock while his own dangled over Ash's face. They admired their manhoods for a moment. Then, simultaneously, they wrapped their lips around the other's cock and began to suck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was their favorite way to handle morning wood. Quick, efficient, and oh so pleasurable. Sucking off and getting sucked off at the same time lacked the same raw bliss of a good old fashioned mating session, but at least it got them properly woken up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey sucked at a steady pace, lips gliding up and down their magnificent lengths at a steady pace. Licking the tips granted them the wonderful taste of their mate, a taste that inspired them throw in some tongue play, which in turn rewarded them with more. Mouths and tongues worked together with an expertise only a decade-long relationship rife with mating could provide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir first orgasms of the day hit before long. Warmth suffused them as they gulped down each other's sizable loads. Spurt after spurt fired down their throats. It made them hunger for more, but it also reminded them they still needed breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a content moan, Machoke pulled himself off of Ash's deflating cock and stood up, pulling his own out of Ash's mouth in the process. He then bent down and offered Ash a hand. \"Ready for breakfast?\" he asked with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh grinned back, took the hand and pulled himself up. Once upright, he hugged Machoke close and they kissed deeply. The taste of their seed mixing on their tongues caused their cocks to twitch eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir lips separated while their tongues continued to play with each other a little longer. Those too eventually seperated and they locked eyes. Their gazes smoldered with love and lust, as if wordlessly promising another fantastic day that would further reinforce their everlasting bond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMachoke chuckled. \"Let's get some food.\" Licking his lips, he added, \"Then we can have our <i>real</i> breakfast, my mate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh let out a pleasured cry. It reverberated around the cave. For some reason, they both felt inclined to have the day's first proper mating session where they kept their meteorites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that Ash really cared. He was too preoccupied mating to think about it. He embraced Machoke--bent over on all fours--from behind, beefy arms encircling his mate's waist as his proud manhood penetrated Machoke's ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe seized up, felt the dam break, and thrust hard with another cry as he fired his load. His hands worked Machoke's length fervently while he rhythmically pounded that tight ass in time with his spurts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take much longer for Machoke to reach his own release. His cry joined in with Ash's. The cave's acoustics made the combined sound nearly deafening but they didn't care. They loved hearing their mate's unbridled pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir orgasms died down. A pleasurable heat suffused them as they fired off their final, small spurts. Or rather, small by their standards. Even the strongest orgasm a normal human could muster paled in comparison to Ash and Machoke's weakest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the high died down and the afterglow set in, they laid down on their side, facing the pair of meteorites. Ash nuzzled into the back of Machoke's neck and kissed it. Hot seed coated his cock. He could pull it out, especially now that it was softening and Machoke's anus had more than enough lubrication, but he didn't want to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, he'd stay like this forever if he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a beautiful relationship you two have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Ash said in a husky voice between breaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... Wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLazily raising his head, he scanned the cave for others. Nothing. Just him, his mate, and the meteorites. Hang on, that voice sounded like it came from...inside his head?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMachoke looked over his shoulder at Ash. \"You heard that too, right?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Ash scanned the cave again. \"Hello? Anyone there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, our apologies. We have been silent so long that our suddenly speaking must come as a surprise.\" The nature of the voice was hard to pin down. It didn't sound distinctly male or female, but it did give the impression of someone incredibly muscular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut wait, silent so long? What?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh and Machoke shared confused glances. The held each other's gazes as realization dawned on them, then they turned to the meteorites. \"You?\" they said in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Again, our apologies for the years of silence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okaaay...\" Ash pulled an arm out from under Machoke and propped himself up with it. The other arm tightened its embrace around Machoke's waist.\"So, why are you talking now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First, if our understanding of your planet's orbit is correct, we wish to congratulate you two on your ten year anniversary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh's eyes widened. \"Ten years?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMachoke looked back and forth between Ash and the meteorites, his brow furrowed in confusion. \"Anni-what? What's it talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Basically, today's the day we first met ten years ago.\" Ash smiled warmly, kissed Machoke on the cheek. \"Happy anniversary, mate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMachoke blinked, then smiled as well. He reached back and stroked Ash's hair. \"Happy anniversary, mate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cave fell silent as the two basked in their unity for a while. Machoke craned his neck while Ash bent over and they shared a deep, long kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" the meteorites said, \"beautiful. You two have developed splendidly. Our influence could never have achieved such a bond.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Machoke turned back to them. \"But your influence made us like this in the first place.\" He gestured at his and Ash's bodies to emphasize his point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not entirely so, Machoke. We merely blessed you with your current bodies, including the gradual growth after your initial transformations.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what about everything else?\" Ash interjected. \"The horniness, the, the... You know, the other stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, a fair point, Ash Ketchum,\" the meteorites responded. \"It is true we did enhance your sex drives to complement your increased semen production. We also embedded your subconscious with whispers that made you more open to sex with any willing individual. We apologize for tampering with your minds, especially in such an invasive way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it is any compensation, the bond you two have cultivated together is entirely your doing, save for us guiding Ash to Machoke. But that is all we did. Though it would be correct to attribute those first sexual impulses to us, we did not compel either of you to stay together and become mates. You did that of your own volition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh didn't respond. He blushed. The logic wasn't entirely sound; those impulses were what kicked off their relationship in the first place. Not to mention that didn't explain--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We did not influence your acceptance of your new bodies either,\" they added. \"The most we did was make it feel pleasurable. It would have been agonizingly painful otherwise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that made sense. Although it still failed to explain--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, wait.\" Machoke propped himself up on an arm, mirroring Ash. \"Aside from the whole mating thing, you didn't mess with our heads at all? We accepted the idea of a human-Pok\u00e9mon relationship all by ourselves?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh spared a glance at Machoke, then nodded. \"Yeah, I wanna know that too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe meteorite went silent for a moment. Pondering the question for a moment. Regardless, it answered, \"Yes and no. We did not actively influence you to accept such a relationship, but given the nature of our origin, our blessing might have made you more open to the idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are the collective conscious of a... Well, calling it a race would not be accurate. Think of it as a planetwide tribe of various sapient species similar to you two in physical structure, including your current musculature, and sex drive. In our mortal forms, we prided ourselves on sexual openness and acceptance of inter-species relationships.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" Ash scratched the back of his head. \"But why did you guys turn yourselves into a collective conscious?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why make us like you?\" Machoke added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe meteorites answered...</span></div></div>",

Feeling that he was leaking pre and saw that Machoke was too, he decided to wake his mate up his favorite way. He rubbed his cock against Machoke's and went in for a big kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MMMMmmmmm\" Machoke responded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning mate.\" Ash said in his deeper voice that developed over the years<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning to you too mate.\" Machoke said back and then slowly licked up Ash's neck<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man, guess we're both a little more horny than normal this morning.\" Ash said as he rubbed his mate's chest<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's take care of that then.\" Machoke said. He then crawled on top of Ash causing him to moan a few times. Machoke wouldn't stop until he was at Ash's cock and his was above Ash. They then wrapped their lips around the other's cock and began to suck. They loved to do it this way because they felt it was the best way to get going in the morning. Almost like they were drinking their first cup of coffee in the morning. Ash then started to rub Machoke's ass. Machoke couldn't help but moan at his mate's touch. In response, he started to fondle Ash's balls who also started to moan. They always tried to make it last as long as they could, but also couldn't wait for the other to cum. Today they came in full force. While they didn't know they came more than normal, they easily swallowed every last bit of it. As Machoke stood up, they both noticed something that was odd, even for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mate, your cock is still hard.\" Ash said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So is yours.\" Machoke responded back<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh the stood, faced his mate and then started to jack himself off. Machoke immediately did the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you...think we should...Gaahh... ask the meteorite?\" Ash asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can... try.\" Machoke responded \"But first.\" Machoke then pulled Ash close for a kiss<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just...couldn't resist..could you?\" Ash asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With you....NEEEEVVVVVEEEEEEERRRRRR!!!!\" Machoke shouted at he came on Ash's chest. Ash ended up coming all over Machoke's. Despite the fact they came twice in two minutes, their cocks were still hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forget the meteorite right now,\" Ash said \"We're not going anywhere until our cocks go soft.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMachoke then laid on the floor and then spread his legs revealing his ass \"Go ahead mate. You know I can take it.\" Machoke said seductively as he laid his arms above his head. \"Do it as long as you need to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh then got on his knees and easily pushed in his cock into Machoke's ass until he could go any further. Ash then pounded Machoke like that for around three hours and in that time, they came hundreds of times. Machoke's chest was covered in his own cum and Ash was kneeling in his. Ash then stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can...keep...going.\" Machoke got out as he panted <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.\" Ash replied \"Just want to change it up a little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh then lifted Machoke off the ground and pressed their chests together with Machoke's cock firmly place between their abs and the head just under their pecs. Some of Ash's cum had leaked out of Machoke's ass in that moment. Machoke wrapped his arms and legs around for some stability. Ash suddenly felt a little off balance so he walked backward toward the wall so he would be more stable. Ash then continued to fuck Machoke like that for about an hour. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say Ash, why don't you sit down?\" Machoke asked \"I'm a bit worried about your arms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok mate. Do you mind if I get a drink?\" Ash asked referring his mate's cock<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMachoke couldn't help but smile \"Sure mate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh then dropped to the floor, now sitting in some of his cum. Machoke then put his hand on Ash's shoulders and started to move himself up and down Ash's cock. Ash started to stroke and suck his mate's cock. Machoke let out a number of moans before coming in Ash's mouth. Once Ash swallowed every bit, he once again came in Machoke ass. He then took it out of his mouth, repositioned himself so he was lying on him back and went right right back to jacking his mate off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have enough to drink?\" Machoke asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YYYEEEEAAAAAHHHHH!!!!!!\" Ash shouted as he came which made his mate do the same on Ash's chest. They continued to do it this way until their cocks went soft, which unbeknownst to them happened about an hour after sunset. With Ash's cock still in his ass, Machoke collapsed on his mate's chest and fell asleep. Ash kisses his mate's muzzle, took his cock out, wrapped his arms around Machoke and feel asleep too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Machoke was the first to wake up that morning. Along with his morning wood, he noticed something was off with his stomach. His abs were a little more rounded, almost like a gut was forming. He also felt like something was inside his stomach. Then out of nowhere, Machoke felt like he was going to throw up. After a bit of coughing, all that came out was spitup. Oddly enough, he came as as he was coughing. Hearing everything, Ash woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything ok Machoke?\" Ash asked almost running to his mate<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I feel sick and something is up with my stomach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man.\" Ash said worried as he started rub Machoke's back. \"As much as I want to take you to the Pokemon Center, I don't think I'm going to be able to walk the streets with freaking someone out.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not to mention, my belt is long gone.\" Machoke added \"Gonna be hard to explain that one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can explain.\" Ash and Machoke heard not sure where it came from. They scanned the cave to find no one else in the cave with them. Until they looked at each other and shouted together \"THE METEORITES!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apologies for staying silent for so long.\" the meteorites responded<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them walked up to the meteorite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I hope you have an explanation about what's going on with me.\" Machoke said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We do. But first we would like to congratulate the two of you on being together for ten years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! That long?\" Ash said surprised <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As to what is going on with you Machoke,\" the meteorite continued \"as the people on you planet put it, it's nothing that won't go away in nine months.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh and Machoke looked at each other confused as to what the meteorite was talking about, until it hit Ash like a Golem fell on his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean to say that Machoke is pregnant??\" Ash practically shouted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!?\" Machoke shouted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We realize this must come as a shock, but we theorize that when you both touched your respective pieces, along with being given the strength and sexual drives, it seems you were also given bits of our D.N.A.\" the meteorite explained \"We have actually evolved to the point where we can impregnate any being.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok so why now?\" Ash asked \"We've had a lot of sex everyday during our time together. How has this never happened before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We believe, in this case, it was a state of both of you being mentally ready for having a child.\" the meteorite responded<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh and Machoke then wrapped their arms around each other and kissed each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for telling us meteorite.\" Ash responded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got two more questions for ya.\" Machoke said \"How many kids are we going to have and where are they supposed to come out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In terms of how they will come into the world, unfortunately it will happen through the anus. So however many are born, you'll need to wash them.\" the meteorite responded \"If you want to know how many you'll be having you'll need to place your hands on your piece.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMachoke did what the meteorite asked and immediately felt a tingle through out his body. Ash then put his hand on his mate's shoulder to reassure him. After about 5 minutes, the tingling stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It appears you will be the fathers of three boys. They will all be different in terms of how they will look.\" the meteorite finally responded<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMachoke then took his hands off the meteorite with looks of surprise and excitement as he turned to his mate. Ash responded by hugging him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll be ok.\" Ash said \"We'll make sure we have room for all three of them and once they are here, we'll make sure they feel loved everyday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know we will mate.\" Machoke responded \"As long as we're together, I know we'll be ok.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Ash. Machoke.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh stirred. Apparently he'd dozed off. And judging by that groan just now, so had Machoke. They were still embraced, Ash laying against the rocky wall (which somehow wasn't causing any discomfort) as he hugged Machoke to his body. His cock was still buried in Machoke's ass. It felt nice. Intimate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... And there was that word again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Ash blinked, scanned the area. \"Who's there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think that's the meteorite,\" Machoke said, not moving his head from Ash's pec.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is?\" Ash thought back to when he found his piece. The voice he heard in his head just now sounded just like the one that told him to take the meteorite and run. \"Oh yeah, I guess it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm-hmm.\" Machoke yawned. \"What's up, meteorite?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone has found one of my fragments. He is a Pok\u00e9mon, a Lucario. He has just received my power and will be coming to you soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucario?\" Machoke raised his head. \"Never heard of that species.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There aren't any in Kanto,\" Ash replied. He rubbed Machoke's back. \"I've met some during my travels. They're really strong and can sense this stuff called aura. I bet this guy looks pretty hot now that he's all big and buff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, hot? He didn't mean to say anything like that. But as he thought about it, he realized he did, in fact, feel that way. His cock twitching was proof enough of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMachoke moaned at the feeling. \"Hey, easy there. Much as I'd love another round, I don't think our new friend's gonna wanna catch us mating when he gets here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have enough time for that,\" the meteorite said. \"Lucario is coming from an island in a faraway region. As such, he is making several jumps to get here. Whatever you two decide to do, make sure you will be there to meet him when he arrives. I will alert you when he makes the last jump here. Have him bring his fragment to yours as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does that mean we're gathering your pieces here?\" Ash asked. \"Why are we doing that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As my body has become fractured, so too has my power. In my current state, I cannot remember my purpose for being. I only know that I must be reassembled.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe meteorite's voice fell silent. Ash and Machoke exchanged thoughtful looks. They still hadn't moved. Ash's cock twitched again, as did Machoke's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Round three?\" Machoke asked hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh found himself grinning. \"Sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter having sex yet again, Ash and Machoke washed up. At Ash's suggestion, they helped clean each other. He reasoned the physical contact would offset the water's coldness, but a part of him just wanted to feel up Machoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey still had some time to spare after that, so Machoke showed Ash a good place to find some food. Just some berry trees and bushes dotted around Mt. Moon's base, but they were enough to satiate them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the meteorite alerted them of the Lucario's imminent arrival, they waited by Ash's landing spot, characterized by the crater he made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still hard to believe I made that,\" Ash muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And to think,\" Machoke said, \"that Lucario guy's making a whole bunch of these on his way here. Bet I could make some if I tried.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh thought for a moment, then asked, \"How do you think he knows the way here? The meteorite?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMachoke shrugged. \"I guess. Brought you here, didn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat much was true. The more Ash thought back on it, the more he realized him landing at Mt. Moon didn't feel like a coincidence. He barely noticed it in the heat of the moment, but there had been a subtle force steering him to Machoke. It made sense for the meteorite to be capable of something like that; relying on clueless recipients of its power to piece it back together without guidance was a terrible idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey looked up, scanned the sky. A quiet stillness filled the air as a gentle breeze blew by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh fidgeted in place. A familiar pressure in his groin made itself known. His cock stood half-erect, pointing straight ahead. Biting his lip, he glanced over to see Machoke's in the same state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForcing himself to ignore both his suddenly dry throat and the compulsion to suck that cock dry, Ash looked back up to the sky. Still no sign of an airborne Lucario.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe if they were quick about it--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShoving that train of thought aside, Ash turned back to Machoke, whom pointed up at the sky. Following that outstretched finger, Ash looked up once more and saw a distant figure in the sky. A figure that grew closer with each passing second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n A thunderous crash boomed. Dust and debris filled the air. A shock wave threw Ash and Machoke off-balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRocks bounced harmlessly off of Ash as he struggled to regain his footing. Once successful, he waved away what dust he could with a few mighty swings of his arm. Thankfully everything settled just as suddenly as it all happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dust cleared. Ash gazed in awe upon the crater, the one he'd made, now wider and deeper than it was before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd in the center of it, a Lucario.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was far more muscular than typical of his species, of course. Also more humanoid. His paws now looked more like human hands, possessing more dexterous fingers and opposable thumbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what really stood out was how different Lucario's muscles were. Where Ash and Machoke were tall bodybuilders, Lucario was a short and stocky strongman. He had muscles about as big as theirs, but his shorter stature made him seem bigger in terms of proportion. Less defined curvature all around--his abdomen was a single slab of meat instead of an eight-pack, for example--but still looked to be just as strong as his two soon-to-be friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario stood still, down on one knee and bracing himself with an arm. The other cradled a faintly glowing rock; his meteorite fragment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he finally looked up and gazed upon the other two studs. His red-eyed stare bore into them, as if peering into their very souls and sizing them up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Lucario finally stood, Ash noticed two more things about him. First was the absence of his kind's chest and hand spikes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, this just barely had enough time to register in Ash's mind before he got a good look at Lucario's erect cock. Sheath notwithstanding, his manhood was comparable to Ash and Machoke's not only in size but shape as well, looking more humanoid than canine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario slowly and silently made his way out of the crater one step at a time. He didn't seem to be struggling with his new body. If anything, between the way he stared at the other two so intently and his cock twitching its way to full mast...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe came to stand in between the two, still saying nothing. His gaze drifted back and forth between them. With him up close, it was much easier to see the desire in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh felt conflicted. On the one hand, it was embarrassing to be sized up in the nude. On the other, he couldn't blame Lucario for taking interest. The meteorite had a way with turning guys into sexy studs, as all three of them could attest to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlus, in fairness, Ash was kind of eying up Lucario too. Just like earlier with Machoke, he couldn't help drinking in the new arrival's brawny body. Even the fact Lucario only came up to his pecs kind of turned him on; it made him feel that much bigger and sexier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're Lucario, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Ash and Lucario jolted to attention at Machoke's voice. Ash shook his head and smiled at Lucario, whom smiled back and looked away sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, yes,\" Lucario said, his voice gentle and soothing. \"I am indeed Lucario. Forgive me, I was...rendered speechless by your physiques.\" He turned to Machoke. \"I see you have been granted the ability to speak human language as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMachoke grinned, nodded. \"Yeah, it's nice. Makes it a lot easier to talk with Ash here.\" He walked past Lucario and wrapped an arm around Ash's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh couldn't help blushing, smiled at the contact. He looked to Lucario. \"It feels weirdly easy to accept what's going on, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are very much right about that. I've not a single clue as to what is going on yet I find myself readily accepting it.\" Lucario held up his meteorite fragment. \"This has told me very little. It will not explain why it has changed me so and given me human speech, nor why it led me here. I can only assume you two have found similar rocks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Machoke replied, \"they're pieces of a bigger rock and it wants to be put back together.\" He gestured with his head to Mt. Moon. \"C'mon, we'll take you to ours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we'll explain what we can,\" Ash added. \"It's not much, but we can at least give you a heads up on what to expect with your new body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" Lucario shot a split-second glance down at his cock, then the others'. \"Though I may have some idea...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>True to Ash's word, there weren't many notes to compare. Found a meteorite fragment. Turned into a buff stud. Gained a massive sex drive. Suddenly attracted to other buff studs, regardless of species and despite never before having a sexual interest in...well, anyone. Surprisingly willing to go along with all these changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree near identical stories tied to an amnesiac space rock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose if nothing else,\" Lucario mused aloud, \"it is comforting to know I am not alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMachoke shoved aside the boulder blocking the cave entrance with a small grunt. He exhaled as though it was a great effort despite not looking the slightest bit winded. \"I feel ya. Love being big, but it's not worth it if I can't share that love, y'know?\" He winked at Ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing, Ash flashed a grin in return. He watched Machoke go in, then looked to Lucario and inclined his head toward the entrance. Lucario nodded and followed after Machoke. Ash followed as well, rolling the boulder back into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they made their way in, Ash couldn't resist ogling their new friend. Lucario's back muscles were a sight to behold, of course. The way they shifted with each swing of the arm not carrying the meteorite was addictive, almost hypnotic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the real feast for the eyes was his bubble butt. It was more rounded than Ash and Machoke's perfectly toned glutes. Softer too, judging by the slight jiggles each step caused. An odd contrast to the rest of his of his body, but certainly not an unwelcome one. Honestly, it kind of made Ash want to play with those cheeks. Squeeze them a little, give them a light smack or two, spread them and stuff his--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh's cock twitched several times. He winced. Would he ever get this new libido under control? Would it ever go down? Or was he destined to live the rest of his life enduring his endless lust between rounds of sex?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBiting his lip, he looked up from that inviting ass to find Lucario looking back at him. His face tensed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario said nothing. He just stared. There was a certain intensity to it even though his expression remained neutral.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then he smiled and turned his attention back to the path in front of him. Not a single word uttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat kind of smile was that supposed to be? Knowing, of course, but beside that. Maybe it was a smirk. Then again, Lucario didn't seem like the teasing or mischievous type, so--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a heads up,\" Machoke half-shouted to Lucario, his voice echoing through the cave, \"Ash and I've had sex three times already, so don't be surprised when it starts smelling musky in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh's whole face flushed a bright red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?!\" Lucario didn't sound shocked so much as he sounded intrigued. \"You are already that comfortable with each other?\" He looked down. \"Does it help at all with the, er, output?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little,\" Machoke replied. \"More than doing it by yourself. Still doesn't last too long, but that has its own perks in a way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...\" Lucario went quiet for a moment, then said, \"I would not dare cause a rift between mates, so I shall endure my newfound need until I can find someone willing to assist me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh frowned. \"Wait--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is fine... Ash, was it? This need is unfamiliar to me, yes, but my lifetime of training has honed my discipline enough that it should--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't need to deal with it alone! I'll help you out any way I can!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario looked back at Ash, surprise clear on his face. Ash was surprised himself, but didn't let it show on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA flicker of gratitude flashed in Lucario's eye, but doubt took its place. \"But...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Machoke interjected, \"what Ash said. We only just met today, so we haven't really settled on being mates or sex friends or anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We did talk about it a little,\" Ash replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but a just a little. So until we get that all figured out, there's nothing wrong with the three of us coming together and, uh...cumming together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario offered no objections. He looked back and forth between Ash and Machoke, both of whom nodded. He then looked down again, most likely at his cock. After a moment of silence, he nodded to himself. His tail wagged a bit. \"Very well. Then if I am not being too forward, would the two of you be willing to help relieve me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Ash said, smiling. \"We can take care of that after we get the meteorites together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good!\" Machoke flashed the other two a grin. \"I'll tell ya now, Lucario, you're in good hands. Ash is a natural at this kinda stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh couldn't help grinning back. It felt weird to be praised for having a knack for having sex with Pok\u00e9mon, even if they were on the more humanoid side of things. Not to mention having a knack for such a thing in the first place. Of course, that could just be the meteorite's doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, it was...kind of nice being close. Being intimate, even.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they reached the chamber, Lucario sniffed the air. He scanned the area, taking note of the small puddle of cum by the two meteorites in the center. \"There is a certain musk in air.\" He hummed. It sounded thoughtful, but was subtly tinged with a sexual undercurrent. \"What a curiously enticing smell...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if to emphasize his point, Lucario's cock twitched. Watching it made Ash's twitch as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before Ash could even notice his sudden urge to suck it off, Lucario placed his own meteorite next to the other two. Anticipation filled Ash, but part of him was more interested in the way Lucario presented his plump, sexy ass as he bent over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then the meteorites began to glow...</span></div></div>",

They didn't grow any bigger, or hornier, or anything. Exchanging glances mixed with confusion and slight disappointment, they turned to face each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys feel any different?\" Machoke asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh shook his head, then looked to Lucario. \"Do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario hummed in thought. Then, closing his eyes, he clapped his hands together in a prayer-like gesture and took a deep breath. His dreads rose as if being blown by an updraft. Ash smiled knowingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMachoke, on the other hand, looked confused. \"What's he doing?\" he asked Ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario's arms and dreads dropped as he let out a soft exhale. \"I was reading our auras just now. As well as the meteorites'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh raised an eyebrow. \"They have auras?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Though to be more accurate, they possess a single, unified aura.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oookaaay...\" Machoke scratched his head, brow furrowed in confusion. \"Ash mentioned that stuff to me earlier, but what exactly is aura?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the most basic of terms, aura is the life energy every living being possesses. Some, like myself, can even harness it for various uses.\" Lucario's expression turned thoughtful as he looked over at the meteorites. \"Though I have never heard of using one's aura to alter another's...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that what they did to us?\" Ash asked, looking down at himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario nodded. \"They have imbued our auras with pieces of their own. Before I was changed, mine was... How to put this... It was calmer, like the undisturbed surface of a lake. No ripples or waves, and it was content to remain within the confines of my body. But now it has become more...let us say impassioned. It burns like a raging fire, one that seeks to become one with other fires. In other words--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your auras attract one another.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio startled, looked between each other in confusion. A fourth voice. And it sounded like it came from inside their head. Then, all three reaching the same conclusion at the same time, turned their attention to the meteorites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" spoke the voice of the space rocks, \"Lucario's observations are exactly correct. My fragments have implanted a piece of my aura in each of you. And though I still haven't recalled why I have such a power or why it caused your bodies to change like this, I <i>have</i> recalled that my purpose and the changes I cause are related in some way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh looked down at himself. So the meteorite was supposed to turn him into a stud? Was it also supposed to crank up his sex drive and make him attracted to other studs, even if they're Pok\u00e9mon? And was it just studs created by the meteorites, or could it be any old stud? He tried thinking of a human man, buff from head to toe. Nothing. He tried picturing the man naked. Still nothing. Maybe a muscular woman...? Nope, nothing there either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he looked up at Machoke and Lucario, both of them mulling over the meteorite's words, and blood instantly rushed to his cock. All his concerns took a back seat to a strong urge to feel up their amazing bodies and be felt up. He gulped. It wasn't because they were Pok\u00e9mon, was it? No, it couldn't be. The meteorite said their auras were attracted to one another, so it was just because they were blessed too. If that were the only reason, then it wouldn't have made a difference if they were human or female. He still would've wanted to feel and be felt, kiss and be kissed, mate and be mated. He'd still want to be intimate with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Intimate...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do we do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnapped out of his thoughts, Ash realized he'd been jerking off and pulled his hands away from his cock and held them behind his back. He looked at Machoke, who'd directed the question at the meteorites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" they replied, \"for now we can only wait for someone to find another of my pieces, so you three are free to do whatever you please. I will let you know if anyone is coming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMachoke shrugged. \"Works for me. More time to get to know our new friend anyway.\" He shot Lucario a smirk and a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario turned bashful, making a breathy sort-of laugh as he looked off in a random direction. \"Funny, I wonder why I feel so flustered...\" Then, after clearing his throat, he turned back to Machoke and asked, \"What was that just now? Is it a, a courtship gesture?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" Machoke's brow furrowed. \"I...guess? I don't know, I just get the idea to do it whenever I'm flirting.\" He paused. His expression grew even more confused. \"Wait, where'd I hear that word from? Must've gotten it from somewhere. Flirting, flirting...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The meteorite, perhaps? It gave us both the ability to speak human language, so it could have also taught us words relating to human mating.\" Lucario brought a hand to his chin in thought. He held that pose for a moment, seemed to consider something, then disregarded it with a shrug. \"Well, regardless of how and why we have gained this knowledge, I quite like these strange words.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMachoke's expression softened into a grin. \"Same here. It's fun to say 'em too. Like cock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mention of the word \"cock\" made Ash bite his lip. There was a subtle emphasis to it, slightly drawn out compared to every other word Machoke said, and it lingered in such a tantalizing way. Ash's eyes drifted to Machoke's cock, then Lucario's. His mouth felt dry, and he felt the urge to quench his sudden thirst with their cum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as if sensing his thoughts, Lucario caught his gaze and regarded him with a smile. \"I must agree, and I daresay our human friend does as well.\" A hint of amusement entered his voice as he added, \"Don't you, Ash?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh blushed for what felt like the millionth time that day. \"Well I don't really know,\" he stammered. \"I haven't actually said it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe certainly had no trouble thinking about his new friends' cocks though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why not say it now?\" Lucario asked, still smiling. \"Hearing it from you would be very... Shall we say 'sexy'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, I like that one too!\" Machoke said. \"C'mon Ash, say that one too! Say 'em both!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh looked between the two expectant Pok\u00e9mon. Was this really that interesting to them? They were just words. Words he'd never say with his mother in earshot, mind, but just words all the same. But if it made them happy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... sexy cock?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuh. That wasn't as awkward or embarrassing as he'd expected. It did feel kind of weird, but not in a bad way. Which was pretty much par the course for today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario chuckled. \"Why the hesitation? Are those not commonly used words in human society?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really,\" Ash replied. Not in the social circles he was part of, anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah? Well, we're not humans--\" Machoke waved a hand dismissively. \"--so don't worry about it. Just say whatever's on your mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust say whatever, huh? Well, it was better than keeping everything bottled up. Might as well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Venting Concerns:</b></u> With everything still vague and uncertain, Ash knows he should be more worried about what's going on, but he just can't for some reason. Maybe if he tries bringing it up with the others, he can finally worry about this whole thing properly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>To Accept One's Lust:</b></u> He's been naked for hours. He's ogled his new friends. He's had sex with Machoke three times and promised to go a round with Lucario. At this point, Ash may as well fully accept his new libido and all the lustful thoughts that come with it. Maybe he could even come to embrace it with some help from his new friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>New Guy's Relief:</b></u> Ash isn't quite ready to open up yet, so he shifts focus to Lucario. The poor Pok\u00e9mon has to be aching with lust. Better give the poor guy a helping hand or two before it becomes too much to bear.</span></div></div>",

Take as much time as you need.\" Lucario said in almost strained tone<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucario, are you alright?\" Machoke asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" Lucario somehow said with a straight face \"As I said before until I can be someone to be my mate, I will endure it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario then stood up and Ash and Machoke saw his cock was twitching. Almost waiting to erupt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not convinvced.\" Ash said \"Machoke do you mind if I help Lucario out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go for it. I'll join you in a minute.\" Machoke said rubbing his own cock<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh got behind Lucario, started to stroke his sides and his cock against Lucario's ass. Lucario blushed a bit as he started to purr.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't know Lucario could purr.\" Ash said in surprise<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not something we do often.\" Lucario responded \"I guess I need more training.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on now.\" Machoke said \"You're among friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario nodded and started to relax. Ash then started to push his cock into Lucario's ass. Lucario shuttered and let out a moan of pure pleasure. Almost immediately after, Lucario's cock started to release pre. Once Ash started to move in and out of Lucario's ass, Lucario started to pant. He started to pant harder as he felt Machoke suck him off. Not even a minute later, Lucario howled releasing a huge load. Machoke made an attempt to shallow it all, but it was too much. He got Lucario's cock out of his mouth and ended up taking a cum shower. It took a full three minutes for Lucario to stop. He then fell on his knees and off Ash's cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were really holding that much back?\" Ash asked in shock<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario simply nodded as he panted trying to catch his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think we've cum this much together.\" Machoke said with most of his body covered in Lucario's cum \"And looks like there is still more to come.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo everyone's surprise, Lucario's cock still as hard as it was before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I can stand up.\" Lucario responded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think you can carry him Machoke?\" Ash asked having an idea<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How far?\" Machoke asked back<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh then lay flat on his back on the floor. This gave Machoke his answer. He then propped Lucario up to lean on him. Once they were where Ash was laying, Machoke gently slid Lucario down Ash's cock. Once he was all the way down, Lucario spread out over Ash's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think you can fit your cock in Lucario's ass?\" Ash asked Machoke<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can certainly try.\" Machoke responded<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMachoke tried and while there was some resistance with Ash already being in, he was able to get in. Lucario tried to say something, but all that came out were moans. Which only increased once Ash started to move in and out. Machoke started to do the same. Not even a minute in, Lucario howled and released a pretty big load onto Ash's chest. Ash could feel that Lucario's cock was still just as hard. After another few minutes, Ash and Machoke were in perfect sync. They could feel the other start to release pre at the same time. Despite the fact that they were both fucking Lucario at that moment, it felt as though they were the only two in the cave. They then shared a passionate kiss causing them to flood Lucario's insides with their cum. In response, Lucario howled and came a third time. Ash and Machoke snapped back to reality after that. Luckily for them though, Lucario's cock had finally gone soft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My apologies for causing you two so much trouble.\" Lucario said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it.\" Ash said \"Just be sure to let it out next time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario nods and lets out a yawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think you could get me off? I can barely raise a finger.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMachoke started by getting his cock out of Lucario. He then lift Lucario up by the arms off of Ash. Ash then helped Machoke carry Lucario to the side of the cave for Lucario to rest for a while. With how much cum was on them, they decided to wash up again. As they cleaned themselves up, they found the water to be warmer than the previous times. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say Ash.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That last kiss we shared it honestly felt amazing. What do you say after Lucario finds a mate, we mate exclusively with each other?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would love that Machoke!\" Ash said with excitement<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey then hugged each other tightly and shared another just as passionate kiss. They then exited the water and dried each other off. Once they were back in the main part of the cave, they were surprised to see Lucario standing and stretching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ok to be moving around like that Lucario?\" Machoke asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Positive.\" Lucario said \"So long as I don't hold back in terms of cumming I'll be fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great to hear Lucario!\" Ash said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that you are all back, there is something I should tell you.\" the meteorites said</span></div></div>",

In related news, a large meteorite entered the atmosphere last night before breaking into pieces, and one such piece was discovered near the large Pok\u00e9mon. A reward is available for anyone willing to find a piece and turn it in to the nearest Pok\u00e9mon Center or police station.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n May took a sip of her lemonade, looking away from the television as it went to commercial. An elderly couple was whispering to each other about the strange Machoke. She only caught snippets. \"...What could've caused it... Reward for a piece... That massive cock...\" She gagged on her lemonade after that last piece, and quickly walked away before she heard anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She grabbed her towel and headed outside to the hot spring. Finishing her drink, she threw the empty cup away, and slipped off her sandals before sinking into the warm water. Having just bought a brand-new pink swimsuit, she planned on putting it to good use. She quickly dunked her head underwater to get her face and hair wet, and then submerged herself underwater until only the top half of her head remained visible. She mentally sighed in content.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n May retraced her thoughts to the news she had been watching. \"Wonder what the reward is for finding a piece of that meteorite?\" she thought to herself. \"I sure could use a new set of clothes... And food, lots of food!\" She began to swing her legs absentmindedly, thinking about all the wonderful things she could buy with the reward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her foot connected with a piece of rock, exciting a small \"Ow!\" from her. Using her hands, she reached around for it, until a sharp pain in her palm made her pull her hand back. Pulling it out of the water, she looked at her palm, where a small cut was bleeding weakly. \"Must have a sharp edge or two,\" she told herself. \"Gotta be a little more careful trying to find this rock!\" Ignoring the minute pain, she shot her hand back into the warm water, and went back to searching for whatever she had kicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n A minute or so passed before she found it. Grinning, she carefully grabbed two smoother edges, and eased the odd rock from under the water. Holding it out in front of her, a look of realization dawned upon her. \"Hey, it's a piece of that meteorite!\" she mused to herself, trying not to say it too loudly. She wanted the reward to herself. A Cheshire grin spread from ear to ear. The hot spring, after all, was literally next to the Pok\u00e9mon Center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n A faint blue light began to emanate from the piece of rock. May quickly hid it back underwater before anyone could notice. Her body was beginning to tingle a bit, but she thought it was just from the excitement. Unsure of what to do next, she quietly sat down, thinking. She began to run a hand through her wet hair, before she remembered it was the one with the cut. Not wanting to get blood in her beautiful brown hair, she looked at her palm... only to discover the small wound had mysteriously begun to heal itself! She watched in amazement as the cut sealed itself, leaving only a barely noticeable scar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The tingling feeling returned stronger, and May knew it wasn't just from her excitement. Her nipples became erect, as she felt her lower regions become moist. She quietly moaned, as a feeling of pain and pleasure swept over her. She was glad she was the only person in the spring, as she unconsciously tightened her grip on the tough meteorite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her swimsuit began to feel tighter, as she felt her whole body began to grow. She looked down, only to have her gaze interrupted by her expanding breasts. She widened her eyes in surprise, watching as they blossomed from a small A-cup until they were almost the size of her head, held up by a pair of pectoral muscles that were the size of dictionaries, preventing them from sagging. She glanced at her right arm, and saw that her forearm was inflating itself with pure muscle, a small vein running along it and into her orange-sized bicep. She looked at her other arm, and saw that it was almost identical, save for a few more veins. Her mighty pythons were being held by her even mightier shoulders, which were almost as big as her breasts, yet filled with pure power and strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n May felt her torso lengthen and her legs become longer and stronger, until they hit the very bottom of the spring. She raised her eyebrows in surprise. The spring was almost six feet deep! Her legs grew some more, pushing her up to six and a half feet tall. Her thunder thighs packed on muscle until they were as thick as trees, with her calves the size of large hams and teardrop shaped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She ran her hands over her developing abs, her H-cup breasts and foot-thick pecs preventing them from being visible. Her swimsuit had miraculously stayed intact, staying on like a second skin, allowing her to feel each individual brick-sized block as they popped up on her formerly flat stomach, until she had an eight-pack just as hard if not harder than the meteorite, with a set of obliques complimenting it running down the sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n All the pain she had been experiencing turned into pure pleasure, as an impending orgasm welled inside the amazonian trainer. Flexing her left arm, she watched the orange turn into a softball-sized muscle, its tricep bending into a horseshoe shape. Unflexing, she watched in astonishment as it retained its massive size. Feeling warm liquid run down her thighs, she flexed everything as hard as she could, inciting a loud moan as her titanic body grew bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"May, what happened to you?!\" yelled out a familiar voice. She turned her body to the source of the outcry, her little brother Max. She couldn't help but smile at the fact she was now even bigger than him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I had a growth spurt,\" she giggled, picking up the meteorite. \"Here, want to hold this for a few minutes while I dry off?\" </span></div></div>",

He stumbled back, smacking May's backpack, knocking out a small red and white ball.  It flashed open and Venusaur looked about.  It looked shocked at May.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey girl, give me a hand, okay?\" May asked.  Half inch vines reached forward  and May took them.  A thought came to her as she climbed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat Machoke became a hunk because it likely touched the meteor.  Before she gave this up, <i>if she gave it up</i>, why not pump up her Pokemon?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girl, I am going to put this rock on you.  Keep it safe,\"  May said.  Her Pokemon nodded and took the rock from her trainer's hand.  Once it was holding the rock, May reached for her towel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds after she started drying, she heard a low moan from her female friend.  She turned and watched with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFormally, Venusaur was about 6'7\" long and 5'6\" to the top of the flower.  The massive beast was no longer so.  Slowly it inched wider and taller.  The tree trunk legs lengthened as the claws grew from its feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt continued to moan in pain and pleasure, breathing heavily..  Brock made mention of hearing something similar during nights before Pokemon eggs would be found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tail pushed out of the Pokemon, lengthening and thickening.  The vine holding the powerful rock thickened to over 2 inches in diameter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe petal on top bloomed out, taking in more and more sunlight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep on growing girl,\" May whispered with glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the corner of her eye, she saw Max return with Nurse Joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrock shook his head with shock.  He was home on what was supposed to be a short stay when the meteor fell.  Now he was in Mt. Moon with Nurse Joy on one side and Misty on the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were watching the Machoke.  But he was not alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA seven foot tall Clefable with large breasts was taking his giant penis in all its majesty.  They screamed in pleasure, panting heavily<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny attempt to get close would cause the enlarged Clefairy to attack.  It was really easy to tell the males from the females now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was only one choice:  Send their own Pokemon in to investigate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Brock's Blissey, Nurse Joy's Chansey, and Misty's Azumarill carefully got closer.  They were told to look, but not touch anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey could only hope they would come back normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe universe laughed at the odds of that happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Vena,\" May whispered with ecstasy.  Her friend had stopped growing.  She was now over ten feet long.  The giant petal on her back was over eight feet from the ground.  Vena was panting as she laid on her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe platform she stood on groaned with the added weight of the two amazons.  May leaned down and hugged her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax and Lavaridge Joy could only watch with wide mouths at the sight of the mega beast.  For all his studies of Pokemon, somethings Max didn't understand quite fully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, when Vena's tail went up, a large, wet slit was visible.  And just minutes ago gushes of fluids came out, dampening the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need . .  We need to get them to give over that rock,\" Joy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if you touch that, you'll become like her!\" Max yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps if we hold it in some tongs we would be safe,\" Joy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plan worked.  The trainer's Pokemon got through the brigade of Clefairy.  They split up and looked around, looking for the meteor piece that was the likely cause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrock held his breath as Blissey moved out of sight.  \"Please be safe,\" he whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlissey tilted her head as she came to a large, strange rock.  Could this be the cause?  Not unfamiliar with heavy lifting, she ignored her trainer's advice and lifted up the rock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute, it moaned loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrock's spine went cold when he heard the cry of his Pokemon.  \"Blissey!\" he called out.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to get past the 6 foot tall Clefairy held the line.  Strong as they seemed, Steelix would likely be able to move them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May?\" came a voice.  May looked past her friend at the tiny brother and Joy.  \"May, please give us that rock,\" Joy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so,\" May said.  she pulled the rock from Vena's vine and slipped it into the gap between her breasts.  \"Vena, can you get up?\"  The mighty beast roared and rose.  \"Give me a ride out of here.\"  Vena nodded and let May climb up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA normal Venusaur couldn't jump very well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis beast was far from normal.  From a standing position, the now 800lb+ beast carried the 300lb+ woman and itself over the springs and into the center of town.</span></div></div>",

At first the three humans had no clue what it was, besides very obviously female.  It was about equal with the two others.  The human head was a soft pink in color.  On her chest were snow white orbs on pink skin.  A row of white orbs created a skirt effect.  A liquid was dripping from between her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer muscles flexed with every movement.  She was carrying a rock in her powerful arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d Brock said with worry.  \u201cDon\u2019t tell me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho is it Brock?\u201d Misty asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt appears to be his Blissey,\u201d Joy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bulked up Blissey stopped about eight feet from the humans.

What she was about to, she did it for him.  For her Brock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrock was stunned, unsure what to say.

They each cried in pain before letting loose a long moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom within her bag, one ball was disturbed.  A tiny pink kitty appeared aind looked up at the Mega May.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwe, look at the cute kitty.  Come, rest here,\u201d May said as she lifted the Skitty up to her chest.  A familiar blue glow appeared and Skitty mewed before moaning in pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay glanced to the side when Nurse Joy came out of the Pokemon Center.  She had a binocular of some sort in her hands.  And Mini Max was writing something down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho cared?  May looked back to her growing feline  She was looking more like a fit persain than a skitty, but still keeping the fluffy tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax and Joy weren\u2019t the only eyes watching May.  Flannery watched with wide eyes and a smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have got to get that rock or find one on my own,\u201d the gym leader said.  She walked to the muscular woman on the mega Venusaur.  May glanced over to Flannery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Flannery,\u201d May said as Skitty began yowling and shaking.  \u201cWhat do you need?\u201d  Flannery watched as something shot from the backside of the enlarged Skitty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want to grow like you.  How did you do it?\u201d Flannery asked.  May smiled as Skitty started to purr.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVena, help her up,\u201d May said.  The thick vine reached out and lifted the fiery Gym Leader up and before her trainer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting on the hard muscular lap, May held Flannery there.  \u201cVena, let\u2019s get going,\u201d May said.  Vena roared and ran out of town.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no.  So that\u2019s why the TV won\u2019t work,\u201d Delia Ketchum said.  When she tried contacting Professor Oak, the signal was dead.  Now she knew why.  The receiver dish was broken.  Something ripped it from the roof.  Walking out, she noticed a strange stone not far from the dish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKneeling down, she picked it up.  \u201cIs this a Moon Stone?\u201d she whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty ripped the remains of her clothes from her body.  Her bra was barely surviving her new breasts.  Her body was glistening with sweat.  Down by her feet, the slivers of stone that entered her had been pushed out from her expanding body.  There wasn\u2019t even a blemish where they were in her.  Her body\u2019s beautiful muscles pumped up with every breath.  The titanic tomboy was close to seven feet tall.  Her body was similar to what one would see on a professional Machamp Muscle Contest.  (What she did not know was while she did have bigger muscles than May, her breasts were smaller by a few inches.  Upper G-cup would just have to do).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat . . . This feels amazing,\u201d she whispered as she touched her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell me about it,\u201d came another feminine voice.  Misty looked over and up at Nurse Joy.  She was taller than her before their transformation and it showed even now.  While lacking the pumped out muscles, Joy favored a professional gymnast look.  Lean but strong muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeavy panting made both women turn further down the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrock was lacking any clothes after he burst free of his clothes.  His mighty penis, however, wasn\u2019t visible.  His Blissey was leaning over it, sucking the mighty rod for all its worth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need to find Ash,\u201d Misty said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need to examine the benefits of this transformation,\u201d Joy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlannery stepped off Vena and onto the rocky terrain.  They were about 6 miles from home but got here in just under 5 minutes.  She watched May step off and pull from her breasts the rock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t give it to you, but I will allow you to use it,\u201d May said.  \u201cNow, are you ready?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne moment,\u201d Flannery said.  From her side, she released three Pokemon.  Torkoal, Rapidash, and Arcanine looked at the mighty Vena.  \u201cDon\u2019t worry guys.  Nothing bad is going to happen.\u201d  May nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing bad at all,\u201d she said before putting the gem close to Flannery.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>May watched with a perverted smile.  After some thought, Flannery removed her tight clothes and stood nearly nude, only her underwear covering her groin remained on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m ready,\u201d she said.  May nodded and reached forward.  The space rock glowed once more and Flannery felt a wave of something pass over her.  The gym leader groaned in discomfort before a rush of pleasure came to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore they could react, May put the gem close to Rapidash, Arcanine, and Torkoal.  Each one collapsed a little before moaning in pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly each one began to grow larger in their own ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlannery\u2019s hair grew longer so even held up it fell to her backside.  Her body slowly built up and up giving her a thin appearance compared to May\u2019s bulk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArcanine was growing like Vena:  a boulder that only got bigger.  Beneath his fur coat, muscles pumped up more and more, pushing the fire dog higher and higher.  From between the legs, a mighty sheath opened and a large penis emerged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVena roared with anticipation and turned about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuper Skitty looked to Torkoal as the pokemon more grew wider than tall.  Even with a small increase in height, the phallic member that now hung was nothing to laugh at, proportionally mind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRapidash neighed as its thin legs became thicker and thicker.  The odds of one of these legs giving out or breaking from stress disappeared all together.  Each one was becoming like thick steel rods.  The hooves dug deeper into the ground as the pumped up pokemon was getting stronger and stronger.  From between its legs, the phrase \u201chung like a Rapidash\u201d could no longer apply to this fire horse.  Even the neck and horn thickened in strength.  The manes of flame grew hotter and hotter.  Blazing 20 feet tall when the horse ejaculated onto the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArcanine roaded and rushed to Vena\u2019s offered opening and slammed into the plant beast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlanner gasped as she blinked into awareness.  Her panties were super moist now.  They were so tight the might have been a second skin.  She looked at May and realized she was taller once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat . . That was amazing,\u201d the gym leader said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know.  I can\u2019t give this rock away so easily,\u201d May said.  Flannery nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.  We need to make more people grow.  Make some nice muscle hunks for us,\u201d Flannery said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.  I like the idea of being so much larger than my guy,\u201d May said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMimey ran outside when he heard Delia scream in euphoria.  He looked at the giant muscular woman laying on the ground.  He moved close, scared of what just happened.  His eyes fell on the I-cup breasts, not noticing the stone on the ground.  He didn\u2019t notice the glow of the rock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTracey?\u201d came a voice from the lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Professor?\u201d Tracey replied, coming into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t contact Delia.  I wanted to see if she heard from Ash recently.  With these strange events from these meteor strikes, it feels like something he could be aware about,\u201d Professor Oak said.  Tracey said nothing but considered just how many times the past few years when the world was in crisis and some danger abound, Ash was always close by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright.  I\u2019ll go see how the Pokemon are doing here,\u201d Tracey said.  The old man nodded and went out the front of the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty walked out of Mt. Moon.  Her Politoed was next to her.  Before getting too far, she have him a piece of the meteor and soon she had a hulking mass of toad standing five feet tall on his hind legs and looked able to bench press a rhyhorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked out into the open air where some reporters from different regions were watching this side of the mountain for any news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing a seven foot tall amazon with muscular pokemon certainly was that.  They got close with their cameras and microphones.  Misty just smiled and threw some shards of the meteor at them.  Ty and Gabby, Kinsey and Tevin, and a few others flinched as the small shards struck them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow you can be your own story,\u201d Misty said as she walked by, ignoring the pain the people were in.  She still had a few gems which could be used when she got to the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh groaned as he came around.  Glancing about, felt his hands still bound.  The wound cut to his hand was still healing.  It was the same chamber as before.  On the other side of the chamber, Pikachu and his Pokemon belt were out of reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>When will this end?</i> he thought.  He was kidnapped from the woods by a mysterious figure.  He woke up in this chamber where strange glyphs covered the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlood of a Hero.  That\u2019s what was said to be needed to call something called the God Stone down to the planet as it came close.  His captor was certainly elated this morning, but Ash didn\u2019t pay the words any heed.  There would be time for that later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled on his bonds, trying to escape but couldn\u2019t.  \u201cPikachu, you alright?\u201d  His little buddy groaned in pain.  Badly injured, in need of medical help, and bound by rubber straps.  Some Rhydon were closeby, always drawing Pikachu\u2019s attacks, so he couldn\u2019t knock open one of Ash\u2019s other Pokemon.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ash heard heavy footsteps and what sounded like heaving moaning coming down the hall.  He lowered his head and closed his eyes most of the way.  He expected Butch and Cassidy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat came in did not look like them.  The first to enter was a truly Adonis-like man.  His short cropped hair, pecks the sizes of hub caps, legs that looked like they were stolen from a Machamp.  His hard belly shifted a little as he chuckled.  His thick penis hung flacid as he entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman next to him was almost identical in body shape, save for the huge mounds of soft flesh on her chest.  Her orange hair hung freely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was amazing,\u201d the bulked up Butch said.  \u201cWe should have done that years ago.\u201d  The curvy Cassidy smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou were truly a surprise.  I never knew you had such passion inside of you,\u201d Cassidy said.  She turned her head to Ash\u2019s feigning sleep.  \u201cAnd it is all thanks to him.\u201d  Ash closed his eyes, not wanting them to know he was awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore footsteps were heard, but they were softer like there was padding on the feet.  Ash felt something move behind him.  \u201cNo!\u201d Butch yelled and grabbed something close to and pulled it back.  There was a yelp.  Pikachu started yelling something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou too!  Get away!\u201d Cassidy yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSableye,\u201d came a voice.  Glancing to the side, a taller than normal Sableye passed by.  But it was like the two humans, bulked up but not as much.  It\u2019s eyes, however, had a strange glow about them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to risk him growing, so you stay back!\u201d Cassidy yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre we even sure he can grow?  Nothing in the legends said he should,\u201d Butch said.  Ash didn\u2019t need to see to know the glare Cassidy was giving Butch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want to take that chance?\u201d she asked.  \u201cNow, phase 2 is complete.  The meteor here and we can move to phase 3.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes.  To grow even more,\u201d Butch laughed.  \u201cAnd once we\u2019re done, we\u2019ll bury this temple so no one can learn how to undo our tasks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd then we can take over not just Team Rocket but the world,\u201d Cassidy cackled.  The pair laughed and Ash chanced a glance.  They were on the altar, backs to him, and what hard backsides they now sported.  The silver bowl with what he assumed was his blood was waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around some more, he saw a giant Granbull rubbing her neck where it loooked like the chokechain collar was just pulled.  Sableye was looking about and noticed Ash.  He smiled and revealed all his teeth, the same eerie glow as his eyes and chest gems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAncient powers of the sky, we bring together your blessing with the gift of the hero,\u201d Cassidy said, \u201cWe anoint your gift with him blessing.  Unite them and unleash our true potential.\u201d  There was a timber to Cassidy\u2019s voice as she spoke.  The walls vibrated, just like they did the first ritual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDead silence followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, so now we let it soak for either a half an hour or an hour and it should be done,\u201d Cassidy said.  The translation was not exact in this area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFeels like we\u2019re making a cake,\u201d Butch said.  Cassidy turned and smiled at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPersonally, I want something more meaty than that,\u201d she said as she came down the stone steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh you read my mind,\u201d Butch said as he followed.  \u201cYou two, keep watch.  Don\u2019t let anyone near that bowl, understand?!\u201d  Both Pokemon nodded and the mighty humans left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPikachu began saying something to the pumped up Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweet nectar splashed over Brock\u2019s face as he continued to lick the beautiful and untouched flower of Joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAmazing Brock.  You are amazing,\u201d she whispered. She rolled onto the hard earth but wasn\u2019t fazed by it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Brock said.  He rose and looked at his Bliss licking her lips clean from the load he just shot.  \u201cThis might just be the best day every.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh look!\u201d Joy said.  Brock looked at her breasts and then hand, following it to another spot where a strange looking Geodude was hovering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat color.  It looks like the meteor\u2019s color.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow could that be?\u201d Joy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGeodudes eat rocks.  What if because it is a rock type, it can\u2019t grow muscles but it can absorb thr traits of the rocks it eats,\u201d Brock said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, it could have the same effects as the meteor itself,\u201d Joy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly one way to find out,\u201d Brock said, rising up and walking towards the strange Geodude.  He reached for his balls but didn\u2019t find them.  He then felt a warm hand and something pushing into it.  Looking down, Blissey was there and his balls were in her hands.  His <i>Pokeballs</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is truly amazing,\u201d Joy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProfessor Oak was in a bit of a shock right now.  He went to see Delia Ketchum.  What he found was an amazon that looked like her and had a glint in her eyes he had not seen in many years.  Not caring she was nude, she reached for the professor and kissed him with more passion than he had known since his wife died many years ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOld feelings bubbled inside the man as he looked up at the beautiful woman.  \u201cSam, I am yours if you want,\u201d she whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing heavily, the human professor nodded and felt Delia\u2019s strong hands unbuckle his pands and pulling them down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Mime, correction, the very clearly Miss Mime worked in the garden, lifting up the dish and moving it aside.  She collected the few strange rocks and put them aside.  She watched as her human friend began making strange noises with the grey haired one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh didn\u2019t know what they were saying but Pikachu and these two altered Pokemon were having some heavy conversation.  Granbull seemed angry or upset about something and would occasionally look at him.  Sableye would move around in the shadows but still would respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, I don\u2019t know how much you can understand me, but please, release me.  If you come with me, I\u2019ll treat you better than those two will.  They\u2019re drunk on their power and want to get even more.  I don\u2019t think it will stop them from hurting you Granbull,\u201d Ash said.  \u201cPlease.  Release me.\u201d</span></div></div>",

He moved to the pond about a mile from the lab and on instinct picked up his pencil and started to work.  Taking out his measuring binoculars, he went to work at the chance of a lifetime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA piece of the meteor fell in the ranch and it was found by Ash's Pokemon.  What's more, they seemed to be sharing it among each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe herd of Tauros, once just over 4 and a half feet had added two feet of height could to their bodies.  Their horns looked sharper and had grown out as well.  The body of the bull pokemon was already like a tank but now, with the expanded legs, lit looked like one could plow through a steel wall and not even be slowed down.  Beneath their massive bodies hung truly impressive specimens of manhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnorlax was still in its sleeping phase.  Small miracles because the once half-ton mass now looked double the weight with how much muscle it was packing.  At a height of nearly ten feet, the once portly Pokemon looked like it could cause a lot of damage if it awoke and needed food.  \"Better make more of those blocks,\" Tracey gulped.  And with it on its back, a truly massive member was exposed and had drawn in the attention of another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBayleaf was just short of a Meganium's average height at 5'6\".  Her body looked like it was sculpted from diamonds.  She could probably out run a normal Tauros now.  She was sucking and licking Snorlax's member.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracey made a note on the top of this sketch to keep out of sight of children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Tracey saw him.  The cause of the growth.  Charizard scratched the hard belly now ripped with muscles.  His thick arms looked like they could squeeze a human head clear off the shoulders.  In the thick meaty hand was a glowing rock.  He waved his mighty wings and even at this distance he could feel the breeze from the powerful wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Charizard out of the way, Tracey saw a seven foot Heracross sucking hard on a a thin but still muscled Sceptile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is getting insane,\" Tracey muttered.  But despite his great ability to see things at the distance, Tracey didn't notice a 3'4\" tank of a Bulbasaur walking up behind him with a meteor in her thick vine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wave of heat passed over the human watcher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSableye came over to Ash and with a single swipe, the ropes were broken and Ash rose up to his feet tenderly.  He looked and Granbull ripped apart Pikachu's binds.  His little buddy cried happily. Pikachu jumped up onto Granbull's shoulder and worked on the unpleasant collar.   Ash sighed in relief looked up at the alter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't understand how he was responsible.  He didn't know why these Pokemon were so buffed up.  He just knew the key to getting more power was up there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't let them keep this,\" Ash said softly.  Slowly he walked up the steps saw the stone in the pool of blood.  The shard was a circular shape but not the color of Sableyes's gems.  It was either clear as crystal now or blood red.  In the dim light it was hard to tell.  Taking a moment to breath, he reached into the pool of his own blood and gripped the stone with his right hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when his hand felt  as though it was on fire.  A painful searing sensation came and went quickly but when turned his hand over, the stone wasn't being held by his hand.  It was now imbedded into his hand.  A slight burn was around where the gem touched skin.  Its beautiful red color.  A gentle warmth filled his hand now, like he dipped it in water.  Looking at his blood, he gripped the bowl with his other hand and scattered the blood on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, let's get out of here,\" Ash said when he heard the clattering of metal.  Pikachu cried happily.  Ash turned and saw the collar on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh smiled when he felt his right hand tingle.  Lifting it up, he felt lightheaded.</span></div></div>",

On instinct, Ash pointed his palm at Sableye.  A faint red light shot from Ash's hand, striking the blue eyed Sableye.  He let out a low moan and Ash could only leave his mouth hanging as the pokemon grew larger and larger.  Sabeye stopped about level with Ash's chin. His muscles were still thin but firmer now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only now did ash realize his hand felt better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is going on?\" Ash muttered before walking past the enlarged Pokemon.  He walked to the doors and saw no one down them.  A heavy thump was heard and Ash turned to see Granbull on all fours.  Her breasts just avoiding touching the ground.  Pikachu was on her back crying happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You would let me ride you?\" Ash asked.  Granbull nodded and Ash went to her.  Picking up his bag and Pokeballs, he climbed up onto her back.  He pulled Pikachu to his gut.  \u201cLet\u2019s go girl.\u201d  She held the human teen easily and started running down the ancient hallways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe empowered dog made heavy thumps as she ran.  At the end of the hallway, a light was blocked by two hulking figures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell!\u201d Cassidy yelled.  \u201cYou stupid bitch!  Don\u2019t make me-\u201d  She was shut up when Sableye appeared before her and gave a glowing headbutt.  Cassidy fell hard.  Butch looked shocked and was unprepared as Granbull checked her shoulder into his gut.  She blasted into the open air and Ash saw he was high on a mountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the amazing view could wait as Granbull just continued rushing down the mountain path.  Sableye appeared behind Ash and held on.  Ash tried to ignore the thing poking into his lower back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlannery returned Pokemon save Arcanine and watched as he finished up on Vena.  Both roared so loudly the ground shook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShould be interesting if an egg comes from this,\u201d Flannery said as Arcanine backed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.  Will the child be normal size or super size,\u201d May said as she approached her comrade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m going to go to see if anything fell on Mt. Chimney,\u201d Flannery said as she climbed on her pokemon\u2019s back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you see my tiny brother, tell him he is missing out on a great time.  I got to go,\u201d May said.  She climbed onto Vena.  \u201cLet\u2019s go south girl.\u201d  Vena roared and started running quickly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh rolled off Granbull.  The trail behind them was torn up from her mighty paws.  Sableye picked around the ground as Ash felt the tingling come once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay.  Let\u2019s try this,\u201d Ash said.  \u201cLittle buddy, mind if you grow?\u201d Pikachu shook his head.  He signaled he wanted to get stronger too.  \u201cThanks.\u201d  Pointing his hand at his oldest Pokemon, nothing happened.    He tilted his head to one side and approached.  He touched the gem and nothing happened.  Ash felt his buddy push the hand up and he allowed it to happen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe palm pointed at Granbull and she moaned in pleasure.  Slowly at first then building quickly, she grew taller and taller past 7 feet tall.  Her tail grew out thick and club-like.  Her jaw thicken most as her barrel of a chest grew larger with softer breasts forming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay.  So only Pokemon already changed by whatever changed them at first can be altered by me.\u201d  Pikachu jumped up onto the giant Pokemon\u2019s shoulder and licked her face.  Ash sighed and wondered what to do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he thought about it, while draining, it felt nice to grow both Pokemon.  He always wanted to help Pokemon get stronger and now he was doing it literally.  Somehow, this stone in his palm was giving him an amazing power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked up when a shadow was cast over him and saw Granbull leaning down.  She licked him with a rough tongue and went on all fours once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re right.  We should keep going,\u201d Ash said.  He looked over to Sableye.  In his hands were some small glowing rocks.  \u201cIs that what is making Pokemon grow?\u201d he asked.  Sableye smiled.</span></div></div>",

She was deep in the Eterna Forest after hearing that a piece of the meteorite had fallen in the large forest.  She had heard this news from none other than Lucas her friend and assistant of Professor Rowan.  The two friends had met up in the forest and decided it would be faster if they split up to look for it.  So Cynthia went one way and Lucas went the other way.   There were at least two dozen other people in the forest that were looking for the piece of meteorite of course.  It seemed that everybody was  going after pieces of the meteorite.  <br>\r\n                    <br>\r\n                     Cynthia made her way through the forest, occasionally running into people along the way.  Nobody challenged her to a Pokemon battle much to her surprise.  Normally she would be hounded for a pokemon battle everywhere she went.  Being the Sinnoh champion did paint a target on Cynthia's back and trainers from all over would come to her to challenge her.  But not today it seemed.   Either they were far too busy looking for the piece or they figured what was the point since Cynthia's Garchomp had yet to be defeated--or showed any signs of pain for that matter.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                         Finally Cynthia entered a rather remote area of the forest completely devoid of humans.  She saw lots of Pokemon; mostly insect-types but she did see a few Pikachu--which were super rare in Sinnoh.   <br>\r\n                            It was approaching evening when Cynthia stumbled upon a rock in the middle of a small clearing.   She almost fell to the ground but managed to grab a nearby tree and kept her balance.  She looked down and saw the rock she had tripped over was quite a large one about the size of a basketball.  The rock was emitting a light blue glow.  She smiled and picked it up without thinking; she hadn't planned on getting the piece of meteorite in order for her to grow muscles like that Machoke did, she just wanted the reward for finding it.  But fate it seemed had other plans.  <br>\r\n                             As soon as she touched the rock, she felt tingling all over her body.  It was ten seconds later that the changes began.  Cynthia simply exploded with her muscles expanding; her biceps doubling in size and her legs lengthening.  Her thighs quickly became thicker than tree trunks.  Her already large chest ballooned to three times their normal size, easily becoming bigger than any known cup size.  Her pecs also became bigger and she gained 6-pack abs that quickly became a 8-pack....and then an impossible 12-pack!    Needless to say her clothing was torn apart by this.   Cynthia's cries of pain turned into cries of pleasure as she felt a strong tingling in her nether regions and her sex juices fell to the forest floor.  <br>\r\n                                \"I'm an amazon...\" panted Cynthia, looking over her new transformed body.  She couldn't look over her mountain-like breasts.  When she flexed her biceps, the bulge was bigger than her entire head!    Judging by the trees that were around her, she guessed that she was now 15 feet tall!   She was holding the piece of meteorite in her hand.  <br>\r\n                                  \"Cynthia!\" cried a voice.   \"what's wrong?!  Are you  hurt?  I heard screaming and.....<i>good god</i>!\" <br>\r\n                                    Cynthia turned around and looked down.  She needed to lean far forward to see past her breasts.  It was her tiny friend Lucas looking up at her in total awe.  <br>\r\n                          \"I see you found....the meteorite\" stammered Lucas backing up a step. <br>\r\n                           \"Yes I did\" said Cynthia, her voice was slightly deeper now.   She smiled at Lucas to show him there was nothing to be afraid of.  </span></div></div>",

Everyone had gone to bed early to be ready to face the challenges that awaited them the next morning.  Dragonite rested back against a large tree enjoying the fresh air of spring. Though it had not rained the past few days the air heald sweet scents of blooming flowers, and fresh dew about it. Dragonite opened an eye lid checking all was well in the field. Emolga rested near by, rising gently against the young axew that had travled with Iris the longest. Exadrill, and Gibill ad opted to stay inside thiere pokeballs, in th event they where caught by a storm during the night.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Dragonite snorted at how cowary they where, espicially Gibill, though young he was still a dragon and should not be scared by something like rain even if he was part ground type. A drGon was strong, they faced adversity head, on never backing down. Dragonite  snilled closeing his eye once more breathing in silently, smilling to himself as he recalled the fights he had won over the years. The Hydrigen, the boy Ash's charizard, and sevral more al pushed him to his limit, and showed him that there where still worth challngers out there.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Of corse there had been many challenges  list as well. That loud girl who claimed  to be a dragon slayer, and her bear having won a few matches, and some of the sparring matches with Charizard. They had been failers tha showed he had a ways to grow to be the strongest. Dragonite sighed silently these thoughts filling his stomach with a small blaze. This wa spart of the reason why he and the others where here.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0They had returned to the dragon village for a moment of rest, when the strange stones fell from the sky, when reports came in on wht they had done, to the Machoke, and several pokemon later on, the village.saw both the beniffit, and danger of such stones. Simply touching one increased an individual's strength sevrel fold, but if such stones frll into the wrong hands such as with team Rocket could cause much harm. So Iris and sevreal other trainers had been sent out to find an retrive any stones they could find, if the rumors that some had fall into the hills, and forest near by where true.<br>\r\nDragonite got up stretched slightly, as sleep eluded him. True that they where on a mission, but Iris did not mind his occasional stroll, as long as he didn\u2019t cause trouble.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It was actually an intresting idea, growing in such a way. Dragons where usually well muscled even if they didn't appear it, and if he wa shonest the attention he recived from so.e of the femalles wouldn't be half bad either. He always had gotten some playful looks and invites when they stayed in the village, and while Dragonite did flirt back it hadent gonne beyond flirting. Not that Dronite lacked anything mind you, the more lewed females (Dragonite, blaimed the trainers) had asured him of thag, but more so because he actuallu didnt have any experience insuch a maner. It was a bit embarrassing but true. As both a drratini and dragonair he had been seen more as cute and a play thing then a sutible mate which had left him some what embarsed when ever wuch matters came up. But maybe a little boost was all he need.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Looking around Dragonite realized he bad travled a fairs way away fromt he camp, the forest seemin much darker than the meadow where they had stopped. Looking around for a familiar path Dragonite notted a small glimiar a small ways off. Curious he wallked twords the light, Dragonite not worried as he could simply fly up and finde the camp again. The light grew brighter as he closed in, and as the trees parted to a new clearing Dragonite saw a metiorite fragment, like the one said to have empowered the Manchoke...</span></div></div>",

They had entered the forest the night before to search for a mysterious Dragon-type Pok\u00e9mon that had been sighted, but became side-tracked after a meteorite from the meteor shower had landed somewhere in the forest. To their luck, no other humans had entered the forest, meaning they could be the first ones to find it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLooking down, Iris noticed a blue-skinned humanoid Pok\u00e9mon. \u201cAxew, look! A Sawk!\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cThose are rare around here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAxew ew!\u201d replied her friend, looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIris pat his head. \u201cIt looks like it\u2019s heading somewhere\u2026 Maybe it\u2019s looking for that meteorite like we are!\u201d She continued watching the Karate Pok\u00e9mon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSawk, not knowing of the trainer\u2019s presence, began walking away, towards a small clearing with several large patches of grass. Iris followed, leaping from branch to branch. Axew stayed in her hair, careful to not fall out during the jumps. As the Fighting-type calmly ventured into the clearing, Iris jumped down and landed on the ground with a quiet thud, trying not to attract its attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSawk walked over to one of the patches and parted the grass. A faint glow emanated from it, catching Iris\u2019s attention. She slowly snuck up to the Pok\u00e9mon, wondering what the glow was. It bent over and picked up a large glowing rock. Iris gasped in surprise. \u201cIt\u2019s the meteorite!\u201d she yelled aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe Sawk turned around, startled. \u201cMeep!\u201d squeaked Iris, covering her mouth. \u201cMe and my big mouth!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBefore either of them could do anything, however, the meteorite in Sawk\u2019s began to glow. It grunted in a mix of pain and ecstasy, dropping the rock. Iris, unsure of what to do, watched, a bead of sweat rolling down her cheek.</span></div></div>",

Iris  started to feel a weird heat inside her  while the pokemon flexed his new muscles, biceps the sizes of melons, tights ticker than trees, an mighty 18-pack, a massive member....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" !!!

Growing? The soft ebony flesh ballooned outwards and suddenly each breast became more than a handful could hold. <br>\r\nIris leaned forward as her new breasts weight her down but suddenly she feels a tingling in her back and the stress of her tits vanished, she quickly leaned backwards as the weight leaves puzzled about it, Iris looked down at her still growing cleavage and noticed a strange line running in her chest beneath her skin and between her breasts, she keeps wondering about what was that but then seems that it was widening and her chest seems wider<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh!! -!\" she yelled and quickly looked to her side, her shoulder looked bigger and rounder.<br>\r\n\" I am ...\" she looked at her arms which now completely filled the sleeves of her dress.<br>\r\n\"I am ...\" she quickly untie the jacket she kept around her waist, her legs now were ticker and curvier, and when she was watching, her buttock suddenly became rounder and bigger.<br>\r\n\"I am.. \" Iris tentatively flexed her right arm and intermediately a ball formed beneath her sleeve tearing it a little, Iris flexed as hard as she could, her arm exploded in size tearing her sleeve and proudly displaying a bicep the size of a lemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris grinned madly, her nipples became erect and a pleasant tingle fill her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I AM A SUPERGIRL !!! \" Iris screamed and place her hands in front of her breast holding the front of her dress, and with a single movement ripped her blouse into pieces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer C-cup (but still growing) breast bounced freely, her upper body now looked like belonging to a female fitness competitor or a professional athlete but not for too long.

There was just red marks where she hit the floor, and a small headache .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe keep searching her body when suddenly felt a tingling in her stomach, Georgia quickly unbuttoned her blouse and lifted the green shirt below, she and Beartic gasped of what they saw, Georgia stomach now spotted a spectacular 6-pack, she touch them and gasped again at how hard they feel and how her obliques suddenly grew giving her abs more firmness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a quick leap, Geogia stood up in her feet and stare in awe as her whole body start changing.

As the Pok\u00e9mon gang finds pieces, they experience some extreme growth...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the record, I'd prefer it if the growth only occurs if the meteorite pieces actually touch their skin, not just their clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nALLOWED: Muscle growth (both male and female), breast expansion (girls only), penis expansion (guys only), sex, GT / GTS (to an extent, keep it under 50 feet), growth of the Pok\u00e9mon (keep it realistic, i.e. no muscular Rock-types)<br>\r\nNOT ALLOWED: Incest, hermaphrodites, vore, scat<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWant more info? Here's the original story idea over on my deviantART account.
