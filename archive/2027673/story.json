            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Margaery Tyrell looked on with a mixture of disgust and wonder. She stood in attendance at the King's Court, the late morning sun shining through the stained glass window of the Seven Pointed Star that sat behind the Iron Throne. She wore an eloquent dress that was the work of a well renowned seamstress from her home of Highgarden It had cost more than what an average village produces in a summer, but one can't look a pauper if they wanted to play the Game of Thrones. Margaery's eyes were transfixed at the woman that was once both the wife and mother of kings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA poet had once called Cersei Lannister the most gorgeous woman in all of Westeros, but he might have recanted that statement if he saw her now. She was still a beautiful woman, but now she sat lazily sprawled across a cushioned bench at the right hand of the throne, looking nearly ten stone heavier than she had but a scant half - year ago. She tore handful after handful off the roasted carcass of a man sized boar before shoving the flesh in her mouth and swallowing, barely chewing. The lower half of the beast was missing, churning away in the Queen-Reagent's protruding gut very audibly, even from some thirty feet away. She stopped only to gulp down cups of wine or to belch loud enough to cause the court to fall silent. She wore a grease stained red silk blanket as a form of makeshift dress, her once radiant golden hair messy and unwashed. With piercing green eyes, she looked lethargically to the man who stood before the Iron Throne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had the demeanor of a peasant about him, about fifty years of age with receding black hair. He looked weathered from a arduous life of labor, but the only look in his eyes was sorrow. He prostrated himself before he began to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your grace, I am but a poor farmer from the town of Brightmeade, up in the Riverlands. When Tully called for soldiers, all the boys left, and soon after The Mountain That Rides fell on our village with fire and sword. Most managed to escape his fury, but he burnt our wheat fields, stole our silver, and slaughtered our animals. We took refuge in Riverrun, but when word got around that your brother, Ser Jamie, was coming to lay siege, a bunch of the soldiers threw us out the gate so we wouldn't take up food. Ser Jamie was merciful enough to allow us to return to our homes, but all that was there was ash. I walked all the way here to ask your highness, if there is anything, anything at all that the crown can do for these poor souls before we starve to death come winter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCersei turned her eyes away from the man and back to her meal. \"I'm afraid the whole of the realm bleeds from the Stark's insurrection.\" She tore off the right half of the boar's ribcage, breaking off a rib at a time and sucking the meat off it in a fraction of a second before tossing the bone aside and grabbing another. \"The crown has little to offer, so I'm afraid I must *Urppppp* deny your request.\" she continued, wet pieces of meat flying from her mouth while she belched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, but Your Grace,\" he started, shock in his face, \"The crown's larders are clearly full! That boar could feed my entire village, and you can afford to choke it down by yourself? Please, I beg of you, we need that food!\" the farmer exclaimed, rising to his feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCersei slurped the last rib into her stomach and tore off the other half, continuing to devour it. \"First, you slander the late Ser Gregor's name by declaring him a brigand, and than you think to council me on how the crown's resources should be used? Perhaps I can help the people of Brightmeade.\" She added, the last rib sliding into her. \"For crimes of slander of a noble, and defiance of royal precedent, I hereby sentence you to death on behalf of King Tommen Baratheon, the first of His name.\" Cersei belched loudly before turning her gaze back to the boar she was so desperate to fit inside of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your grace!\" Margaery spouted autonomously as two Gold Cloaks seized the pleading man and began dragging him from the court, \"This man has done no crimes! It would be unlawful to incarcerate him!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe queen reagent tore off the front right leg of the boar and began devouring it. \"Ah, always a good little queen of the people, aren't you Margaery? Very well then, I won't give him to the dungeons. Gold Cloaks *Braaaaaph* execute this man.\" As one Gold Cloak drew his sword, she tore off the front of the boar's leg and swallowed it. As the other forced the man onto his knees and held him still, Cersei did the same to the back of the leg. As the first Gold Cloak brought his blade down into the old man's neck, the queen reagent belched loudly and tore off the other leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargaery's shocked eyes fluttered between the decapitated corpse and the queen, who tore of the flesh of the boar's leg. Cersei had finally done it, she lost her edge, there was no way the common man would forget that the queen ordered the death of an impoverished serf while she ate half her body weight in meat. As more Gold Cloaks ran out to remove the corpse, Cersei finished the leg, and quickly devoured the meat on the beast's shoulders before tearing the flesh off the animal's face and tossing the bare skull to the side. She than reached for a flagon of wine, gulping it down with haste before belching for nearly twelve straight seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is all the crown will hear today, as what remains of yesterday's feast is currently assaulting my royal personage.\" Cersei said, grasping to the area of her belly beneath the massive orb that was once the body of a boar. \"Handmaidens, if you would escort me, I have need of the privy.\" Her handmaidens came, and with great effort, hoisted her to her feet and away from the courtroom. Servants hastily ran to where the queen regent was sat, cleaning up the bones, which Margaery noticed were picked nearly clean. It took two men to hoist the bucket of bones out of the courtroom before the throng cleared out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargaery, livid over what she had witnessed, stormed off to her room, servants in tow.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Margaery pushed her way past her servants, and threw open the door into her chambers, where a very bewildered looking coal boy looked up from his flame. The soot covered boy hastily bowed and uttered \"Your Grace\" before scurrying past Margaery, into the hallways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Paper and Ink.\" Margaery called out as she walked over to her closet and held out her arms in a \"t\" pose. Her two handmaidens, Mira and Sera, quickly began to undress her from her elaborate gown as her servants fetched the writing utensils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And send for dinner to be sent to my chamber. I would fancy roast swan this evening.\" the Queen spoke in a softer tone, reigning in her anger. More servants hastened to her wishes as she was finally undressed, standing in but her small clothes. She placed a hand gingerly on her abdomen and turned to her handmaidens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All this talk of executions and starving villagers makes one utterly famished, does it not?\" Margaery spoke as her servants left her with her handmaidens. A slight nod and quieted \"Yes\" was elicited from Sera, as a more impassioned \"Yes, Lady Margaery.\" came from Mira.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No appetite, Sera? I could understand. Seeing an unnecessary death is always saddening.\" she said as the duo began dressing her into her nightgown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that, My Lady, it's the Queen Reagent. That boar was twice as large as I am, and she ate it in less then twenty minutes. How can she even do such a thing?\" Sera spoke in a quick, uncomposed voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You would be surprised at the capacity of a woman who was born with a little talent and whose had a little practice. And Cersei was born with a lot of talent, and has had much practice in the recent months. If you could manage to find enough food and commitment for the task, you would quickly begin to make progress, I'd wager.\" Margaery lectured as she was finished being dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Sera asked, inquisition on her face. \"There are others who can do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes, even here at court. Lady Taena, of Myr for one, and myself, of course.\" she said as she began to strut towards her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You?!\" Sera replied, shocked. \"You could eat an entire boar that large?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And come back for dessert.\" she said with a practiced smile. \"The Reach is the greatest producer of food in the whole of Westeros, and Highgarden lays at a crossroads of the most fertile farming, grazing, and hunting lands in The Reach. Our larders were always full, and by extent, so was I. Maybe one day I can show you two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You would honor us, Your Grace, but, if you eat so much, why aren't you... you know...\" Sera broke eye contact and looked way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Large.\" Mira finished bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't a clue. I suppose I am lucky. I always had the talent.\" Margaery said dismissively as she dipped a quill in a inkwell. \"Now, if you two will excuse yourselves; I have letters to compose, and I believe I smell roasted swan on the wind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Lady Margaery.\" Both muttered before curtsying and leaving the room, their presences shortly thereafter replaced by two men baring a silver platter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your supper, Your Grace.\" A third man spoke from the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, wonderful. Place it on my desk here.\" Margaery said, salivating from the smell. \"And send for another.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Grace?\" The man said questioningly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fetch me another.\" she reiterated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Your Grace.\" He replied with a puzzled look on him. The platter was set to her left and the cover removed, revealing a large carcass cooked a golden brown. The spice augmented two-stone heavy bird was larger then Margaery's torso, but she immediately began attacking it regardless, the three men leaving as she started. As her right hand wrote, her left grabbed pieces from the swan and brought them to her mouth. Skin, fat, meat, bone, and cartilage were all torn, chewed, and swallowed without hesitation as Margaery's hand flew across the paper. In ten minutes, her hand grasped only at air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe disappointingly gazed at the empty platter next to her. Sighing, she returned her focus to her letter. Any man could read the parchment and find a harmless letter directed to her grandmother, Lady Olenna, regarding recent feasts and balls she had attended and inquiring about the state of Highgarden, but none save Margaery and Olenna themselves could find the encoded meaning in the methodical words. It was a difficult process, but Margaery had practice and intelligence to aid her efforts, making the process much simpler. She signed her name at the bottom of the sheet as the door opened once more, revealing the same three men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you are, finally!\" Margaery nearly shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I apologize Your Grace, we brought the swan out as soon as it was... done.\" the third man said, curiously eyeing the empty platter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't bother with the spices this time then.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bring another.\" Margaery said very matter-of-factly as the platter was placed next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you wish, Your Grace.\" The Three departed as Margaery dug in with gusto, once again grinding all parts of the swan into a wet paste before gulping it down. As she did so, she read her letter's intended meaning back to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cersei bringing realm down with her. Tommen will side with me. Peasants have reason to hate Cersei. Perfect time to depose. Thoughts?\" As she translated, her hand once again grasped at nothing. She released a soft, feminine belch as she reached for another parchment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now to insinuate allliances and rewards...\" Margaery thought as she began. Several minutes later, the door opened to the same three men, another platter being carried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is taking too long. Bring it raw next time.\" Margaery said as the platter was placed next to her, not looking up from her work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" The man said with a look of disbelief on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Raw.\" Margaery said, already shoving the wing of the Swan into her maw, grinding it to bits in moments before sending it to join the mush of two swans inside of her. The three exchanged looks before leaving. In but five minutes, the bird was but a belch as Margaery felt her hunger growing, rather then shrinking. The sensation reminded her of her late teenaged years, where she would stuff herself to capacity nearly every meal. It was something she hadn't been able to do often since her arrival at King's Landing. She impatiently look towards the door for the next minute, until it opened to the three again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're taking so long!\" Margaery cried out as the two panting servers nearly dropped the platter onto her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The bird had to be plucked...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then don't pluck it this time. If I finish this swan before you're back, I'll see to it that you spend the rest of your days begging in Flea Bottom.\" Margaery said, in a voice filled with aggravation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Your Grace\" the man muttered before he and the two servers ran from the room. The uncooked swan was still whole, with head attached. This didn't bother Margaery, who chomped her way down the whole of the neck in one blood filled mouthful. She halted her work on her letters to fully devote her efforts to fitting the swan inside of her. Two minutes later, the door flew open as the last bloody mouthful of the bird slid down Margaery's throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another.\" is all Margaery said before she began eating the feathered carcass. Another two minutes passed, before the three entered the room to find another swan gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another.\" was uttered four more times, and four more swans met undignified ends before the serving man stepped forward, nearly on the verge of collapse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are no more swans, Your Grace, you have eaten every swan in the royal larder!\" Margaery paused for a moment at the utterence of this. She opened her mouth put her hand forward and pointed upwards, as though to interrupt before she belched for nearly twenty seconds straight. A gout of saliva drenched swan feathers flew from her mouth as she did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me.\" she said with a smirk. She looked down to her perfectly flat stomach and still felt great hunger. She paused for a second before continuing: \"Tell me, are there any boars in the larder?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, there is one. The Queen-Reagent was saving it for her-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want it. Now.\" Margaery said commandingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But the Queen had...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Queen-Reagent had demanded it be saved for her. The Queen demands you to bring it to her this instant.\" The man paused for a second before nodding his head and leaving the room. About ten minutes later, five men brought the beast into the room, placing it on a table opposite Margaery. It was just as large as the boar Cersei had eaten in the court room, weighing nearly fifteen stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That will be all for this evening, gentlemen. Thank you.\" Margaery said. Standing and walking to the table. All five bowed and exited as Margaery took note of the time on her water clock. Nine hours past midday. Margaery tore into the beast as fast as Wildfire through paper, biting through bone with each chomp. In a flurry, Margaery devoured the entirety of the animal. She placed a hand on her gut, whose noises had become audible, and belched loudly. She pivoted on one leg and broke wind rather loudly as she looked to the clock. It had been five minutes. She smirked and walked to her bed, feeling satisfied for the first time in a while. Not full, but definitely satisfied. Margaery laid down and quickly drifted to sleep, thirty three stone of animal happily digesting within her.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With a dawn as red as her long hair, Margaery awoke. She sighed charmingly and arose with a grace befitting her birth. She stretched, the wrinkles in her emerald, gold trimmed silk evening gown gently unfolding to reacquire the robe's original form. She laid back down for a moment, propping herself on several pillows. Here she remained for a moment, in comfort, before she suddenly felt a very powerful urge resonating from her bowels. Taking a breath, she rose off the bed, and waged her options for her relief. Her privy was a bit down the hall, and the grumbling from her flat midsection was growing more with each passing moment, while her half meter tall porcelain chamberpot was nearly adjacent to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a moment's thought, Margaery pulled on her slippers and started for her privy. As amusing it would be to watch Mira and Sera try to move the pot to empty it after she was done with it, she was rather sure it wasn't large enough to contain her most recent feast alone, not withstanding her last breakfast and lunch. Her hurried footsteps muffled by her footwear, Margaery hurriedly opened her bedroom door and started down the pink brick hall. After nearly half a minute, she reached the oaken door and nearly tore it off the hinges with strength unbefitting of her size. She then raced in, slammed the door behind her, and hastily affixed the latch, before untying her gown, throwing it off herself, pulling down her small clothes, and taking a seat. She did her best to be as polite as she could with the chorus emerging from her behind, but after a short while, she decided her comfort was more important than her servants, and released herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a nearby chamber, Mira Forrester and Sera Durwell exchanged similar looks of disgust. While the less noble of bodily functions had found their place in court since the Queen Mother had tried to replace her dead son with meat and wine, the sound emanating from the privy was still sickening to the two girls.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think that's Lady Margaery?\" Sera nearly shouted over the cacophony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Mira replied, \"You saw the servants last night. Nine swans and a man-sized boar went into her chambers. Ten empty platters came out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That can't be possible.\" Sera replied, incredulous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By just sound, it seems that there is that much is certainly exiting her.\" Mira retorted under her breath before continuing, \"And besides, we just watched Cersei eat one of those boars yesterday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's different though.\" Sera began, wheeling about, \"Cersei has a gut the size of an auroch. Lady Margaery is as slender as a birch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then she's the one to talk to about learning how to do it.\" Mira replied, intent in her stare. Sera eyed her curiously, recognizing the look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can even think about eating right now? And, not every moment needs to be a play for greater influence, Mira.\" Sera said softly, putting on her best sympathetic look while Margaery's sounds lowered to a softer tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This may be a new vogue among nobility, Sera.\" Mira replied matter-of-factly, sternness painted onto her face, \"The current Queen-Reagent is the progenitor of the court stuffing itself silly and allowing bodily functions to flow as they would, and the next Queen, Lady Margaery, seems to be not only a practitioner of this, but a master of it. People follow royalty, Sera, it may become that women who could literally eat their husbands in one sitting are seen as most desirous. If I can help my family by stuffing a dozen chickens a day down my throat, a lot of poultry is going to be on my plate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not the girl I met at Highgarden, Mira.\" Sera said disappointed, looking down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if you had any sense, you wouldn't be the girl that I met.\" Mira returned, no inflection on her voice. \"What of Lord Tarwick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What of Garibald?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been two months since King Tommen's coronation feast. Has he spoke of marriage yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we have - I- ... No. He hasn't.\" Sera admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what if he goes to a feast one day, and spies some noble girl with the right name devouring a whole lamb by herself, and he takes an interest in her, by virtue of the interest she'll make around him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I- I- He won't!\" Sera proclaimed indignantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what if he does? He's already suspicious of the Durwell \"family.\" It is rather odd that you're the only Durwell in Westeros, wouldn't you say?\" Mira continued, striking a nerve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what about you, Mira?!\" Sera snapped, \"The only Forrester left! How many brothers did you lose? Two? Or was it three? Refresh my memory!\" A very long pause occurred between the two, the room silent if not for the squelching sound of their mistress' defecation. Sera's face slowly twisted from anger, to horror at her own words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mira, I'm -\" Sera began, reaching her hand out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How dare you.\" Mira interrupted with a voice of ice. The pseudo-silence returned for a short while as the two locked eyes, before suddenly the noises from the privy ceased. The two continued staring at each other for a moment before Mira cut the silence;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, let's go serve Lady Margaery.\" Sera nodded silently as the two exited the chamber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMargaery ran the linen up and down the length of her behind several times before discarding it into the privy. She was glad she no longer had to share facilities with her noble contemporaries anymore, she could simply leave the gag-inducing smell to time, rather then lighting the candles and incense she normally had to deal with when she took relief. However, with one gurgling in her gut quieted, another began, this one inviting thoughts of breakfast.Wondering what she would have made, now that she no longer had to worry about containing herself, Margaery undid the latch and pushed open the privy door, to see...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A new noise played to Margaery's ears as she emerged from the privy. She quickly found its source further down the hallway, nearby the door of her handmaiden's quarters. There the two girls stood, nearly pushed back against the wall by a large man dressed in the colors of a Lannister House Guard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis scratched gold, black, and red armor played a wonderful analogy of the house he served; red blood and black death holding the foundation, with a shimmering gold to hide it all away. There was a time, not long ago, when a man with a lute and a song was all House Lannister needed to bring unruly subjects to heel and potential enemies to peace, but that time had passed, and the realm had noticed. The bascinet on his dented klappvisor was pulled down, leaving the only part of his person visible his mouth, where thin, stubble surrounded lips sneered to reveal teeth a shade darker then the yellow of his helm. Margaery could practically smell the onions on his breath from where he stood. In a gravelly voice that screamed of a lowborn Westerlander, he persecuted the two handmaidens. Glowering, Margaery began down the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSera instinctively shrunk back before the man. He didn't seemed interested in her in the slightest, but the sternness in his tone towards Mira definitely seemed to work much more effectively on herself then the northern girl. Mira stood stoic, a look of condescension and maybe even boredom on her face and tone as she negotiated the guard's questions with learned ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you know Ser Damien Estren?\" he demanded in a growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't.\" Mira replied coolly, meeting his gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know a coalboy by the name of Tom, and how is he related to Ser Damien's disappearance?\" he returned, the look in his eyes growing wilder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know the coalboy because he changes my coals.\" Mira answered in a bored tone. \"He's related to Ser Damien's disappearance because you mentioned both topics in the same sentence. Now if you've quite finished at trying to intimidate a Northern girl for magical answers as to the whereabouts of a Westerland knight that disappeared almost half a year ago, I have duties to attend to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You listen to me, girl,\" he began, mounting frustration evident on his voice as he pushed closer to Mira, \"the queen knows you're involved in this, and if you think you're getting out of this by playing dumb you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one here is playing dumb, Ser, you're just living it.\" Margaery interrupted, closing the gap between herself and the trio. \"To my most recent knowledge, it is a punishable offense for a commoner to threaten a noble. Has the law changed, or are you simply daft?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I -\" he started in aggression before remembering himself. \"Queen's orders.\" he said submissively before producing a small scroll with the royal seal; the Baratheon stag and Lannister lion hand in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Margaery said with a tone of scrutiny. She took the scroll, broke the seal and began to read it. \"I don't recall writing this letter.\" she continued coyly, before ripping the paper in half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" the large soldier emoted, reaching a hand out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now since my mother-in-law trusted you with this document, I presume you have your letters?\" Margaery asked of the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do, your grace.\" he replied begrudgingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There seems to be more to you then the eyes would suggest. Come, follow me. You're going to write my reply to the queen-reagent.\" Margaery commanded as she began walking towards her chambers. The man hesitated, first looking towards Margaery, then towards Mira.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't over, girl.\" he threatened as he began down the hall. Mira and Sera exchanged looks before Margaery suddenly turned about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Sera.\" she started, putting inflection on the \"oh,\" \"Have a roast chicken sent to my room. Mira, you can return to your chambers until I have need of you.\" The two muttered \"Yes, Lady Margaery\" before once more exchanging looks and setting off in opposite directions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome twenty minutes later, Sera knocked twice on her mistress' door, a platter bearing servant behind her. A few seconds later, a faint \"Come in!\" was heard from the other side. She opened the door, and christened the servant in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your breakfast, Lady Margaery.\" Sera proclaimed as the servant quickly placed the platter before her and fled the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, excellent, thank you.\" The red haired queen said with a smile from where she was sat at the end of a table. \"I've found chicken to be one of the best palette cleansers there-\" *URRRAAAPH* she belched suddenly and violently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the Seven, excuse me!\" Margaery pardoned, placing a hand gingerly on her chest, before suddenly taking in hand the stone heavy bird and bringing it to her mouth. Sera awkwardly avoided eye contact as the poultry disappeared in a manner of seconds, using the time to take in the sights of her queen's chambers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelicate green Tyrell laces from Highgarden covered the majority of the room, but Margaery had not neglected her husband's houses neither. Baratheon yellows and blacks were woven into the room's decor, and Lannister red and golds added in tandem. A mosaic of Highgarden was constructed along the wall in Lyseni specular stones, and a carved oaken stag stood nearby. On her desk was a number of pens and papers and inkwells. Letters in various stages of completion were scattered about. On the edge of the desk sat the dented helmet of a Lannister soldier. Sera eyed the armor carefully before a cacophonous belch brought her attention back to her mistress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, that did me well.\" Margaery reported, leaning back in her chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will there be anything else, Lady Margaery?\" Sera inquisited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no.\" she replied, pausing a moment before belching heartily once more. \"We will be attending a nameday celebration at midday, however, so be ready for that. Oh, and tell Mira that she won't be having any more problems with Cersei and that cutthroat of hers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, Lady Margaery.\" Sera said, as the smell from her queen's belches reached her nostrils. She winced slightly at the smell, an acrid odor of vomit, chicken, and... onions? Her eyes grew wide as they fluttered from her queen to the helmet on the desk. She quickly half-curtsied and departed with haste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA troubling thought on her mind, Sera...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The intense Ghiscari sun once more found its way through the steaming air of Meereen and through Daenerys Targaryen's brass-stained window. Its illumination crept its way up through the room, climbing the steps that led to the Queen of Meereen's lapis lazuli feather bed, before too setting its gaze upon the ultramarine bed, and the lump that was apparent to be underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, the last known surviving member of the House Targaryen rose. The rays of the morning sun causing her platinum blonde hair to glow nearly white, she stretched and rose. A thin purple gown clung to her body, which had returned to its normal weight in recent months, regaining the muscle-taunt aesthetic it had held during her days as Khaleesi of the Dothraki Sea for some reason unbeknownst to her. She had recently had herself weighed, and found herself to be some 9 stones heavy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe descended the sandstone steps in her silk slipper clad feet as she felt a pressure in her lower abdomen, causing her to hurry. Turning left, proceeding down a hallway, and then rounding a corner, she stood in front of a heavy acacia door, which she threw open with haste, reveling a privy, the walls and floor made of the same sandstone material that composed her bedchambers. The chair itself rose a meter from the floor. It was acacia on top, with its foundations being made from the same sandstone. The pipe that led to the ancient sewer system of the city had been widened at Daenerys' request, its diameter now about a meter and a half wide. With haste, The Mother of Dragons undid the lace on the back of her sleepwear and nearly tore it off of herself, tossing it towards the open door as she thrusted her rear on top of the wooden slab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral loud farts erupted from her taunt buttocks before what remained of what she had eaten the day prior followed. She felt her rectum expand greatly to allow her waste to pass with a sound that would be sickening to many, but to Daenerys, it was a song of relief; it was not painful to her in the slightest, almost pleasurable, really. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaenerys tried to recall what she was currently defecating, and after a moment, believed she had. Yesterday, she had broken her fast on a vine of grapes, a wheel of goat cheese, and a suckling pig. At midday she had feasted on half a dozen sea bass, a loaf of bread, and a large bowl of pomegranate seeds. After nearly twenty minutes of nearly constant shitting, the last of her digested meals fell from her as she stood up and reached for one of the low quality linen cloths that had been given to her to use to clean herself. As she wiped off any tenacious remains, Daenerys recalled her dinner the previous night before, as her mouth began to water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor an appetizer had been two large snapping turtles, that her chef, Dramazi gro Zomach, claimed he had captured himself. Zomach had prepared them masterfully, and Daenerys found great pleasure in devouring the reptile's flesh. In a matter of five minutes, the two turtles, which weighed nearly two stone each, were but empty shells and a bulge in the Last Targaryen's belly. For the main course, a prize sheep that weighed nearly 13 stone, a gift from a former slave turned wealthy pasture owner, was given first to Dramazi's touch of mastery, and than to Daenerys' hunger. Over the next half hour, the animal was converted from beast to bones and belches. Dessert came in the form of a peach pie, which Daenerys almost reluctantly ingested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was moments from calling her handmaidens and Unsullied guard to escort her back to her chambers before she was informed that a noble house, the zo Patons, had made an offering to her in the form of a Astaporian delicacy; two dozen unborn puppies, cooked by the zo Paton's own head chef. Daenerys was reluctant to try one, both for her lack of desire to eat  unborn puppies, and for her lack of hunger, but when the servants brought out the platter, her mind was changed. They didn't look the most appetizing, but the smell stirred a hunger in the platinum haired girl's belly, despite it containing nearly double her own weight. She sat back down and took a cautious bite, which was then followed by a more emphatic one, and another, and another, until the whole of the morsel was sliding down her esophagus. She grabbed another and ate it in three large bites, as the dog fetus' bones had yet to form, allowing Daenerys to eat the thing entirely. Each of her hands grabbed one and fed it to the maelstrom that was her mouth, turning the three pound puppies into a wet mesh of meat in five seconds flat before her throat catapulted them into her. Almost autonomously The Queen of Meereen devoured another five stone of the puppies in a scant two minutes until all two dozen were lost within the confines of her body. She then belched loud enough to cause the Unsullied guard in the next room over to enter, spears raised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaenerys Stormborn, Last of the House Targaryen, then collapsed onto the floor, fighting off sleep. Three of her servant girls, taken from the Noble Houses of Meereen as hostages, rushed to her to assist their captor to her feet, unsuccessfully. As her heavy eyelids shut her vision away, Daenerys realized that she had ate more than those three girls weighed together. If she  wanted to... she could... \"No,\" she thought as rough hands hoisted her upwards, \"The Gods curse men who do such things.\" She released her control over her sleep and relaxed as two Unsullied lay her in a stretcher. As her consciousness fled her for the night, a voice she did not know whispered in her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" a man's voice whispered in a drawn out and frail tone that dripped of venom, \"But you are a Dragon.\" She could not recall her dreams, but that voice was clear to her as the soiled cloth in her hand. With a grunt, Daenerys dropped the shit stained rag into the sewers, before clothing herself and walking to a nearby bathroom, which to her surprise, was sat an already prepared bath, heated near to boiling, as she preferred. She bathed before heading towards her servant's corridors, a grumbling stomach eliciting thoughts of breakfast to her mind. As she opened the door to the waiting gaze of a waiting Noble girl servant, Daenerys decides she has a hunger for...</span></div></div>",

With efficient cutting and movement the unsullied was by the edge of the bath in seconds, raising the slice of cake to his queens mouth.  Daenerys began taking hardy bites, filling her mouth with the delicious flavors of rare, chocolate, sugar, and lemon.  It was not long until the unsullied's gauntlet-ed hand was empty and the Queen demanded more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was strange, but recently Daenerys had been feeling a compulsion to give in to certain indulgences, particularly in food.  Her appetite had grown significantly and unexpectedly in the past few weeks and while it had not really yet began to show on her figure the slightest signs of weight gain had begun to appear, her cheeks looking less gaunt, her arms taking on new softness.  Still, she had no intention to stop, and as she continued to fill her mouth and belly with cake, she pondered what it would feel like to have more softness and fat.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Daenerys froze in her steps and stared open mouthed at the girl in front of her. Her name was Shilvani zo Rhazdar, a twelve year old daughter of the ancient House of Rhazdar, taken hostage to ensure their loyalty. Black haired and olive skinned, with eyes of dry soil, Shilvani had already begun her budding into a woman, the beginnings of a feminine body apparent. But her aesthetics weren't what was on Daenerys' mind when she looked at her. Her mouth watered and her stomach growled as she looked her servant up and down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn idea came to her; an idea that every rational portion of her mind screamed out against, but not her more bestial thoughts. Her mind floated to the bag of a boy's charred bones a farmer had brought to her, talking of dragons. She could recall the guilt she had felt that day, but couldn't recreate it. A frail, venom-spiked voice spoke to her once again: \"...But you are a Dragon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Queen?\" Shilvani spoke in High Valyrian. \"What is your bidding?\" Daenerys' eyes quickly snapped back from the girl's body to her eyes as one side of her mind won out over the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Shilvani, would you accompany me into my chamber for a moment? I have need of you.\" she said as sweetly as possible, putting a welcoming smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Your Grace.\" she replied with a bow of her head. The two left the servant's corridors and took a short walk back to Daenerys' room, skirting along the edge of the great pyramid. Two Unsullied stood at attention as Daenerys threw open the doors and entered her quarters, the Rhazdar girl in tow. She sat down at a table and called for Shilvani to bring wine for both of them, and invited her to take a seat next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you need me for, Your Grace?\" Shilvani asked, taking the seat offered to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted to ask you some questions. And answer candidly, it is a great crime to lie to your Queen.\" Daenerys spoke, bringing the cup of wine to her lips, her eyes transfixed on the girl before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not in trouble, are I?! I haven't done anything My Queen, I swear it!\" Shilvani quickly spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, you aren't in any trouble.\" Daenerys lied. \"I just wanted to ask some questions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, My Queen.\" Shilvani replied incredulously, \"Ask away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you find serving me here?\" Shilvani paused a second and took a sip of wine before answering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is more difficult then the life I had before you took the city, but it is not terrible. I miss my own slave servants, at my family's Great Yellow and Green Pyramid, but I get to speak with many more people, with the other servants here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you wish there was still slavery in Meereen?\" Once more Shilvani took a sip of wine before answering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so. It definitely made my life easier, but sometimes I saw horrible things happen because of the slavers. Tongues torn out, eyes plucked, mothers and daughters raped by the same man, babe's heads dashed against walls. I think Meereen is much better now that you have come.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How has your family fared since the abolition of slavery?\" Shilvani looked away and couldn't meet Daenerys' eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speak, Shilvani.\" Daenerys commanded after several long seconds. She quickly jerked her eyes back to The Mother of Dragons before looking away again. She sighed, took a deep gulp of wine, and looked back to Daenerys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are ruined. Our trade involved buying slaves from the Dothraki Khals, training them into soldiers, and selling them to Pirate Warlords, Exiled Lords, or Volantini Lords stupid enough to try to fight the Dothraki, rather than paying them tribute. We have tried to take up the spice trade, selling saffron from Asshai By-The-Shadow to the Free Cities, but all cargo ships we send are lost either to pirates or to the Smoking Sea, and all caravans are either taken by marauders or lost along the Demon Road. My mother has sold her jewels, my brothers have fled from the city, my sisters try to marry into the other Houses before they discover the depths of our poverty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And your father?\" Shilvani's face twisted in anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You crucified him after taking the city.\" Daenerys once more brought her cup to her lips and drank deeply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you hate me?\" The girl's face froze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I - I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Truthfully, Shilvani.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Yes. You've ruined my life. I have no family, no wealth, and no future. Every night I lay in bed awake, my father's agonized face plastered to my mind's eye. I fantasize about the day I can do the same to you.\" The two sat in silence for a seemingly long time, before the tension was cut by the growling of Daenerys' stomach. A moment afterwards, the Queen of Meereen spoke;</span></div></div>",

Shilvani froze and looked away, staring off into nothing. After nearly ten seconds, she looked back to Daenerys Targaryen, Breaker of Chains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaenerys studied the girl. Although there was only a few years difference between the two, the girl looked to be nothing but a child. Just a lost child, with her life taken from her. She looked so innocent, her skin so soft. She looked so... appetizing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shilvani. Remove your clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your clothes.\" The girl hesitated a moment, before she rose and began slowly undressing herself, shuddering and whimpering the whole time. Once she stood in but her small-clothes, Daenerys rose as well. She slowly approached the girl, who continued to shudder and cover herself, whilst undoing the clasps on her gown and allowing it to fall to the ground. The two were nearly touching at the chest, before The Mother of Dragons leaned forward. She gently kissed the girl on the forehead before embracing her. She drew her in close and nuzzled her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Please.\" Shilvani begged, but Daenerys continued. The girl began to sob, until her noises of sadness were replaced with those of pain as she felt a sharp stab at her neck. She looked at the Last Targaryen's; her mouth was full, and her face bloodied. She brought her hand to her neck; part of her throat was missing. She tried to cry out, but found her voice missing. Shilvani looked in fear at Daenerys as she swallowed. The girl followed the lump in her throat until it disappeared into her Queen's depths. She felt faint, losing her consciousness as Daenerys one again clamped her jaws around her, and tore off another mouthful of the poor girl's throat. She swallowed, hardly chewing before she lifted her dying body and placed it on the table. She leaned down and tore off the rest of Shilvani's neck meat. With a grunt, she grabbed at the bottom of her servant's jaw, and pulled, severing her neck bone with a sickening pop. Daenerys took the girl's severed head in her hands, bit into her cheek, and tore, taking most of the skin on the left side of her face. She quickly chewed and swallowed, before doing the same to the other side of Shilvani's face. As she chewed, she put her thumb in the eye socket, and popped out the unseeing eye, before doing the same to the other. She snapped the optic nerves before throwing the two brown pupiled orbs into the wet mesh in her mouth before gulping the whole conglomerate down. Next, she grabbed the head's hair, and pulled, the rest of the skin coming off with it. She put the bleeding mess into her maw before swallowing, slurping the girl's hair down like a noodle. Daenerys then began pulling off the remaining facial muscles and giving them to her hunger. She looked over the skull; it was nearly picked clean. She then dashed the skull against the side of the table, causing a hairline fracture. Then Daenerys grabbed a nearby fork. She forced the prongs into the fissure, and pushed down, causing the skull cap to lift. She grabbed at the bottom of the raised skullcap, and peeled it off the rest of the skull, revealing Shilvani's brain. Without hesitation, Daenerys tossed the bone aside and thrusted her mouth into the open cavity, devouring the girl's brain in seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaenerys pulled herself from the now empty skull and threw it to the side. Her face and hair was covered in blood. She belched and walked to the now headless corpse on the table. She removed what little clothes remained and cast them aside. Her stomach moaned again, her hunger not even effected by the flesh of Shilvani's head, but Daenerys hadn't planned on stopping there anyway. She leaned down and thrusted her head into the corpse's belly, eating through and emerging with a mouthful of entrails and a wide smile as her vision turned to red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud, ten second long belch woke The Mother of Dragons from her stupor. She looked around to find herself standing on a blood drenched floor, surrounded by human bones, all the meat was missing, and the bones were broken to get to the marrow beneath. Her skin was sticky with blood, and a slight potbelly emerged from her abdomen. She had ate much more than the maybe eight-stone heavy girl before, but she had never felt so... whole. Shilvani had been the sweetest meat she had ever had. She grabbed the flagon of wine on the table and looked towards her buzzing gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One last drink, Shilvani?\" she then drained the flagon and belched once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for this wonderful meal. I hope you find death more suiting then life. I'm glad I found some use for your body, since you didn't want it. See you tomorrow morning.\" Daenerys then climbed the steps to her bed and fell onto it, falling asleep in moments.</span></div></div>",

She was utterly famished, and something nearby smelt wonderful. Feeling a pressure at her backside, Daenerys slightly tilted herself to the side and broke wind, rather audibly. Yawning, she rose and stretched. She climbed out from her bed before a sharp gasp emerged from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer living quarters looked like the scene of a murder. Fleshless bones lay scattered about, cracked and marrowless. A skull, its cranium removed to get to the brains beneath, lay discarded several feet away. Blood was splattered everywhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this?\" Daenerys wondered to herself, \"A warning?

She remembered tearing out a girl's kidney with her bare teeth before grinding it to a wet paste and engulfing it. She remembered sticking her maw into her open skull cavity and feasting on her wits. She remembered tearing the flesh from her face before plucking out her eyeballs and devouring those as well. Then she remembered who's face she had in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gods, no...\" Daenerys cried, looking towards her taut, churning gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forgive me, Shilvani...\" The Mother of Dragons practically whimpered, collapsing onto the ground, surrounded by the scattered remains of the servant girl that was digesting inside her.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Daenerys gasped as a loud rapping at her door broke the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Grace,\" an adolescent girl's voice called from the other side, \"Your lunch has arrived.\" Panicking, Daenerys quickly looked about at the scene of horror she had made out of Shilvani.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-a moment!\" She called back as she hastily gathered several blankets from chairs in the room. She then collected all of the bones she saw into a pile and covered it, before hiding it behind her table. With several more blankets, she covered as much of the blood stained floor that she could. She went to go answer the door before remembering her own appearance. Hastily, she ripped off her blood stained gown and tossed it to the side, leaving herself in the nude. She fetched a long sleeved dress and donned it hastily, before sweeping her luxurious hair in front of her blood stained face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a final inspection of herself, Daenerys opened the door. On the other side stood the girl Orvana gro Pahl, a minor daughter of the House of Pahl. She was a cute girl, of an age with Dany. Her long hair was as black as midnight, and her face a roundish thing. She was a bit heavy, but nothing absurd. Daenerys recalled one of the other servant girls remarking that since she was so far in the line of succession, her father had little care of her figure, and Orvana liked her food. In fact, her lack of inheritance was one of the first things that had brought Orvana to Dany's attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the men of House Pahl had died during her attack on Meereen, or shortly there after, with the family's patriarch being slain when she broke Meereen's gates, his Eldest Son slain by her ally, Strong Belwas, in a most humiliating fashion, and his three brothers being amoung those crucified in retribution for the 163 children the Meereenese had nailed to posts to intimidate her, so control of House Pahl had passed to the women of the family. When Daenerys demanded hostages, House Pahl sent Orvana. Daario Narharis had suggested that she send back her head to \"Teach the Shriveled Crones respect,\" but she had elected to keep Orvana in one piece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your grace, half a dozen rabbits, a vine of grapes, and a flagon of ale, to satisfy your hunger.\" Orvana spoke, motioning to the platters being borne by the two men behind her. Daenerys did not fail to notice her eyeing the roasted rabbit with hunger in her glare. Orvana didn't conjure the only look of hunger there, however. Danerys' eyes explored the pudgy body of the Pahl girl as her hunger grew and grew. After a moment, she snapped out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yes, yes, wonderful, please, send it in. Leave it on the table.\" She prattled, as her stomach growled with thoughts of Orvana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no! Not that one!\" Dany quickly scolded as the two servants began towards the scene of her breakfast. The two muttered \"Pardon, Your Grace,\" before setting the two massive plates of silver onto a smaller corner table and exiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will there be anything else, Your Grace?\" Orvana asked. Dany imagined the girl before her a skeleton, her flesh happily churning away inside her as she belched with alacrity, dozing off to sleep while Orvana melted into her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that'll be all, thanks.\" Daenerys quickly replied before practically slamming the door in her face. hyperventilating at her thoughts, she returned to the scene of her feast. She gathered Shilvani's bones into the same blanket she had used to cover them and brought them through her hallway, into her privy. She opened the door and brought her package inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Shilvani.\"  Daenerys muttered as she dropped the package into the hole and watched it clatter into the sewers below. The House of Rhazdar would never know what happened to their daughter, with what was not in the sewers soon to be there, as the Queen's waste. With a sad smirk, Daenerys returned to her chambers, eager to drown her sorrows in rabbit flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urrrrrraaaaapphhhh.\" Dany belched as she swallowed the last mouthful of rabbit and polished off her flagon. She licked her lips to get a bit more flavor out of her little newfound friends. She was glad her head chef, Dramazi gro Zomach had prepared such a midday feast for her, she wasn't as full as she'd like to be, with only about 5 stone sitting in her stomach, but it had definitely taken the edge off. She managed to rationalize what she had done a bit better then before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, she rose, and thought of a plan. She gathered the platter of marrowless rabbit bones and set it on the table next to the scene of her crime. She next called in her servants, who quickly gathered the platters and left, before several cleaners came in to scrub the blood off the floor, unaware of its origins. They quickly and wordlessly finished their task before departing. With a sigh of relief, Daenerys farted deeply and loudly as Shilvani shifted further into her intestines. The young servant girl would now forever be at most a red on a discarded rag, and a brown on a Queen's undergarments.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Your Grace,\" one of the servants chimed in, \"'tis almost time for you to attend court. Will you be requiring assistance in clothing yourself today?\" She stared wordlessly at her queen's dress, splattered with brown-red stains and flecked with bits of noble serving girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As a matter of fact, I would, \" Daenerys replied. Her massive meal was sitting in her stomach like a bag of rocks, distending it to the point of seeming rather pregnant. Daenerys felt like she wouldn't be able to bend downward more than an inch, let alone dress herself. She had tried to shun being pampered by her servants when she could, but today seemed a necessary exception.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo more handmaidens silently entered the room and began stripping her, nimble fingers untying knots and undoing buttons with the grace and skill of women who had been doing this all their lives. Next came her smallclothes, whose front was still damp from soaked-through blood. Taking a moment to glance down at her engorged stomach, Daenerys found it to be as large as it felt. It was like all of her torso between her sex and her breasts had bloated outward six inches, and a cursory poke found it to be stretched as tight as a drum all over. Her stomach and intestines were both filled to bursting, some of it even backing up her gullet a little. At both sides, just above her hips, Daenerys saw the faint pink beginnings of small stretch marks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe winced internally as a servant walked away with her clothes, a look of disgust crossing her face as she tried to avoid touching the bloodstains. Would they notice how much blood there truly was? Would they figure out where it came from? <i>But would they care?</i> a voice in the corner of her mind seemed to whisper. <i>Every one of their former masters has assuredly indulged in some terrible vice before, this will hardly faze them.</i> And with that, Daenerys relaxed slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the servants walked into her field of vision, a rainbow of dresses draped over her arm. \"Which of these do you wish to wear today, your Grace?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaenerys eyed them all carefully. Almost all of them were cotton or silk, so sheer that she might as well go with her breasts bared. The only clothing that seemed solid was a violet tokar, which Daenerys soon pointed to. She would <i>not</i> the people of Meereen, former master or slave, see her body exposed in such a state of decadence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe servants set to work immediately, gracefully unfolding the cloth and wrapping it around her torso, pausing every step of the way to pull it tight. At each stage, another servant darted through and fastened several points of contact together with golden brooches in the shapes of dragons and harpies. On and on it seemed to go, twice around her breasts, between the legs, around the waist once more, under the right armpit, over the left shoulder, and at last wrapped around her left arm and bound by a golden bracelet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen came what seemed like an endless cavalcade of jewelry. Nearly every inch of open skin on her arms and hands was soon covered by silver bracelets in the pattern of snakes, strings of Myrish pearls, and thick rings carved whole from single gemstones. Her shoulders were bent slightly by a dozen gold necklaces and chains, each signifying a great honor of being ruler of Meereen and an insult of the highest order if it were removed. A golden choker that wrapped around her entire neck, topped by a ruby the size of her palm, made tilting her head any more than ever so slightly downwards impossible. The great amethyst-and-platinum pendants that now hung ponderously from her ears felt like they would tear off her lobes any minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaenerys felt more like an overstuffed sausage in an undersized casing, but the fabric was thick and garishly-patterned enough that it was hard to notice the state of her belly. But before she could take a step, more servants ran up carrying another box of jewels and a strange clay container. One of the maids pulled off the lid, revealing a waxy substance that glittered silver, and began running her hands through Daenerys's hair. It must have been whatever the Meereenese nobles use to style their hair into the outlandish fashions she saw. She could only guess as to what they were doing behind her as the servants added handful upon handful of the cream to her hair, occasionally pausing to weave in another bejeweled monstrosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the hairstylist worked, another walked up with a palette and began applying makeup with a thick brush. First was a layer of some sweet-smelling substance that felt like tree sap (\"to help the powder keep its hold,\" she claimed), then layer after layer after layer <i>after layer</i> of face powder. Sometimes, she would pause to mix colors, add in the powder from some precious metal, or even press a jeweled adornment right into the resin. She even placed two great ovular rubies over Daenerys's top and bottom lips. Layers would go on, then be scraped away to make patterns in the revealed layers underneath. Sometimes layers would be piled on in one specific area, making those parts of her face jut out. As it wore on and on, Daenerys felt less like a human being and more like a house with a mural being painted on its walls. She could've sworn that the makeup artists began to work their way from her forehead to the base of her hairline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short eternity, the servants all stepped back, looks of triumph blooming across their worn-out faces. One of them bore a golden hand mirror with a handle in the shape of the Harpy, holding up for Daenerys to see. \"Look, your Grace!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Daenerys saw wasn't her; no, it wasn't even a person. It was an ostentatious statue that had grown a mouth. Her skin was painted a bright white that shone silver in the light, just as her hair. Elaborate patterns of gold and crimson and violet and onyx crisscrossed and swirled their way across her face, uniting under a chin that narrowed into an upward-curving golden hook. Her nose was covered by a similarly jewel-encrusted golden hook that blocked her nostrils and jutted into her field of vision. When she kept her jaw closed, the two hooks' points touched to form what looked like a gaudily-dressed eagle's beak. Between them sat a pair of bulbous ruby lips that scattered red points of light on her chin. Her cheeks were built up by innumerable layers of makeup and shaped into razor-sharp edges that jutted out a good half-inch from the rest of her face. The tips were pierced with small silver rings, linked by small chains to a diamond-shaped amethyst set in the makeup on the bridge of her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut her hair, Gods, her hair. The makeup matched her hair color so well it was hard to tell when her forehead ended and her hair began. It snaked into three enormous braids that curved upwards and over her head, their ends shaped to look like the heads of dragons. Sparkling ruby eyes, sat above rows of pearl teeth, and their backs were ridged by silver scales and diamond spines. Two braids split off from the sides are were brought back up to the top of her forehead, fanning out in the shape of an eagle's wings. A gold figurine of the Harpy of Meereen's torso, its clawed feet perched atop her gold-painted eyebrows, was slipped over. Its scorpion tail had three small golden chains looped about it, each of them leading to a gilded collar around each dragon's neck. Though the servant described it as representing \"the dragon binding the Harpy's fiercest weapon\", the symbolism was obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt long last, she was ready for court. Daenerys gingerly took a step forward, her entire body jangling like a bag full of gold. She felt her head begin to tip, but her balance was restored by two servants. \"Shall we call a palanquin for your Grace?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I suppose so.\" Even speaking was a chore, with the makeup caked on her face and the great collar on her neck making it difficult to move her jaw. She was loathe to use such an obvious symbol of the slavers to move, but the tight tokar and the combined weight of all the makeup and jewelry made it the far more practical option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin ten seconds, half a dozen muscular manservants walked in bearing the palanquin on their shoulders. It was just as gaudy and ornamental as everything else she was wearing; the sides and handles were painted gold, and adorned with carvings of soaring harpies and frolicking cherubs. Its top was purple velvet, which she sank deeply into as she sat. Due to her elaborate hairstyle, Daenerys found herself forced to recline sideways, as if on a chaise, her right hand used to prop up her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe palanquin gracefully lifted off the ground and brought Daenerys from her chambers. The rolling motion began to elicit a series of belches from her overfull stomach, but thankfully nothing came of it. As she entered the throne room, the throng of waiting supplicants and noblemen fell silent, awestruck by their queen's ostentatious appearance and her strict accordance with Ghiscari customs. As her violet eyes scanned the crowd, she noticed the freedmen, as well as those who had come with her, were staring in either shock or disgust. The Great Masters, on the other hand, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe servants ascended the stairs to the throne of Meereen, falling to their knees just in front of the throne. Two of them rose to help her down, their strong arms deftly righting her and setting her on the seat of her throne as if she was as light as a feather. If they felt any strain, they were excellent at concealing their discomfort. The servants carrying the palanquin bowed deeply, and soon it was as if they were never there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaenerys called her court to order, but before she could call the first supplicant forward, a servant bent down to whisper in her ear. \"Your Grace, court must begin with a prayer by the Green Grace.\" And so, Daenerys called the Green Grace, a tall yet elderly woman, to lead a brief prayer. Upon its conclusion, her royal duties could finally begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter not even a single hour into hearing her supplicants...</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">An interactive \"stuffing\" story based off of characters from George R.R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series, and portrayed by actors and actresses on HBO's A Game of Thrones. Stuffing is a type of erotica that involves individuals ingesting large (often inhuman) quantities of food. This particular story may feature many graphic activities, such as assault, sexual intercourse, sodomy, onomatopoeic representations of belching / breaking wind, foul language, murder, and cannibalism, so view discretion is most assuredly advised. This story will take place during the fourth book in A Song of Ice and Fire, A Feast for Crows, so spoilers for A Feast for Crows and previous books may be divulged. This story accept the canon from the book series, but understands the character to appear as they are in the HBO series, as portrayed by their respective actors / actresses. This story was inspired by deviantart user Laxit42's story Cersei, Daenerys, and Taena, found here: <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://laxit42.deviantart.com/art/Cersei-and-Daenerys-and-Taena-322051173,\" target=\"_blank\">http://laxit42.deviantart.com/art/Cersei-and-Daenerys-and-Taena-322051173,</a> and accepts what has henceforth transpired in that story as canon, excluding bits that are not in canon with the A Song of Ice and Fire series itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo any wishing to add to this story, I would request that you follow the continuum set forth by both the book series, and any previous chapters in the thread you are publishing in, as despite the inelegant topic of this interactive, I would like to keep the story coherent. Minor mistakes are acceptable as long as the author attempts to rectify them in future iterations, but consistent or intentional refusal to pay heed to what is canon will result in deletion of chapters. Furthermore, chapters with unacceptable grammatical errors or with just plain awful writing will be deleted. Do your best to decide character actions based off of their set personalities as described in A Song of Ice and Fire. While I personally enjoy stories in motion, you do not have to progress the narrative if you do not wish to. While this story is intended to serve as erotica for those attracted to females, your particular chapter need not tailor to this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharacters who stuff themselves in this story may gain weight, or they may not, as per the author's discretion, but if they do not rapidly gain weight, there must be reasoning behind it. Perhaps the individual's body metabolizes excess food as raw energy instead of stored fat, or perhaps there is something magical at play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that block of text out of the way, let us begin!</td>",
