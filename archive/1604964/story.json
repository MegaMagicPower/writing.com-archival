My new assistant, his first day in the lab, and he's already over an hour late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's goes that assistant. I return to my desk, and begin to plan out a new job ad. As I'm nearing the end, the door bursts open, and in walks Bailey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dr. Hunter, I'm so sorry. My wrestling coach went extra hard on us at practice today, and I hadn't realized the time until just now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's evident Bailey really did just come from the wrestling mats. He's dripping with sweat, and still wearing his singlet. He breathes heavily, his muscular chest heaving inside the tight singlet. I try not to stare, but instead find my eyes wandering to his boulderous biceps, still pumped from a heavy workout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the words I had planned to say to Bailey, that his tardiness was unacceptable, no longer apply. How can I fire him? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dr. Hunter, is everything okay?\" Bailey asks, approaching me. Bailey's a good 10 inches or so taller than me, and as he approaches, I just see his magnificent chest in front of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, everything's fine,\" I choke. I regain what composure I can. \"Um, I'm going to need you to change into a lab coat. Do you have one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBailey shakes his head No.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I believe there's a spare in the closet over there. Why don't you grab that? And you may want to change also. There's a bathroom down the hall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBailey steps out, and I shake my head for not firing the kid on the spot. I'm a glutton for punishing myself, I guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Bailey returns. Man, I've never seen someone fill out a lab coat like that. The coat's obviously too small on him, his muscles pressed against the fabric, but he doesn't say anything about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Doc. Um, can I call you Doc?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look at Bailey. \"Um, sure, whatever,\" I utter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what exactly are we studying?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI tell Bailey about my recent studies. \"Basically, I'm conducting research on cell manipulation, discovering ways to engineer our DNA to alter our physical states.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, what was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look him over. He's lucky he's such a stud. \"I am, um, finding ways to change or morph bodies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, yeah, cool!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBailey eyes the flasks of the solution I'd recently been testing on the shelf. \"So, what do those bottles do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes. Well, good question, as that's what I'm currently working on...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Maybe it's better if I show you.\" I motion him to follow me to the cages in the corner. Bailey walks over and looks at the rats in the cages. \"Right now,\" I explain, \"I'm studying the effects of my solution on rats.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They look like ordinary rats to me, Doc.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smile. \"Yes, that's because those rats haven't yet been experimented on. But look over there.\" I point to the small box with multiple pinholes on the shelf next to the cages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBailey walks over and looks at the box. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on. You can take the lid off. But be careful!\" I warn him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBailey opens the lid. \"Oh my God! Look at them! They're so small!\" Inside the box, tiny rats, each no bigger than a thumbnail, run about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it's taken me years of research, but just this month I've finally had results.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look at Bailey, and can't read the expression on his face. Is he amazed, scared, creeped out, confused?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what does it do to humans?\" Bailey asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To humans?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pat Bailey lightly on his arm, noticing the tense bicep underneath the sleeve. \"Oh, Bailey. It's taken me years to get this result with rats. I can't just go and experiment on humans unless I know the stuff is safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBailey puts the lid back on the box. \"It's all so incredible, Doc.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smile. \"Listen, Bailey, it's getting late. We should talk about your day-to-day duties in the lab, and then let's call it a day. But excuse me for one second first, as I go use the men's room, and then we can have that chat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI excuse myself and head out into the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile,<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After all, I was the first to arrive late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's something in his voice that seems a little odd, though. A tinge of excitement, perhaps?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look at Bailey, and then look at the clock. 5 o'clock already.

He sports a huge smile, while fidgeting a little in his chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything ok?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything's awesome, Doc!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBailey fidgets some more in his chair. I notice he looks a little different. It's funny how much looser Bailey's lab coat looks when he's sitting down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBailey catches me staring at his chest. \"Like what you see?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blush. \"I'm so sorry. I don't know\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut I don't finish my sentence. \"Doc, don't be sorry! I mean, isn't this everything you had been working for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm very confused, \"What are you talking about?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBailey smiles. \"Let me show you, Doc. Come over here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI get up from my chair, and walk around the desk, as Bailey stands up. But it's a different Bailey. He seems shorter. The lab coat looks bigger on him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Check it out, Doc!\" Bailey says, spinning around. \"It works, your solution works!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look over, and see an empty vial on the book shelf next to Bailey. \"Bailey, did you drink that?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure did, Doc! Sure did!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doc, I could hear earlier in your voice how sad it seemed that it'd be years until you could test on humans. I know about the laws you need to abide by. But I thought I'd speed things up a bit. No law is keeping me from choosing me to be your guinea pig!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was dumbfounded, as Bailey continued to dwindle in front of my eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, look at me, Doc! I'm shrinking!\u2026\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His proportions had remained intact, but he didn't seem as intimidating. He seemed cuter and more approachable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Doc, I'm shorter than you now!\" Bailey cried out. Indeed, I now had to look down a little to see the top of his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis shrinking had stopped, and I guesstimated he was now 5'4\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you feeling, Bailey?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Doc. I feel fine. This is so incredible. It's so strange to see the world from a different height.

Not that I need to take it now. I mean, I'd love to see what's like for awhile at this height, but eventually I should get back to normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gulped, trying to find the words to say, \"Um, Bailey.

But I can tell that something definitely seems out of place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look at Bailey, and then look at the clock. 5 o'clock already. I better keep this quick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Bailey,\" I say, sitting at my desk. \"Let's discuss what I'll need you to do for this job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI begin running down the list of tasks, from setting up my lab in the morning, to typing out my notes, to helping me observe experiments, and finally to cleaning up the lab at night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does all that sound to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBailey nods his head smiling, while fidgeting a little in his chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything ok?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Bailey says, fidgeting some more, \"I'm just wondering how this will work around classes and my wrestling practices.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good question. I don't need you to work in one long shift. For setting up in the morning, I'll just need you to come in before anytime at 9. I'll be giving you a key to the lab, so you can come in before class, or a morning workout, or whatever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the evening, cleanup should be quick. If you come in after practice like you did today, we should be fine. I'm here late, so I'll still be around to go over cleanup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As for during the day, as we discussed in your interview, it'd be best to meet up between classes, when possible. But, I do most experiments on the weekends, which you said should work out for your schedule. Is that still correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBailey fidgets some more in his chair, and begins scratching at his chest. It's funny how much looser Bailey's lab coat looks when he's sitting down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, yeah. Weekends are fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watch Bailey some more, as he continues itching. \"Everything okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, Doc. I feel a little odd. Really itchy, all over. I hope I didn't catch something from wrestling practice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nod my head. \"I'm sorry to hear that. Well, I was going to give you a tour of the lab, but how about a quick rundown from our seats. We could go over everything in more detail tomorrow morning, and I can walk you through a weekday setup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, here is my office space. As you can, it's separate from all the lab equipment, and it should be kept that way at all times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Over there is where we'll be conducting experiments. I'll go over all that tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I showed you where we keep the rats. I'll need you to feed them twice a day, during your setup and cleanup tasks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And finally, the solutions. You've seen the shelves that new solutions are held. After a few days at room temperature, they need be kept cool, which is why there's a refrigerator in the room\u2026.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Excuse me, what was that?\" Bailey interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The refrigerator? It's for the lab!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. That's where we put the solutions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBailey suddenly looked a little pale. \"Doc, is that all you keep in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that and some other chemicals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at Bailey. He looked really odd. I noticed the collar to his lab coat, earlier so tight on him, looked really floppy. And the coat's sleeves. Earlier they didn't come close to his wrist. Now they were coming down to his fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bailey, did you do anything while I was away?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry, Doc! I had no idea. No idea! I thought it was water!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked next to Bailey, and saw what seemed out of place before. A vial of solution, now empty, on the book shelf next to where Bailey was sitting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you drink that?\" I asked, pointing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um\u2026.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI jumped up from my seat, and ran around the desk. Bailey likewise stood up. I looked up at his face, noticing that I didn't have to look up as high as before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doc, what's going on? I'm confused. You seem to be getting taller.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed on hearing these words. \"No, Bailey, I'm afraid it's quite the opposite. You're getting smaller.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm shrinking! How?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen suddenly, Bailey experienced a shrinking spurt. When it was over, he was:<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I mean, every man in the world's gonna want to get some of your stuff!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look at Bailey, and laugh tensely, \"Well, don't get too worked up, boy.

He felt strangely sore all over, while at the same time extremely pumped, as if he had been working out in his sleep. He slowly lifted himself up from his pillow, sitting up in bed, the sheets falling off from him. He looked down at his pecs, noticeably more bigger, rounder than the night before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa, fuck\u2026 Doc\u2019s shit worked!\u201d Bailey muttered to himself. He got up from his bed, walked over to the mirror and looked admiringly in his mirror. He flexed his bigger guns, kissing each peak. \u201cCan\u2019t wait to show these guns off to Doc!\u201d He scoured through his drawers and closet, seeking out a nice, tight T that would really show off his gains. He was surprised how long it took him to find one, as most seemed strangely loose on him. He finally pulled out a shirt he hadn\u2019t worn in ages having outgrown it, though now it fit snugly. Looking at himself in the mirror, he smiled seeing how well they showed off his new curves. \u201cWait \u2018til Doc sees me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, I was in my office, anxiously awaiting Bailey for his first day on the job. It turned out to be a longer wait than anticipated, as he showed up nearly a half hour late. When he arrived, he had the biggest shit-eating grin on his face. \u201cSorry boss, it took me awhile to find clothes that\u2019d fit me.\u201d I looked at the extra-large hoodie he was wearing, loose and long on him, the cuffs spilling over his wrists, and I thought to myself he apparently didn\u2019t look long enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll right\u2026 But just don\u2019t let this be a regular thing, coming in\u2026 in\u2026\u201d I stopped myself, as Bailey had unzipped that big hoodie, pulling it off, revealing his incredible torso, squeezed tightly in a too-small shirt. Bailey must\u2019ve seen me staring, as he laughed, saying, \u201cNotice anything\u2026 different?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took me a few moments to gather my thoughts and words, being so tongue-tied near Bailey\u2019s beautiful torso. Finally, I couldn\u2019t help but utter the words \u201cso big\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou got that right! Bigger than yesterday!\u201d Bailey exclaimed proudly, as I just stared on, looking at him blankly, confused. He continued, \u201cDon\u2019t you get it? Doc, I tested your stuff yesterday\u2026 while you were out\u2026. You said you hadn\u2019t tested on humans. Well, consider me your first human test subject. Now look at me\u2026 Jeez, I must\u2019ve put on 10, 20 pounds of muscle in one night!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBailey,\u201d I asked, concerned. \u201cYou took some of that stuff, without my knowing? You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing. We haven\u2019t completed tests on rats. There could be side effects!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSide effects, schmide effects!

I also realized this would be an incredible jumpstart for my research, already seeing effects on humans. I couldn\u2019t be blamed for testing  so soon on humans, as Bailey took the stuff without my knowing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBailey seemed real eager to show off his positive results, flexing his biceps in front of me, his barrel chest, thick tree-trunk thighs\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoc, you okay? Doc, you there?\u201d Bailey joked, waving his hands in front of my face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI snapped to. \u201cSorry\u2026 just\u2026 a lot to take in\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure I am just that\u2026 A lot to look at! Just look at me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continued showing off his gains, and I did my best to hide my raging hard-on. I tried changing my focus, not just on individual muscle groups, but on Bailey as a whole. I noticed something seemed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFunny,\u201d I muttered, \u201cI thought you were taller\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that, Doc? You think I\u2019m taller, too!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no, I thought you <i>were</i> taller. Sorry, just muttering to myself\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, ha ha. Just wishful thinking, I guess\u2026 I always wished I could be taller\u2026 instead of just 6-foot even\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut Bailey\u2026 that\u2019s not correct\u2026 You\u2019re 6\u20192\u201d!\u201d I realized I blurted that out real quick. I remembered quite well seeing his height on the copy of his drivers\u2019 license from his job application. I remembered savoring how tall and muscular this hunk was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Bailey looked at me oddly. \u201cNo, I think I know how tall I am.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, it\u2019s just\u2026 We should probably measure you\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow you\u2019re talking! I can\u2019t wait to see my gains. Good comparison to record\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExactly, to compare to the <i>you</i> from yesterday\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd to compare to <i>me</i> after I take my next dose!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNext dose? Hold on, cowboy, we should wait until this first dose ends\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnds? You mean, I\u2019ll lose this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no, Bailey\u2026 it takes awhile to fully process in your system\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait!! So\u2026 it\u2019s not over? I might get bigger?? Without another dose?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded my head, while contemplating to myself thoughts of a bigger Bailey. I shook my head, and grabbed a pencil along with a tape measure. \u201cBefore we measure your weight, I just want to doublecheck that height.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re funny, Doc, but all right\u2026\u201d I grabbed a stool and got on it to mark the top of Bailey\u2019s head. Then, after he stepped away, I unfurled the tape measure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you weren\u2019t lying\u2026 6-foot even\u2026\u201d I stepped away, confused. I grabbed the folder containing Bailey\u2019s application, finding the copy of the driver\u2019s license. There it was \u2013 6\u20192\u201d. There must\u2019ve been an error at the DMV. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, can we check my weight out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBailey hopped on a scale. \u201cWhat\u2019s it say, Doc?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked back at the license and noted 260 pounds. I then walked over to where Bailey was standing and looked at the reading. \u201cOh, buddy, not sure if you\u2019re gonna like this\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Bailey asked, alarmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA shade under 255\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d Bailey asked incredulously. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 amazing!

Though quite young at age 25, Dr. Hunter seems older, due to work stress and the large number of hours he spends in his lab. This leaves him with little to no free time, and no sex life whatsoever. Recently, Dr. Hunter has been seeking a lab assistant to help him with his research, in hopes to cut down his time in the lab.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnter Bailey. Bailey is a college student who was recently hired by Dr. Hunter. He is 19, 6'2\", and very athletic, having played numerous sports over the years, including football, water polo, and his personal favorite, wrestling. He's a big guy, roughly 260 pounds of muscle. He's clean-cut, with handsome boy-next-door features. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBailey's not your typical lab assistant. For one thing, he's no smartie. He is barely scraping by college with a C average.  But the openly gay but highly repressed Mark Hunter couldn't say no to this stud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday is Bailey's first day in the lab. Neither he nor Mark will be same from this day forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Note:</b> This body transformation story is and shall always be gay themed.
