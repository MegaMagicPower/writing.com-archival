But you knew something like that couldn\u2019t be real, but you click on it anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou skim over the page, the sample images seemed to be of a contacts list, and a day planner. You notice that the app has received a 4 out of 5 star review so you begin to wonder what it really is. Was it some kind of social planning thing organizer? So you then decide to read the description.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEvery wondered what it was like to see the world though someone else\u2019s eyes?   Well look no further; this is the first body swapping app, where you can temporarily trade bodies with your friends and family.\u201d It said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then you receive a call from your friend Josh, \u201cOh hey man what\u2019s up?\u201d you say, \u201cHey man what you doing?\u201d he says, \u201cNothing much, bored, looking up phone apps when you called.\u201d You say, \u201cNice, wanna come chill at my place?\u201d he asks \u201cSure, I\u2019ll be right over.\u201d You say<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk over to Josh\u2019s apartment still thinking about the Swap Me app, was such a thing really possible?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou arrive at Josh\u2019s place and he welcomes you in. The two of you then proceed to the living room where he sits down in the recliner and you kick back on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what\u2019s new with you?\u201d you asks, \u201cNothing at all, the one day I\u2019m not working and there is nothing good on TV.\u201d He says laughing, \u201cSo what about you?\u201d he asks, \u201cWell you know me, no work, so every day is boring, but I did find an interesting app just now.\u201d You say <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice, what you got?\u201d he asks, \u201cWell it\u2019s called Swap Me, and it says it lets you swap bodies with people.\u201d You say<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSwap bodies?\u201d he says looking at you like you must be joking, \u201cYeah you know when you swap brains or souls or bodies or however they do it in the movies?\u201d you say, \u201cYeah I know what it means, I just don\u2019t get what\u2019s the big deal about it.\u201d He says laughing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh come on you\u2019re saying you wouldn\u2019t want to be someone else for a little while?\u201d you ask, \u201cNope, I\u2019m perfectly happy right here.\u201d He says smiling, \u201cOh really? You called me over because you were bored.\u201d You say laughing, \u201cYeah so, just because I\u2019m bored doesn\u2019t mean id want to be someone else\u201d he says laughing <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell think about it, you know your neighbor Rick\u2019s girlfriend, the one that sunbathes topless on their back porch? You can tell me you wouldn\u2019t mind being Rick for a few hours.\u201d You say laughing, josh smiles at the thought but then says, \u201cOkay you\u2019ve got me there but what if you end up in a less desirable situation? Like what about Jackie from the third floor that\u2019s pregnant with triplets?\u201d Josh says laughing <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cAh well you have a point, then again not knowing is half the fun, and it would only be temporary. Right?\u2019 you say, \u201cOkay well if that\u2019s the case have you downloaded this app yet?\u201d he asks, \u201cAh no not yet\u201d you say, \u201cWell what\u2019s the hold up?\u201d he says, \u201cI\u2019m thinking about it.\u201d You say<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
