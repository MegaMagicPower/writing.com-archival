            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was the beginning of summer and John and his mother Lisa were moving into a new neighborhood if that\u2019s what you could call it. The street the house was on was a dead end and there were only two other houses on it and they were all pretty far apart. John and his mother spent half the day with the help of the moving men getting the furniture placed in the right rooms. Then the rest of the time would be spent unpacking, this would take all week though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree days of work and everything was almost done and Johns mother wanted to light candles in every room to get the musty smell out of the house. Every room in the house was lit with a candle and John was sitting on the floor next to the one burning in his bedroom. Just then a breeze stated to blow and the flame from the candle started to flicker. You could hear the wind starting to pick up from the sound of the leaves on the trees. Then one good gust through the window blew the candle out and the wick started to smoke, the funny thing was after the candle went out the wind died down and the smoke started to drift across the room. John watched as it drifted across the room and into his closet. That\u2019s when things started getting strange, the smoke, once it reached the entrance to the closet zipped across and disappeared into the wall. John\u2019s curiosity was peeked and he went to investigate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn slowly moved across the bedroom so not to disturb the stream of smoke, he got to the door of the closet and sure enough the smoke was zipping right across and into the wall. \u201c hmm \u201c John thought \u201c there must be something in behind this wall I bet . \u201c John started to knock on the wall, he could hear that there was something behind it, John got excited \u201c wow a mystery, this is going to be fun! \u201c John started to move his hands up and down and back and forth the wall to find something to open it with. Then finally just before he was going to give up, he noticed a small button at the base of the wall in the corner of the closet and pressed it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wall was set up like a pocket door and slid to the left disappearing into the rest of the wall. John was only eleven and this whole thing was starting to get scary but his curious nature was to much to bare, so he stepped into the opening to look inside. It was dark and there were cob webs, a recipe for a horror movie on late night TV. John couldn\u2019t see anything and decided to go retrieve the candle from his room but while he was turning to go, he noticed a light switch in his closet \u201c hmm funny place for a light switch \u201c he thought since there was no light in his closet. He turned the switch on and the room lit up like magic. The room was the size of the garage below it, if you stepped in and looked left to right there were racks of clothing on hangers, at the center of the long racks built into the wall on both sides there were two large mirrors, if you looked straight across from the doorway at each end of that wall there were big dressers with mirrors on top of them. Everything in the room had a pinkish girly feel to it and was preserved perfectly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the wall were the dressers were smack dab in the center of the wall was a glass cabinet with what looked like to be a large doll. The doll was a young lady about John\u2019s age and made to look very pretty. She had long curly hair with a big satin bow in it and a pretty little pink dress, you could tell she was wearing a petticoat beneath the dress because the skirt of the dress stayed full and you could see some of the ruffles from it at the bottom of the skirt. The glass case was on top of a wooden box, the box was hand carved and with great craftsmanship, in the middle of the box just below the glass was a large pink button that looked like something you would press, below the button was an inscription carved into the box it read, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor all who play my name is Claire Play the game if you dare So many Treasures you can win if you press the button in Once inside will play will play, each and every single day I love to win I bet you do to So play the game and Ill play with you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn stepped back to look at the box, he looked at the button and then looked left, there was a lever on the side of the box that pulled like a casino machine. John started to pace back and forth and looked at the contraption and started thinking to himself \u201c what trouble could it cause, I mean it\u2019s just and old game. \u201c He started thinking that he might want to show his mother the game but of course curiosity killed the cat, John walked up reached out and pushed the button! Once the button was engaged the game started to vibrate and make a sound, then a drawer opened and there was a game board with in it. On the board was a circular path going around from the outside to the inside and the path was broken up into many spaces. Most of the spaces on the outside of the game board were blue but through out the blue spaces there were pink ones. As you got closer to the middle of the board there were more pink spaces then blue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the board was a set of dice, John looked the board over and only saw one player piece on it. The game looked amazing and he couldn\u2019t help himself he had to try it out. He reached for the game piece to pick it up but couldn\u2019t remove it from the start position, so he went and rolled the dice, it was a three, for some reason he was able to move the piece three spaces. John counted off the spaces and landed on a blue. Right after setting the piece on the space the lever started to light up, John pulled the lever down and the game whistled and clanked then spit a card out of a slot just above the board. There was writing on it and it read <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething that you really want <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill arrive outside in front <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the door bell started ringing, John ran downstairs to see who it was. There was a package on the front porch and a fed ex guy was driving down the road. John saw the package was for him and opened it, it was the latest Xbox and John didn\u2019t even have the earlier version his mother just didn\u2019t have the money. He set it all up on T V in his bedroom but he couldn\u2019t get it to work, just then the game in the room started to whistle and clank and spit out another card and it said <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime to make another roll <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr your game won\u2019t work at all <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn rolled the dice again and got another three, he moved his piece and landed on a pink spot, the machine spit out another card and it read <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll your boxers will have to be gone <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire thinks panties are more fun <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter John read the card he started to remove his trousers and boxer shorts then went over to one of the dressers opened the top drawer and pulled a pink pair of panties from it, then started to slide them on, he couldn\u2019t stop himself. After the panties were on he put his trousers on and proceeded to remove all the panties from Claire\u2019s drawer and put them in his drawer while removing his boxers and throwing them away! Uh Oh!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After the smoke cleared in John\u2019s mind he realized what he had done, all his boxer shorts were in the garage trash can! This trash can was the nasty one with old food and coffee grounds, there was no retrieving the boxer shorts at this point. \u201c What just happened to me? \u201c He thought, \u201c why did I just do that and why am I wearing panties? \u201c John became a little frantic so he went to his room and tried out the new Xbox and this time it was working fine. As John started to play he became distracted and forgot that he was wearing panties the new game consol was the bomb. Then after a while his memory clicked back in, \u201c Oh no I\u2019m a boy wearing girls panties, what am I going to do? \u201c The whole concept of wearing the panties was bad enough to John but the fact that he couldn\u2019t get himself to take them off was completely something else. <br>\r\nJohn\u2019s mother had arrived home from the old apartment, she was doing a final clean so she would get her security deposit back, when Lisa entered the house John started to freak! \u201c Oh man my mothers home! What am I going to tell her? \u201c John didn\u2019t know what to tell her about the new game consol or the fact the he was wearing panties and his top drawer in his dresser was full of them! Then his mother called John from the bottom of the stairs <br>\r\n\u201c John, I\u2019m doing some laundry bring what you have O K \u201c <br>\r\nJohn really started to freak, he gathered all his laundry and brought it down to his mother in the laundry room, she told him to throw it in the pile next to the laundry basket and that\u2019s just what he did. John\u2019s mother was busy sorting the cloths so he took off back upstairs and went back to playing the video game. After a while John\u2019s mother came upstairs to John\u2019s room and asked <br>\r\n\u201c so where\u2019s all your under ware John \u201c <br>\r\n\u201c oh I don\u2019t have any \u201c<br>\r\nLisa looked puzzled and asked \u201c What do you mean you don\u2019t have any? Have you been wearing the same ones all week? \u201c<br>\r\nJohn thought for a second then said \u201c yea that\u2019s it I\u2019ve been wearing the same pair all week \u201c<br>\r\nLisa didn\u2019t look happy and in a very annoyed voice said \u201c well then stripped those off and let me have them you piggy boy \u201c<br>\r\nJohn started to fumble and said \u201c let me finish my game mom, I\u2019ll put them in the next load O K. \u201c\u201d what game is this? \u201c Lisa started questioning \u201c were did this come from? And I asked you to strip now! This game looks brand new. We need to talk about this new game that I know I didn\u2019t buy, where did you get it? So stop with the game John and you get your shorts to the laundry now! \u201c<br>\r\nJohn\u2019s brain just started going into a tail spin, he didn\u2019t know what to do, he wasn\u2019t getting out of this one, so he did the first thing that came to him, he started crying. John went from desperate to a blubbering fool. Lisa\u2019s face went from assertive to worried, she started to try to calm John down. After a while John regained his composure and started to come clean. John went on telling Lisa about the room he had found in behind the wall in his closet and the game that was in there, then how the new video game appeared on the door step. As John went on Lisa listened but the whole thing sounded liken some crazy dream John came up with.<br>\r\nJohn hadn\u2019t come clean about what was under his trousers yet and that was the point of the story that was next. He started to explain why the whole laundry thing triggered all of this and what he was wearing, Lisa had a look of you can\u2019t be serious on her face and told him to lower his trousers. There they were in plain sight as pink as can be and Lisa\u2019s face dropped into what the. After a moment Lisa started talking<br>\r\n\u201c you know if you like to wear girls panties you don\u2019t have to make up some story about some secret room and a magical game just come out and say it and will figure something out \u201c<br>\r\nJohn realized his mother wasn\u2019t buying any of it and took her to the room in the closet. The two of them entered the closet and John hit the switch on the floor and the wall opened up, then John turned on the lights and the room lit up. Lisa entered the room with a look of fascination on her face, she couldn\u2019t believe what she was seeing and that John was actually telling the truth. Both of them walked over to the game and it started to whistle and clank and spit out another card, it read<br>\r\nTime has passed while you were away <br>\r\nRoll the dice so we can play<br>\r\nLisa looked at her son in amazement, the two of them started to talk<br>\r\n\u201c well John I must say your story is for real and I don\u2019t know what to think about all of this, I\u2019m kind of spooked by the whole thing. \u201c<br>\r\nJohn started shaking his head and replied \u201c Spooked huh, your not the one wearing her panties! There doesn\u2019t seem to be a way out of them either, I can\u2019t seem to bring myself to remove them, the thought creates so much fear inside me for some reason, every time I try to change to my boxers I become overwhelmed and nervous like life will cease to exist, it\u2019s like I have no choice but to wear panties for the rest of my life! \u201c<br>\r\nThe two of them pondered the situation for a moment, then Lisa said<br>\r\n\u201c what if you can redeem yourself playing the game, there must be some way to do that. \u201c<br>\r\nAfter Lisa said that the game whistled and clanked then spit a card out, it read<br>\r\nThere is always a chance Claire will lose <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd give you back the life you knew <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both read the card and looked at each other with a glimmer of hope, then they looked at the game and back at each other before Lisa said <br>\r\n\u201c I don\u2019t think you have much choice, I mean if it is the way you say it is, your going to have to try and win the game!<br>\r\nJohn thought for a moment and looked at the game and agreed with his mother. He picked up the dice and rolled away, it rolled three again and that took him to a blue spot, the game did it\u2019s thing and spit out another card.<br>\r\nYou know your mother works so hard<br>\r\nTime for her to get a new job<br>\r\nJust as they were both done reading the card Lisa\u2019s cell phone started to ring, she answered it and it was Harry Davis from Davis Corp. a company that Lisa tempted at some time ago. The conversation went on for a little while and you could see a big smile coming over Lisa\u2019s face, she hung up the phone and started to go on to John about the job that was just offered to her!<br>\r\n\u201c That was Harold Davis of the Davis Corp. he just offered me a job, to ru the shipping dept. of his company, the pay is 75 K a year with benefits and a company car, I can\u2019t believe it can you!<br>\r\nJohn shook his head and asked<br>\r\n\u201c mom did he say you have the job? \u201c<br>\r\n\u201c no not exactly but he did say I was a perfect fit and he had only one more interview to do so wait for his phone call. \u201c<br>\r\nJust then the game spit out another card that read<br>\r\nOne more roll it\u2019s always in two\u2019s<br>\r\nThe job will be hers if you follow through<br>\r\nJohn sighed and started counting the spaces to the pink ones because he now realized that those were Claire\u2019s spaces and the next pink one was three spaces away. Lisa nodded her head in a what ever you want to do fashion and John picked up the dice, the moment was quiet and John released the roll, it was a five! John started to smile because that took him to a blue space. The card popped out of the game and it said<br>\r\nSlow your roll down it went to fast<br>\r\nSubtract two spaces from your last<br>\r\nJohn had no choice but to move back two spaces that took him to a pink space and again the game produced a card. Both John and his mother started reading the card. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to skip by ha, ha, ha, ha<br>\r\nYour wearing my panties now match with a bra <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as they were done reading the card John\u2019s face went blank and he walked over to Claire\u2019s dresser and found a pink satin bra and put it on under his shirt, then proceeded to remove all the different colored bras and bring them to his dresser while his mom watched the whole thing, he placed them next to all Claire\u2019s panties and closed the drawer.<br>\r\nLisa was dumbfounded and didn\u2019t know what to do, she was afraid, she didn\u2019t want to say anything while John had that blank stare on his face. When John\u2019s mind cleared he was standing in his room and knew exactly what had happened and said<br>\r\n\u201c oh great this is wonderful now I wear a matching bra to! \u201c<br>\r\nLisa couldn\u2019t believe what she had just witnessed and John was starting to flip, the both of them were scared and started to hug each other then Lisa tried to calm John down<br>\r\n\u201c John \u201c she said \u201c it really doesn\u2019t look that bad \u201c<br>\r\nJohn responded quickly \u201c mom are you kidding \u2018 he ran to the bathroom mirror and turned to look at his profile and started ranting \u201c look at me, this bra is got some padding, I look like I have tit\u2019s! \u201c<br>\r\nLisa couldn\u2019t help but giggle a little so she tried to do it quietly, then John started to change into a half dozen other shirts just to have the same out come, finally he put his denim jacket on and was satisfied. John and his mother were mystified of the power of the game that John got himself involved with, they had no idea what to do about John\u2019s predicament. John became angry and went to the game board, he walked up and started ranting, then he slammed his hands down it, the lights started flashing on the game and it started whistling real loud the it spit out a card that said <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoys can be unruly they can be ruff <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire does not like that kind of stuff <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gift to calm so to speak <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have been petticoated for a week <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn had no idea what that meant but while his mother watched he started to change into one of Claire\u2019s outfits complete with a petticoat and everything that went with it, a wig, jewelry, tights and shoes all in pink. When John came to he was totally freaked! The next words from Lisa while slowly shaking her head and trying not to smile were <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c I must say you do look cute \u201c </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lisa calmed john down, he was frantic and didn\u2019t know what to do. Lisa started saying things that she thought would ease his mood <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c John, John calm yourself down, it\u2019s just a dress, but I must say it is adorable and you don\u2019t look half bad in it \u2018 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn looked at his mother and replied sarcastically \u201c really mom how is it that I don\u2019t feel any better hearing that, would you please tell me \u201c <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c I\u2019m sorry John it\u2019s just that I haven\u2019t seen a petticoat worn with a dress in such a long time, it\u2019s just so cute \u201c <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c mom please, I\u2019m your son! \u201c John replied with angst. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c I know you are honey, but right now you look like my daughter \u201c <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the shock of the whole petticoat reality started to wear off John started to relax and as he relaxed Claire started to chisel away at John\u2019s persona. Little things like instead of saying mom John started calling her mommy or making sure the dress stayed clean and tidy. At first John was oblivious to these things but his mother wasn\u2019t and she kept her observations were to herself. This all happened at the end of the day and the evening was starting to fall, Lisa asked John if there was anything that he was in the mood for and John replied <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c tea would be lovely mommy, wait did I really just say that? Oh no what is going on with me! \u201c <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c Tea is fine with me \u201c Lisa answered <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn was getting a bit confused when he talked, he wanted to say something the way he would always talk and half the time it would come out like some proper young lady was talking. Regardless Lisa started brewing the tea and John set the table, when Lisa was done brewing she turned to bring it to the table and that\u2019s when the whole thing became very obvious that her little boy was changing and there was nothing she could do. The table was set, one of the pretty table cloths were on the table and the china from Lisa\u2019s tea set was on the table. There were cups, saucers, sugar bowl and creamer along with cloth napkins and pastry, it had the look of the perfect little tea party for the two of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lisa turned to face the table John asked <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c how does it look mommy? \u201c <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa wasn\u2019t sure how to react so she just said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c it looks perfect honey, great job \u201c <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn giggled as Lisa brought the tea to the table, she placed it in the middle and they both seated themselves. Lisa sat down and watched as John seated himself, he stepped around the chair smoothed the back of his skirt on the dress he was wearing sat down put his legs together wrapped one ankle around the other off to the left side, placed his hands in his lap in a very lady like manner and asked <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c mommy would you like one lump or two with your tea? \u201c <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa was speechless she didn\u2019t know how to respond then she asked <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c John is that you? \u201c <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c of course mom, who would it be \u201c <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa realized when she talked to John like he was her son he would react back to her like he was her son but it was hard not to look at him like he was her daughter, I mean he looked so pretty in the little outfit he was wearing and so Lisa\u2019s struggle began. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe evening went into night and the conversation was tricky, Lisa tried all night to talk to John like a young boy but it was hard for her when she was looking at a young lady and the sight of her was very convincing. The two talked and Lisa watched as John went in and out of the feminine roll that he was dressed for and Lisa was finding hard not to enjoy having a daughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while the two of them agreed it was time for bed and both went to get ready, when the two met in the hall at the top of the stairs John had changed into the most adorable night gown with a matching robe that tied in a big bow at the collar. He looked perfect and Lisa was overcome with the emotion of having a daughter, she thought to herself \u201c I have to stop enjoying this, I may lose John if I don\u2019t \u201c <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both were off to bed and the next morning Lisa woke to sounds of breakfast in the kitchen, she could smell the fresh coffee and hear the toaster popping, there was a lot going on down there and she was very curious as to what. She got out of bed and put her robe on and headed down to the kitchen where she found a young lady all bathed and wearing a lavender summer dress with ankle socks that had ruffles at the top of them, the dress was cute as cute gets and with pretty and very girlie apron over it the look was precious, the sight looked like a Norman Rockwell painting or something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa watched as John prepared breakfast, she stayed out of sight so she could observe him while he was alone. While she watched she couldn\u2019t help but see that every movement and every gesture and every expression was that of a young lady. This started to scare Lisa so she interrupted the moment and said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c John is that you \u201c <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course John snapped back into the picture and replied \u201c yea mom, are you alright? \u201c <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c I am John are you alright? What are you doing? \u201c <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Lisa talked to John he answered as John but when John went to explain what he was doing Claire spoke for him <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c why I\u2019m making you breakfast mommy so you can get ready for that interview this morning, so why don\u2019t you get ready while I get breakfast on the table \u201c <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Lisa could say was \u201c O K dear \u201c <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went to get ready and started to think about the situation that her son was in, what did she need to do? Lisa started thinking about calling in a professional, but who would she call? This was no ordinary situation going on and Lisa didn\u2019t even know how to explain it. She decided to wait until the week of petticoats was done then see where John would be at. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa headed down to the kitchen after she was done getting ready, when she walked in the table was set and her plate had one soft boiled egg, some bacon and a glass of juice, toast and coffee. The table was perfect and there were fresh picked flowers in a vase on the table picked from the flowers out front. Lisa asked her son <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c John did you get the flowers from out front \u201c <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn replied \u201c I did didn\u2019t I, what if someone saw me picking flowers wearing this dress oh no! I can\u2019t believe who I\u2019m turning into I\u2019m thinking like a girl all the time now! Mom what am I going to do? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa told John to try and be calm, she will be back as soon as possible and that they would figure it all out when she got home. As she was talking to John she noticed his fingernails were painted to match the dress he was wearing \u201c oh boy \u201c she thought \u201c I\u2019ve got to get home fast \u201c <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
