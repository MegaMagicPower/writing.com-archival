The place was all but deserted, and she'd prune up permanently if she waited for a kind stranger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Muttering about her circumstance, Usagi tiptoed back inside the inn. No people about, but nothing to wear, either. Checking different rooms, she made a game out of her sneaking around, taking exaggerated steps and whispering to herself that she was the \"Naked Ninja.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Just as she was mentally working up a theme song for the Naked Ninja TV series, starring her, Usagi found herself cornered. The old lady who acted as housekeeper had stealthily crept into the room Usagi had been checking, wielding a huge feather duster and working over the fusuma. No escape!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   The lady was mostly blind and almost totally deaf, so Usagi decided to wait her out. Not that it wasn't mortifying. But having to explain her situation at sufficient volume to make the cleaning lady understand would be even more embarrassing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Must remember my Naked Ninja training!\" Usagi thought to herself, steepling her fingers and concentrating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   She actually thought something was starting to happen, the air stirring around her. But when she opened her eyes and quit goofing around as a ninja, Usagi realized she was REALLY cornered. The old lady was moving right for the ornaments stacked on the table Usagi was in front of. No way out, short of stepping on her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Usagi gritted her teeth, feeling more vulnerable than... well, ever. Proceeding by memory in a task performed thousands of times, the old woman gave the knickknacks a thorough feathering. Or would have, if Usagi hadn't been blocking them with her own knickknacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   &lt;&lt;SNNRK!&gt;&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Usagi managed to choke back a laugh, but the feather duster wasn't going anywhere. With one hand clapped over her mouth and the other trying to defend against the duster, Usagi hopped from foot to foot, her face turning red from suppressed laughter. She tried spinning around, hoping her backside was less sensitive, and got immediate confirmation to the contrary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Usagi continued to pirouette in place, desperate for the old lady to move on, until...</span></div></div>",

Those knick knacks you were dusting were, um, me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must be losing my marbles,\" mumbled the old lady. \"I swear there was someone or something making noises.\" She began dusting again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OHMYGOOOOOODNESS!HAHAHAHAAHHAAHA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanicking, Usagi gripped onto the lady's shoulder.

She reached another room and peeked in to find it was full of people. And what was worse... she saw one of the pink yukuta, just laying there, as if to tease her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Seriously?</i> she thought, grimly.

But...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rei.\" Usagi managed to moan out as Rei was embracing one of her ample breasts with her lips. \"C-can we go to your room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei looked up at the blushing blond girl. \"I was fine right here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know...\" Usagi said, her sex throbbing for attention. \"But...what if someone catches us here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooooh.

Get me a little excited thinking about you wondering around wearing my little bitty towel and nothing else?

You can't do your little baby pout and be naked! I can't win against both of them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Rei-chan...\" Usagi said in her sing song voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay! Okay! I forgive you.\" Rei said. \"But what do we do now??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can use your towel!\" Usagi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Usagi...\" Rei said patiently. \"That towel covers one person. Barely. There's no way we can share it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could use it to get into your room and get dressed.\" Usagi offered. \"And then come back for me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Except my key was in the pocket of my clothes.\" Rei said sadly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Won't they have a spare at the front desk?\" Usagi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. That's actually a good idea. Way to go, Usagi!\" Rei said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't need to sound that impressed.\" Usagi lamented. \"I can have good ideas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you can.\" Rei said sassingly. \"Its rare, but it happens a couple times a year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi stuck her tongue out at the naked Rei. The black haired girl arched an eyebrow and swatted the blond on her butt, which elicited a little shriek from her. Rei trotted back to the bath before Usagi could retaliate. But she stopped dead when she reached the bath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe towel was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How...Where...When...\" Usagi sputtered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is unreal.\" Rei whispered. \"Okay....no clothes, no keys, and now no towel. Do...you have any other good ideas? Because I'm fresh out...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi thought hard.</span></div></div>",

Waiting here was my plan after MY clothes were stolen, and you showed up and wanted to do what we were GOING to do (and you kept TEASING me until I wanted to do it too!) and then your clothes disappeared. So I'm just going back to plan A with a fun way to pass the time. What's wrong with that?\" Usagi demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For one thing, you were worried about someone finding us a moment ago!\" Rei shot back, falling into her role as Usagi's chief source of rivalry and argument as easily as she had a lover a moment ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm less worried about being caught in a bath were its OKAY to be naked than I am roaming a hallway that way. And now you want us to sit here waiting for help to come WHO KNOWS WHEN and seeing each other naked and NOT do anything about it?\" Usagi said, nearly in hysterionics. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei growled to herself and crossed her arms. Her usual scowl of disapproval softened and broke looking at Usagi's antics, but a pained look replaced it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Usagi...\" Rei said after a moment. \"About this...what we've been doing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh?\" Usagi paused, half-way through muttering something to herself about fiery haired sex goddess and horrible teases and being driven into mental illnesses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I wanted to do this for a long time. And when we first started these little midnight sessions of ours, the most selfish part of me was thrilled. But...\" Rei trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You feel guilty.\" Usagi said simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Usagi, I love you.\" Rei said ernestly. \"I always will. But I know how you feel about Mamoru. I've seen the world you two make together- we've been to the future. We've seen Crystal Tokyo. Chibausa fought with us through some of our hardest battles. I'm supposed to protect you! I can't-\" Rei broke off, tears in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think your destroying that by loving me now.\" Usagi finished. \"Rei, sit by me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi settled herself into the water. Rei hesitantly followed her. Usagi draped an arm over her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was going to wait to talk to you about this. Its a little new for me, too, you know. But your more worried than I understood about it.\" Usagi pouted a little. \"We need to work on that, you know. You never seem to talk about about anything that's bothering you until it eats you from the inside out, but you'll have sex at the drop of a hat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei smirked despite her tears. \"Well, if that's a problem I can tone the sex down for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you dare! I'm saying to open up the rest of the way! We don't need to tone anything down!\" Usagi said, a little dismayed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh. You scare too easy.\" Rei said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph.\" Usagi said. \"All right. Moving on....Rei, your assuming too many things. You think what your doing...and don't think I didn't notice how when its 'wrong' its what 'your' doing as opposed to what 'we' do, by the way...you think your sacrificing our future. Rei, did you think I hadn't already thought of that? Did you think Mamoru hadn't?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Rei asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rei...Mamo-chan knows about us.\" Usagi said with a smile. \"Your forgetting...he protects more than just me. He's saved all of you at one point or another. He's helped and guided all of us. He sees each of us as the hope for the future of the world. Your feelings for me, Rei-chan...he accepts those.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei's face burned. \"You told him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually...he told me.\" Usagi said sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's that again?\" Rei asked, more bewildered by the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...err...didn't really notice when you were getting interested in me. He pointed out the looks you'd been giving me and what they meant.\" Usagi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Rei said, huffing a bit. \"That takes some of the mystique out of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rei.\" Usagi said, elbowing the girl slightly. \"The point is...its all right with him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\" Rei said, downcast. \"Well...then I guess its okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi sighed to herself in exasperation. \"You DON'T see. Now your thinking 'I'm her mistress' or something. You aren't! You...Rei, you used to date Mamo-chan, remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does that have to-\" Rei's eyes widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did it ever occur to you that maybe you could have both of us at some point?\" Usagi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd really...\" Rei choked off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not? You were clearly interested in him, he liked you, and I love both of you. And...don't tell him I said this...but getting the two of us into the same bed has been his little perverted fantasy for loner than I want to think about.\" Usagi said conspiratorially.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So he thinks he can handle me.\" Rei smirked. \"He's pretty optimistic, considering the one he's had to work with up until now has been a crybaby bunnyrabbit that only likes the vanilla stuff...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY!\" Usagi said, much too loud. \"I've gotten better...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, because I had to SHOW you!\" Rei snapped back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid black haired bitch!\" Usagi snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dumpling headed moron!\" Rei shot back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two stared at each other, challenge and desire clearly in their eyes. Then, with a playful light in their eyes, the two began kissing, pressing their breasts and bodies up against one another. The hot springs boiled all around them, and the calm surface of the bath began to ripple as the pair began to disrupt it with gusto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...feeling better?\" Usagi asked, as Rei sucked on her neck, leaving a large hicky behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, was I thought obvious?\" Rei shot back, as Usagi flicked her nipple with a serpentine tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. So...Rei-sensei, shall I show you what your student has learned?\" Usagi asked playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh! Yes, do that! Just..remember! If...if you get a bad grade...I-ah-ll need to t-tutor you again.\" Rei said, trying to sound like their first period teacher, which was less than effective with all the attention Usagi was giving. \"M-maybe even...discpline!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ewww.\" Usagi said in mock terror. \"Please. Rei-sama! I'll be good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey thrashed about for a moment, then both were startled by a loud \"ahem!\" coming just above their heads.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Most of our guests have the decency to follow our rules and avoid any lude behavior while they're in the baths.\" The resort maid said caustically. \"But every once in awhile we find some trouble makers who care more about cheap thrills than respecting the people they share these baths with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, lady, you don't need-\" Rei began, a little miffed at the disgusted tone in the matron's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortunately, we know how to deal with them.\" The maid said ominously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...do you mean?\" Sailor moon asked nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gather up your towels and leave this bath immediately. Its noon. In three minutes we open this bath up to our male guests.\" The matron announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha? Wait a minute. This is the women's bath!\" Usagi stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We only have one hot spring in this hotel. In the morning, we leave it open to the women, in the afternoon the men use it. I was just making a quick sweep to make sure we don't have any stragglers. And I've found you two. So, get your belongings and go. We've got a long line today, and we're supposed to open in two minutes.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two senshi looked at each other in alarm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm...miss...\" Usagi began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said MOVE!\" The matron demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't have any towels, okay?\" Rei snapped. \"Someone took our things while we were in the bath. So go find us a towel of something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe matron crossed her arms. \"Oh, you little sluts!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Rei squated, furious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your just a pair of exhibitionists, aren't you? I know your type! You were hoping to put on a show for the boys! Well, take your little traveling porn show somewhere else!\" The matron demanded in disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look lady, we were just minding our own business when someone yanked our clothes, okay? Its your crappy security that-\" Rei snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Out of the pool right now!\" The matron demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way in hell are we getting out until you bring us a towel!\" Rei snapped back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like me to call security?\" The matron asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead! I have a theft to report! And I'm not gonna move from here until I get something to cover myself with!\" Rei snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you hussies didn't bring anything in, that's your own fault. And if I call security, they are going to eject you from this bath by force.\" The matron warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bring it on, you cunt!\" Rei snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could we just-\" Usagi began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT DID YOU CALL ME? THAT'S IT! TIME'S UP! SECURITY WILL BE HERE IN 5 MINUTES.\" The matron screamed, storming over to a small cart, grabbing a radio, and barking into it as she waddled off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mars, what were you thinking?\" Usagi demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, relax. She's just some domineering bitch on a power trip. We'll be fine.\" Rei said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, a group of young boys wandered into the bath, laughing and talking. But all conversation died as they locked eyes on the two girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The.they're butt naked!\" One stuttered, leering at the women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy crap!\" Another one said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That bitch let the men in!\" Rei exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls slunk into the water. More and more people poured into the bath. Shock and surprise turned to leering in no time at all. The two girls covered themselves underwater, trying to shield themselves in the bubbling bath. Unfortunately, other than the distortion of the surface the pool was crystal clear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right ladies. Security is on its way. My suggestion would be to get up and leave of your own choice before they arrive.\" The matron said, coming back into view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but everyone's looking at us!\" Usagi wailed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps you should have thought of that ahead of time?\" The matron said acidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What'll we do?\" Usagi asked Rei.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>   \"Who...?!\" Ami shouted, breaking off and blushing. Whoever had kifed her clothes, they obviously weren't still in the small studio. Folding her arms over her breasts, Ami sat in furiously embarrassed silence for several moments, regretting her agreement to go through with something she hadn't felt comfortable with from the start. Maybe her friend had stopped by and taken her clothes for some reason, and was soon to return?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   As Ami was trying to convince herself she hadn't been seen (nude and asleep!) by a complete stranger, she felt something underfoot and looked down. The plastic sheeting, placed to keep her feet from the paint-spattered floor while she posed, was covered with photographs. Quality work, and she could still smell the fixative over the normal studio smells of gesso and linseed oil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"What?!\" she said aloud, still at a loss for words. Two shocks in one afternoon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   A series of 8x10s, each carefully numbered, showed Ami... naked and snoozing. Without thinking, Ami put the pictures in numeric order and began flipping through them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   The first several showed her nodding off, settling into the chair. The next few were taken later, at various points as she shifted in her doze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   The idea of someone patiently photographing her as she slept was creepy enough, but the subsequent photos were completely unhinged. Ami's jaw dropped at the weirdness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Picture #9 saw a gigantic fude entering from off-frame. #10 had the huge calligraphy brush poking at her navel, Ami caught in mid-squirm as she tried to push it away. The eleventh showed all but the tip of the brush out of frame, the focus on Ami's tummy where \"Ticklish\" had just been written in delicate script, black ink as fine as ballpoint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   The next eighteen were unbelievable, Ami forced into a number of positions as the fude continued its work. Each photo saw the addition of another \"Ticklish\" tag somewhere on Ami's body, and her contortions became so involved that she would have realistically sprained or broken something. Yet she remained asleep throughout the shoot, however involved her brush-induced gymnastics became. She seemed to be laughing forcefully, her eyes squeezed shut in hysterics. The oversized fude was never completely in the picture, presumably held by someone unseen. But who could handle such a large brush with enough precision to write all over her? The penultimate picture was utterly ridiculous, Ami arching herself in a neck-snapping display as the brush got at her posterior, her feet braced on the chair arms and her head against the chair back. Her artist must have lain on the floor and written from an impossible angle for that one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   The last picture was Ami, awake, just starting to yell, \"Who...?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Ami looked herself over for the hundredth time, finding no trace of words or even an ink spot. She wasn't sore or sweaty, as she'd expect after such an intensive workout. The photos must be very elaborate manipulations, arranged during her nap... but what was the purpose?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Sitting baffled, Ami leapt up as she heard the studio's door open behind her. She reflexively fanned the photos and held them over her front, hiding the worst of her humiliating condition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"I'm presently indisposed!\" Ami called out, feeling silly but thinking <b>some</b> warning was called for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   And in comes...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Amy nearly jumped out of her bare skin when she heard the sound of the bathroom door creeping open.  She had hoped to find something to wear in the restroom.  Even if she had to wrap herself in toilet paper, it would be better than this!  Frantically looking around for a place to hide, Amy finds no means of escape, until she sees the Janitor's cart slowly exiting the bathroom.  It would be a tight fit, but the sides were covered with dirty looking sheets.  If she was fast, she could climb inside and avoid detection, at least for a little while.  It was a risky plan, but she really didn't have a lot of time to think.  Instead, she just ran towards the cart, as quickly and silently as she could, before crouching down and scurrying inside.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Janitor, an older man, close to retirement, stops and looks around for a moment, puzzled.  He could have sworn he heard something.  After looking up and down the hall however, he just shrugs, throws the towel he had in his hands over his shoulder and starts wheeling his cart towards the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the cart, Amy's heart was pounding in her chest.  The cart wasn't meant to hold a human being, and even though Amy was petite, the cart afforded her little room to move around.  So there she sat, curled up in a ball with her knees pressed tight against her chest, and her naked butt pressed against the cold, hard, dirty plastic of the Janitor's cart.  Her mind raced as she tried to think of a plan, but it was a difficult task indeed.  The cart was moving, and she had no idea where it would stop.  If she was going to make a break for it, she'd have to be aware of her surroundings. Unfortunately, as much as the sheets shielded her from view, they also blocked her own vision as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually however, the cart came to a stop, but before Amy could take a peak around the sheets, she heard the click clack of a heavy metal door coming open, and then the cart was moving again.  Instantly, the sounds of open air and the busy city streets began to flood into the cart from all around her.  \"Oh God!\" She thought to herself, \"I'm outside, in broad daylight!  How am I ever going to get out of this without being seen now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough the cart stopped again and the garbage bag that hung only a few inches in front of her disappeared.  The Janitor was emptying the trash into a dumpster in the alley.  Luckily, the old man hadn't noticed her when he removed the bag.  Now exposed from the front, Amy didn't want to spend another second trapped inside the tiny, dingy cart.  While the Janitor was still emptying the trash, Amy stumbled out of the cart and quickly hid behind a nearby garbage can.  Peaking around the side, she watched as the Janitor slammed the top of the dumpster shut and headed back into the building.  Quickly rushing to the door, Amy was devastated (but not surprised) to find it locked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning her forehead up against the door, with her hands over her breasts and her naked butt exposed in the urban breeze, Amy is close to tears as she wonders what she could possibly do now.  How had this even happened to her?  Somebody had taken her clothes while she slept.  Could it have been the Janitor?  Why would he do something so cruel?  He didn't look like a man who had just played such an evil joke on an innocent girl.  He looked like a regular Joe just finishing up at the end of the day.  He did look kind of old though.  Maybe his eyesight was bad.  Maybe he swept up her clothes and didn't even notice she was in the room!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA glimmer of hope glows to life within Amy's bare chest (somewhere between her cute, perky breasts one would imagine) and she quickly rushes over to the dumpster and tries to lift the lid.  If the Janitor had swept up her clothes, they'd probably be in the dumpster!  Unfortunately, after a few moments of fruitless naked struggle, Amy is disappointed to learn that the dumpster, like the door, is locked.  Defeated, Amy turns around and leans her back up against the dumpster and slides down until her pale butt cheeks make contact with the gritty concrete.  Looking around the filthy alley, Amy can't imagine what her next move would be.  She's totally naked, in a busy city, in broad daylight and miles away from home.  And where the heck was her so called friend anyway!?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Amy's hands instinctively rose up from her sides to cover her privates.  She didn't even blush.  Her whole body just felt cold with shock.  She always felt so awkward around Daria, but this was taking it to a whole new level.  Daria, on the other hand, didn't seem disturbed at all.  On the contrary, she seemed rather amused, sauntering confidently over to the dumpster and crouching down next to her shivering naked friend.  Daria just stared at the silent scout for a few moments before a devilish glint came to her eye.  Without warning, Daria moved in close and kissed Amy full on the lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy's eyes went wide with shock, and she tried to say something, but it was muffled by Daria's warm, wet lips.  The kiss was gentle, but Amy none the less felt emotionally overpowered.  All of the strength seemed to drain from her body and her eyes closed as she allowed herself to be overtaken by the moment.  When Daria was finished, she pulled away, but stayed crouched down next to Amy, watching her with a Cheshire smile.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Amy recovered from the kiss, she could do little more than stare back at Daria with a dreamy look in her eyes and ask \"What was that for?\" Giggling, Daria responded \"Just saying hi, thats all.  What are you doing out here without any clothes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Amy did blush.  As unbelievable as it may sound, she actually forgot she was naked.  Daria had that kind of effect on her.  It's like her wits and her will turn to jelly when she's around.  Following Daria's kiss, Amy had allowed her hands to fall once again to her sides, letting everything she had hang out for Daria's inspection.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, are you going to answer me, or are you just going to sit there looking all hot and bothered?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy didn't think she could blush any redder, but she did.  This time however, she managed to muster a response. Amy explained, \"I arrived right on time, in exactly the right spot and I found your note, the one that told me to get myself ready, so I did.  When you didn't show up, however, I started to get tired, and I couldn't help it... I nodded off.  When I woke up... no more clothes.\"  Amy continued to relate the encounter with the janitor and her theory about what happened to her clothes.  Daria listens patiently and when Amy is through, she just whistles and laughs.  \"Well, that is one heck of a story Amy.  I would have been here sooner, but I got caught up on the way here, you understand.  Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy nodded, but in all actuality, Daria didn't look too sorry.  She seemed to think Amy's whole predicament was hilarious.  \"Do you have anything I can wear?\"  Amy asked.  \"I'm really rather desperate...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Ams, no can do.\"  Daria replied, quickly.  \"All I've got are the clothes on my back, and there's no way I'm walking home in just my birthday suit!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could I... I mean, if you don't mind... c-could I at least... maybe borrow your... your underwear?\"  Amy blurted out, finding it hard to make her mouth form the words her mind commanded it to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaria nearly falls over laughing.  \"You know Amy, I wish I could help you out, I really do... but...\"  and with that, Daria stood up and lifted the hem of her skirt.  \"...but I'm going commando today, girlfriend!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy couldn't believe she was staring up at Daria's bare sex.  She could see everything!  When Daria pushed her skirt back down, Amy was crestfallen, for more reasons than one.  \"Aww, cheer up Amy!  It's not the end of the world.  We'll figure something out.  In the mean time, let get some pictures...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\"  Amy was quick to reply. \"Tha... I mean.. we can't just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't be so fussy Ams.  You showed up here to pose in the nude right?  I'm sorry I got here late, but this is for a school project, remember?  I NEED these pictures.  So get up off your naked butt and stand over by those trashcans where the lighting is better.  This alley is a terrible place to take pictures, but I suppose it'll have to do...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up, Amy drapes one hand over her breasts and places the other one firmly between her legs as she looks around in uncertainty.  \"Can't we try to find a way back inside the studio?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so.\"  Daria replied as she fiddled with the lens on her camera.  \"The place usually closes at this time.  I'm afraid we're just going to have to make due.  We won't have the best lighting, but we'll have some interesting scenery, that\u2019s for sure.  Okay Amy, just try to act natural.

Press yourself up against it....\" Daria's camera flashed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, turn around. The blush is nice, but don't look so frantic! Lean up against the wall. Stretch your arms out. Like your going to fly. Good!\" Daria snapped another photo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, get down on your knees. Hold your hand out to the camera. Yeah, like your asking for something. That's wonderful.\" Snap. Flash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I know its dirty, but lean down on your side. Close your eyes. Pretend your thinking about something far away....like someone you want to be with. Prop yourself up on your left hand. Okay. Hold that pose.\" Snap. Flash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep your body like that. Just a few more.\" Ami heard something wistful in Daria's voice. She heard another camera flash. \"Just....keep holding that pose....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi's arms were starting to ache. Modeling was a bit harder than she had imagined. It took more than just sitting there. You had to hold a pose for an extended period. It wasn't a big strain on the muscles to hold for a shot or two, but they started to add up. She heard more camera shots, and she was about to ask Daria if she could break the pose and rest for a moment when she felt a snake along her waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daria?\" She whispered in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't move! You'll ruin the picture.\" Daria whispered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi heard the camera go off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, one more like this and then I'll let you rest.\" Daria whispered, drawing closer to Ami. To the Sailor Scout's surprise, she felt only bare skin when Daria made contact with her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you...naked?\" Ami whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted in on the fun. Don't move.\" Daria said, and the camera flashed. \"Okay, you can open your eyes. Relax a minute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi looked at her photographer. Daria knelt next to her, completely naked. Her breasts were large and cropped with a nipple ring. There was a piercing in her navel as well, and a little tattoo just above her sex. While a little wild, she was still a very good looking woman. Ami blushed at her own perusal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaria smiled. \"My my, you are getting flustered today. Its so cute! I need to get you naked more often.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...aren't you supposed to be manning the camera?\" Ami asked at last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, I hooked it up to a tripod and put it on a timer. It'll snap a shot of us being naked every now and then.\" Daria said smiling. \"Speaking of which.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe naked girl began crawling towards Ami, who took in a breath and drew back a step. The camera flashed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'll call that one \"hunter and prey\".\" Daria said with a laugh. Ami glowered at her friend a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Won't this ruin your project? You can't see what kind of pictures your getting now.\" Ami said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh. You learn how to predict these things without staring down the viewfinder every second. Besides, the shots I got of you earlier should be enough to get me a decent grade. I thought we could have some fun with the rest of the shoot.\" Daria said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err...what kind of fun do you mean?\" Ami asked nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmm....well, you didn't seem to object to that little kiss earlier....\" Daria said as she crawled towards Ami once more. They stared eye to eye mere inches from each other. Another flash went off. This time Daria didn't break the close proximity, but ran a hand down Ami's hip. Ami blushed deeply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you like girls, Ami?\" Daria asked seductively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N...no....\" Ami said uncertainly. \"Not always....but...sometimes....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" Daria said, circling her hand along Ami's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sometimes I do.\" Ami said in a whisper. She didn't add that most of those times had been literally a lifetime ago, when she was a princess of another world and the bonds between herself and other people were....different. There wasn't a word to describe the feelings the old Senshi had for each other- their bond crossed friendship, lovers, and family- it was all of those things and yet something else all together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, my camera can take about 2000 pictures before its batteries or memory run out. So...what do you say? Wanna make this one of those times?\" Daria smiled wickedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I....\" Ami gulped. \"How...do you get me to do these things?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaria snorted, leaning in closer. \"Its not too hard, Ami. You just need to figure out what people want before they know they want it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe camera went off. It would be the last time the pair would take notice of it as they began to kiss, then took turns teasing one another's bodies until neither could stand the wait any longer, and began to make love in ernest. Daria took the lead most of the time, putting Ami into a variety of positions straight out of the karma sutra. Ami quickly realized Daria was delighting in posing her in the most lude poses just as the camera went off. More than once, though, Ami insisted on a pose that made even Daria blush, a holdover from her past life in which inhibitions and modesty had always played a distant second to the joy of exploring one's lovemaking. Before they were done, each had orgasmed many times over, and the camera caught more than a few in the midst of those throes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've been amazing, Ami.\" Daria said. \"I should have done this a long time ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi blushed deeply. She had amazed even herself with how far she'd been willing to go with this girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I think I've held you prisoner long enough. Let's get dressed. We can sneak off to my apartment, get you some clothes. I'll pick out the PG picks of this shoot and turn them in. And I'll save the rest for you and me.\" Daria winked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi laughed, the first geniune laugh she'd had since this nightmare began. Well, all things considered, it wasn't so bad....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi blinked as she saw Daria standing up in confusion, which was quickly turning to alarm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ami, did you see where I left my clothes?\" She asked. \"Or...the camera?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err...\" Ami said. \"It was right over there a minute ago. Did we knock it over?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" Daria said firmly. \"I'd have noticed. I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi and Daria both colored visibly as the situation sunk in. They'd been completely focused on each other. Had someone else been watching them? Even if that wasn't the case...everything they did had been caught on film. And now they were both caught- no camera, no clothes, and no money or keys to Daria's car or apartment! What were they going to do now?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Daria searched the alley fruitlessly for any trace of her camera or her clothes, Ami stood back and considered the situation carefully.  The nearsighted janitor had seemed the most likely culprit behind the initial disappearance of her clothes, but now, that was beginning to seem less likely, presuming that the former and current disappearances are related.  The old man was slow, and seemingly oblivious to Ami's presence or predicament.  If he was the mastermind behind this whole situation, then he was also an exceptionally good actor.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi's train of thought was derailed momentarily when Daria once again made her way into her field of vision.  Daria was on her hands and knees pushing aside a pair of empty trashcans, searching for something, anything, and finding nothing.  Daria wasn't what Ami would call a shy girl, but in her current frantic state, any pretense of modesty she had was abandoned, and Ami couldn't help but watch as Daria moved in all of her unabashed glory. Even though she was frustrated, worried and making no attempt to look sexy or alluring, Ami felt strangely fascinated, like she was seeing Daria truly naked for the first time.  She was no less clothed of course, and aside from her piercings, her dyed hair and the little tattoo above her kitty, she was already in as natural a state as she could possibly be, but Daria had a certain attitude, a certain element of character that kept her somehow partly removed, a part of her impenetrable and inaccessible, even while she and Ami had been making love.  Now, all of that was gone, and Ami felt as if she was staring into her naked soul by way of her naked ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Ami was going to be honest with herself, she'd have to admit that a part of her had suspected that Daria had been behind the abduction of her clothes, at first as a prank, and then later as part of a plot to seduce her.  Now, those thoughts were all but banished from her mind.  Ami would have forgiven her, but there was some comfort to be had in the knowledge that this strange girl who was her lover was an innocent in the course of these strange events.  Of course, that meant someone else was behind these machinations, someone unseen and unknown, and that left a cold and nasty feeling in the pit of Ami's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feeling got worse when it occurred to Ami that forces more sinister than mischievous prankery could be at work here.  As Sailor Mercury, Ami was a target for a seemingly endless array of malevolent entities, and all of this could easily be an elaborate setup to leave her naked and vulnerable. Was that it?  Had she walked into a trap?  She cursed her own stupidity.  She was a fool to have left her only means of transformation at home, but she didn't want to have to explain herself to her friend.  Knowing how Daria can twist her mind into knots, Ami chose to do what she had to do to ensure that her dual identity remained a secret.  Now, Daria could very well end up being an unfortunate casualty of that secret, and all the danger and horror that come along with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daria...\"  Ami began, trying to hide the mixed emotions of worry and anger that she knew would creep into her voice as she spoke, \"We have to go.  Something is going on here, and if we stay any longer, I'm afraid it will only get worse.\"  Daria, still on her hands and knees, looked over her shoulder at Ami and gave her a quizzical look before leaning back onto her haunches and answering her with a dubious tone \"I'd like to go too Ami, but I don't think we'll get very far in this condition.\"  She grabbed her own boobs for effect and pushed them together before releasing them and looking to Ami for an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we can't stay here.\"  Ami replied \"This can't all be a coincidence.  The camera, your clothes, my clothes before that, they can't all have simply disappeared.\"  Whether it was Ami's one of voice, or the implications of her words, Daria rose to her feet with an increased sense of worry and urgency.  \"You mean, you think somebody might be toying with us?\"  Daria said, looking about suspiciously, her hands drifting uncertainly towards her privates.  \"I don't know.\"  Ami replied, her left hand cupping her right elbow as her right hand held her chin, \"But I don't want to stay here and find out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, the two girls decided that getting out of dodge would be the best idea, and planning that escape became their overriding priority.  There wasn't much in the alley that could serve as makeshift clothing.  Of the two empty garbage cans, there was only one lid, and, even if the girls decided that they weren't above borrowing it, it would only cover one of them, and not by much at that.   Running out of options, the two girls carefully made their way to the edge of the alley and poked their heads out to survey the streets for options.  There wasn't much to see.  A wire garbage can, containing a few scraps of paper and a discarded banana peel, a tall, unlit street lamp, a homeless man passed out on the sidewalk with a Styrofoam cup filled with change, a young couple walking a dog, a pair of young boys carrying a remote controlled model boat, and a beat up old payphone.  A payphone!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf excited and half regretful, Ami whispered, \"If only we had some change, we could call someone to come and pick us up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, actually...\" Daria answered, turning as she did and once again dropping to all fours \"I think I saw some loose change here and there while I was searching for my stuff.  Come on, help me look!\"  With that, Ami joined Daria, their bare knees and palms rubbing against the hard concrete.  Ami blushed as she pictured what she must look like, buck naked on her hands and knees, looking for loose change in a filthy inner city back alley.  There was no time for modesty or dignity, but Ami knew that if someone, anyone, were to walk into the alley, they would have a perfect view of her ass, her holiest of holies, and everything in-between.  The thought sent a shiver down her naked spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, they managed to gather enough loose change to make a call.  Standing side by side at the edge of the alley, the naked lovers began to plot their next move.  Though a call for salvation seemed mere feet away, those feet fell beneath rays of broad daylight, and would prove to be a perilous and daring journey never the less.  They would have to be both quick and cautious.  Daria was the first to speak. \"I'll go alone.  I know some people who live close by.  They're not exactly the most trustworthy people in the world, but they should be able to help us out...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took hold of the garbage can lid and prepared to make a run for it, when Ami grabbed her by the wrist, surprising the naked Goth girl and stopping her in her tracks.  \"Uhm... actually, Daria, I think I'd like to make the call.  I don't mean to sound pompous, but I know a few friends who would never let me down in a time of need.  You'll just have to trust me on this.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaria looked uncertain at first, but then finally, she smiled.  \"Whatever you say, Ami.\"  Ami smiled back.  As Daria reached out to hand Ami the change they had collected, her smile turned into a smirk \"You know, you should try being assertive more often Ami, it's kinda hot.\"  Ami, blushing, took the change, and bowed her head as a wave of red shyness made its way through her nude body.  Giggling at her friend's response, Daria held on to the trashcan lid and held it in front of her pelvic region \"Just don't forget who wears the pants in this relationship, huh?\"  They shared a laugh and then refocused their attention on their goal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, they waited until the coast was clear.  The kids with the boat were long gone, and the young couple had cleaned up after their dog and been on their way.  Soon enough, the only living soul remaining on the street was the sleeping homeless man.  There was also a steady stream of traffic going by but since neither the cars nor the homeless man showed any signs of going anywhere else in the near future, Ami and Daria decided that they would just have to risk it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMustering up all of their courage, they bolted from their hiding place and ran to the phone, Ami covering her breasts with her right arm, with her left hand buried between her legs, and Daria just barely covering her nipples with one arm while shielding her crotch with the trashcan lid, leaving both of their asses naked in the breeze.  Neither of them had the time to worry about being seen however.  It was just one blinding flash of flailing flesh and adrenaline, which ended as quickly as it began, with two birthday suit bare beauties panting and fumbling for a nondescript position in front of the phone.  In the end, Ami stood facing the phone while Daria stood behind her, facing the opposite direction, keeping the lid over her crotch and her arm over her breasts.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi reached for the phone, but paused when she felt Daria's bare butt cheeks brush up against her own.  Turning her head, she said \"You could cover yourself much more thoroughly if you turned around you know, then you'd only have to cover your...\" Daria interrupted when she noticed Ami starting to blush.  \"It's cool Ami, one of us needs to be on the lookout for trouble.  I've got your back.\" Daria winked at this and gave Ami a little butt bump that gave her a start, but brought a smile back to her face none the less.  Turning her attention back toward the phone, Ami added in the coins and began to dial the numbers, little knowing that the other Sailor Scouts were having problems of their own...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I swear, if your interupting my nap to sell me something....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Usagi!\" Ami squeeked. \"Help!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ami?\" usagi asked, still groggy. \"Hey. What's going on? Did you get a new number? The caller ID...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Usagi, please! I don't have much time!\" Ami said, glancing up and down the street instinctively even with Daria keeping vigil. \"I need your help. We're in trouble!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a pause, then a some shuffling and a door closing. Then, in a voice that was soft and firm, without the usual whine that seemed second nature to her, Usagi asked. \"Is this 'senshi' kind of trouble?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-\" Ami hesitated. \"I don't know. Something's happening, and I'm not exactly sure how or why....can you come to the alley at the corner of 1st and Sakura Lane?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Ami! We'll be there!\" Usagi said, brightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We? No! Usagi, don't call the others! Just come yourself! Bring clot....hello?\" Ami asked the suddenly dead line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That didn't sound like it went well.\" Daria said, her back to Ami.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi hung the phone up, her head downcast. \"Ummm....not exactly well, no....We'll get help. Its just going to take a little more time to get clothes than I wanted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now everyone I know is going to find out what happened, she added silently to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"let's get back to the alley.\" Daria said in a neutral tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair hastily slinked back to the modest cover of the alley. Ami bit her lower lip as she trailed behind her friend turned lover's jiggling butt. She'd been counting on Ami, and now....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh. There was that too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daria....\" Ami said, glancing one way and another. \"I...have something I need to tell you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaria glanced left and right down the alley, then turned and looked squarely at her friend. Her look of consternation paused as she took in the anxious, flustered look of her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your not about to say you planned all this out, did you? Cause you have one of those 'I need a priest' kind of guilty looks on your face, Ams.\" Daria noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...no, I didn't do this. But...there IS something you don't know about me.\" Ami said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" Daria said, her face breaking into a relieved smirk. \"Jeez Ami, don't scare me like that. Lemme guess, your friends are a little....weird?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm...you could say that.\" Ami mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chill out Ami. Trust me, your crew doesn't have nothing on who I run with. No big deal.\" Daria said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its just....\" Ami paused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaria crossed her arms, looking appraisingly at Ami.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ami....don't.\" Daria said at last. \"Look, its no big deal. You have a secret you'd rather keep. You don't need to go and confess every little thing to me. I mean...you don't owe me anything, okay? We just fooled around and had some fun. It doesn't need to mean any more than that, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi looked stricken. \"You don't want to....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha? No. I mean yes. I mean....crap! Ami, I'd love to do this again! That's not what I'm saying! Its just we haven't been on a second date yet! I don't know if you want to...you know, keep doing this. You said you don't usually like-\" Daria began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm free Teusday!\" Ami said quickly. \"Do you like horror movies? There's a Dead Scream playing at my neighborhood theatre! We could go get some icecream after that! There's a little park by my apartment we could-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaria closed the distance between them and began kissing the smaller girl while her mouth was still open. Ami jumped a bit, then wrapped her arms tightly around the goth girl and hugged her tightly. They breasts pressed together and their bodies reddened as hands moved over one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a yes, by the way.\" Daria whispered. \"I'd love to go to a movie. Its probably not going to be as exciting as running naked through the streets or screwing your brains out in an alley, but it sounds like fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-thanks.\" Ami said, quivering a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, Ami, I have some stuff I'll let you in on too, okay. But you don't need to rush it. You've got a secret you want to keep. I'm fine with that. Tell me when your ready.\" Daria said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...can't really hide this. Its going to be obvious in a little while....\" Ami mumbled,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaria paused, staring past Ami.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ami....\" she said softly. \"By any chance....is this secret that your a sailor scout?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi paused, gulped, and hugged Daria tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. S-sailor Mercury.\" Ami said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I lied. You win the 'weird friends' award.\" Daria said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long have they been watching us?\" Ami said in a small voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just notived them. But I'm gonna guess around the time you suggested the movie and we started making out.\" Daria said, her face burning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ah.\" Ami said, turning around and covering herself with her hands as her friends stared from the opposite end of the alley, red faced and wide eyed. Ami contemplated crawling under one of the empty trash cans and hiding until this was all over as the giggles started. Her situation was now firmly in the hands of her friends.</span></div></div>",

Mercury stepped forward a couple paces, her hands still covering her more intimate areas and her face burning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys.\" Ami said lamely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ami!\" Usagi said in a giddy sort of confusion. \"What are you doing? What happened to your clothes? Who's the other girl??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you you should have gotten more details, dummy.\" Rei noted, shaking her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I thought she was in a fight!

This has been a really bad day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch.\" Daria said in mock hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....mostly bad.\" Ami said, blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scouts exchanged knowing glances, cooing to themselves in a sort of collective glee. Jupiter looked at Ami in concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...I take it you haven't been fighting the Dark Kingdom or anything? You two aren't hurt?\" She said, glancing around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...someone just kind of swiped our clothes...and there's a camera with some pictures I REALLY don't want in the wrong hands. But nobody's attacking us.\" Ami said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh. And how exactly did someone manage to steal your clothes without attacking you?\" Venus asked knowingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"......\" Ami said, blushing deeper. \"We were a little distracted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a collective burst of delight from the assembled scouts. Ami sighed. This was sure to be the center of conversation for their little circle for months. The scouts surrounded Ami and began talking all at once. Jupiter lightly punched her shoulder, saying something about it being about time. Questions were falling all around her like snow, mostly revolving around how and why and when this had happened. Mars broke off from the main group and gave Daria an appraising once over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi. I'm Sailor Mars.\" Rei said, extending her hand. Daria cocked an eyebrow, then shrugged and took it. Something of her usual nonchalance was returning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi. Name's Daria.\" She said, glancing down at herself. \"Nice to meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two shook hands a moment, hardly breaking eye contact, gauging one another. The two seemed to reach some unsaid conclusion at the same time, as both offered a wide smirk to the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is just about the most surreal introduction I've ever had.\" Daria said. \"Hope I'm not making a bad first impression, all things considered.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah. There's a story here and we're going to hound Ami until we hear it, but she's a good judge of character. If she trusts you, that's good enough for me. And you don't feel wrong to me.\" Rei said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh. So your psychic, too?\" Daria said with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fire Priestess, actually.\" Rei said nonchalantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't say.\" Daria said, glancing at the trio who had surrounded the blushing girl. \"Well, look, I really really hate to be rude about this, and I'd love to get to know all of you a little later, but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But your tired of being stuck naked in an alley.\" Rei finished. \"Right, sorry. I'm a little distracted by Ami finally getting a boy....girlfriend of her own. She always acts so timid....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Don't knock the shyness. That's what's so cute about her!\" Daria said. \"But yeah, I'm still a little in shock myself. What with the whole sailor scout thing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that a problem?\" Rei asked, a little concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You kidding. This is freaking amazing! Its just....\" Daria began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Being naked blunts your enthuisiasm a bit. Right.\" Rei said. \"Hey! Guys! We can torture Ami more later! Let's get these two some clothes and go home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where to?\" Usagi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...my apartment is closer.\" Daria said. \"But this is a pretty busy time of day. I'm not sure we can get there without someone recognizing me...even with you guys helping us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you bring my computer?\" Ami asked, VERY eager to pursue a conversation thread that didn't involve her current state of dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep!\" Jupiter said, holding up the little codex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. We can use that to analyze this area. There should be enough residual data to track the thief.....once I have some clothes on.\" Ami added quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's like a mini CSI lab?\" Daria said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CSI, calculator, digital encyclopedia, and data analysis corrolator.\" Ami said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I mention I think big brains are sexy?\" Daria purred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...it does most of the work for me.\" Ami said, blushing once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" usagi said. \"Clothes! We could try going to Ami's place if yours will be a problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"usagi, I live even farther away than Daria!\" Ami noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but we've been to your place. We can just teleport there no problem.\" Usagi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-\" Ami stuttered. \"You know that takes all of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we're all here, right?\" Usagi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I haven't transformed! What if something goes wrong?\" Ami asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, if it saves us from going cross country in the nude, I'm all for it!\" Daria noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax Ami. We'll have you home in no time.\" Usagi said, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Wha...Daria?\" Ami said, groggily coming to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat on a carpeted floor in a dark room. Her head was pounding and she felt very dizzy. Daria stood over her, a look of concern on her face. They were both still quite naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\" Ami asked groggily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you remember?\" Daria asked anxiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember Usagi had talked me into the teleportation. We made a little circle around you....and we started to concentrate on my place....and....THERE WAS A SHADOW! Someone was coming into the alley....no...I think someone was ALREADY THERE. Someone was creeping out behind doorway.....\" Ami said in alarm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then there was a flash of light.\" Daria agreed. \"I woke up here. You were out like a light. You had a weird little blue symbol on your forehead for a second. Then that went away and you woke up. I....was worried.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi smiled a little at the concern. \"Its okay. The teleport takes a lot of energy sometimes. I was worried it would cause some side effects....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah....about that....\" Daria began. \"I think your spell...or whatever it is...must have misfired. There's no one around....and this place is completely empty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi looked around. The room was empty except for a closet. and an open door into a hallway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we did....\" Ami said uncertainly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...now what?\" Daria asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to get our bearings. Let's look around, see if there's anything to cover up with....\" Ami said distractedly. \"This place does seem familiar....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two began rummaging around the area. Ami was feeling a growing sense of unease. At first it was simple disappointment at the plan failing once more, but as she roamed the halls her apprehension was growing. Closets were full of various assundries of daily living- canned food, cleaning supplies....but nothing that would serve in even the most rudimentary sense as clothing or adequate covering. More importantly....she RECOGNIZED the things in the cupboards. In fact...she recognized the halls, doors, and rooms of this place. It seemed larger....and emptier. But she knew where she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daria....I think we ARE home. This is MY house!\" Ami exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaria didn\u2019t answer. Ami felt a rising pain of sheer panic and helplessness come over her. Who was doing this to her? And how? First, her clothes. Now\u2026everything she had! All her furniture, appliances, bed\u2026.everything was gone! And worse, someone had deliberately taken every bedsheet, curtain, shower curtain, tablecloth\u2026anything that might offer even the bare (no pun intended) minimum of dignity was gone! All her possessions\u2026.all she had left were the clothes on her back\u2026which were unfortunately no longer on her back!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Daria!\u201d Ami moaned. \u201cThey\u2019ve been here! Someone took all-\u201c <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaria entered what used to be Ami\u2019s living room, looking grim and soleful (a look Ami had never seen her wear before). She held an odd looking folder in her hand. Without a word she handed it to Ami.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi opened the folder, discovering what looked like a well made presentation or exhibition. To her surprise, the folder looked like a well edited, tasteful version of Daria\u2019s report. The handful of shots she had Ami took before their shoot turned more intimate were presented beautifully, apparently adjusted and cropped and professionally printed. There were even a handful of shots from their lovemaking session, but the pictures were tasteful and inoffensively artistic. In short, it was precisely the type of presentation Daria had intended to make.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t get it.\u201d Ami said in confusion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere was a note with it.\u201d Daria said, holding up a piece of loose leaf paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi began reading the small neat handwriting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope you both can forgive me for keeping this brief. I always find the first communication difficult in these situations. I admit there\u2019s a certain exhilaration to playing with you two, taking advantage of happenstance and escalating the situation as necessary. The act of addressing you both, of taking a moment to consider your own feeling on the situation\u2026well, I have no doubt you both must hate me to no end, that you feel great frustration on hurt at what has happened. For what it is worth, I am not unmoved by those feelings. Please keep that in mind, since my next action will seem quite pitiless and contemptable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, I will catch you up to speed. You have been unconscious for roughly two days. Your computer, Miss Mercury, assures me that this is a side effect of your ill conceived teleportation attempt (useful device indeed- it was one of MANY things left behind in the alley, I\u2019m afraid- it does most of the work for me, as you said). I realized that Miss Daria would miss her deadline for this photo project you two have become embroiled in. I took the liberty of turning her assignment in for her. I did some minor edits and paid for a professional printing, but the work is still entirely and authentically hers. You\u2019ll see several flattering comments from your photography teacher on the last page. If you\u2019ll accept a compliment, Miss Daria, you are an excellent photographer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecond, I believe it is time to move on to the second part of our game. As you\u2019ve no doubt noticed, I have removed all your belongings. Doing so was simple, armed as I was with your housekey and identifications. I am afraid that with the assistance of your computer I have also been able to remove all funds from your accounts and change all passwords and security protocols associated with your name. You are now, in essence, stripped of everything. I have placed Miss Daria in a similar situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of your items and articles of clothing, including your mystical Sailor equipment, is safe. I have no reason or intention of damaging any of it. Follow my instructions carefully, and everything will be back to normal soon enough. All you have to lose is your dignity and self respect IF you can follow my rules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.\tI have placed a single photograph in a series of public locations in nearby areas of this city. The odds are high there will be at least one person who will recognize one or both of you in each location. I can assure you, the photo is decently hidden\u2026.but someone will be bound to stumble across it sooner or later. And I can also assure you\u2026.these photos are all handpicked to be the ones of your photoshoot you would LEAST want to be seen by the general public. It is your job to find these pictures.<br>\r\n2.\tEach photo has some instructions on the back. When you find these instructions, you are expected to follow them to the letter. No exceptions. <br>\r\n3.\tAt no time are you to wear any form of clothing, nor are you to cover any part of your body from public viewing.<br>\r\n4.\tDo not seek any further outside help, or give any truthful explanations of your situation. I\u2019ll remind you, while my hand in this affair is certainly a violation of the law, I have proof that you both have engaged in public indecency and other lewd behaviors outside of a private setting. Getting any kind of authority involved would be\u2026.bad for all of us.<br>\r\n5.\tAs you have gotten the senshi involved, understand that these rules apply to them as well if they choose to help. As such, your mystical abilities, though I believe they have been adequately neutralized, are still strictly off limits. Its not too difficult, knowing the identity of one scout, to extrapolate the identities of all of them (again, wondrous toy your computer!). As such, don\u2019t go looking for any further help beyond the people already involved, be it your talking cats, that Tuxedoed fellow, or those \u2018outer\u2019 senshi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollow those instructions, and I promise everything will go smoothly. I look forward to playing the second level of this game. When your ready, look for the first photo by the waterhose outside of this building. Be sure you give yourselves plenty of daylight. If you haven\u2019t retrieved the picture by nightfall, I\u2019ll be uploading your entire photoshoot to the internet, your possessions will be burned, and the names of your fellow Senshi are going to every major newspaper in the country. Best of luck!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no signature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi looked up from the note, her face forlorn. Daria stared at her, the look on her face impossible to read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry!\u201d They both said at once. \u201cWait, what?\u201d They both followed up with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is probably an enemy of the senshi.\u201d Ami said, her eyes tearing up. \u201cThis is all my fault.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Daria said, her own eyes watery. \u201cAmi, I\u2019M the one who got you involved in this! This is MY fault! If I hadn\u2019t been so occupied with getting into your pants, you\u2019d-\u201c<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d Ami whispered, tossing the note aside and hugging the beautiful goth girl close. \u201cNo. I\u2019m not going to regret the ONE thing good about that day. None of the rest of it matters, Daria! I can deal with it as long as\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaria sighed. \u201cOkay. Okay. I won\u2019t take the blame if you don\u2019t, okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi only nodded. They held each other closely a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know\u2026.\u201d Daria whispered. \u201cWe have PLENTY of daylight here. We could always\u2026blow off a little steam before we go on this pervert\u2019s stupid scavenger hunt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi blushed. \u201cNow? I don\u2019t even have a bed anymore\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause a clean, carpeted floor is SUCH a downgrade from an alley.\u2026\u201d Daria said sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs this all you think about?\u201d Ami whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot all I think about. But its up there\u2026..\u201d Daria said, grinning at Ami. \u201cFunnily enough\u2026I\u2019m not hearing a \u2018no\u2019 from you so far.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi blushed profusely as the goth girl pushed her lightly to her knees. She wondered yet again how this girl had so much power over her, then wondering if that even mattered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, a bang came from one of the closets, startling both girls. What was it now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Quietly, Ami rose back up to her feet, and, hand in hand, the two nude lovers made their way to the closets, making nary a sound.  It didn't take them long to spot the source of the noise.   Though the intruder was waist deep in the closet, it was clear from the start that she was in the same predicament as the other two girls.  Daria and Ami examined her thoroughly, their eyes traveling up her long feminine legs and settling on her delectable butt, the last part of her body that remained visible before the rest of it disappeared into the closet.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this point that a relieved smile appeared on Ami's face.  Quirking an eyebrow, Daria whispered \"You know this asshole?\" Blushing, Ami nodded her head.  It was one of the Sailor Scouts.  But which one could it be?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Blushing, Ami responded \"It's my friend, Usagi... Sailor Moon.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can tell that just by looking at her butt?\"  Daria replied, incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, she appears to be naked...\" Ami began \"and looking for clothing... and we both know that the other scouts went through the same failed teleportation event that we did.  Logically speaking, it almost has to be one of the other Sailor Scouts.  That narrows the possibilities down quite a bit.  Comparing the evident physical features of our guest with those of the other scouts, I can estimate with a high probability that it's Usagi.\"  When the look of incredulity did not leave Daria's face, Ami began to squirm a bit under her gaze.  When a knowing smile formed from Daria's lips, Ami blushed again and looked away \"... And I have, in the past, had the opportunity to be thoroughly acquainted with the physical features of my fellow scouts... even their butts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling warmly, Daria kissed Ami on the forehead and whispered \"Hey, Ami, its okay.  I've got Ex-Girlfriends too.  It's no big deal.\"  Ami began to protest, trying to keep her voice below a whisper \"No!  It's not like that!  Well, I mean, it wasn't, and not exactly...\"  Before she could finish explaining, Daria strode confidently into the room, positioned herself directly behind Usagi\u2019s wiggling behind, and greeted her with a firm but friendly slap on the ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi shrieked in surprise and practically leapt from the closet, ready to defend herself.  When she saw it was only Daria, her face turned a light shade of embarrassed red.  Usagi wasn't sure whether it was the fact that she was naked, or that she had been caught unawares, but Daria had certainly managed to give the Sailor Scout a shock.  Smiling, but realizing that she may have gone a bit too far, Daria decided to try a joke to smooth things over.  \"Guess now we know why they call you Sailor Moon, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Usagi responded by giving her a raspberry and walking right passed her, Daria decided that, yeah, maybe that move was a little dumb.  Usagi didn't look like much, but she was a super hero. Daria decided she'd try to be a bit more tactful in the future.  All else considered, she didn't want to add \"getting my naked butt kicked around Ami's apartment\" to her list of problems.  After exchanging notes with each other, the two Sailor Scouts paused a moment to think.  Usagi had actually woken up out on the fire escape.  She had no idea how long she was lying there, but the thought that her nude body might have been on full display for days sent a shiver down her spine, and caused a bad feeling to settle in the pit of her stomach.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, that explains why Ami and Daria hadn't come across her when they first explored the house.  It also brought to light another unsettling fact.  The other Sailor Scouts, Rei, Makoto, and Minako, were all likely stranded in random places, each one every bit as naked as the three girls were now in Ami's bare bones apartment.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've got to find the others.\"  Usagi said at last.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi, crestfallen, replies \"I'm not sure that\u2019s such a good idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not!?  We're Sailor Scouts!  We stick together no matter what!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but this time, sticking together could be dangerous.  Whoever is pulling our strings said that if any of the scouts tried to help me, they'd have to play the game too, and abide by the rules.  I'm not sure how Daria and I are going to manage this, but it's going to involve a good deal of sneaking around... and as conspicuous as two naked girls are, six would be even worse!  I--I can't drag the rest of you into this.  Usagi, I think you should find the others and let Daria and I see this game through to the end.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA serious look of concern came to Usagi's face as she gave Ami her reply \"I'm not leaving you, Ami.  I know the other girls will agree.  We're not going to let some perverted wackjob force you to jump through hoops.  If we stick together, we can beat this!  We always do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi thought on this for a moment.  The Scouts were always at their strongest when they were united, together.  But no.  Not this time.  This time, teaming up would be a liability.  \"I really do think it would be best if we split up for now.  Daria and I will follow our instructions, while you gather the rest of the scouts and let them know what\u2019s going on. It wouldn't mean abandoning me.  You can do much more to get to the bottom of this if you aren't caught up in the game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls pondered this for a few moments.  Usagi still hated the idea of leaving Ami alone, even if she'd have Daria to accompany her.  The pierced, tattooed, gothic hottie wasn't exactly on Usagi's list of favorite people at the moment.  Ami did make a good point though.  The rest of the scouts, all working together might be able to find their mutual tormentor while he or she was busy focusing all of his/her attention on Ami and her new girlfriend.  On the other hand, they might not.  With Ami's computer at his/her disposal, the gamemaster could be reasonably close to an all seeing and all hearing techno god.  Daylight was burning however, and a decision would have to be reached.  At length, the girls decided...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sailor Scouts don't leave each other behind.\" Usagi said, putting her hands on her hips and sticking out her chest, posing in a fashion that would have looked confident and heroic (in the Sailor Scout's typically cheesy sort of way) if she'd been wearing her fuku. As it was, it did highlight her large breasts quite nicely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Usagi....\" Ami began, pinching her noise in exasperation. \"How many times have you abandoned the rest of us to go face down trouble by yourself?

Just...I wish you'd...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll be okay, Ami! Really! We just need each other!\" Usagi said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi hugged her naked friend lightly. \"Thank you.\" She whispered, feeling a little relieved, and a little guilty over that sense of relief. They were all in this together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The others will probably make their way here when they realize what's happened. I'll leave a note for them.\" Ami said, scampering away, a little embarrassed by some of the feelings cropping up in her mind after hugging her beautiful naked leader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaria watched Ami leave, then turned towards Usagi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, you REALLY don't have to come along. I can take care of Ami by myself.\" Daria said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi looked at the goth girl and shrugged. \"I'll just feel better if one of us is there too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'One of us', huh. Yeah, well, sorry I'm not part of your little club. I still think you should just stay out of it.\" Daria groused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi glared. \"Aren't you the one who got her into this in the first place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaria reddened. \"Well....your the one who made things worse! You did this stupid teleport thing even when she said it was dangerous and now.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaria trailed off as she looked at Sailor Moon's eyes, which were rapidly filling up with tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I was trying to help! I didn't....I didn't....\" Usagi began to blubber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaria stared at Sailor Moon, utterly shocked at the tears running down her face. Wasn\u2019t this supposed to be the girl who saved the world, what, five times already? Daria couldn\u2019t reconcile the hero that faced down godlike evil with the naked girl sobbing in front of her. How did a few harsh words from her compare with the monsters she had fought?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm\u2026.umm\u2026.look, I\u2019m sorry, okay? Urr\u2026please don\u2019t cry.

I just get kind of territorial around old girlfriends\u2026.\u201d Daria said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOld\u2026.girlfriends?\u201d Usagi asked, confusion cutting off the flow of tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure. You know- you and Ami?\u201d Daria said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-wait\u2026me and Ami? But\u2026no, we\u2019re just friends. I mean, I care about her, but she and I have never\u2026.\u201d Usagi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut she said you were\u2026.and she\u2019s seen you naked! All of you, in fact!\u201d Daria blustered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026that. Umm\u2026.no, no, I like boys. Well, one guy in particular. I mean, okay, I like girls too\u2026a little. But none of us have ever\u2026well, me and Rei sometimes\u2026.but mostly we\u2019re just friends, honest! I mean, we used to\u2026but that was a totally different life. I mean, literally a different life! We\u2026\u201d usagi babbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Daria glowered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay! Ummm\u2026.okay! We\u2026um\u2026we used to live on the moon. Except, it wasn\u2019t barren and dead like it is now. None of the planets were. There used to be palaces and people who lived on every world, not just earth! We were all queens and princesses of one of those planets, like Mercury was in charge of the planet Mercury and Mars was in charge of Mars and-\u201c Usagi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI get it.\u201d Daria said. \u201cSo\u2026what happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm\u2026.well, I fell in love with this guy from Earth named Endymion. He\u2019s the guy always hanging around us- throwing roses and wearing Tuxedos? Anyway\u2026we were getting married and we were going to unite the moon and the earth\u2026.but not everyone on the earth wanted that. And\u2026.and there was this monster\u2026.we were never exactly sure if the dark feelings of all those people gave birth to IT or if it was always here and just responded to those feelings\u2026.but however it happened, there was this monster. It has different names, people called it Queen Metallia or the Negaforce or even weirder names\u2026but it took all those people who didn\u2019t want peace between the two kingdoms, and it changed them. They became monsters and demons and things. And there was this other woman\u2026.who also loved Endymion\u2026she hated me and all the scouts\u2026.and the monster made her into an evil Queen called Beryl, and she became to ruler to this Dark Kingdom of monsters\u2026..and on the night of our wedding, we were attacked. All life was wiped out. All of the scouts died, and everyone of their kingdoms died with them. Only Earth survived, and everyone there forgot about that age except in fairy tales and myths. But my mother, the queen of the moon, used the last of her power and sent our spirits into a distant time. We were all reborn on earth\u2026.and\u2026well, eventually we found each other and became sailor scouts. The whole reason we have these powers is because of who we used to be.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi paused. Daria stared at her wide eyed. Both girls paused to take in the massive amount of exposition that had passed between them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026.back then, you guys\u2026.\u201d Daria said at last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cErr\u2026.look, its hard to remember everything from back then, okay? It was way more\u2026umm\u2026it was a different time, and\u2026\u201d usagi floundered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe word your looking for is hedonistic.\u201d Mercury said softly from the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm\u2026hi.\u201d Daria said, a little embarrassed even though she couldn\u2019t quite say why. \u201cWe were just, ummm\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s things I want to tell you about me.\u201d Mercury whispered. \u201cBut\u2026I\u2019m not the same person I was back then, and some of the things I remember\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blush on her face melted Daria\u2019s heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt feels like a dream now. I wouldn\u2019t exactly say we were all lovers\u2026because even then there was something different between us and what Usagi and Endymion had\u2026but we were much more than friends. I remember\u2026we were so unruly! We lived exactly how we wanted to- we had all worlds as our playgrounds, and no one could tell us what to do except our poor parents\u2026..if we wanted to make love, we did, whenever and wherever we pleased, for however long we wanted. We loved our worlds and our people, and we knew someday we\u2019d have to take responsibility for them\u2026.but that just encouraged us to live as wildly and freely as we could before we became queens\u2026..I was such a different person\u2026.\u201d Ami whispered, blushing to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe all were.\u201d Usagi chimed in softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaria glanced between the two, clearly lost in their distant memories. She cleared her throat loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay. So\u2026all this about old girlfriends is just part of some old fairy tale thing you guys went through a bajillion years back is some totally different life. All righty. That takes some of the pressure off.\u201d She summed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay. Usagi, before we go out there\u2026I just wanted to make sure we\u2019re cool. I\u2026you seem like you care about her a lot. I just wanted to say, so do I. I\u2019ll help you watch her back, okay? And I\u2019ll watch yours too, since you guys are so close.\u201d Daria said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks.\u201d Usagi said, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo prob. We\u2019re all in this together. Plus, I don\u2019t mind watching a back with such a cute butt attached to it. Not that your front is bad to look at either.\u201d Daria smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi and Usagi both blushed and glowered at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, relax. I\u2019m just playing around! You guys have to lighten up! The odds are good that uberperv out there is going to\u2026well, let\u2019s just say I think we\u2019re all going to get really, really familiar with each other before this is all over. Besides, Ami, just because I think another girl has a cute butt doesn\u2019t mean I think yours is any less adorable!\u201d Daria said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi crossed her arms. \u201cIf I had a couch, you would so be sleeping on it tonight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCrap.\u201d Daria said, then both girls broke out into wide grins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know\u2026.you never did apologize for slapping my butt earlier.\u201d Usagi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, your still mad about that? Come on, its meant as a compliment! You can\u2019t wiggle a cute, bouncy little butt in front of me like that and not expect me to-\u201c Daria began, and promptly screamed as Usagi darted behind her and swatted her left cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think your absolutely right!\u201d Usagi said, grinning from ear to ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaria glared at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww, your not mad, are you?\u201d Usagi asked, a note of worry in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFeh. Please. I know how to turn the other cheek.\u201d Daria said, turning her back on the leader of the sailor scouts presenting her rear end once more to Usagi, lightly wiggling the unspanked right butt cheek in her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi stood aghast as a loud smack filled her home, followed by mock \u2018eek\u2019 of surprise, followed by twin fits of laughter. This was going to be a long night\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which\u2026the three totally naked women gathered before Ami\u2019s doorway. The time had come to step outside. As the moment glee of the diversion subsided, all three covered themselves and stood at the threshold between their dignity and abject humiliation. Ami placed her hand on the doorframe, feeling her heart beating faster. The feeling was not unlike the sense of dread one aquires as a rollercoast noisily grinds its way up a long hill before plunging its captive riders down into an abyss. One last shared glance between the three blushing girls, one last intake of breath, and then Ami tossed the door open into the stark white light of day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three girls formed a naked conga line as they made their way out of the building. They walked on tip toe, hunched over so that their motion looked something like a crab, knees bent and chest thrust forward slightly. Hands covered what they could manage, but they couldn\u2019t quite hide the ample bounce in the breasts and butt cheeks as the three made their skittish way around the corner of the building, awkwardly trying to hurry on and stay in place all at once. Ami, to her horror, found herself at the head of the procession, with both other girls using her as a barrier from sight. Not that that would help much for any onlookers. The late evening sun lit up their pale naked bodies, easily offering a perfect view of almost all their anatomy, including delightful peaks at nipple and pussy despite their efforts to cover those areas while moving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three rounded the corner, Daria and Usagi all but shoving Ami forward in their desperation to get to their destination. Ami skidded to a halt, the other two practically tripping over themselves in the process. The hose was wound up tightly in one corner, a cheap plastic kiddie pool lying next to it. Those also saw...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

OUT IN THE OPEN? Naked?? Why....how has no one seen me?\" Rei asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....\" Ami began, \"I think the overload of magic we experienced may have helped us a little....you know how people never seem to recognize us when we're sailor scouts, even people we know well?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" Rei and Usagi said at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....there's something about our transformations that keeps people from making that recognition. It essentially 'fools' the part of memory that allows you to identify a person based on past memories of that person. i think until you woke up....in other words until the magic ran out....the same power essentially kept you invisible. People could see a naked girl, but the part of their minds that would register this as strange or out of place was tricked into ignoring you. Until you woke up.\" Ami explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, gee, that's great....\" Rei said. \"So where are the others.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way to know.\" Ami said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm.....help?\" Sailor Venus whimpered, as the growing crowd beneath her stopped and stared. Her legs were spread wide apart, forced into that stance due to the ledge she now stood on falling right out from under her. Her position was quite precarious. A story below, a crowd was gawking and laughing at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't funny!\" Venus snapped, cringing as a camera flashed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could just jump!\" Someone cried. \"It might hurt, but I doubt it would kill you, or even inure you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But....I'm afraid of heights!\" Venus called. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suites me.\" Came the reply, and another camera flashed. Venus flushed red. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really have no idea.\" makoto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look....getting your head stuck in a ventilation system? That's stupid, but I can buy it. Taking your clothes off after wards....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I thought it'd help me squeeze back through?\" Makoto said, more as a question that a statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, congrats.

And what's the card say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".........your not going to like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This surprises who?\" Rei asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It says that we must be tired and sticky after a day of squatting in garbage and another of sleeping in our own sweat and gunk. So.....we should use the kitty pool to wash off in. And.....do what we did for the camera....again.\" Daria trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....what did you do for the camera?\" Rei asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".......\" Daria paused, flipping the picture over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HOLY CRAP!\" Rei said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!\" Usagi whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is that even physically possible?\" Rei asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"......well, if she can pull it off, Mamo-chan won't have any problems.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three girls glowered at Usagi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Give you the camera?\"  Daria was puzzled, and more than a bit shocked.  She wanted to encourage Ami to grow more of a backbone, but she was wondering if she'd gone just a little bit too far.  \"Come on Ami, I practically AM a camera, it only makes sense...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no.\"  Ami answered, cutting her off while gently extracting the camera from her new lover's fingers.  \"I need to expand my horizons, don't I?  I've always wanted to try my hand at photography. Besides, I'm accustomed to operating supercomputers light-years ahead of the modern day technology curve.  I think I can work a camera.  Usagi, Rei, be gentle with her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... but...\" Daria sputtered as Rei and Usagi moved in on her from both sides, each one taking a hold of one of the naked goth girl's arms and slowly backing her towards the kiddy pool.   She tried to protest further, but Rei took a hold of the poor girl's nipple ring and gave it a tug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, the only way I'm interested in your butt is getting it into that kiddy pool.\"  Rei said with a smirk.  \"Now move it, before we have to get rough!  You started this whole mess, so you\u2019re going to help get us out of it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Usagi said, giggling and only half serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch!  Hey, watchit you psycho!\"  Daria protested as she was lead into the pool.  Six bare feet splashed down in the shallow water of the kiddy pool. It was nearly ice cold, and each of the girls visibly winced as they began to get their feet wet. Ami watched them closely through the camera's telescoping lens, playing around with the mechanisms and just getting a general feel for the camera.  Zooming in on her friends breasts, she could immediately estimate the temperature of the water.  All of their nipples were rock hard and pointing straight back at her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm... I think we should probably wash up first.  Then we can worry about the posing.\"  Usagi declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good to me.\"  Rei replied, and as one, they knelt down in the pool, taking Daria down with them.  Immediately they began scooping up the chilly water with their hands and splashing it on themselves, shivering and shuddering as they did their best to clean themselves up.  Ami watched with unblinking eyes as the three naked beauties got soaking wet, the fading light of the sun shining off of their slick and shimmering bodies.  She might have been tempted to touch herself, if there wasn't a crowd beginning to gather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, look over there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that what I think it is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit!  They're all naked!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this, for a TV show or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More like a porno!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They can't film porn in the middle of the street!  And in broad daylight!  I'm calling the police!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady, I've never hit a woman before, so don't tempt me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm... guys, I think we'd better hurry up...!\"  Ami began as the crowd grew larger, closer and louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sounds like the natives are getting restless!\"  Daria remarked. She had just about finished giving herself a quick scrubdown, and she was now busying her hands by doing her best to shield her privates from the view of the leering crowd. A quick glance from side to side indicated that Rei was doing the same, but Usagi was still scrubbing away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's taking so long!?\"  Rei said, one hand tucked between her legs and the other draped across her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStopping suddenly as if snapped out of a trance, Usagi, squeezes her breasts (which she had been washing/massaging mere moments ago) with both hands.  \"I'm going I'm going!  Jeez, just because a girl believes in cleanlinessssss..\"  It was about this time that Usagi noticed the gathering crowd.  \"EEEEEEEEEEEK!\"  realizing that her wet pussy was on full display in the shallow water, Usagi's hands immediately shot down between her legs, leaving her breasts exposed for the briefest of moments before she realized her mistake. Her hands darted hither and thither for a few frantic seconds before settling into the same classic position chosen by Rei and Daria.  \"We've got to get out of here before somebody calls the cops!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!  We have to do the pose first!\"  Ami said, waving the picture in front of the three girls who were now about ready to hop out of the pool and run for their lives.  Their three hearts sank in unison.  Their hands began to grow slack upon their privates.  What was the point?  There's no way they\u2019re going to be able to keep their naughty bits concealed while pulling off THAT naughty little number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Ami, just hold the picture still so we can see what we're doing!\" Usagi declared, looking around nervously and trying to block out the increasingly rude and bold chatter of the crowd.  \"So, uhm... that\u2019s a pose made for two... and there's three of us... who's going to do it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait... I thought we all had to do it?\" Daria exclaimed, frightened and confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It didn't say that in the note!\"  Rei protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually...\"  Ami said, trembling a bit now and blushing.  She had kept her back to the crowd for most of the spectacle so far, but people were moving in closer now, trying to get her attention and talk to her directly.  She knew just about everyone had seen her butt, but now they were seeing everything!  \"Actually, the original note we received said that if any of the other girls got involved, they would be expected to do everything we were supposed to do.  I'm afraid we all have to do it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA collective groan issued forth from the captives of the pool.  Daria was the next to speak.  \"So, who's going to work the camera?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Upon hearing her name, Ami spun around on instinct, and immediately covered her nudity with renewed vigor.  Standing before her, mouth agape, was Mr. Higashi, an old widower who lives in her building.  His arms were filled with groceries, but he looked like he was about to drop them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ami!  Whats going on here?  Are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine Mr. Higashi!  Everything is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you need help?  Do you want me to call the police?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!  No no!  That's really not necessary!  We're all fine!  Everything is fine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Higashi flashed her a worried and slightly frustrated look before putting his groceries down on the ground.  Clearly he wasn't buying it.  He didn't know Ami very well, but he knew this wasn't the kind of thing she'd ever get up to unless something was very very wrong.  Ami wasn't sure what he was going to do, but he looked like he was definitely getting ready to do something.  The crowd went silent waiting for the old man to take action.  Some of them even began to leave once they saw him going into his pocket for his cell phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, wait just one moment sir!  There is something you can do to help!\"  Amy shouted, desperately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man stared at her for a moment before blushing himself and looking guilty.  Then he started taking off his jacket.  \"I'm sorry Ami, this should have been the first thing I did...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could finish removing it however, Ami ran right up to him and revealed her small, but perky breasts just long enough to hand him the camera she held in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please sir, we've lived together in the same building for a long time, and you know I'm not the kind of girl to make mischief, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man, stunned and holding the camera as if it were a tarantula, nodded reluctantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you must know how serious I am when I tell you that I NEED you to take pictures of us right now! I really can't explain, I just need this favor as soon as possible!  I don't want to be out here any longer, and we're running out of time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was insane of course.  The whole scene didn't make a lick of sense unless something very, very bad was going on, and Mr. Higashi didn't like it one bit.  But... maybe it was something in Ami's voice, or her desperate manner, or the fact that he did truly want to help the poor girl... against his better judgment, he decided to help.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you sir!\"  Ami exclaimed before giving a little bow and rushing towards the pool. Mr. Higashi did his best not to stare at her ass as she bounced towards her equally naked friends, and instead busied himself with figuring out the camera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know that guy Ami?\" Daria said as she glanced suspiciously in his direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, he's one of my neighbors, I think we can trust him.  Now please, lets just get this over with...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaria was surprised by how much that stung. She knew it was the circumstances that were getting to her more than anything, but still, Ami seemed to like this position when it was just the two of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... so, uhm... how do we actually do this?\" Usagi said, looking down at her body and trying to imagine how she could twist it to fit the picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Usagi, it's not THAT difficult...\"  Rei began.  \"You just have to... uhm... Ami?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi blushed instantly before crouching down in the shallow water.  \"Well, I started out like this.  Daria, can you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?  Oh, yeah sure.  Just, you know, lean back a little bit more...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSailors Moon and Mars watched with no small amount of admiration as Ami and Daria twisted their bodies into position, entwining their wet and slippery limbs until they finally settled upon the shocking pose that only now seemed like a remote possibility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you were taking notes...\"  The nude goth girl said, her painted lips peeking out from between Ami's legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah, we've got it, no problem!\"  Usagi said as she looked at Mars expectantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't look at me!  I don't want to be on the bottom!\"  Rei exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like it really matters!  We'll be twisting around so much, you'll probably end up on top at the end anyway, lets just get started, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine!\"  Rei replied, crouching down with a huff and sparing one last glance at the still leering crowd as if it say \"What're you lookin at?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so the Moon and Mars began their strange orbit, doing their best to unite as gracefully and beautifully as their counterparts.  It... was kind of slow going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bend down a bit Usagi!  No, your doing it all wrong!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to relax Rei!  Lay back a bit more, and I won't have to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof!  And do you have to have that thing of yours so close to my face?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES!  Didn't you see the picture?  If anything, you should stop being so squeamish and get up in there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YEAH!  GET ALL UP IN THERE!\"  Someone from the crowd yelled.  The two frustrated nudes responded in unison.  \"SHUT UP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, just stop complaining and grab my ankles!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\"m not complaining, YOUR complaining, and you need to spread your legs more before you grab my ankles, otherwise it doesn't work!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you donut head!  YOU have to grab MY ankles!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh oh, right!  Yeah, okay and then you grab my...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then I just lean back, and you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then I bend over and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I put my face in between your...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you know what, you did end up on the bottom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, will you stop talking about it and do it already!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she did.  And so it was that Sailor Moon and Sailor Mars became reacquainted with parts of each others anatomy that they hadn't seen in centuries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ami, does this look right to you?\"  Usagi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I think so!\"  Ami replied.  She actually had to squirm slightly out of position to get a good look, giving Daria's butt a light tap to coax it out of the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Close enough for government work.\"  Was Daria's response.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting back into position Ami called out \"Okay Mr. Higashi! You can take the picture now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMumbling something about the eventual fate of his soul, Mr. Higashi aimed the camera and fired away.  Once he was finished, the girls pulled themselves apart and collapsed into the pool with a splash.  While the others recovered, Ami ran up to the old man and took the camera, rewarding him with a peck on the cheek.  \"Thank you sir!  Please don't tell anybody about this!  Everything is under control!\"  With that she scampered back to her friends, leaving behind one very confused old man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so THATS over with.  What next?\"  Mars said as Ami returned.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>   Not keen on overnighting in the change room, Rei opened the door and poked her head outside. The beach was deserted, and the sidewalk leading from the gift shop to the parking lot was similarly vacant. Promising... but getting back to the lockers would take her right past several windows, and she'd lost her locker key with everything else. Maybe she could appeal to one of the shopgirls for a loaner suit?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Taking a deep breath, Rei stepped out and marched stiffly to the gift shop. There was a hand truck with cartons of product being delivered just outside the door. And a mob inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Rei couldn't believe it! Peeking around the jamb, she saw what looked like every tourist from the beach, poking through the overpriced stuff on the shop racks. There had to be thirty people in there! Rei swallowed her panic and glanced at the dolly. She saw a box advertising kids in swimsuits and grabbed it, hoping it would hold something she could use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"If I can get my stuff out of that locker, I'll buy the lot,\" Rei promised herself, fast-walking back to the changing room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   In relative safety, Rei had a look at what she'd boosted. It would be embarrassingly tight, but she could make a kid's swimsuit work...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Except she hadn't made off with swimsuits. She'd nicked a carton of that novelty sunblock that changed you colors. Blue, in this case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Rei sighed heavily and stared at the ceiling for several seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   The delivery guy had left a utility knife wedged halfway into the box, and Rei used it to cut through the tape. There were a dozen 8-ounce bottles of lotion inside, and some promotional material wrapped in blue foil. Nothing resembling an outfit, or a way out of her predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Call it the worst idea ever, but...\" Rei said to herself, shaking her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Two bottles and ten minutes later, Rei was royal blue from soles to forehead. Creative use of the box cutter on the promo slicks yielded a blue foil sorta-bikini-bottom and a pair of improvised pasties. The slimy lotion provided a tacky layer to stick her 'outfit' to, and it <i>was</i> a little hard to see where the blue foil ended and blue Rei began. Assuming no one got too close, she might be able to pull it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Rei glanced in the mirror, getting her first good look at her handiwork, and burst out laughing. She looked ridiculous, reeked of the lotion's blueberry fragrance, and crinkled when she walked. But that could all add up to an excellent distraction; her blueness was more remarkable than her near-nakedness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Stepping back outside, Rei hustled the remainder of the sunblock carton to the gift shop door, dropping it off and walking past the window. The crush of shoppers was still there, but no one spared her a glance. Which was incredible, because Rei caught her reflection in the plate glass and couldn't help laughing again. She was a walking blue light special.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Safely past the gift shop, Rei made it to the snack bar and locker rental window. One girl was covering both sides, and a gaggle of kids were chomping ice cream at the benches in front of the lockers. Rei's appearance started a minor riot, which she tried to laugh off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Sorry, I managed to lose the key to my locker,\" Rei told the girl at the window. The girl was so busy tying her face in a knot to prevent braying laughter that Rei got a replacement key without any questions. Almost painless!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   As Rei made for her locker, the younger kids pawed at her while the older ones asked her why she was blue (the oldest just snapped away shamelessly with his camera). Rei put a prudent distance between herself and the locker rental window, the girl who'd given her the key now doubled up with laughter and calling her friends over. Proceeding with her entourage, Rei tried to keep grinning. Her makeshift promo-suit was better advertising than the company could have managed on the shelves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   To her complete lack of surprise, Rei got to her locker and...</span></div></div>",

Makoto knew the work order she'd submitted to building maintenance hadn't been handled yet; the door's strike plate was slightly misaligned, which meant she should be able to lift on the knob and push in hard to pop the bolt. Rotten from a security standpoint, but Makoto was feeling a little insecure herself, just then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Makoto worked on the door for most of a minute, thrusting up and inward repeatedly. She imagined that would look pretty comical if someone was watching... at which point she realized someone was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Pardon me, miss,\" said the pizza guy, carefully looking no higher than Makoto's toes. \"Do you need some help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Makoto put it together, going ballistic at a cautious whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Did YOU knock on my door earlier?!\" Makoto hissed, looking over her shoulder and covering her butt with one hand.

She thanked him uncertainly and went back to trying the door.

His little sisters toddled over, one trying to tickle Makoto's right foot as the other spilled dipping sauce on the left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   With Pizza Guy fighting to maintain his precarious grip on Makoto's ad hoc pants, Makoto danced around and endured the breadstick bastinado administered by the little girls.

Embarrassed at her state of dress (or rather, her lack thereof) and being tormented by her neighbor\u2019s little hellions gave her a new found strength. Channeling all her energy into getting the door open, Makoto gave one last HEAVE on the latch hoping to get it open.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAs the latch started to give way, Makoto had a split second to wonder if her situation would really be improved if she and the large group of people pressed up against her door were to suddenly lose the solid wall they were all pushing against. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nThen the door gave way, and Makoto found herself back in her own apartment at last. Unfortunately, her entourage had her pinned to the ground. The little kids excitedly scattered into the apartment, eager to explore the nooks and crannies of this new space. The pizza delivery boy was a bit stunned, both from the fall and from the fact that he was currently lying on t op of Makoto, who was lying on her back. The boy\u2019s jacket was wide open, and his head was currently thrust directly between the poor girl\u2019s exposed breasts.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell are you doing??\u201d Makoto demanded in exasperation.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cSorry! Sorry!\u201d Pizza boy said, hastily trying to rise to his feet. Unfortunately, there had been precious few times in the lad\u2019s humble career to see a naked girl, let alone touch one, and the experience was making him rather absent minded. In his haste to rise to his feet, he tripped on a stray puddle of dipping sauce and landed right back where he started. Instinct took over and his hands shot out to protect himself from the fall. They found two very soft, round handholds to latch onto. Makoto burned bright red.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cGet your hands off my-\u201c Makoto started to scream, bu t was interrupted by the flash of a camera.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe little children had found Makoto\u2019s digital camera. They had just captured for posterity a shot of her lying on the ground, naked accept for the pizza guy\u2019s jacket, being felt up by the him, and smeared with grease and pizza sauce. Makoto was mortified. And, as usual, her mortification looked for an object to vent its wrath upon.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cGet off me!\u201d Makoto screamed, slamming a fist into the delivery boy\u2019s face. \u201cGet off me right now!\u201d <br>\r\n <br>\r\nShe struck left and right. The pizza boy\u2019s head jerked one way and then another, then fell forward as he lost consciousness. Makoto now found herself still naked, still pinned to the floor, and now with an unconscious body on top of her. The boy with the camera, of course, wasted no time in getting as many shots o f this spectacle as he could.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nMakoto attempted to shove the dead weight off her. She succeeded partially. Unfortunately, the boy\u2019s wrist watch was caught in the zipper of his jacket. Makoto had to struggle to free herself of his jacket in order to stand up. This of course was chronicled by the amateur photographer behind her, including a scandalous shot of her butt as she stood up, hunching over to pull the jacket completely off herself.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nMakoto glared at the little kid, crossing her arms in front of her to hide her nudity.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cOkay, you give me that camera right now or you get the same treatment as your friend their.\u201d She threatened.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe boy seemed to think about it a second, and snapped another picture.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cYou little-\u201c Makoto began.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cIs he okay?\u201d One of the little girls chimed in.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nMakoto looked at the pizza boy. He was out like a light. He seemed to be breathing, but there was a large bruise spreading across his face. Makoto sighed to herself.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019ll be fine. But we should make him comfortable. Keep his head elevated. Can you guys help me get him to the couch?\u201d Makoto asked, remembering some of the things Venus had taught her about first aid.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cOkay!\u201d The two girls chimed at once. Makoto glowered as she raised the boy up by the shoulders while the girls took the feet. All the while, the big brother felt it more appropriate to take snap shots of the naked girl while her hands were too occupied to cover herself. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cOkay, get a wet towel and apply it to his forehead. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d Makoto instructed, stalking meaningfully towards the little boy.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nA phone rang from the hallway.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cHey, I think that guy\u2019s cell phone is ringing.\u201d The brother observed, eager to divert attention from himself. Makoto seemed unimpressed, so the kid bolted faster than the s ailor scout thought possible. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cGet back here!\u201d She cried, chasing him into the hall. The kid shot into his own apartment and slammed the door.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cSon of a\u2026\u201d Makoto muttered. She glanced down on the ground. A cell phone lay next to an abandoned pizza cap and in the delivery bag. Makoto paused, glanced around, then picked up the cell.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cHello?\u201d She asked, glancing up and down the hall. She hated her building. The hallway was the only place to get any reception. She\u2019d love to go inside and aquire some new clothes, but this could be important and the pizza guy was a little indisposed. The one thing Makoto hated to be more than embarrassed was guilt-ridden.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cJack. Is that you? The reception is terrible!\u201d Came a gruff voice on the other end.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cuh, sure is.\u201d Makoto said, panicking a little.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cWell, did you get the pie delivered yet?\u201d Asked the voice, apparently Jack\u2019s manager.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026yes sir!\u201d Makoto said in her best \u2018Jack\u2019 voice.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cWell, get a move on! You have five other orders to make, and your running out of time! I don\u2019t want to have to give anyone any more free pizza this week, you understand?\u201d the manager asked .<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cSorry sir. Had a little distraction here.\u201d Makoto said. \u201cI was trying to help a girl get back into her apartment. She\u2019d been locked out-\u201c<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not your problem!\u201d Manager snapped. \u201cLook Jack, I took a big chance on you. I mean, when you said you didn\u2019t have a car and would have to make deliveries on that squeaky bicycle of yours, I could have slammed the door in your face. But I knew your mom was sick and couldn\u2019t work. I figured you being the only source of income for your family- five sisters and a sick mother, Jack! I figured that would get you to work extra hard and be responsible. But your always behind schedule, your always awkward around customers, and you can never seem to find the right address even if its in the same building. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this girl got locked out of her place because you knocked on her door first before you figured out where to actually deliver the pies!\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cUhhh\u2026.maybe.\u201d Makoto said in a small voice.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cThis is your last chance, Jack. Get those pizzas to our customers. I\u2019m gonna call the next one on your list in five minutes. If they aren\u2019t enjoying that pizza by the time I call them, your out. I know its harsh, but you haven\u2019t left me any choice.\u201d The Manager said.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cBut-\u201c Makoto began, but the phone went dead.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nMakoto blinked. She looked at the delivery bag. There were a bunch of addresses. All of them were in her area! If Jack hurried he could make the next one on his stop. But Jack was currently unconscious\u2026.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cYou could help him out.\u201d Said Makoto\u2019s left brain. \u201cYou\u2019re a sailor scout. You protect people every day from evil! One pizza delivery shouldn\u2019t be any trouble at all.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d Said her right brain. \u201cExcept a sailor scout never had to fight evil butt naked! \u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cWell, then take a second to put some clothes on and make those deliveries.\u201d Her left brain said.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nMakoto suddenly heard the click of a camera. She turned. The brat from across the hall had snapped another picture of her, hunched over the delivery bag! She reddened again, and rose up, clenching her fists. The brat shot another picture of her! Then he slammed the door to her apartment in her face!<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d Makoto screamed. This couldn\u2019t be happening! But sure enough, the door was locked.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nMakoto could hear banging and shuffling going on in her apartment. What were those monsters doing in there? Makoto\u2019s mind flashed to every nightmare scenario she could think up. What if they used her computer? She had the names and addresses of her entire circle of friends in there! What if they uploaded all those pictures? What if they sent them to everyone she knew?? How could she show her face around here ever again?<br>\r\n <br>\r\nMakoto glanced down at Jack\u2019s Pizza delivery hat and bag. His bicycle was probably parked right outside. She had all the addresses. If she hurried, she could put on his cap (so people would know she was the delivery person),=2 0get on his bike, and make his deliveries before his boss fired him. She could do all that, if she was willing to rush around her neighborhood completely naked in front of millions of commuters\u2026.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nMakoto heard another loud banging sound from inside her apartment. The kids sounded like a wrecking crew. She could probably force her way back inside through that faulty latch. But if she did that, what would she find on the other side?</span></div></div>",

Jack only had 5 minutes to make his next pizza delivery before his boss made a fateful call that could end his meager career, spelling financial doom for his mother and 5 sisters.  Makoto couldn't even imagine how that many people could survive on a delivery boy's salary, but apparently they did.  \"Did\" perhaps being the operative word, seeing as how she had knocked the clumsy oaf unconscious, making it more than a little difficult for him to make good on his next assignment.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Makoto, you can do this!\"  She thought to herself as she continued to struggle with the door.  She was a Sailor Scout.  She was a Superhero who put her life on the line day in and day out for the cause of good alone.  One doesn't walk that path in life without developing a pretty accurate sense of right and wrong, duty and responsibility, and she knew exactly what she had to do.  She had to deliver those pizzas and save this guy's job, and by extension, his family.  And yet, here she was, struggling to get back into her own apartment, wasting precious seconds while the clock ticks away Jack's remaining time as one of the employed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrowling with frustration, Makoto turned her attention back to the bag lying on the floor.  Sighing, she bent down to retrieve the cell phone and check the time (being pocket impaired is a bitch.)  \"Shit!\"  She said after flipping open the phone and checking the time.  Less than 4 minutes left, and that door wasn't budging.  One of those little hellions in there must have barred it with a chair or something.  Looking up and down the hall, as if expecting an alternative course of action to present itself, Makoto was disappointed to find no other sight or sound save for empty halls, and rambunctious children making a disaster area of her apartment.  What the hell had happened to her towel anyway?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA look of grim determination came over Makoto's face as she forcefully snapped the cell phone shut in her hand.  Her mind was made up, her course was set.  She was going to do the unthinkable.  But she was going to do it smart. (It always helps to think before doing the unthinkable.)  Crouching down, Makoto dropped the Cell Phone into the bag and closed it shut.  Next, she picked up Jack's discarded hat and placed it on her head.  Little more than an ordinary green and yellow baseball cap, one might not think it would make much of a disguise.  But Makoto was thinking outside the box (If anyone makes any box jokes at this point, Makoto will slug you.)  Quickly, but meticulously, Makoto proceeded to bunch up her long, still wet hair and tuck it neatly under the sides of her cap.  It all fit, but just barely.  Pulling the brim down over her eyes, she stood up and held the pizza bag in front of her body feeling the red leather against her naked breasts, her bare stomach and her pubic mound.  It covered up everything important in the front, but just barely.  If she was fast and careful, she could make it out of her building without being identified as Makoto.  She was pretty tall for a girl, so with her hair tucked under her hat, and the delivery bag concealing her unmentionables in the front, anyone who saw her would be just as likely to take her for a boy... she hoped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath Makoto bounced up and down on the balls of her feet for one or two heartbeats just to get her blood pumping, and then, in a flash, she was gone.  Not one second after she left, the little boy from across the way opened Makoto's apartment door just a crack and stuck his head out.  He had just enough time to snap a picture of her naked ass before she disappeared down the stairwell.  With little time left for subtlety or stealth, Makoto came down the stairs like rolling thunder, one hand holding the railing for support and the other clutching the Pizza bag tightly to her chest, bolting quickly from step to step hoping to get out of the building before encountering one of her neighbors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo such luck.  Waiting at the first floor landing was Mr. Nagai, an elderly widower who lived on the floor above Makoto.  Seeing him out of the corner of her eye as she rounded the bend, Makoto hunched over slightly and kept her head low, doubling her speed, hoping to rush past him too quickly to be identified.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing the cacophonous sound of Makoto's bare feet impacting recklessly against the noisy stairs, the elderly gentleman stopped and looked up preparing to chastise whatever callous youngster was making such a disorderly disturbance in his building.  A look of puzzlement came to his face however as he saw the peculiar figure coming towards him, head down and full steam ahead.  From the hat and the bag, Mr. Nagai assumed the rapscallion was a pizza delivery boy, a young one by the looks of it, but his arms and legs were completely bare... and so were his feet.  Were short shorts back in style again?  Before he could say a word, Makoto flashed right by the old man, rushing down the last flight of stairs and escaping straight out the front door.  As soon as she turned the final corner however, Nagai's features shifted from puzzlement to astonishment.  \"Holy...!\" he said aloud.  \"That delivery boy was streaking the building buck naked!  Youngster's these days... with their lack of respect and their rap music and their soft, shapely rear ends...\"  Startled by his own choice of words, Mr. Nagai quickly shakes several troubling thoughts from his mind and resolves to head back to his apartment for a drink and a cold shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Makoto hadn't stopped moving, even when the light of the midday sun hit her full in the face and the strong summer wind blew the last few droplets of water dry on her bare skin.  She had hoped, in vain, that the streets would be empty, but alas, that was not to be.  The sounds of the big city surrounded her.  Cars honked, dogs barked and pedestrians gasped as she ran by showing her perfectly naked backside to anyone who cared to look. In no time flat, she made her way to Jack's bike, which was leaning up against a street sign with five pizzas stacked on the back and not so much as a twist tie protecting it from theft.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the time it took her to stuff the red bag under the bungee cord which held the five to-be-delivered pizzas, Makoto was unfortunately forced to stay in one spot long enough to actually hear what was going on around her, captivating and erudite observations such as \"Holy shit!\" \"Whoa baby!\" \"Oh, my!\" and \"Look mommy!  That girl's nakkie!\"  \u201cSo much for maintaining gender ambiguity\u2026\u201d She thought to herself.  Now, totally exposed save for her hopefully identity concealing hat, she grabbed the handlebars, stood the bike up, threw one bare leg over the side and placed two bare feet on two black peddles.  Eyes locked straight ahead, she took off down the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRound and round the pedals cycled, turning the chain, turning the wheels, Makoto's legs pumping up and down, up and down, her beating heart forcing blood through her veins up into her head where it made her pulse pound in her ears and her cheeks blush red as she passed by face after startled face.  Her mind was on the mission, she kept telling herself, not on these strangers who were seeing her in all her glory, certainly not.  Not on the feeling of the wind on her bare skin as she rushed by, nor on the way her perky breasts swayed two and fro as her body worked to move the bike. She was completely focused on getting where she had to go before precious minutes passed on into the past.  Her head leaned forward, her hands gripped the handle bars (perhaps too hard) and her bare beautiful butt bobbed up and down, hovering above the bicycle's seat giving all the cars stuck in traffic a drive by mooning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Makoto saw her destination ahead, the apartment building that contained the next address on Jack's list.  Pulling the bike to a screeching stop, she leaned it up against a telephone pole, undid the bungee and grabbed the first pizza off the top.  She didn't bother to check the cell phone for the time.  As far as she was concerned, there was no time. Her internal clock was ticking fast, and it told her to move her butt, and fast.  Rushing towards the building, pizza in hand, she backed up into the door, pushing it open and leaving an embarrassing ass print in the glass that she was too preoccupied to notice.  After sprinting up the stairs and then down the thankfully empty halls, she finally came to the door of the desired apartment.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto took a moment to compose herself.  Despite her attempts to mentally exercise away her fears, she was shaking like a leaf.  She had no idea who she would find behind that door, but in a matter of seconds, she would have to face them, in nothing but a baseball hat and her birthday suit.  Letting out a deep breath, she reached out and knocked on the door with a trembling hand...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnock Knock indeed.  But who's there?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The door to the apartment swung open, and Makoto prepared herself for the worst, holding the Pizza box out in front of her, protecting her nipples, but not much else from view.  On the other side of the now open door, a young girl, late high school or early college age stepped out into the breach.  She had blue eyes, and shoulder length blond hair. She was also much shorter than Makoto and she was wearing nothing more than a fuzzy pink towel wrapped around her body.  She answered the door, stifling nervous laughter echoed by a chorus of girlish giggles coming from deeper inside the apartment.  She looked up from her painted pink toes expecting to meet the eyes of an astonished pizza delivery boy, but instead finding Makoto: A tall, buxom brunet, buck naked, and holding a pizza out for her to grab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, the girl was stunned.  Obviously caught in the middle of some kind of dare or prank, hoping to tease the pizza delivery boy from behind her towel at the behest of her unseen friends, the tables were now seemingly turned and it was now she who could do nothing but stare slack jawed at the under dressed cutie in her doorframe.  You could cut the tension with a knife as Makoto and the girl tried to find the words to break the confused silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Makoto had begun to ask for the money, the sound of a ringing telephone sang out from inside the apartment, the noise seemingly running through the girl and into Makoto like a bolt of electrical current.  As the girl jumped in surprise, the towel slipped out from under her arms and pooled around her ankles, leaving the two naked girls staring at each other as someone inside the apartment called out, through intermittent laughter \"Hey, Jessie, it's the guy from the pizza parlor; he wants to talk to you about the service!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Makoto took in a breath. She looked pleadingly at the other naked girl...probably a year or so older than she had been when she started this \"Sailor gig\". Wow....had Makoto really been that young?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't say anything.\" Makoto begged. \"About...this, I mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe naked girl in front of her covered herself and blushed, clearly still a bit shell shocked about this bizarre twist in her dare. Another girl was walking into the hallway. She held a cell phone in one hand. She was older than Makoto, probably the 'adult supervision' for this party. She had black hair, a tank top and shorts. She was casually taking in the sight of the two naked girls, an eyebrow raised. The blond girl who had dropped her towel was a bright scarlet, and stooped to pick it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, sir, can you hold on a second?\" The black haired girl asked. She covered the mouth piece of the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Susan...that towel stays off.\" She said to the younger girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, Jessie....\" The girl began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No buts. You were supposed to go down there, steal a kiss, and bring the pizza back. You didn't do it, so that's the penalty. I'll have a 'make-up' dare ready for you in a little while.\" Jessie said, smiling evilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not fair!\" Susan wailed. \"She wasn't supposed to be a girl! Or...or a naked girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hush. A dare's a dare, Susie. You have to follow through, no matter what. Speaking of which....\" Jessie looked over the prone form of Makoto, who was trying to shrink into the pizza box as much as possible. \"Umm....are you somehow supposed to be 'Jack'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, uh...\" Makoto said, reddening. \"Actually, I'm just covering for him. Please pretend it was him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your covering for him?\" Jessie said, laughing. \"That's awfully nice of you, considering how little less your keeping covered!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its a long story.\" Makoto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The best ones always are. Excuse me a sec.\" Jessie went back to the phone. \"Yeah, he got here a couple minutes ago. Oh, yes sir, the service was great. Well, yeah, he was a bit behind schedule, but that was our fault. We were sorta of gonna prank him when he got here, so it took us a little longer to answer the door. No, the wait was no problem- I'm sure the pizza will be well worth it. Tell you what- I'm a little busy right this second. Can I call you back and make a full report? I'll be happy to discuss any problems then, I'm just kinda juggling everything at once right now. Okay, thank you. You too, sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessie clicked the cell phone shut, and put her hands on her hips and smirked at the naked duo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right. Let's start off small. Just who the hell are you?\" She asked Makoto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh....hi! I'm...\" Makoto had no interest in sharing her real name. \"I'm, uh, Lita.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lita.\" Jessie said. \"That has to be the lamest fake name I've ever heard. What kind of random name is Lita?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...guess it was pretty lame.\" Makoto said in a small voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try again. Who are you? You lie a second time, I'm calling the manager back and telling him there's some naked girl delivering pizzas instead of his delivery guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name's Makoto.\" She said lamely. \"I... kinda knocked your delivery guy out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Start from the beginning, Makoto.\" Jessie ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Makoto caught them up to speed. Her face was burning and she kept interrupting herself to look left and right at the slightest hint of a noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm....well, first things first. Susie, go get the pizza and pay the naked slut puppy.\" Jessie said, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! I'm not a-\" Makoto protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAHA!\" Jessie said truimphantly. \"We'll see what you are soon enough! Go on, Sue!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan awkwardly made her way outside, taking the pizza from Makoto and giving her the money in exchange. Makoto was stuffing the money into the pizza bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me the pizza Susie. Then get that bag for me.\" Jessie said. Susan turned bright red, but dejectedly did as instructed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what are you-\" Makoto demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hush! Lemme see....no, go back outside Jessie. I told you, your under penalty until you do a new dare. Now...ah, this is your delivery list?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Makoto said, covering herself with her hands and bending over. Poor Jessie was practically shoved out next to her, where she mimicked Makoto's posture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm....your delivery service has a 40 minute or its free policy. Your next stop is right around the corner, and you still have 20 minutes to get there before Jack gets in trouble.\" Susan said. \"So here's the deal. You spend a few minutes doing what I tell you, and I give the most glowing review Jack has ever gotten in his life. You don't, and I tell Boss-sama what happened to Jack, I send him my pictures, and I tell him where you live.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What pic-\" Makoto asked, just as Jessie used the cell to snap a photograph of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those pictures.\" Jessie said. \"I assume the top name on your list is your building and floor. From there finding 'Makoto's' address should be a sinch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay.\" Makoto said. \"Just tell me what you want already.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang tight.\" Jessie said. She closed the outer screen door, which was nothing more than a plate of glass, and locked it from the inside. The two naked girls surveyed the hallway fertively, aware that someone could discover them any second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...sorry about dragging you into this...\" Makoto finally said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gawd, this is terrifying!\" Susan whined. \"But really...that should be my line...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your friend is kind of sadistic, isn't she?\" Makoto noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you really don't want to know.\" Susan warned. \"Believe me, I was getting off lucky with that towel dare.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Until I came along...\" Makoto said. \"Sorry for stirring up the hornet's nest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S'alright.\" Susan said. \"Tell me something, though. Why are you doing this for that guy? Its nice of you...but just being in a HALLWAY is freaking me out! I couldn't imagine riding cross town, even if it meant saving some guy's job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...its just the kind of stuff I do. Usually not completely naked, though.\" Makoto muttered. \"Truth is...he looks a little like an old boyfriend of mine...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, girls!\" Jessie interrupted. \"Raise those hands up, and give us a slow turn!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jessie, not the camcorder!\" Susan wailed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Penalty box, Sue! Now, get em up, and show us what you got!\" Jessie instructed, one eye glued to the viewfinder on the camcorder she hd retrieved from the back. \"GIve us a slow turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan and Makoto looked at each other and sighed. Raising their hands above their heads, the pair bared every inch of themselves to the smirking girl and her video tape. They made a full circle, displaying jiggling breasts, lighten shaven sex, and rounded and firm butts to the camera in their turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good!\" Jessie said. \"Okay. Sue, I have a dare for you. Come over here and I'll explain it. Makoto, you need to get warmed up again to make that next delivery. Do some leg stretches, and then give me thirty jumping jacks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've gotta be-\" Makoto began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now now....\" Jessie waved her cell phone. \"You really got the time to whine about this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto watched Jessie leave the camera on while she conspired with a ever reddening Susan through the door. Makoto stared at the lens. She knew Jessie wanted her to prance around in front of the camera. Her first instinct was to move offstage and out of its hungry light, but Jessie could easily make that phone call, and provoking her would just lead to more horrible tasks. She didn't have to totally indulge the bitch, though. She turned her back to the camera, spread her legs and began stretching. Sure, this gave the future audience a good, long look at her well toned butt, but it was loads better than seeing a spread out vision of her sex. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cute, Mako-chan, but for the jumping jacks you better be turned around and smiling into that camera.\" Jessie said, pausing in the midst of some whispered argument with Susan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great.\" Makoto said, turning her completely naked body to the lens. She looked down at her toes, her whole body blushing red and taking in a couple deep breaths. She was only prolonging her agony, though, so a moment later she began scissoring her hands and legs apart. She was horribly conscious of her large breasts, bouncing and jiggling in every direction, and her sex, opening and closing like it was gasping for breath. Although it took less than a minute, reaching thirty felt like it took a hundred years. Makoto was sure she was going to combust with hotly her face was burning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All done, Mako-chan?\" Jessie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have to call me that?\" Makoto asked, covering herself once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are worse things  can call you, you know.\" Jessie smiled. \"Okay. Now we just need you to help out with one little bitty thing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What now?\" Makoto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, all you need to do is put your hands behind your head and kneel down to Susan's level.\" Jessie said, reaquiring the camera. \"Oh, and step in a little closer. I want to get a better view of that cute little body of yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why am I doing this?\" Makoto asked even as she complied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, your really tall, Makoto, and if you were standing up Susan would have a hard time getting her lips around that nipple.\" Jessie explained casually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What??\" Makoto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm really, really sorry Makoto!\" Susan said. \"That's the only way I get to come back inside! Please don't make me stay out here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto glared hotly at Jessie, her face turning a new shade, but she angrily nodded to Susan and stuck her chest out a little more. This was officially one of the worst days of her life. Not the worst- the Dark Kingdom and her other enemies had certainly  done more terrible things to her and her friends. But that just made this situation all the worse- Sailor Jupiter, princess of the Thunder God's realm, best and strongest fighter of the Sailor Senshi, was kneeling completely naked and utterly helpless while some ordinary girl with a meanstreak was recording her humiliation! There was nothing she could do, and she knew things were about to get worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSailor Jupiter was always a jovial girl. She was committed to her teammates, and although she found Usagi occasionally exasperating she was always willing to follow her lead in a tight spot. She was, however, a competitive girl by nature. Although she seldom bragged about the fact (she didn't need to show boat the way Mars or Venus did) she did have a list of skills and assets she took pride in as being the best amongst the Senshi. Most of these involved physical strength or martial skill- things she worked to hone. One of her 'natural' talents, however, was the pair of enormous breasts she carried on her chest. Perhaps befitting for the patron of the largest planet in the solar system, Makoto also boasted the largest endowment of any girl on the team- Inner or Outer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, they were also the most sensitive and responsive pair of any of the Sailor Scouts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Susan took her left breast in both hands and wrapped her lips around the large pink nipple, Makoto gasped. She closed her eyes, craned her neck back, and became lost in the sensation. The feeling of the tongue lapping, teasing, sucking, and swirling around the rapidly hardening nippled was amazingly intense. Sometimes Makoto fantasized about one of her fellow Senshi suckling on her enormous orbs. She'd never dared to tell anyone about that fantasy- they were all dear friends of hers, and she didn't know what it would do to the team or her heart if she looked for a lover. Her own feelings for women versus men were left deliberately unexplored- most of the stemmed from a far more hedonistic past life where social stigma on relationships was near nonexistent, the bonds between Senshi often straddled the line of friend and lover, and everyone was beholden to the whims of a celestial princess. In this life, her boyfriend (prudish jerk that he'd been!) had never indulged her breasts more than a few moments as a matter of foreplay. This was the first time anyone had devoted their attention solely, gloriously, and completely to that nub on her chest. She stifled little gasp and moans, but she was unable to completely suppress the way her lips parted slightly with each little suckle of Ssuan's lips or swish of her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan back up at last. Makoto opened her eyes, her heart racing and her breath short. The large nipple jostled slightly, wet from Susan's attention and hard enough to cut glass. Susan blushed at her handiwork, seemingly unable to take her eyes off it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Susan...\" Makoto whimpered. \"Would...would you do the other one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Makoto...\" Susan said, looking up and down. \"I wanna go in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please....\" Makoto begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's she asking, Susan?\" Jessie asked, the camera still recording.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She wants me to...\" Susan trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She can answer. Mako-chan....look at the camera, and tell them what you want her to do.\" Jessie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want...\" Makoto whispered, staring into the unseen faces of future viewers. \"I want her...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Louder, hon.\" Jessie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I WANT HER TO SUCK THE OTHER ONE!\" Makoto begged, her face burning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard her.\" Jessie said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan pouted a moment, but the look in her eyes was a mix of hesitation and hunger. She pushed her naked, warm body up against Makoto, and once more took up her breast like she was worshipping it. Makoto moved one of her hands behind the girl, pushing her gently closer against her body. Susan, for her part, slipped a hand behind Makoto's should and grasped it, pressing her entire face up against the huge orb and kissing and licking with renewed vigor. Makoto couldn't help an exclamation of pleasure this time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-bite it!\" Makoto stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha?\" Susan paused. \"Won't that hurt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a little nip! Don't bite down all the way!\" Makoto cautioned, the urgency clear in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan did as instructed. A sensual jolt of pain made Makoto's whole body tremble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God!\" She cried. \"Please, just a little more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can stop now.\" Jessie announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Both girls asked at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You completed the dare. You can stop now.\" Jessie said. \"Get back in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan looked uncertainly between the camera and Makoto. She was eager to get back inside...but something told her to keep pressing those lips against Makoto. She seemed to need something badly....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, Sue. Or would you like me to lock you out all night?\" Jessie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay!\" Susan quickly disengaged herself from Makoto. She looked confusedly and apologetically at the breathless Sailor Scout, but trotted back to the safety of the apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was nice meeting you!\" Susan said as the glass door closed. \"I hope you make those deliveries!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...thank you...\" Makoto said, the two parting as casually as if they had chatted for a few moments on the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. You've got about ten minutes left by my watch.\" Jessie smirked. \"So...how's it feel to be a naked slut puppy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not.\" Makoto said, rising to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those quarter sized little rocks you've got standing at attention say otherwise, Mako'chan.\" Jessie smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto quickly covered her breasts. \"I'm not a slut.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? So why do you look so 'juicy' downstairs?\" Jessie asked turning the camera downwards to Makoto's slit. \"And...oh my! I think your 'little man in the canoe' wants to say hi!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto looked down at herself, and blushed when she realized her clit was peeking out of her wet sex. She quickly readjusted her hands so that one covered her breasts and the other hid the view of her sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm n-not a slut puppy!\" Makoto insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No?\" Jessie asked. \"That's too bad. I think only naked slut puppies would ride around town delivering pizzas naked. So if you aren't one, maybe I should just hold onto this list and bag until we find a better canidate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did what you asked!\" Makoto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep! And you'll totally get a glowing review from me for Manager-san. But that won't help Jack if you can't make the other 4 deliveries, will it?\" Jessie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want?\" Makoto demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, looking at you its not too hard to see you wanted to cum really, really badly. Heck, those giant tits of yours might have been sensitive enough to have made you cum just by sucking on them! Which is why I had little Sue here stop when I did. I figured you were close enough that it'd be living hell to have to stop right then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto glowered. \"Your evil, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never claimed otherwise! Anyway, here we are. You want your addresses and pizza bag back? Finish what she started.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Makoto asked, dread settling into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on! I want you to stop covering up with those hands. Instead of hiding your breasts, I want your to use your left hand to massage and play with them. Instead of covering that slit of yours, I want you to slide your fingers in there and play with that throbbing clit! In other words, I want you to act like a naked slut puppy and play with yourself while we watch and tape you, and have an orgasm in public where anyone could stumble by and see you!

She knew what she had to do, but her arms just didn't seem to want to move.How many indignities would she go through before this was over?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Mako-chan.\" Jessie said, the note of compassion in her voice. \"This is the last thing you have to do. I promise. Remember your doing all this for little Jack and his family...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto glowered. This was so unfair. Hands still crossed in front of her, she made her way up to the glass door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err, what are you doing?\" Jessie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want a good view, right?\" Makoto asked darkly. She slowly withdrew her hands, revealing her naked body to Jessie and the camera. She slid her right leg up to one side of the doorway, and she leaned against the left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready when you are.\" Jessie said, a little unbelieving that Makoto was actually going to go through with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto slid a finger between her legs, and began to manipulate herself. She could feel the walls of her sex close around her hands, eager for her touch. Her face burned as she closed her eyes. Her left hand began to massage and kneed her breasts. The sensation wasn't as intense as before, but it helped return her to the state she'd been in a moment ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god! Everyone's watching me!\" Part of Makoto screamed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe twirled her clit, and gasped at her own handiwork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Makoto...don't stifle your gasps. I want to hear every gasp and moan you make.\" Jessie whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto glared at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto returned to her work, this time moanin and gasping with each thrust of a finger or pinch of a nipple. She slowly found a rythym, and began to pump her fingers faster. Her whole body began to shake. Her left leg slipped a little, and she violently thrust it back in place, several inches higher than before as her fingers desperately tried to supply the stimulation her body was screaming for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Makoto, your runnin out of time...\" Jessie said, somewhat worriedly. \"You need to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm trying!\" Jupiter said in frustration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessie watched her a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what I'm gonna do with this tape, right? I'm gonna show it to everyone you know. I'm gonna find out who your family and friends are, and they're all going t see you trying to get yourself off like this!\" Jessie declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wouldn't dare!\" Makoto said, midthrust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just picture it, Makoto....all your friends, seeing you fingering yourself right now!\" Jessie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Makoto did. All four Sailor Scouts, staring at her. Ami, blushing and trying not to look away, but peeking with every little moan. Rei, glowering and shaking her head, wondering why the hell Makoto was doing this. Usagi, acting concerned but laughing at her plight with an embarrassed blush. Venus, giving her a sly wink as she tried desperately to cum. And Luna, chiding and berating her for what a disgrace this was. Artemis...Artemis staring at her like the pervy cat he was. All of them, seeing her shame played out for their amusement...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a loud cry, Makoto came at last. She felt her whole body arch in release, her pumping fingers finally finished with their work. Her body was drenched in sweat. She could see Jessie staring at her in silent awe. Susan was a pace behind, eyes round with wonder. The world seemed to stand still and bask in her release.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I have it back now?\" Makoto asked, her voice carrying a confidence she did not feel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" Jessie said. \"You've been a real good sport about-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stuff it.\" Makoto said, embarrassed and angry. \"Your going to show that to everyone, right? Tell everyone I'm your naked slut puppy, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessie bit her lip. Maybe she'd gone too far with this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I promise I won't show it to anyone. Look...maybe I can helo you out. There's a van in our garage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have time!\" Makoto said. \"Please just give me my list!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay! Okay! Here!\" Jessie said. \"Sorry. I like teasing people, and you seemed like...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Makoto demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like you were enjoyng yourself.\" Jessie shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoying THIS? Why would I-\" Makoto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some people like it.\" Jessie mumbled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well, I'm not one of them!\" Makoto snapped. She had to hurry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sailor senshi stormed down to the first floor, momentarily forgetting her own nudity in her rage. She reaquired her bike just as her situation caught up to her. She reddened replaying all the things she'd just done, in full view of anyone who wanted to see and caught forever on that girl's camcorder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDwell on fallout later, she decided. She began biking towards the next address, vowing that no more trouble would follow her. Unfortunately, that vow quickly became broken as she heard a siren behind her. Police! She'd been spotted!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't believe this!\" She screamed to herself. \"What else could possibly go wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSHe regretted it the moment she asked. A crack of thunder overhead and the first cold drops on her skin told her exactly how things could get worse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rain...and lightning....that's one hell of a coincidence.\" Makoto thought to herself. \"I wonder if Jupiter isn't behind this somehow. He's supposed to be my guardian and patron, after all. It wouldn't take too much effort to snatch my towel in a sudden wind, then catch me in a storm....nah, being paranoid. Well, bright side: I was gonna need another shower anyway after all the exercise and....other stuff I've just gone through.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the rain began in ernest, Makoto returned her attention to the police car behind her. She needed to get the hell out of here! But she didn't have much time to make her delivery. What should she do? There was an alley on her right too narrow for that cruiser to follow. Unfortunately it was in the opposite direction of her next stop. Or she could try losing them in the crowded street, put on an extra burst of speed and hopefully slipping away before the cars could part and let the cruiser through. One thing she was NOT going to was get caught get tossed in jail after all the other crap she'd been through today.</span></div></div>",

She was ready, her heart pounding, her mind as sharp and determined as it ever was in combat. Nothing could stop her, nothing could hold her back. This was all or nothing, and there was no way, NO WAY, she was going to lose. She had been through too much to lose now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then the lightning crashed over her head, ear splitting and almost blinding. And in that flash, in the jolt of terror and adrenaline and attention the thunder demanded, and in the cold and wet splash of the rain....a dose of sober reason ran through her. She wasn't a sailor scout, she wasn't fighting for the fate of the word. SHe was a naked girl on a bike, even now being leered at on all sides as her butt hung high in the air and her breasts jutted out over the handle bars. She was naked, she was vulnerable, she was cold and wet. And if she could lose the police for a few minutes in traffic, her destination would be easy enough to track. She might make the delivery, but she couldn't possibly hope to make it back out without being arrested. The police weren't stupid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf there was an answer, it would have to be found after taking the obvious escape route.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mission decided, Makoto wasted no more time. Practically skidding across the road, the naked girl turned the bike around, skillfully coming to a stop and positioning her bike in the proper direction. She tried to ignore the cries of surprise and amazement all around her, as she struck a scandalous pose on the bike, her butt high in the air and bent over so that her pussy lips were on display. In the dark of the rain slick street, she saw a flash of light and felt a knot tighten in her stomach knowing that the pose had just been caught on camera. But she paused only a moment, her feet pounding on the pedals. Rain and wind whirled past her on all sides. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then the flashing lights of the police car were nearly blinding her. The car had pulled right up in the alley, cutting off her escape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not gonna happen!\" Makoto cried, a hint of the feeling of invulnerability she had felt before overcoming her again. Moving full speed, Makoto hit the incline of the curb hard, pushing with all her strength and maneuvering with all her skill. And the bicycle rose into the air, carrying the naked girl and her hot cargo over the police car, to the stunned amazement of the officers inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as she shot out of the alley, her mind was working in a fever. What now? She couldn't hope to make the delivery now. What was she going to do?</span></div></div>",

But Makoto was nothing if not stubborn, and she rejected that notion as quickly as it came to her. Confession now would solve nothing- the poor doomed pizza boy would still be fired, and she would still would have streaked in front of half her neighborhood and humiliated herself on camera for the amusement of some sadistic bitch. She was already half-way in, and she'd gone through too much to have it all be for nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, bottom line, she need help and she needed it fast. In times like this, there was only one answer to her question- the scouts would be the fastest and easiest people to turn to. They would keep her secret and drop what they were doing to help. The problem was, they would also be relentless in teasing her about it. But there really wasn't a choice, was there?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis still led to the question of who to turn to. Two choices came to mind, both in riding distance. If she hurried, she might still be able to keep on schedule here. One was the home of the outer scouts- and while Saturn was probably still at school at least one the other scouts was probably home. Venus also lived close by, although it was less certain she would be there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo....who would it be?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When it came to the relationship between scouts, the little subgroup that was known as the outer senshi had not always been on the best of terms with their inner counterparts. Aloof and cryptic at the best of times, the group often seemed as distant as the planets they were named for. For some of its members, this was understandable. Pluto, the most distant world and the guardian of Time, had had little to no contact with anyone for most of her existence. Even when she withdrew from the time gate to fight alongside her fellow scouts, she always kept to herself, carrying about her an air of one who both knew far more than she would say and one who carried far more than she should have to on her shoulders. Saturn, the youngest of the outer scouts, was equally aloof and withdrawn, but for far different reasons. Her mortal life had been disrupted more than once by her nature as the scout of destruction, the power to annihilate literal worlds made her the target of certain dark forces. As a child she had been frail and sickly, even before her father's dangerous experiments made contact with things beyond this world who used him and her in a bid to destroy everything. Even with the influences of that darkness gone, her role as a sailor scout seemed to consume her. Due to the scope of the power she wielded, she seemed to have access to memories and understanding that rivaled even Pluto...but her personality seemed to almost drown in that power.  Which left Michiru and Haruka, the patron guardians of Neptune and Uranus respectively. They were, in most respects, the most human of the outer scouts, but that made them no less intimidating. They had awoken years before any of the girls, and had been fighting a silent war with things more dangerous than the Dark Kingdom ever offered. As sailor scouts, they had often been cold and grim to the other girls, convinced that they were too naive to make the right choices as scouts. That attitude had thawed considerably over the years, as the inner scouts had proven far less naive and the pragmatic but merciless tactics the outer pair favored far less effective at the critical moments than the abiding hope of the younger girls. Still, the pair continued to intimidate, fascinate, and paralyze the inner scouts with their calm and assured manner, to say nothing of their maturity and wry sense of humor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Jupiter's part, she had often been frustrated and awe struck by the pair. Jupiter had always seen herself as a tomboy, a big girl too aggressive and strong and clumsy for her own good. Since the death of her parents Makoto had valued self-sufficiency above all else, a trait which she blamed for her inability to have a stable relationship. Her supposedly masculine traits grated on her and made her secretly self-conscious. The irony was that most of her friends admired her skill as a dancer and a chef as some of the most feminine of their number, to say nothing of her impressive figure. When she first met Michiru and Haruka, the pair had more or less instantly charmed Makoto as the ideal example of a strong and independent but aloof and seductive model of a mature young woman. Haruka especially drew Makoto's attention, given her unabashedly boyish looks and demeanor. Of course, for all that she would blush and laughing deny the charge whenever Usagi brought it up (often more loudly than Makoto wanted) the fact was she had a major crush on the couple in general and Haruka in particular. Unlike the unspoken and confusing feelings the girls felt for each other due to past life trysts and complex relationships, Haruka and Michiru were very much and very openly in love and quite happy to admit (if a bit coyly) their own homosexuality. Far from interfering with their friendship, Makoto's unspoken crush seemed to drawn the pair a bit closer to her than to the others. If anything, Michiru seemed to be amused and almost welcoming of the crush, much to makoto's confusion and embarrassment. Haruka, of course, was always a hopeless tease when it came to the slightly younger and slightly more innocent scouts. In the end, they seemed to have decided to let Makoto work out her own feelings, neither overtly pushing her away nor pressing her on the matter. On the other hand, mercilessly teasing her with innuendo and sly looks was apparently fair game. Some nights Makoto was sure the pair made a competition out of who could make her blush more. It was apparently the price of admission for the increasing number of excuses the girl made to visit their pretty little suburban home under flimsier and flimsier pretenses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of this was going through Jupiter's mind as she stood on their porch, soaked to the bone by the rain, a pizza bag clutched in her hands trying vainly to cover her obviously naked body (thanks to Makoto's akward size, the bag would do a fine job of cover her beautifully large breasts with their erect nipples or her unshaven sex that even now showed signs of her recent orgasm...but not both), a crazy story on her lips and police sirens alarmingly close behind her. Although it would be horribly embarrassing to be greeted by Pluto or Saturn, part of her was hoping one of them would be home. At least then she would just be humiliated instead of having that horrific two pronged assault of delight and horror knowing that her crushes were seeing her like this, knowing that their eyes were going to rove over her body, committing it to memory so that they would never forget the sight or let her forget it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally, her hopes died as the door opened and light flooded the porch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe looks they gave her were somehow more reassuring and more terrible than she had thought. There was the expected surprise and delight in their eyes, but it quickly past to a neutral gaze of worry and perhaps a hint of smug confidence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-michiru! Haruka! P-please, I need-\" Makoto stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Inside.\" Haruka said, her tone authoritative and businesslike, the sort she reserved for battle and discussing missions. Michiru nodded and stepped aside. Makoto started forward, then quickly glanced at the bike. When she turned back around Haruka was standing in front of her. Makoto sucked in a surprised breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its fine. Just get it in quickly.\" Haruka whispered in assurance even as she lightly and deftly took the slim protection of the pizza boxes from Makoto's hands. Makoto blushed crimson as she realized Haruka had effectively positioned herself to be a shield/body guard for Makoto's retreating form while also giving herself a front row seat to enjoy the sight of Makoto's dripping wet body without any possible way to cover herself. Brilliant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto quickly dragged the wet bike into the house. Her heart broke as she left wet muddy tire tracks and footprints on the carpet. Neither senshi seemed to care, however. Michiru already had a towel ready, and Haruka was guiding her to the living room. Neither asked for details, which made the story easy to spill out of the bewildered Jupiter's mouth, a great rush that conveyed the whole embarrassed mess in a matter of minutes. The pair exchanged looks, unreadable to Makoto. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...will you help me?\" She asked breathlessly, even as a knock came at the door. </span></div></div>",

Michiru smiled in her sly, mona lisa fashion, then let her expression serenely melt back into kind of matter-of-fact style she reserved for concerts more serious matters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd better answer that. Makoto, you might want to stay out of sight a little while. I can shoe anyone who's looking for you off the property, but there's not much we can do if your seen inside the house.\" Michiru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-okay.\" Makoto said as the sea green haired girl walked calmly out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can keep her company.\" Haruka said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No doubt.\" Michiru said on the way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short silence descended on the small living room as Makoto stared straight ahead and blushed profusely. Now that she had a moment to pause, the strange series of events that led to this moment were catching up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" Haruka finally said, glancing about. \"Maybe you should go over this again...a little slower.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" Makoto said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were taking a shower....\" Haruka promoted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I heard a knock at the door.\" Makoto said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And no one was there....\" Haruka continued. \"You probably looked a lot like you do right now, covered in that towel and dripping wet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry.....about the dripping, I mean.\" Makoto mumbled. \"And no...my towel was actually a lot....bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh.\" Haruka said, giving the tall girl a knowing once over. \"That's probably why the wind caught it so easily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah.\" Makoto stammered. \"Is there any way-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you know this guy?\" Haruka asked, interrupting. \"The one your delivering the pizzas for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" Makoto said softly. \"I just kinda overreacted to everything and he was in the middle of the rampage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still...awful lot to do for someone you don't know.\" Haruka said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....he seemed like a nice guy, and I didn't want to get him in trouble. And he...umm....he looks a lot like my old boyfriend.\" Makoto stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right. You have a habit of doing weird things around guys like that.\" Haruka said, in her usual smug tone. \"Or so I'm told.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its not like that. He just needed help....and I just acted a bit before thinking about it too hard.\" Makoto insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you made it to your first delivery, and they made you do some things you didn't want to do.\" Haruka continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....I didn't really have a choice.\" Makoto said. \"Actually, that's not true. I could have left. Maybe I should have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sounds like you were in more control than you realized. This girl backed off when you pushed back. I'll bet if you ask, you can get the blackmail back.\" Haruka said. \"And if they give you trouble, we can help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Makoto said, trying very hard not blush quite so deeply or look quite so much like she was hanging off every word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All of that said....\" Haruka said, giving Makoto the look the tall her had been dreading. \"The real question is....was it all bad? What they made you do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hated it!\" Makoto stammered. \"Its not....its not that it didn't feel good....I just....I hated having to do that to myself with her waving that stupid camera in my face and getting taunted and threatened and....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. I know.\" Haruka whispered. \"Your not really the type to enjoy getting bossed around like that. But....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto gulped as Haruka drew closer to her. \"What I meant was....did you enjoy it when the other girl was....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto turned purple and stammered a moment. \"It...it was....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichiru reentered the room. The pair glanced in her direction, Makoto never happier to see her in her life. Michiru raised an eyebrow at the close proximity between the two girls, Haruka smiling and shrugging in a casual way and striding off to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told the police I didn't know anything about a streaker here. I don't really think they believed me, but I told them it was not okay to search the property. They're probably still out on the street looking for you, though. I don't know if it'll be safe for you.\" Michiru said slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't stay here, though. Actually...I was hoping you could help....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me see you list.\" Michiru asked as Haruka returned from the kitchen, drink in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmm....\" Michiru had a look in her eye that was particularly devilish. \"Yes.....I think we can help. I think I can make this next stop....and Haruka can take number four here....all you would have to do is number 3 and five.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right.\" Makoto said slowly, sensing something was afoot. \"That's....very generous of you. Is there something of yours I could wear when I leave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichiru's smiled the least reassuring sort of smile Makoto had ever seen.

Haruka could be intimidating in her aggressive nature, but it was the kind of intimidating Makoto understood and could deal with. Michiru, on the other hand, had a nearly ethereal prescence around herself- she intimidated Makoto precisely because of her mystery and her grace. There was never an easy way to deal with the green haired girl....any attempt you made to oppose her would be artfully and subtly parried. At the moment, Makoto was still reeling from the girl's last statement. The three of them...naked? How could that solve anything. Lost in that fog, she barely resisted as Michiru gently but diligently pried Makoto's hands away from her little towel. Before Makoto realized what was happening, Michiru had stripped the towel off the tall girl's body was gently drying her with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't look so stricken. Its the best option. The police know what you look like, and they're probably watching this place right now. We don't have time to make a more elaborate plan.

Makoto was fairly certain those hands didn't need to linger quite as long as they did, or squeeze quite as hard as they did, especially where her butt and breasts were concerned. \"But can't I at least have some...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surely you wouldn't make me and Haruka go out naked and not do it with us!\" Michiru said in mock surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...its embarrassing! I don't want any more people to see me....\" Makoto stammered. Damn it, she sounded like a little girl. Why did this always happen around these two?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Michiru said with a sly tone. \"I thought you seemed a little excited.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor emphasis, she pinched one of Makoto's nipples. Makoto's blush became full bodied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was cold!\" Makoto protested. \"I don't like running around naked!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say so.\" Michiru said dismissively, dropping the towel and leaving a mortified Makoto completely exposed. \"That still leaves the scales unbalanced.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha...what does that mean?\" Makoto said in bewilderment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....\" Michiru said, hugging the shocked girl and running her hands once more over her bare skin. \"You might not want to stay like this....but we do. We want you to stay like this as long as possible. So the scales are unbalanced...we beat you two to one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but-\" Makoto stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm trying to be fair, you know.\" Michiru whispered in her ear as she distracted Makoto with her wandering hands. \"We both know how you feel about my Haruka. Now she's seen you naked. Its not fair to her or me that you want to cover up so soon. At least this way you get the chance to see what she looks like in turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto was shocked into silence. Michiru had refrained from bringing up Makoto's crush for so long...it was a little shocking to mention it so casually. And that made the guilt harder to ignore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I'm sorry.\" Makoto stammered. \"I'm not trying to come between you two-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mako-chan!\" Michiru said, amused. \"I don't think you understand. I like you. If I didn't like you, things would never have gotten this far. We know how Haruka flirts. She does it all the time. Do you think I would still be with her if that sort of thing bothered me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But this is different!\" Makoto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it is.\" Michiru said as she turned the naked girl around to face her. \"Most of the time, Haruka just flirts with some poor girl to get her flustered and then walks away. There are very few girls she flirts with seriously. There are even fewer girls I approve of. You're self-conscious...you think your size and your temper make you awkward and unrefined. But the truth is your exactly how Haruka used to be...you have the same fire. I like that. Its the sort of thing I insist on for anyone who takes things farther with us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Us?\" Makoto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" Michiru said, again in mock hurt and shock. \"Do you mean...you don't like me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Makoto's amazement, Michiru slowly began to undress. First her shirt, then her skirt, then the aqua marine bra and panties she wore underneath. She stood there, her green hair flowing around her, her breasts large and topped with beautiful and full nipples, a thin and meticulously trimmed strip of hair running down her sex. She turned in a circle, revealing a beautiful little bottom that bounced slightly as she twirled. Her figure wasn't quite as athletic as Haruka, her breasts a little larger and her curves a little more delicate. But her body was well toned from years of swimming, and there was nary a trace of fat on her skin. Just enough to give her breasts and her butt that extra 'bounce and wiggle' without marring the breath taking sight of her nudity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto gaped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichiru looked at her, and laughed softly. \"Oh, I see. I must look hideous to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. NO! I....\" Makoto said, looking down and blushing fiercely. \"You look beautiful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you think so.\" Michiru said, more seriously. \"I'll leave it up to you to decide. Just know that if you want one of us, you're going to get both of us. And you're going to need to make that choice soon. Haruka deserves an answer soon, and so do I....especially after you've paraded around naked in front of us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto's head snapped up, her blush blooming again on her face. \"I did NOT parade! You...you're the one who took my towel...\" She trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Michiru! Do you have a plan set up? The coffee's almost done and those pizzas are going to need to get delivered soo-\" Haruka reentered the room, pausing in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto immediately covered herself with her hands. Michiru smiled and let Haruka's stunned eyes look over her body. Haruka paused a moment then laughed nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jupiter I was half expecting...but this is a surprise.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ooh?\" Michiru replied in her typical sing song way. \"I hope you like what you see. You're next.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm...what?\" Haruka asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going to distract the police so Makoto can deliver her pizzas. We don't have much time so you should get undressed now.\" Michiru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruka blinked. In a way, it was a comfort to know that Makoto wasn't the only one who thought this plan sounded insane. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well? What are you waiting for?\" Michiru asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto half hoped Haruka would call out Michiru on how ridiculous this whole thing was. The other half was in full support of Michiru's earlier point- since Haruka had seen her naked, it was entirely fair that the favor be returned.</span></div></div>",

Makoto could have easily wrestled free of the older girl, but somehow she remained paralyzed to do more than whimper in protest and gyrate in embarrassment for a stunned Haruka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's definitely a risk.\" Michiru said, kneeding and playing with Makoto's breasts. \"The question is...are you willing to take it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto's eyes widened as she felt Michiru's hand snake slowly and teasingly down her body, meandering its way closer to the space between her legs. At the same time, she felt Michiru's hot breath on her neck as the woman moved in closer, inches away from kissing the exposed skin. Makoto felt herself getting goosebumps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh....I....have something I need to get first!\" Haruka said, dashing from the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto blushed furiously, then finally found the will to dislodge herself from Michiru as the girl seemed reluctant to remove herself. Makoto glowered at the girl, who laughed softly to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that all about? What happened to 'waiting for me to make my choice'??\" Makoto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. Its just so rare to catch Haru-chan by surprise! I have to take advantage of those opportunities when they come.\" Michiru explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Makoto said, crossing her arms over her chest. \"Could you please just try to stop molesting me from here on out? You've had your hands on me practically the entire time we've been alone...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh. I see.\" Michiru said softly, placing her hands behind her head and sticking out her chest. \"I have taken the opportunity to enjoy myself. Please, Mako-chan, feel free to touch as much as you like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto blinked, then looked away, clearing her throat. \"That's not what I meant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.\" Michiru said, patting Makoto's cheek sympathetically. \"Its just that your almost as much fun to tease as Haruka...and your much easier to embarrass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto said something incomprehensible. The blush on her cheeks made countering that statement very hard indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So....you two really plan to go through with this?\" Haruka's voice came from the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto glanced in her direction and felt her heart skip a beat. Haruka was silhouetted in the doorway, facing away from them, her bare back pressed up against the door as if she might melt into the wall. She extended one long bare leg seductively into the light of the living room, then an equally bare arm. Finally she stepped into the light, entirely naked. Her breasts were smaller than Michiru (then again, both girls were dwarfed in comparison to Makoto), her erect nipples prominent and obvious. Her body was lithe and athletic, her muscles putting even Makoto to shame. Still, there was a sleek feline grace to her, something Makoto found intoxicating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichiru smiled. \"I'm glad you decided to join us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do have a condition.\" Haruka said, locking her gaze on Makoto. \"I want you to wear this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her cupped hands she held a tiny, bracelet like object. It seemed to be elastic, and several tiny orbs were interlaced in a circle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...is that?\" Makoto asked. \"It doesn't look big enough to wear, even on my arm. Is it like a ring? I could probably get it around my finger...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing like that. I wear this when I work out.\" Haruka said, smiling at Makoto. Michiru actually blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....what's going on?\" Makoto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you ever heard of ben wa balls?\" Haruka asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no...\" Makoto whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're great for getting the blood flowing. But the pesky things always fall out....so I made this to wear while I work out. It keeps everything in place.\" Haruka said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto looked down at herself. \"So I'm supposed to wear it on my...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hear, let me put it on for you.\" Haruka said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto wanted to refuse. She really did. But Haruka had that look in her eye, the kind that cats might use to paralyze their prey. She found herself falling back into on of their living room chairs, found her legs spread as Haruka gently worked the little object around the nub of her clit. To Makoto's chagrin, she found it aroused and ready, it was no hard task at all to wrap the small elastic band around it. Once Haruka was done, she gave the clit and the device a playful tweak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh!\" Makoto gasped. The sensation was intense, the small orbs connected to the ring each held a small weight to created an intense vibration with even the slightest movement. Riding her bike wearing such a thing...Makoto blushed furiously at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just think of this little vibration as me and Michiru cheering you on.\" Haruka said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...couldn't p-possibly take such a...precious thing away from you.\" Makoto said breathlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't mind. If its just you, I can share it.\" Haruka said with a knowing wink. Michiru rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. If we're really going to do this, we need to go now.\" Haruka said. \"I'm the fastest, so I'll deliver the next pizza.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichiru nodded. \"And I'll take care of another one. Assuming you don't get caught by the police, you only have two stops left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\" Makoto mumbled, wondering how her situation had gotten so complicated. \"So....which did you leave me with...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glanced at the list, and then glared daggers at Michiru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" The girl asked innocently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One of these is the top floor of a huge hotel. I'll have to go into the lobby and somehow get up and back down to the bottom! There's no way I won't be seen.\" Makoto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I happen to know the owner. He isn't the type to call the police about that sort of thing.\" Michiru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That still means a whole crowd of people are going to see me!\" Makoto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. I didn't think of that.\" Michiru said, her tone making it obvious that was precisely what she had thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could make the other delivery first. You should have time now.\" Haruka pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto made a face and passed the list to Haruka. She glanced at it, stared, and then looked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A football stadium?\" She asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At my college.\" Makoto added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your home team is having their big game tonight. I imagine the pizza is to celebrate the end of the season. And hopefully a victory tonight.\" Michiru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THAT'S NOT MY CONCERN!\" Makoto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Michiru...aren't you overdoing it? I mean, I'm relishing the thought of her getting exposed as much as anyone...\" Haruka said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\" Makoto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err...anyway...which will you pick?\" Haruka asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto sighed. There really wasn't any use arguing. Michiru had been right about one thing, she didn't like having to ask either of them to risk themselves for her own dumb sake. If she had to go naked (and she had already resigned herself to that) she probably would have chosen to do the most humiliating deliveries herself anyway. Probably. Which meant all that was left was to make her choice....hotel...or stadium.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Ohmigodohmigodohmigod!\" Makoto muttered to herself as she pedaled down the street. From the endless sound of honking horns, shouted catcalls and the occasional squeeling brake she knew she was attracting attention. She could feel her large breasts with their prominent nipples bouncing in all directions as she pumped the bike harder and harder. She held her butt high in the air so she could get as much momentum as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet paradoxically, this situation was both more and less humiliating than everything she had been through before. She was aware of the faces as the whizzed by in a flurry of motion, caught the leers and insults as she had before. But her attention, was little of it she was able to devote to anything besides the stubborn need to move forward, was occupied almost entirely by the relentlessly vibrating apparatus that clung around her engorged clit. A was a merciless, wonderful sensation. And yet, every little gasp and moan she had to stifle reminded her of her earlier ordeal, naked and being pleasured in front of a camera, helpless to do anything but endure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fact that it felt so good just made it worse. Had the bitch at the first stop been right? Was she just a slut who liked being naked?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto had to hand it to Haruka. This little device was effective at forcing the wearer to maintain a constant focus. Makoto gripped the handle bars like they were a lifeline, and her eyes were staring ahead with pinpoint precision. They had to be. One little lapse in concentration, one little jolt or spasm from her overstimulated sex, and she could fly right off the road or into an oncoming car. Objectively, she appreciated how this could hone one's fighting prowess- she knew all too well how pain and injury could be just as intense as the pleasure she was now feeling. Her method of dealing with both sensations was largely the same, detach yourself as much as possible from what you were feeling and push forward with the mission. However, while she might theoretically be grateful for the 'present' some other day, in the here and now her mind was occupied with a) not getting herself killed, b) ignoring the intense sensations that put her in constant danger of having an orgasm with each pump of the pedal, and c) pretending the huge number of people she had just ridden past utterly exposed hadn't seen anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, perhaps the little bastard had more use than she was giving it credit for. Whether by successfully detaching her mind, or by pushing herself hard to get the ordeal over with faster, or by instinctively pumping as hard as she could to get as much vibration and pleasure out of her latest accessory as possible (Makoto really had no desire whatsoever to consider which of those was most likely!) the hotel suddenly loomed tall over the next hill. She had made it in record time. Now came the really hard part...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could try to sneak in the back way and avoid attention. Someone would have to answer the door to claim the pizza, obviously. But she might be able to avoid attention in the lobby. Or she could go in the front and not risk setting off any alarms. Downside there was there was no chance at all that she could escape being seen by at least a few extra people. And that wasn't factoring in the long elevator ride to the top....then again, it beat the stairs....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Can I...help you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man at the front desk looked at Makoto with a bored disdain that was really unworthy of a naked girl strolling into the main lobby of a hotel. Makoto held her pizza bag at waste height, awkwardly supporting it with one hand so that it covered her pussy, the other trying to cover her large breasts (one tit cupped in her hand, the other trying to hide behind an elbow but stubbornly flopping its way into view every few steps) as she wandered down the hallway. She could hear whispering and snickering all around her. At least no one was calling the police.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, hello. My name's Makoto. I'm-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll need your full name and room number. The replacement key will be billed to your credit card.\" The manager said behind his desk. The small plate on the desk read 'Jack R. Shirley'. Makoto assumed the 'R' was for Rod, in honor of the one clearly shoved up his ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...I'm not a guest.\" Makoto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Reallllly.\" Jack said, elongating the word snidely. \"So you have not journeyed into this lobby upon the pretense of having just taken a hot shower and having made the inadvisable decision to leave your room, either without your towel or with a towel you subsequently lost in a highly contrived manner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Don't sound so condescending! That really does happen to some people!\" Makoto blurted out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've no doubt. However, I choose to give the patrons of this establishment the benefit of the doubt and assume they are playing out some obvious perversion and are not truly stupid enough to wander outside dressed in a towel.\" Jack said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, Makoto contemplated abandoning her mission entirely and smashing the steaming hot contents of her pizza box into the man's face. But she restrained herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just here to deliver a pizza. Its room 607.\" Makoto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack's composure did break for a moment. The look he gave her was something between being dumbstruck at the sheer stupidity of the statement and being impressed at the novelty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's...certainly an original statement. Is this some...publicity campaign Lugi's Deepdish is performing I was unaware of?\" Jack asked at last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...no. I'm just doing a favor for a friend.\" Makoto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\" Jack said. \"Well, while we tolerate a certain level of...oddity in our patrons, I'm afraid someone wandering about town in the nude might bring undo trouble upon the establishment. I'm afraid I'll have to inform the police.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha- NO! Please! Michiru said-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Michiru? MADAME Michiru? You know her?\" Jack asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...yes?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should have said so. I assume this is one of her little jokes?\" Jack asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...joke?\" Makoto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah. Then she is playing one on both of us, it seems. Very well, Miss Makoto. If you will agree to abide by the rules of the hotel, I will allow you to conduct yourself to 607. After I confer with them to confirm you are indeed meant to deliver this pizza, of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh, no problem.\" Makoto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent.\" Jack said, picking up a hotel phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Susie. Melissa. We have a young nude woman at the front desk in need of an escort to room 607.\" Jack announced over the loudspeaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto blanched. Was he trying to alert the whole hotel??<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"J-just what are you trying to do here?\" Makoto demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss, please, I need to speak with the occupants of room 607.\" Jack said, turning away from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral painful minutes passed. Predictably, the announcement attract a whole swarm of people into the lobby. In moments, Makoto found herself utterly surrounded, a mob keeping only a few feet distance between her, forming a little semi circle all around her. Makoto turned her back to Jack just so no one else could get a free view of her butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HI!\" a pair of women scuttled around the corner, carrying a strange looking apparatus that Makoto assumed was for pushing large amounts of luggage about...but something looked off about it.The women themselves were two, maybe three years younger than Makoto. The blonde and the brunnette could have been doing an over the top impression of Usagi and Minako, with their almost manic smiles and bubbly personalities. Their uniforms resembled Jack's- white shirt, black tie, black overcoat, black shoes and so on. Except the top of the uniform was separated from the bottom by miles of bare midriff, the lower part of the uniform was a miniskirt (with white panties exposed on the bottom), and high heels. Between that, the excessive makeup and styled hair, and the tight asses and big bouncing breasts both women had, they looked more like strippers doing some kind of faux bellhop routine than real hotel employees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take Miss Makoto here to room 607. She'll be delivering a pizza to the tenants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool. I'll take that Miss Makoto!\" The blonde, Melissa, said as she snatched the pizza box from Makoto. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto had come to expect the surge of flashing lights from cameras whenever her naked body was exposed, but that made it no easier as the crowd tried to capture her naked sex for posterity. She quickly covered herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss! Please!\" The brunnette, Susie according to the nametag, scolded. \"This is a respectable hotel! We can't have you playing with yourself in front of our guests!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT? NO! I'm just covering-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss, please!\" Susie said in mock ourage as she cheerfully pried Makoto's hands away from her body. Then, to Makoto's shock and horror, she snapped a little pair of plastic restraints down on her wrists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing??\" Makoto stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to make sure you won't be touching yourself in front of our guests, Miss.\" Susie said, and proceeded to hook the restraints to the top of her luggage conveyor. Makoto realized that what had seemed 'off' about it was that it had built in 'hooks' for these restraints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT'S GOING ON?\" Makoto wailed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, before they built this hotel, there used to be a chain of 'love' hotels in this area! Those are the hotels where you pay by the hour for your room...you know, the type where you only have time to do *one* thing in? So, when they all got torn down an this fancy english hotel got built...a lot of the same clients dropped by. Jackie here realized he'd have to put up with some odd behavior...lot of perverts running around. Then someone inspired him to milk it and make it a part of the attraction. Now guests come here to have some fun with each other, or to have some exhibitionist thrills like you...or they come to watch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her legs too, girls.\" Jack said, bored once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah! She might be one of those super sensitive girls that can get off by rubbing her legs together!\" Melissa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Wait! NOOOOO!\" Makoto exclaimed as her legs were spread to opposite ends of the conveyance and snapped into place. There was now no part of her whatsoever that was not visually accessible to everyone in the lobby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls, this is a special occasion. She's an aquaintance of Miss Michiru.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooooh Really?\" Susie said, eyeing Makoto in a very hungry and sadly not unfamiliar way. \"That calls for something special.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO! I DON'T NEED ANYTHING SPECIAL! JUST GET ME DOWN FROM HERE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Attention, everyone! For the next five minutes, we'll be offering a free cleaning and turn down service for anyone who needs one. We'll be taking our guest to the sixth floor, but we can service any room along the way upon request. Upon request, and for an additional fee, one of us will pose topless and have fun with our guest while the other cleans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow! Can we really?\" Melissa practically squeeled with delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sigh. Yes, but only this once and your uniforms go back on the moment Miss Makoto's business has concluded.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-b-b-but I have other deliveries to make!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Room 607 has already given their blessing for receiving a late pizza. They sounded rather amused by the whole thing. When is your next appointment due?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-three hours....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent. That shall give us ample time to see that our patrons are well pleased and that we send you on your way with time to spare.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, agonizingly, Makoto was wheeled down the hall, her moans of agonized humiliation drowned out by all the patrons who suddenly found themselves in need of a clean room.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"No! Wait! Don't do this to me!\" Makoto begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mind was reeling. When she woke up this morning, everything had been normal and great. In the course of just a single day, she had been locked out of her house completely naked, had paraded herself around town completely exposed, and had even played with herself on camera for the amusement of complete strangers. All of this, however, was nothing compared to what was happening now. Here she was, being wheeled around like a piece of luggage, tied up so that she couldn't run away or hide from the dozens and dozens of leering faces all around her. She couldn't even cover herself from the crowd. The vision of her gloriously naked and atheltic body was presented before them all unobstructed. This was easily the longest stretch of time she had been exposed to so many people, and Makoto realized with sickly giddy feeling that she was completely helpless to do anything about it except struggle against her bonds (which she had discovered did nothing to help her escape, but did provide the crowd with a good look at her jiggling breasts and butt) and close her eyes so she didn't have to see all the people taking in her humiliation. This day couldn't possibly get any worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sweetie, we wouldn't want to deprive you of the experience!\" Melissa said, giggling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto swished her brown hair to the side, wincing and closing her eyes as a camera flashed in her face. \"Please! I can't move. Just get me out of here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the point, isn't it?\" Susie said, smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't funny! Stop doing this to me! Let me out of here!\" Makoto snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusie seemed to consider the request, then blinked and leaned over. Makoto burned bright red and squirmed helplessly as she realized the girl was looking right between her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is that?\" Susie asked in fascination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU ALREADY KNOW WHAT THAT IS!\" Makoto screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that...this.\" Susie said, unbelievably extending a curious finger and flicking the pink elastic band around Makoto's clit. Makoto's back arced and she let out a dismayed moan of pleasure as the simple gesture sent a rippling vibration up her spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....oh wow. Oh wow, that's fucking brilliant. Melissa, check this out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto squirmed again as the two girls looked in fascination at her bared sex, along with several people in the crowd over their shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a great idea!\" Melissa said enthusiastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha...what great idea?\" Makoto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This little thing!\" Melissa said, giving it another flick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't do that!\" makoto said. The two girls exchanged glances, enormous smiles on their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T...this thing isn't even mine!\" makoto moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh. That's even better.\" Susie said. \"This is one of Michiru's little games, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Makoto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, think, silly. What's the most humiliating thing that can possibly happen to you?\" Melissa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EASY! Getting strapped to a luggage gurney butt naked and wheeled around a bunch of gawking perverts!\" Makoto snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please! This is nothing.\" Susie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto took in a breath. She really didn't like where this conversation was heading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, the most humiliating thing that can happen to you is being seen by a crowd naked and having an orgasm! Not only is that the most intimiate, private thing you can do, the thing you don't want anyone else to see (except maybe some VERY special boy or girl!), but it proves to everyone beyond any shadow of a doubt that despite how much you might blush and whine, deep down your body is loving being shown off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....okay. I can...understand that.\" Makoto was trying and failing not to think of her experience earlier that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, with this fiendish little thing, you up all the possible thrills! In order to get away with being naked in public, you have to move fast and hide often! But any time you move around with this, you're tormenting yourself with the little vibrations. So, every time you try to avoid being seen and getting humiliated, your body is dancing on the edge of having a huge orgasm! In other words, you up the thrill 100 times- you not only might get caught and seen by everyone, but you might suffer the biggest humiliation of all and cum right in front of everyone!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hadn't thought of that....\" makoto stammered, in her head making a list of ways she was going to murder Haruka when this was all over. \"Not that it matters anyway. I'm already caught. This thing is useless if....oh no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair were looking at makoto much the way the outer scouts had been earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-come on! You can't!\" makoto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should probably give her a sporting chance....\" Susie allowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"yes! Please! Give me a...wait, no!\" Makoto exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls giggled. Makoto tried to struggle, but soon found her legs unlatched from the corners of the device and reattached to the sides! She was now no longer even touching the ground, her feet were clamped onto each side of the conveyance, her body doing a near perfect midair split with her hands cuffed directly over her head. Her breasts quivered with each breath she took.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, now to get into costume.\" Susie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the amazement of Makoto and the crowd, the pair of hot bell hops began to strip out of their work clothes until they were entirely naked. Makoto blushed, unable to look away. Then the pair proceeded to get into a pair of french maid outfits, including the skimpiest black skirts and lowest cut cleavage exposing corsets makoto had ever seen. To the thrill of the crowd and embarrassment of the sailor scout, the pair seemed to 'forget' to put on any underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell was the point of that??\" Makoto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this is more in character for these, isn't it?\" Susie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto felt a deep sense of dread settle over her as the pair produced a pair of large feather dusters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you...\" Makoto began, then yelped as a feather was playfully flicked across her nipple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you tickilish, Mako-chan?\" Susie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".......\" makoto said nothing, shaking helplessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the pair began to apply the feathers to her, Makoto felt her body jerk and twist helplessly. The girls were obviously no strangers to this procedure, knowing just the right spot to induce a spasm of limbs and laughter from their giggling victim. Makoto arched and gyrated one way then the other, her tormentors expertly causing her body to jerk in the most humiliating and erotic way possible. What was worse, of course, was that every supressed fit of laughter and every involuntary spasm sent jolts through her body, which inspired the device around her clit to vibrate all the more. Soon enough was actually throbbing in tempo with the vibrations, a fact not lost on the crowd of onlookers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you can keep yourself from cumming, mako-chan, we'll let you go. Go ten minutes, and you win. If not, we're going to keep this up until we've seen you orgasm a dozen times or more!\" Susie whispered, before kissing and nibbling the side of makoto's ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn some distant part of her mind, she promised herself never to assume her ordeal couldn't be made any more humiliating. The universe seemed eager to prove her wrong today.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A door came open, but not the one Makoto had been hoping for.  All of the Sailor Scout's vain struggling was interrupted by the shocked gasp and outraged cry of the mother from across the hall.  \"Would somebody please tell me what in the world is going on out here!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreezing up instantly, Makoto closed her eyes and thought words she'd rather not say in present company.  The kids had all stopped their antics.  The boy was gone, but the little girls were still positioned around her bare (aside from some dipping sauce) feet.  She looked over at the pizza guy, who looked even more worried than she was, staring dumbly at the shocked mother as Makoto faced the opposite direction.  Bowing her head for a moment, Makoto grabbed a hold of the delivery bag to make sure it wouldn't fall as she moved, and turned around to face the latest in a growing line of people to see her in a state of embarrassment today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" Makoto said, meeting the mother's gaze with her own.  Mom, for her part, looked like a strung out mess, standing there in front of her open door with her hands over her son's eyes,  Makoto continued, \"but the pizza delivery guy here knocked on my door by accident while I was in the bath and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A likely story!\"  The mom said, incredulously.  \"Listen young lady, I don't know what your kink is, but this building isn't your private playground!  I've got kids over here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, the same kids that were torturing my feet and trying to pants me five seconds ago!\" Makoto thought to herself.  As it was, she was still soaking wet from the bath, and the vest and pizza bag combo did an awkward job of hiding her nakedness at best.  In short, she was in a very poor position to argue anything with anyone.  But, she was a Sailor Scout, and a tough one at that.  She wasn't going to be bullied by anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care what you think ma'am, but this is all just a misunderstanding.  I was trying to get back into my apartment when your kids...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cram it!\"  Mom interrupted.  She looked like she was about to cry.  \"I know you don't care, no one does!  You just run around having your little adventures without a care in the world, while I'm stuck in my apartment every night dealing with real responsibilities!  You're a young girl with lots of time on her hands, you'd think just ONCE you'd take an interest in someone other than yourself, maybe offer to look after my kids for a little bit so I can have a night out, but NO you spend your time streaking through the halls without even thinking about the other people living here struggling to raise a family!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat wasn't fair at all.  Makoto was not what you would call a girl with lots of time on her hands.  Between schoolwork and saving the world, it's a miracle she EVER has enough time to finish a nice relaxing bath.  Clearly, today was not going to be one of those miraculous days.  Still, she couldn't help but feel sorry for the woman.  Her kids were obviously a handful, and looking after them had driven her to distraction.  Maybe she could work out some time in her busy schedule to take them off her hands for a while.  After staring down otherworldly monsters and supervillains on a daily basis, taking care of some unruly brats for a few hours should be a sinch... when she wasn't wearing an ill-fitting pizza bag that is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really am sorry about all of this ma'am.  If you ever need me to watch the kids for a little bit, I'd be more than happy to help out.  But you really must believe that this whole situation here is all a misunderstanding, you see...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto never got to finish her sentence.  As soon as she said she'd be willing to babysit, the mother's eyes grew wide with a swelling joy that boarders on truly \"more than happy.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?  You would!?  Oh that is... that is just... Oh, thank you so much Makoto!  I'll just, well, you can just walk right in and make yourself at home!\"  The mother, now disturbingly frantic with jubilation, swings the door to her own apartment wide open, offering Makoto entry, releasing her son to leer at the nearly naked scout once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto was stunned to say the least.  This woman actually thought she was going to look after her kids in THIS state!?  Was she insane!?  Makoto struggled to formulate a suitable reply, forgetting for an instant that she was now the only one holding up her pizza pants, causing the back part to slip away exposing her still wet butt to the breezy hallway.  Luckilly, her backside was facing the door, and no one else, but the girls at Makoto's feet couldn't resist craning their heads back to take a giggling peak at the naughty older girl's exposed bum.  Struggling to fix her predicament, all thoughts of replying to the kid's crazy mom were momentarily forgotten as the off duty Sailor Scout frantically fumbled to re-secure her makeshift pizza pants, causing her tits to wiggle free of her borrowed vest in the process.  By the time she had set herself right, Makoto saw that the jubilant mother had already made her way to the end of the hall and was preparing to leave down the stairwell.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" Makoto cried out, but the response she received back was a fleeting \"Emergency numbers are... well you know the number for the police, right?  Take care everyone, I love you!\" before the mom dissapeared down the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto thought to herself.  \"Police!?  What have I gotten myself into now!?\"  Before she could mull the situation over properly in her head however, she noticed the pizza guy looking down at his watch and then looking back up at Makoto with a sorry and desperate look upon his face.  \"What's the matter?\"  Makoto said aloud.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring at his shoes and shaking his head as he spoke, the Pizza guy replied.  \"I am really sorry about all of this, Makoto, but... if I don't get back to work soon, my boss is going to kill me!  I'm going to need to ask for my stuff back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngry, surprised and frustrated, Mokoto glares daggers back at the man who got her into this mess and asks \"So your just going to leave me here like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis expression truly sorry, the Pizza man nods his head and explains himself.  \"If I don't get back to work soon, with all of the company's property, I could lose my job.  I can' afford to get fired right now Makoto.  I'd really like to help you out, but I don't really have a choice.  I'm sure you can find something to wear in that woman's apartment though.  She seemed so happy to have you to look after her kids, I'm sure she won't mind you borrowing some clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConsidering this for a moment, Makoto sighs (it's nearly a grunt) in frustration and hands back the pizza bag before carefully removing the vest and handing it over to the pizza guy as well.  Now totally naked, she quickly covers herself by wrapping one arm around her breasts and placing the other between her legs.  She then stands uneasily waiting for the pizza guy to depart.  He stands transfixed for a moment, and, despite his reservations, he can't help but stare.  The tall, brown haired girl was a vision of beauty, with her wet, glistening breasts pushed together by her clutching arm and only her hand and invisible air between him and her most private secret.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnapping himself out of it, the Pizza man nods apologetically and turns to shuffle awkwardly out of the building.  Makoto, though partially relieved to see a set of annoying eyes go, is left feeling more exposed then ever as she watches her momentary covering, literally, walk right out the door.  Sighing again, in resignation this time, she turns her attentions towards the kids starring up at her in unreadable silence.  Putting on a fake smile, Makoto bends over at the waist to lower herself to the eye level of the children.  This, naturally causes her naked butt to stick out obscenely behind her, but there's no one back there to look aside from that accursed jammed door.  Small drops of water still sliding down her skin, Makoto tells the children to head back inside the apartment in the most confident and in control voice she can muster.  She's quite anxious to follow them of course, especially if it means getting out of this exposed hallway and finding something to wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her first impulse was to swim as quickly and silently into a shadowy part of the lake and just wait for whatever it was to pass by, but then her mind caught up to the direction the noise had come from. Her clothes! No! With her heart pounding, Mina quickly swims to the hidden bush that holds her belongings. Looking around frantically, she exits the water, trying to keep herself covered all the while. Walking on her tip toes, Mina made her way as carefully as possible to the spot she'd stashed her clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly there was nothing there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMina turned red, and her stomach did little flipflops. She was stranded, completely naked and glistening wet, with no easy way to get back home! How could this get any worse?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, that's definitely her.\" A sniveling voice announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMina screamed and spun around. Two 13 year old boys were standing there, leering at her with grinning faces. Mina stared at them a moment, then she reddened and covered her breasts. A second later, she moved one hand down between her legs. One of the boys had dark brown hair and pimples, the other hand black hair and thick glasses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, she does LOOK similar, and those bouncy breasts are as nice to watch as they are on the real one, but there's no way....\" The one with the pimples said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course there is.\" The first said, holding up a bra. \"This is the exact size I've estimated-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You little perverts!\" Mina screamed. \"Give me back my clothes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She sounds the same.\" The glasses one said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said give me bac- AHHHHH!\" Mina screamed as she felt someone swap her butt, which had been sticking out as she was leaning forward trying to block as much of the view from her front as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we should just ask her.\" Said a squat, fat boy roughly the same age as the others. Mina spun around, realizing she had given him a perfect view of her rear end, hunched over as she had been. Her face was burning, and she started to scream again. Her hands quickly covered her mouth, realizing that venting her rage verbally would just attract more attention. A second later, both hands shot down once again between her legs, the arms covering up her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that's funny! She' making a 'V' with her hands!\" The one in glasses snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave me alone!\" Mina said. \"Where do get off....wait...did you say 'V'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" The glasses wearing kid said. \"You know...like 'V' for 'Victory'. Or 'V' for 'Venus', maybe...as in, Sailor Venus?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh crap! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Allow me to introduce myself and my friends. I'm Victor. The big guy behind you is Rick. The guy with the pimples is Stu. We're a part of the Sailor V fanclub!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFans? FANS? What kind of fans steal your clothes and humiliate you like this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good for you!\" Mina snapped. \"Now gimme back my clothes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So your saying you aren't Sailor V?\" Victor asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you, dense? Of course I'm not a freaking Sailor Scout. You think if I could zap you with lightning bolt I'd let you stand there gawking at me?\" Mina demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's Jupiter. But she has a point. I don't think the real V would be dumb enough to get her clothes stolen.\" Stu said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if she's not Sailor V, I guess she won't need this, then.\" Victor casually raised up Venus' transformation brooch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...yeah, that's nothing important. Why don't you put that down and go away, huh?\" Mina said, her voice cracking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah. I figure if it isn't important, you won't mind me tossing it into the lake. Or maybe I'll crush it under a rock!\" Victor said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" Mina said. \"Okay, don't do that. Please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...I'll think about it.\" Victor said, twirling the wand in his hand. \"You know, I might be able to decide a bit quicker if you put those silly hands of yours behind your head and widened those legs a bit. Oh, and stick out that chest a little more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAww, crap! How could this be happening? Mina placed her hands behind her head and widened her stance. Now she was on full display for a bunch of perverts! Stu took out a camera with an enormous lens on it and began snapping pictures. Rick took out a tape measure and began measuring various parts of her body. Mina was sure he was taking the opportunity to grope her as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who knew she shaved down there?\" Victor asked casually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-that's enough!\" Mina said. \"I've played along so far. Just gimme back my clothes and I'll forget this ever happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll tell you what. You do us another favor, and we'll let you have your clothes back.\" Victor said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What favor?\" Mina demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about we give her a spare Sailor V mask, and she does some poses for us?\" Stu suggested. \"I've got a whole boat load of manga and newsclippings of Sailor V pictures we can make her duplicate!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm naked!\" Mina wailed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yeah. That's kinda the point.\" Stu said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think she needs to be taught a lesson. A sailor scout can't afford to be caught naked and unawares. What if there had been an emergency? What if we'd been the negaverse? I say we spank her so she remembers not to let this happen again!\" Rick said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys are thinking too small. Why don't we double our good fortune?\" Victor suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Mina asked suspiciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, here's what I'm thinking. Your the Sailor Scout of Love, right? Well, why not show a little of it off? You call one of your sailor friends, get them to get naked for us, and then let us watch the two of you make out. You do a good job, maybe we'll give you two your clothes back.\" Victor explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, I like the poses idea better.\" Stu said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, which one you gonna do?\" Rick asked.</span></div></div>",

Since we took a look through your stuff we got your home address, so we'll definitely be in touch.\" Stu said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreat. Just what she needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go.\" Stu said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three perverts parted, forcing Mina to wander to the front of the clearing, their eyes glued on her butt. Mina was blushing furiously as she parted the bushes and glanced left and right. Outside of the cover of the trees and bushes there was a sunny and grassy clearing, and a sidewalk running through the midst of it. Mina's heart was thumping as she timidly made her way out into the open, her hands still positioned behind her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice. Now let's get you into costume. Here's the mask and your red ribbon. I also got some shoes for you.\" Stu said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee, thanks.\" Mina muttered as she tied her wet hair back with the ribbon and put the high heeled orange shoes on her feet. The mask, a decent replica of the one she used to wear during her solo adventures as Sailor V, fit snuggly over her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right! Let's start off with a quick Sailor V transformation! Say 'Venus Star Power' and do the usual pose.\" Stu said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the usual pose?\" Venus snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want your clothes back, you'll figure it out.\" Stu said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVenus sighed, and then went through her normal routine, twirling an imaginary wand around her in a circle and holding it over her head. SHe demonstrated how to fire a crescent beam, pantomimed using a love me chain, and did her best 'In the name of Venus, I will punish you' pose. Venus began to realize that her typical style of fighting her enemies had often emphasized showing off her legs and breasts, positioning herself so that she gave provacative glimpses of her body to her enemies and fans alike. She had always subscribed to the philosophy if you had it, flaunt it. Well, now she had more to flaunt than ever. Stu kept the camera moving, highlighted her butt as she bent over, photographing her breasts as she squeezed them together, zooming in on her shaven sex as she posed dramatically with her hips swaying in the breeze. To her humiliation, Mina had to mentally slap herself more than once as she imagined attacking an enemy with her magic chain, whipping it around her body and then lashing out at an enemy, pausing to let Stu capture the shape of her butt or the jutting of her breasts as she performed her signature attacks in slow motion. She hated the moments of these realizations even more, because once she realized sh was starting to enjoy performing for these freaks, her response was inevitably to blush furiously, snap out of the pose as best she could, and cover herself with the slim protection of her hands. This seemed to delight the trio to no end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right. That's about all we needed.\" Stu said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're going to give me back my clothes now, right?\" Mina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Depends. You going to admit who you are?\" Stu asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't say anything about that!\" Mina snappd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, lemme put it this way. If your just some ditzy dumb blond who took a swam and paid the price, then I don't really owe you anything. In fact, the thought of you having to make it home like that is awesome! On the other hand, if your really Sailor Venus, and you can prove it, then I'd be willing to return your stuff. Out of respect, you understand.\" Stu clarified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her hands darted out to catch the brooch. In the process, she gave her audience one last good look at her full frontal nudity, including a lovely bounce of her ample chest as she caught the magic pendant. Mina clutched the pendant tightly and reddened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did that on purpose.\" She noted duly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meh. One last look. Can you blame me?

To her relief, she felt the familiar snug confines of a fuku materialize around her. The trio looks on in awe and admiration, then exchanged incredibly smug glances as if they were mentally high fiving each other. Mina blushed when she realized what the look meant- \"We just saw Sailor V naked!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right! Listen up! You three had your fun, but now the party's over!\" Mina said, in her best authoritative voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" Stu returned. \"So, what's next, Miss V?\"</span></div></div>",

SHe then began working her way out of the one piece fuku she had on underneath her costume. Her milky white breasts and huge pink nipples popped into view, followed by her bouncy butt and shaven pussy. She stripped off her gloves, so that all she had left were her bow, tiara, earings and shoes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh....ta-daa?\" Mina said, presenting herself to the boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, look at that. She got naked again.\" Victor noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wasn't she complaining about being made a porn star before?\" Stu asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on guys!\" Mina begged, squeezing her ample breasts at them and wiggling her butt. \"Can't we just forget all this? Here I am, naked and....and....stuff, giving you all a free show!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meh. I always liked Sailor Moon body better anyway.\" Victor said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. She doesn't act like a slut.\" Stu said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!\" Venus shouted. \"How can you...oh, I see! Your so clever! Making me all jealous like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah. Your just overrated.\" Stu said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it! VENUS LOVE-ME Chain!\" Mina screamed, a chain of golden hearts appearing in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth boys eyes widened as the chain came down....on Mina's butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OWWWWW!\" Mina cried, the whip dissolving around her as she shot up, rubbing her butt in the process and hopping around. Her breasts were bouncing left and right as she bent over, rubbing her butt and wincing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".......I guess we could stop the countdown for a little while. Let her finish...\" Stu said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, okay.\" Victor said, typing into the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow! Ow! Ow!\" Mina squeeled. \"I...ow. That thing his harder than I thought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I wouldn't just snap it up in the air like that and bring it down. You build up too much momentum. Next time wrap it around you hand a few times so you shorten the length to like three feet. Its easier to swat yourself that way.\" Rick said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next time?\" Mina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I think your onto something with the spanks. How about you lean over against that log and do it again?\" Stu asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMina blushed. \"H-how many times?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, go ahead and count. We'll tell you when you can stop.\" Victor said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMina blushed as she bent herself over the log, her breasts jutting out hugely in front of her. She gingerly raised her hand behind her and called the whip back into being. Winding it around her hand, she created a tight strap that reminded her of her father's belt as he prepared to discipline her for being a bad girl. The same mix of anxiety and shame were bubbling up in her now, made all the worse because she was being 'discplined' by a group a half dozen years younger than her, to say nothing of standing naked in front of them and knowing they were loving every second! This couldn't be any worse!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Miss not a porn star, I have a question for you?\" Stu called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah?\" Mina asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If your not a porn star, what's with your nipples and stuff?\" Stu asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMina's blush became a hundred times worse. The pink tips of her breasts were indeed hard and begging for some attention, as was her moistening sex. Okay, so it could be worse. Her body could sadistically be enjoying the attention she was getting from her forced humiliation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O...one!\" Mina said, bringing down the strap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a hot summers day, as a car pulled up to the crystal clear beach, where you could easily see the dolphin flipping in the air. It didn't take long for one of the car doors to open, and out stepped a beautiful young woman with shoulder length blue hair, shining blue eyes, and was wearing a pretty blue bikini. This blue haired beauty, was known none other than Michiru, AND to a few special friends, was also known as Sailor Neptune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amara, you sure you don't wanna stay, and swim with me and the dolphins?\" Michiru asked, turning to the person inside the car still, who was a young woman as well, but had VERY SHORT blong hair, and was wearing sunglasses, and a red buisness suit. Her name was Amara, but like Michiru, was known to only a few of her special friends, as Sailor Uranus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Positive,\" The blond haired beauty told her friend, while not looking at her, \"I can't miss this job interview, and you know that,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.... but you can't blame me for trying at least,\" Michiru giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.... have fun, and wish me luck!\" Amara nodded at her friend, before Michiru shut the door to the car. After she did, the car sped off, and was soon out of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She should try to slow down,\" Michiru told herself, while waving at the direction of where the car headed, before heading down to the beach. Once there, she kicked off her sandals, set her towel down, and went into the water, straight for the dolphins. As she did, however, she didn't happen to see the wind kick in, and swept her towel into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the towel went far away, Michiru swan under the water, towards the dolphins. Once she reached them, she gently began to pet one, who she knew very well, and it retaliated, by pokinh its thin nose into her belly button, making her stop, and clasp both her hands over her mouth, trying to not let air escape as she was trying HARD not to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh no!' she thought in her mind, as the dolphin continued to poke her belly button, 'Not the belly button! I'm surper ticklish there!' As she continued to think wildly, while her eyes closed, and her body shook, a dolphin that swam behind her noticed how the strap of her blue bikini top continued to shake wildly. It looked fun to tug on, so it went up behind her, took the thin strap of her bikini in her mouth, and tugged. As the strap began to come out of its bow, Michiru didn't even notice, as she tried to make her friend stop poking her belly button. As she did, the dolphin behind her continued to tug ang tug, until at last, the blue strap of her bikini was undon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'YAY! I GOT THE TOY UNTIED FROM HER!' The dolphin thought exciely, before going up to the still occupied laughing woman. Michiru didn't even see the dolphin come up to her, as her eyes were still closed, from laughing from the assult on her belly button. As soon as it was close enough, the dolphin took the middle part of the blue cloth (between her, Michiru's, breasts, so your not confused), and gently tugged, and to the baby's glee, it slid off Michiru's chest, and down her arms. Thanks to the water, Michiru didn't even feel her bikini top come off her, THAT and her dolphin friend's tickling assult on her belly button distracted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'HEY! LOOK WHAT I GOT!' The baby dolphin exclaimed to the other two that were there, showing the bikini top that was once covering Michiru's chest, now in the baby's mouth. The other baby was amazed at there friend's new toy, and wondered if Michiru had another one of those things. Her eyes brightened, seeing one on her lower half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'One second!' The other baby dolphin told her friend, before going over to Michiru herself. Finding a similar strap on her hips, was no problem, and after a few tugs, it was off Michiru's bottom half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'OKAY! LET'S GO PLAY WITH OUR NEW TOYS!' The two babies exclaimed excidely, before swimming away from there other friend, who was still tickling the blue haired beauty, and the so called, blue haired beauty, now totally naked under the sea!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

The two younger dolphins had tugged off her top and the bottom of her thin, blue bikini, which the laughing young woman had not noticed. Tho, she really did not care.<br>\r\nShe was having the time of her life with this dolphin...and giggled again when his snout touched, then rubbed her erect nipples, her breasts bobbing in the water, open to his touches.<br>\r\n\"OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHH...That feels so....good!\" she moaned out as she now noticed she was nude in the water....\"Where the fuck did my bikini go to???\" she ask as the dolphin kept nipping at her now exposed, naked body.

She then noticed her towel laying right beside her,...and she reached out for it with her weak-feeling arms.<br>\r\n\"Gods...I can hardly move right now....got to get a grip on myself...\" she added as she then sat up, and used the towel to wrap around her naked body. Then she noticed as her eyes grew focused....it was getting dark....and the end of day light was fast approaching. She looked at the dipping sun, as the sunset started....and she smiled out at the sea.....and at her unseen, new lover....<br>\r\n\"I will be back, my friend.....tomorrow!\" she promised, as she felt an ache of the emptiness within her pussy, which wanted to be once more filled with that dolphin's male hardness.....while she reached up and cupped her tits, while she mashed and pinched her nubs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nwhat next??? </span></div></div>",

Is that you?\u201d Came the voice on the other end. \u201cHow are you? When did you get back to earth?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI arrived in Tokyo a few minutes ago.\u201d Setsuna said, smiling a little at her friend\u2019s excitement. \u201cI apologize for not informing you sooner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s all right!\u201d Michiru assured. \u201cBut\u2026wait, is something wrong? Do you need our help?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, nothing like that.\u201d Setsuna said, hesitating slightly. \u201cCrystal Tokyo has been peaceful and quite prosperous. No one has threatened it since Wiseman was destroyed. Our Queen is happy, and Chibiusa is growing up. The Doorway of Time remains secure. If anything things have grown quieter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds boring.\u201d Michiru said in sympathy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo be honest with you, I prefer it.\u201d Setsuna said, sighing in exasperation and pushing her way into an alcove hoping to escape the throng of people and the accompanying cacophony of noise. \u201cThe silence allows me to think and be at peace. While I treasure the company of Small Lady, and I enjoyed my time with all of you when I was last here\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetsuna glanced up as a short, bolding man in a business suit passed by on his way to whatever destination he was headed. The man\u2019s eyes were leering at the short skirt Setsuna wore on this summer day, trailing over her large breasts and well sculpted figure. She found herself blushing from the look. The man met her glare and quickly went on his way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut this city is full of awful people!\u201d Setsuna said, the blush still on her face. \u201cLess than an hour, and I\u2019ve been jostled, bumped into, cursed at\u2026and now stared at! There is too much noise and confusion, the air is so stifling. And there are smells coming from the corners of the streets I don\u2019t want to think about!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t like crowds, Setsuna?\u201d Michiru asked, genuinely interested. Setsuna, or Sailor Pluto, rarely ever talked about herself. Or at all, for that matter. \u201cYou\u2019ve always been a little withdrawn. I always thought it was a consequence of being so close to Time. I never imagined you were just being shy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d Setsuna paused a moment to get her flustered voice under control. \u201cI\u2019d like to talk about something else now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, come on!\u201d Michiru persisted. \u201cYour taking a little vacation to visit us anyway. Do yourself a little favor, and hook up with someone while you\u2019re here! Trust me, that\u2019ll do wonders for you\u2026.and maybe it\u2019ll get you to stop being so tightly wound\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI have no interest in\u2026\u2019hooking up\u2019 with anyone here.\u201d Setsuna said icily. \u201cThese people\u2026they are just one more group in a throng of humanity\u2026one more civilization that\u2019s going to fall. I am the embodiment of Pluto and the guardian of Time. I remain detached from these people as part of my duty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, good god, Pluto! We\u2019re talking about one little love affair! What\u2019s the point of protecting the world if you can\u2019t indulge yourself a little?\u201d Michiru asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am perfectly content, thank you.\u201d Setsuna muttered. \u201cI am well aware of just how many of these brutish people would like me to \u2018indulge\u2019 in them. I\u2019ve seen history, Neptune. I\u2019ve seen the very worst parts of these\u2026people play over and over again just beyond my doorstep. How can I find a decent person in this sea of\u2026of leering faces?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo your just going to hide yourself behind your portal all your life? Setsuna\u2026speaking as a friend who still admires these sorts of things\u2026you\u2019re a beautiful woman! Don\u2019t hide behind your insecurities! Get out there and flaunt what you have! I mean\u2026look, you\u2019ve got more experience with this than I do. I don\u2019t pretend to have a complete handle on destiny and fate, but I notice that we tend to have to face our fears one way or another. Either we confront them ourselves\u2026.or life makes us confront them.\u201d Michiru warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a matter of fear. It is a matter of what duty demands of me, and what I prefer. I prefer to be alone. I have no intention of ever showing these drooling men\u2026or, no offense, women\u2026.any more of myself than I am right now. And to be blunt\u2026this is too much already. Do you have a place I can stay?\u201d Setsuna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course. Your always welcome at our house. I\u2019m sorry for pressing the issue\u2026\u201d Michiru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. No, I apologize. I have been uneasy for quite sometime.\u201d Setsuna whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou seem a little on edge. Normally you\u2019re a lot calmer and collected. And less talkative.\u201d Michiru noted. \u201cAre you sure everything is all right? No danger?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMostly certain, yes. I\u2019ve just been feeling\u2026strangely lately. A little emptier, like there was a void in me. But I can\u2019t seem to find a specific threat. Its more like a vague unease\u2026like something fundamental has shifted somehow in a way I\u2019m unaware of.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm\u2026is that what prompted this little visit?\u201d Michiru asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPartly\u2026\u201d Setsuna admitted. \u201cI may have\u2026.all of you, as well. And this place, a little as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, of course you have!\u201d Michiru said. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve missed you. I\u2019ll call the others. Its been awhile since we saw usagi and the inners anyway. We\u2019ll have a little party when you get here, okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat sounds great.\u201d Setsuna said, smiling to herself. Yes, despite all her harsh criticism of humanity, Earth did have its charms. She had missed it a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden wind picked up, and she felt her flap up a little. Her panties were momentarily exposed. She squeeked a little and quickly yanked them down. Her eyes looked left and right. Sure enough, she spied a group of young boys pointing and laughing at her from a nearby bench. One even had a cellphone out to capture the event.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had missed this world. It was just hard to recall why at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe air shifted It was a subtle thing, like static electricity in the air. The shadows seemed to lengthen, and the people seemed to move a little more sluggishly. Setsuna recognized the shift. Something was drawing out energy. Something nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMichiru, something is happening here. Have YOU been having in trouble? I think something is attacking these people.\u201d Setsuna exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmmm\u2026nothing major. Since Galaxia things have settled down significantly. But we occasionally get a refugee from some other part of the Galaxy or crawling up from the Dark Kingdom. They don\u2019t seem to have a specific agenda. They just need energy, and earth happens to have plenty of what they need.\u201d Michiru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, its still a parasite, and it needs to be stopped.\u201d Setsuna said. \u201cI realize its not typically our concern, but I believe I\u2019ll take this particular creature out myself. If nothing else, it will allow me to work off some tension.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay. Let me know if you need any help.\u201d Michiru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will.\u201d Setsuna said, closing the cell phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPluto Power\u2026.MAKE UP!\u201d She cried, feeling the familiar cold, grey magic of time embrace her. Her street clothes dissolved around her, to be replaced by the familiar fighting regalia of the senshi. First her fuku, identical to her fellow companions save for the particular dark colors of her small skirt and the scarf like bow all the sailor scouts wore about their necks. A moment later, her feet were clad in a pair of knee high black boots, and her hands in white gloves. The familiar, solid weight of her staff materialized in her hands. Finally, the magic provided the small cosmetic changes of her earings and crown, finishing with a dark shade of lip gloss across her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole process felt a little more sluggish than normal. Pluto took a second to glance around, making certain no one had caught her in the midst of her transformation. She barely needed her civilian identity since she spent so little time in this world\u2026but just the thought of being seen naked was enough to make her tremble. But no, no one was around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis form allowed Setsuna to do many super human feats. If she couldn\u2019t exactly leap tall builds in a single bound, she could at least jump several stories up. She quickly leapt from one train to another, closing in on the source of the dark energy. She saw it then, hidden on a roof top of the train station, near the hub of trains and people. It was black skinned with a reddish, diamond like dress that looked a bit like a revealing clown outfit. The shape approximated a female, but the 6 arms ending in taloned claws suggested a more spider-like physiology. This was an underling of the Dark Kingdom, no doubt a refugee from the turbulent place that had been in complete chaos since Queen Beryl had been defeated. Pluto sighed to herself. Not much of a challenge to a veteran like her. As an aside, the fashion of the Negaverse was as gawdy but otherworldly as ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPluto paused a moment, then launched a kick at the creature\u2019s head. The monster went flying into the crowd, squeeling in surprise. Although quieter and more withdrawn than the other scouts, Pluto nonetheless took a moment to pose, arms crossed and expression glaring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI come from a world of ice and darkness. I serve as the guardian of Time and Space on the lonely world called Pluto. You are not from this place, yet you seek to steal the very lifeforce from these people! I am Sailor Pluto, and in the name of Pluto I shall punish you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spider woman hissed and spat ball of darkness that quickly expanded into a web. Pluto sighed and leapt straight at the web. Holding her staff in both hands, Pluto summoned a small amount of power and struck the web with her weapon. The staff tore through the webbing like a knife through butter. The spider woman\u2019s eyes widened as she narrowly ducked out of the way as Pluto finished the downward spiral inches from the thing\u2019s head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just want to eat!\u201d The Dark Kingdom monster whined. \u201cI\u2019m hungry, and this is the only place to get any food!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis world is under the protection of the sailor senshi. You knew this when you came, and you knew what it would mean if you were discovered.\u201d Pluto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease! Listen, my names Ara. I\u2019m not bad\u2026.okay, I am, but not that bad! I just want a little energy! I won\u2019t take enough to hurt anyone! Just enough to keep myself alive. PLEASE!\u201d Ara pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho you are and why you are here are irrelevant.\u201d Pluto said, leaping at the poor demon, spinning her staff at the monster\u2019s head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d Ara screamed, dodging desperately. \u201cPlease! Leave me alone! Have mercy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will give you the only mercy I have ever shown any creature that would cross between her rightful place in time and space into another\u2019s- I will give you a quick end with no pain. You will simply be removed from this timeline\u2026.\u201d Pluto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLEAVE ME ALONE!\u201d Ara screamed, dodging another blow and kicking with a high heeled shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPluto grabbed the boot with her gloved hand, forcefully stopping the attack with her mystically granted strength. She stared at the woman coldly, then blinked as she felt a cool wave of energy emanate from her hand. The glove seemed to waiver in the air, dissolving in a grey light, which slowly unraveled into nothing. Pluto was left holding the spider\u2019s foot with a bare hand. Ara recovered from the surprise first and tore her leg from the scout\u2019s grasp. With fury and helpless outrage, Ara spat two more balls of webbing at the scout. Pluto leapt out of range one attack, then the other. She skidded to a halt, deftly bunching herself and using her boots to stop her momentum. She glared at the spider woman\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd felt bare concrete underneath her feet. She glanced and and saw the wisps of smoky grey energy rise around her and float away. Her boots had dissolved like her glove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Pluto demanded, looking slightly annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe? I\u2019m not doing anything!\u201d Ara said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnlikely.\u201d Pluto said. \u201cWell, it is an amusing trick, but it only delays your death for a moment. Pluto Power, Make Up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPluto ran her staff along her arm. The grey light gathering at the coiled outward and reformed the missing glove. Pluto flexed her encased fingers with satisfaction, then raised one bare leg. She touched the tip of her staff, first to one foot then the other. Soon enough her boots were back on her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI believe we should simply end this.\u201d Pluto said, raising her staff over her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDead Scream.\u201d She whispered, causing a mammoth bath of the same grey energy to well up on the end of the staff. She released the energy at Ara, momentarily blinded by the attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smoke cleared to find Ara cowering behind her hands, trembling. She blinked a moment, looking over herself, apparently as astonished as Pluto that she was alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2026hey, sailor bitch, are you just playing around with me? I thought you said you were going to make this quick!\u201d Ara said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026How did you stop that attack?\u201d Pluto demanded. \u201cThere\u2019s no way-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe suddenly felt faint, like something was ebbing away from her. She fell to her knees, feeling a huge drop in energy. With an effort, she stopped the flow. She looked down at her hands and knees. Her gloves and boots were stripped from her.<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2026.tell me what your doing to me!\u201d Pluto demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, honey, I have no idea what your problem is!\u201d Ara snapped, then her eyes narrowed and a sly expression came over her face. \u201cBuuuuuut\u2026.you look a little like your losing your power over there.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? How would that even be possible?\u201d Pluto demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do I look like, a professor? How the hell should I know?\u201d Ara said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, somewhere in America\u2026..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProfessor!\u201d Mamorou, who was occasionally known as Darien, or Tuxedo Kamen, or Tuxedo Mask, called as he walked into his Astronomy professors office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d The professor asked, looking up from his books.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbout this quiz you gave yesterday\u2026\u201d Mammorou began. \u201cYou marked question six wrong. I thought it must be an error.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSix? Ah, yes, six. How many planets are in the solar system. You said nine. That\u2019s not the correct answer.\u201d The professor said irritably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course it\u2019s the right answer!\u201d Mamourou said, flabberghasted. \u201cEven elementary school kids know that! Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune, Uranus, and Pluto. That\u2019s nine planets! Trust me, I know this better than most!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe professor sighed. \u201cYou need to keep up with current events, Mamorou. You\u2019re a hard worker, but sometimes I feel like you\u2019re writing my class off like the information is irrelevant.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no. I just know most of it already. I have a\u2026err\u2026fascination with the stars. There\u2019s not a lot of stuff I don\u2019t know about this system.\u201d Mamourou said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh-huh. Well, for your edification, not too long ago the world astronomers decided to declare Pluto a non-planet.\u201d The professor said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHAT!\u201d Mamorou asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, they\u2019ve invented a category of \u2018demi-planet\u2019 for it. So the correct answer would have been 8.\u201d The professor noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHO GAVE THEM THE RIGHT TO DO THAT?\u201d Mamorou demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t aware they needed the right.\u201d The professor said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, what if someone gets hurt because of it?\u201d Mamorou demanded. \u201cWhat if the connection between a person and their planet gets disrupted because of this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood lord, son. Calm down. Who could possibly be hurt if one little planet isn\u2019t considered a planet anymore? Other than you and your question 6, of course.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in Japan\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPluto looked at Ara in confusion. The spider woman looked over the sailor scout as she rose to her feet. Ara still looked weary, but was smiling a little too smugly to herself. Pluto found the look both alarming and highly annoying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026.how do you want to handle this?\u201d Ara asked. \u201cYou could try to kill me\u2026but that attack of yours clearly eats up your power like nobody\u2019s business, and your apparently having some trouble keeping the power lethal long enough for it to connect with me. On the other hand, the longer you draw this out, the weaker you get. Right? Pretty soon you\u2019d be at my mercy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSailor Pluto drew herself into a fighting stance, spreading her knees and raising her staff above her with both hands. This caused her breasts to ride higher on her chest, highlighting and enlarging them. But that affect paled compared to what happened when a stiff wind billowed up, catching her skirt once again and revealing what she wore beneath to Ara and their stunned audience. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr rather, revealing what she no longer wore\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAra smirked, and the began to laugh hysterically. Pluto looked puzzled, then scowled. \u201cWhat the hell are you laughing at?\u201d She demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! Oh, nothing! Just\u2026heh heh\u2026you might\u2026hahaha!\u2026might want to watch how much you bend your knees. Especially in that little bitty skirt of yours.\u201d Ara said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you\u2026\u201d Pluto trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like you lost a little more than your shoes and gloves\u2026.\u201d Ara said, smiling. You can check if you want. I\u2019ll wait\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPluto blushed. With a sickening sensation, she reached beneath her skirt and felt around desperately for her panties. The silken fabric was nowhere to be found. Pluto pressed her lips together, her humiliation burning on her face. She felt a little dizzy as she looked at the crowd, seeing all the face who had just seen more of her than ANYONE had for millennia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHon\u2026I don\u2019t mean to interrupted your deer in headlights moment here\u2026but you might want to get your hand out of your skirt before people start to get the wrong idea\u2026.oops! Looks like they already did!\u201d Ara said, gesturing at a group of leering males who had just snapped a picture on a cell phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPluto tore her hand free like there was a snake hiding in her skirt. A second later, she used her hand to pull the hem of the skirt as low as it could go without revealing her butt or pulling it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWon\u2019t that make fighting kind of awkward?\u201d Ara asked. \u201cI mean\u2026trying to hold your skirt down and attacking me at the same time. Also\u2026correct me if I\u2019m misreading the implications here\u2026but your losing your powers, and the more power you lose the more clothes you lose, right? Pretty soon you won\u2019t have a skirt to hide anything behind!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought struck Pluto with horror. She looked around at the sea of faces. Everyone seemed eager to drink in her embarrassment. She tentatively began to inch towards the exit, walking on tip toes and keeping her skirt (which she was not ACUTELY aware was too short!) clamped to her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Pluto\u2026.\u201d Ara said, walking towards her. \u201cWhere do you think your going?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease\u2026\u201d Pluto muttered. \u201cJust let me go\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry. What? Let you go? Now that sounds familiar. Wasn\u2019t I begging for that just a little while ago? Except\u2026.at the time, I wasn\u2019t fretting over people seeing me naked. No, no, I was begging for my LIFE! And correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but if you weren\u2019t losing your energy left and right, that attack of yours would have killed me. RIGHT? So\u2026why should I be any more merciful to you? All you lose is your clothes. And maybe your dignity!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cE-either let me go or kill me now!\u201d Pluto snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh. Your strange. You\u2019d rather die than have anyone see you naked?\u201d Ara asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026I\u2019ve died before. I\u2019m not afraid of that. But\u2026everyone\u2019s looking at me! Everyone saw me\u2026saw my\u2026!\u201d Pluto stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. You have a lovely little slit down there. A nice butt too! I think everyone will appreciate seeing more of you!\u201d Ara said. \u201cBut\u2026.okay. I\u2019ll let you go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2026you will?\u201d Pluto asked, shock and relief on her face. Ara nodded and gestured towards the exit. \u201cTh-thank you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing.\u201d Ara said as Pluto meekly retreated. \u201cI\u2019ll just suck these folks dry and be on my way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPluto paused, turned around to stare at the monster. Her face grew determined, and she raised her staff and, cheeks burning as she let go of her skirt and felt it billow every direction as she gathered an enormous amount of energy in the tip. \u201cDead Scream\u201d she whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAra looked smug now. The energy ball streaked towards her. Pluto concentrated on the power, making certain the energy maintained its cohension even as it burned into her personal reserves of power. Ara watched it come, smiled broadly, and leapt aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d Pluto thought to herself. She mentally snapped back the energy, willing and even forcing the power to dissolve. It narrowly avoided striking the crowd before disappearing back to nothing. Pluto breathed heavily. Ara clapped her hands ( one pair, anyway, sitting on a train behind Pluto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWonderful shot. I figured I could get you to throw one more shot at me. You really put your heart into that one, too. Definitely would have killed me. But, hate to say it, you\u2019re a little too slow\u2026\u201d Ara smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPluto looked at her in despair. She felt her energy slipping. She was concentrating, trying to hold on to what she had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhhh\u2026.that look almost makes me feel sorry for you, Pluto. Your about to show off more of yourself, aren\u2019t you. Hmmm\u2026here\u2019s a suggestion. Why not just transformation back into\u2026whoever you are.\u201d Ara asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d be helpless.\u201d Pluto muttered softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour about to be helpless AND naked.\u201d Ara pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPluto\u2019s face burned, and she quickly held her staff in both hands and willed herself to return. There was a flash\u2026and the staff was gone. So was her fuku.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSailor Pluto stood dressed only in her skirt and the little bow she had tied about her neck. Everything else was gone, except the crown on her head. Pluto made a little noise in the back of her throat. Both hands went up, pulling the sides of her bow down over her naked, enormous breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAra practically squeeled in delight. \u201cOh, god yes! Oh, I\u2019m so sorry Pluto\u2026but this is so perfect! Look at you! Look at that flat little stomach! Those long, gorgeous legs. And this big, bouncing titties! Haha! I really was going to let you go, hon, but now that you\u2019ve lost your chance to transform back\u2026.well, we\u2019re too far gone now, aren\u2019t we? You have no way to attack me, no way to turn back, and how long can it possibly take before your exposed butt naked to all these people?? Heh heh. I wonder which will be next? Your top, or your bottom?\u201d Ara asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSailor Pluto looked around at the assembled audience. This was easily every nightmare she had rolled into one. A sea of humanity, a sea she had deliberated tried to separate herself from emotionally and physically\u2026despite all her desires and efforts, hundreds of people were staring at her! At her practically naked body! They had cameras and cell phones. This horrible moment, the moment when the modesty she\u2019d safe guarded for millennia, was going to be captured for all time. Whatever was she going to do? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The silence was what decided it, in the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetsuna stood there, head spinning and knees weak. She stood frozen, hands tugging down on little sailor bow that currently shielded her breasts from public viewing. Her tanned, taught stomach and lovely navel was completely bared, and only her small skirt protected her from exposure of her most scared place of all. There was an otherworldly fiend staring at her with malicious intent, and a stunned audience staring at the tall, exotically tanned woman with long dark green hair whose clothes were, one by one, vanishing into the ether. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn other times and places, Setsuna prided herself on being the calm and collected scout. It was a demeanor easy enough to aquire- she was the senshi of Time, after all. When you can spend your days looking into past and future, going over every inch of possibility until the path to the preferred outcome is all but laid out for you step by step\u2026.that goes a long way to building the cool, detached style she presented to the world. But as much as she would like to be, Setsuna was never TRULY detached from the world. She was too old, too wise for that. And it was killing her now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetsuna could be called a student of history. Past and present and future- the portal through time she stood watch over allowed her to review each moment as easily as a normal person might watch a television. She envied the faith the other scouts could have in humanity- they were so young, so idealistic. Even the supposed cynicism of her friends in the Outer Senshi was touchingly na\u00efve. Setsuna\u2026she knew humanity. She knew what their thoughts revolved around. Every person was selfish by default. It took effort, willpower, strength of being to rise above that. She had seen shining examples of virtue, but she had seen a hundred more examples of vice and betrayal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew what was on the minds of the people staring at her right now. She could see the pure lust in those eyes. She could practically feel them visually roaming over her, as if their gaze was a physical thing probing her body. She knew how the human mind worked. She had none of the sailor scout\u2019s naivete. Humans, all noble intentions put aside, revolved around two goals- a desire for wealth\u2026.and a desire for sex. And oh how they obsessed over those things!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Setsuna could be the thing she aspired to be, this wouldn\u2019t matter. Clothed or naked, powers or not, audience or no- she would fight to her last to end this threat. Detached, collected, assured of her purpose, she would have no fear or qualms about battering this demon to death regardless of how many eyes were on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetsuna was not what she aspired to be. She saw the eyes on her, knew she was to be the player in their sexual fantasies, knew every inch of her would now play host to websites and videos and photographs\u2026.and she trembled. And then a silence came over the audience, and Setsuna ran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSailor Pluto was what one might call an expert on silence. Her days were spent with watching over the void between times. She had learned to love the silence, to savor the flavor and the taste the way one might savor a fine wine. Silence, she discovered, had a music all its own. It could be beautiful, peaceful, flowing and long and soft. There were some silences so perfect you could wrap yourself in them like velvet. There were some silences more fragile than glass, yet with a greater weight than the most sacred of places could hold. And then\u2026there was this silence. This charged, expectant silence of eager eyes and leering faces. This was the silence of the wolf before it kills the lamb. This was the silence of the storm before the rains come. This was the silence of the headman before his axe fell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were waiting for her to be naked. They WANTED her to be naked, for the last of her to be laid before them helpless and bare. They wanted to see her blush, to see her squirm. They wanted her to be the object of their lust, her modesty flung away and her body completely and totally theirs to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll thoughts of being a Sailor Scout, of duty and honor, of the threats to the crowd and of punishing the creature that was feeding on them- they fled as surely as her clothing had. It was too much for the woman who would gladly give her life for this cause. Her life, yes. Never this! She gone too long, spent her entire existence hiding away from this world. She couldn\u2019t face it, being laid out like this, all her secrets gone and the privacy she\u2019d killed for to fade away like mist. Or clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she ran. Arms clutching at her bow, pressing with feverish desperation to the enormous orbs whose bottoms peaked out beneath the last of her covering, jostling and jiggling with each step she took. She ran, her skirt fluttering behind her, offering littler peaks and glimpses of her rounded butt cheeks, which jiggled ever so slightly in time with her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had no idea where she was going. When the large, heavy shadow leapt in front of her path, she squeeked and skidded to a halt. Ara stared at her, crossing her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t run.\u201d Ara said. \u201cRunning just makes me want to chase you. Chase you, catch you, play with you. I promise, if you run you won\u2019t get away, and I WILL make this harder on you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLeave me alone.\u201d Pluto whimpered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d Ara said. \u201cNot until I get a little payback. You were going to kill me, remember? I\u2019m going to make sure you remember what it feels like to be helpless and vulnerable and begging for mercy. Maybe next time you\u2019ll be more sympathetic. Besides\u2026.I\u2019m gonna have WAY too much fun to pass this up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPluto\u2019s knees trembled and her lip quivered. This wasn\u2019t happening. She glanced to her left and right. Then she saw it. A train, mere minutes away from disembarking. One of those passenger trains that helped commuters get into the center of Tokyo. That was her escape from here. How she would deal with her situation\u2026.she could solve this AFTER some distance between her and the thing she was fighting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPluto inched in that direction, her eyes slanting back towards Ara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPluto. Don\u2019t run. I\u2019m only saying this one more time. Its not a good idea.\u201d Ara said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPluto paused only a second longer. Then she fled, heading straight for the train.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPluto\u2019s heart sank a little inside the train. This was a passenger train, a bit like an above ground subway or a commuter rail. And it was full. Hundreds of people were gawking at her. But at least\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPluto\u2026.\u201d Came a voice behind her. Pluto closed her eyes and softly cursed. She didn\u2019t need to turn around to know who was behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPluto turned around slowly, like a small child caught in the act of something naughty. Ara stood, her expression blank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre we done now? You can keep running if you want.\u201d Ara offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m done.\u201d Pluto said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood.\u201d Ara said, spitting a wod of dark energy from her mouth. As the missile moved toward Pluto, she instinctively made to dodge it. But as it approached, the missile split into 4 pieces. Pluto panicked, hands and legs flailing out in all directions. Each new missile connected with a single limb, quickly congealing into strands of web that expanded to the floor and ceiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPluto found herself spread eagled in a crowded commuter train, bound up in sticky strands of web that encased her arms and legs. The curve of her round breasts was stretched and rising high on her chest, her bow literally centimeters away from exposing her rounded brown areolas and the erect nipples (her fear and adrenaline managing to betray her). Her skirt was the flimsiest of protections from a full view of her sex. The bottoms of her butt cheek were already on display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026.Pluto\u2026.here we are. Can you move? Can you call up any more magic to help you?\u201d Ara asked, seemingly honestly interested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d Pluto said, her voice so small and forlorn she might have as well been the little fly her current predicament reminded her of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood.\u201d Ara said, walking towards her, one pair of hands crossed over her chest, the other on her hips, and a third in a classic \u2018thinker\u2019 position as if she was pondering something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-what happens now?\u201d Pluto said, her voice trembling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happens now?\u201d Ara asked. \u201cPlu, I thought that was obvious. What happens now is\u2026anything I want to happen now.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Suddenly, she squealed as multiple arms grabbed her. They held onto her thighs, hips, and shoulders. She involuntarily squirmed, trying to break free of Aras grip. She had no luck, as the youma held firm. At once, she felt weaker, opening her eyes to see the blue wisps of her energy fading into the youma. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please stop, if you take any more...\" The words on her lips as a faint breeze through the train windows washed over her. Horrified, she realized the ribbon had disappeared, leaving her topless. Looking around, her stomach churned at the faces of the humans. For the males, and some females, she was the object of their desire. The leering faces, the snapping of cameraphones, the face nobody was coming to her aid, it was too much. Ara stopped draining Pluto when the woman started to cry. It was soft, but the green haired senshi had tears coming down her eyes. Small sobs wracked her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feeling humiliated and scared? Now you know how I felt.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAra's words held no sympathy, or sadism. The tone was neutral, but Pluto knew her ordeal was far from over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ju...just sto..stop. Please.\" The senshi begged. There was a pause, before Ara lifted her hands off. Pluto smiled in relief, maybe the youma would take pity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body froze as a pair of hands grip the fabric of her tiny miniskirt. \" I'm not done yet.\" There was sense of satisfaction coming from Aras as she tugged on the flimsy material slightly. Pluto shivered, fearing the skirt would rip, leaving her fully exposed to a watching world. It was hopeless trying to get away, she was overpowered. There were no other senshi around to save her, and the leering crowd seemed content to just watch her plight. Closing her eyes, Pluto awaited for whatever was in store. Shutting off the rest of the world, the shivering senshi didn't see a figure rise from the crowd. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He looked around her age, maybe his mid 20's. She could tell he was a foreigner, his features were too western, no trace of mixed lineage. A mix of red and brown hair matted his head, while green eyes glared at the youma. For a moment, Pluto desperately hoped for the mans green jacket, completing his ensemble of a black T-shirt and blue jeans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's enough?

Pluto would have given a small laugh if it wasn't real. She shook her head, remembering humans basest desires. He wouldn't help her. He would merely exacberate her condition for condition. She was still thinking of the immiment betrayal, before she looked at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Those eyes!</i> Having been around for millenenia, Pluto had become adept at readings peoples thoughts and emotions through their eyes. In the youths eyes, what little lust was tempered by restraint and compassion. Pluto felt warm relief at the thought, before becoming worried. The man had no powers, and was just as fragile as any human. How could he defeat a youma? Looking closer, she noticed the man held some fear, but was putting up a brave front. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So tell me stranger, how do you expect to defeat me?\" Ara was torn between being annoyed or amused by the mans 'cheap heroics'.

At the moment, they were camping outsite of her friend Gem's house, wearing there night-gowns, and were in the middle of a game of everyones favorite sleep over game, Truth or dare. Candy, a girl with short brown hair, just took her turn, having to tell them her deepest darkest secret, which happened to be having a crush on a boy at school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Candy,\" Gem stated, while running a hand through her black waist length hair, \"It's your turn! Choose your victum!\" Candy, who was still a little red after telling her secret looked around the tent, until her eyes rested on Hotaru, who was playing with the hem of her dark blue night gown. She remembered how Hotaru once got her in a dare good... and now would be the prefect time for some sweet payback! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hotaru... truth, dare, or double dare?\" Candy asked kindly. Hotaru didn't like the sound of her friend's voice, but thought of what she should do... so far, no one had chosen double dare, and thought it'd be fun to choose it, since no one else seem to have the guts to do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doubl dare me!\" she said bravely, making the others go \"Ooooohhhhhhh.......\" Candy smirked, for she had the perfect double dare in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, for this double dare... we need to go somewhere...\" She smiled. The others blinked, but followed her as she went to the limo (Gem is super rich)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*45 minutes later* <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe limo parked in front of Mike's house (he's a boy i made up that lives far away, but goes to the same school as them, and is the most popular boy in school) making the girls follow Candy out of the car, and into the bushes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Candy, why are we at Mike's?\" Hotaru asked in a hushed voice, but blushing deeply. She had a thing for Mike, and all of her friends knew it, which made her worry about what her double dare would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandy smiled at her now worried friend, who continued to play with the hem of her night gown, \"Well Hotaru, your double dare is to go up to Mike's house, ring the doorbell, and say, 'Hi there Mike, your dream girl is here,'.\" When she finished, she saw the girls, including Hotaru blinking at her in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it?\" Hotaur asked, a little unsure, \"That's all I gotta...\" before she could continue, Candy interrupted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the good part... you gotta do those things... butt naked!\" THIS made Hotaru go red while the other girls gasped. Go up to Mike's house?.... Say all those things?.... NAKED?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way Candy!\" Hotaru shouted a little, but not loud enough to sart a sceen, \"There's NO WAY I'm gonna do this dou-\" \"You're right!\" Candy interrupted again, \"It IS a double dare! And since you're forgetting, a double dare is a dare that you CAN'T back out of!\" Hearing this made Hotaru go red again... Candy was right.... She had to do it.... Stupid double dares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright...\" she sighed sadly, \"I'll do it... Just promise me you'll stay right here and watch over me as I do this and my clothes...\" The others nodded along with Candy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of couse girl!\" She smiled, while crossing her fingers behind her back, \"We wouldn't dream of leaving you during a dare this crazy! Now.... Get stripping!\" Hotaru turned red again, first removing her dark blue night gown, handing it to Candy neatly folded. After she did that, it left her only in her bra and underwear. Taking a little bit longer than before, Hotaru finally took a deep breath and unhooked her bra and pushed her underwear down, while her feet stepped out of her dark blue slippers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you feell Hotaru?\" Gem asked nicely, while now holding her indercarments, slipper socks, and slippers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-C-Cold,\" Hotaru shivered, as her now fully naked body was exposed to the chilly night air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just get it over with!\" Candy shouted silently, holding the dark blue night gown, \"so you can put your clothes back on afterwords!\" Hotaru sighed and nodded once. Turning to face Mike's house, she looked around for anyone else coming there way. When she saw no one coming, she took a deep breath, stepped out of the bushes carefully, and started walking towards Mike's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>   Hotaru padded up the cold sidewalk to Mike's front porch, hugging herself for warmth... and to disguise the fact that she was shivering with dread. Hotaru thought she was getting off light, all the same; that wicked dare she'd once stuck Candy with had involved a mammoth bowl of Jello and a photograph that the unfortunate Jello-ee hadn't lived down yet (although it had worked a twisted miracle for her popularity at school, in some circles).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   It was a little late to ring the doorbell, but Hotaru saw blue light from the living room. Mike liked to stay up late and watch TV on the weekends, so she might be able to get through this without involving the rest of his family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Hotaru already had a plan as she came up the walk. She stepped up on the wood stoop, glad to be off cold paving and sheltered from the wind. Her teeth were chattering with apprehension, but it was <i>just</i> possible she could escape anonymously. Picking up the welcome mat by the front door, Hotaru made sure she could hide behind it. To her knees, at least. She could get Mike to the door, recite what the dare required, and carefully back her way out to the street and limo. Mike would be so surprised, he'd never figure out who it was. She hoped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Hotaru took a deep breath and rapped lightly on Mike's front door with numb knuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Her stomach lurched as she heard someone approach, and Hotaru quickly hid most of herself behind the welcome mat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"<b>NOW</b> what?!\" asked Mike, opening the door, as if he'd been putting up with naked girls interrupting him all night. Looking down, she could see his sneakers just in front of her. Hotaru swallowed hard and spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Hi there, Mike! Your dream girl is here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Although she disguised her voice, Hotaru sounded unreasonably chipper, even to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Tomoe, what the heck are you up to?\" asked Mike, sounding amused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Hotaru forgot all about her plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"You recognized me by my <b>FEET</b>?!\" Hotaru demanded, dropping the mat to chest height and frowning. With her imagined escape stymied, Hotaru's disappointment outweighed her drop-dead chagrin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"They're totally superb feet, aren't they?\" said Mike, grinning. \"But really, I just don't know anyone as pale as you, Tomoe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"I'm not <i>that</i> pale,\" Hotaru grumbled. Griping beat death by embarrassment, so she stuck with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"You're on a dare, right?\" Mike asked, trying to get his grin under control. Hotaru noticed him struggling to be nice and felt a little better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"This would actually be a <b>double</b> dare, Mike,\" said Hotaru, running a toe along the wood slats of the porch. She could still sprint backward, hop in the car, and get a tourniquet on what was left of her ego... but she was finally talking to <b><i>Mike</i></b>! The conflicting imperatives made Hotaru want to split herself down the middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Umm, you're working on a triple, Tomoe,\" said Mike, pointing at the street. Hotaru looked over her shoulder, saw Candy and Gem hopping into the limo with her clothes, and heard their shrieky laughter as the chauffeur peeled out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Hotaru whirled around with a betrayed yelp, realized the welcome mat's utility had slipped to 'dubious,' and spun back to face Mike. All her energy was wrapped up in blushing from head to toe, so she didn't wake the entire neighborhood with the screech she was entitled to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Why not come inside, I'll give you one of my brother's shirts, and he can give you a ride home when he's back from his date,\" Mike suggested, sounding supernaturally reasonable for someone who'd just been fully mooned. Hotaru was too busy turning crimson to acknowledge, just then. It did wonders for her pallor, and complemented the doormat nicely as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Finally...</span></div></div>",

As they entered his home, Hotaru continued to hold the welcome mat in front of her, to keep her front covered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mike... I'm sorry about all of this...\" she suddenly whispered as they entered the living room. Mike stopped, and turned to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright Hotaru,\" he smiled nicely, \"It's not your fault your double dare was this extreem,\" Hotaru blinked. Mike was being so nice to her, which was a big reliefe. The last thing she ever wanted was for the guy of her dreams to be mad at her, and tell her otherwise, while she was naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before she could say anything, she heard a small bark, and looked down at her feet, only to see a little pug dog looking up at her with confused eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, did I forget to introduce you guys?\" Mike laughed, \"How rude of me!\" As he said this, he bent down, picked the little pug up, and held it in front of Hotaru's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hotaru, may I introduce you to the family dog, Princess,\" He stated happily, while Princess started to sniff at Hotaru, before licking her face, making the young girl giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you Princess,\" Hotaru smiled, and pet her with one hand while the other kept the mat in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Mike set the little dog down, Hotaru looked to her left, and noticed that there were some pictures on the wall. She stared at them for a moment, until it hit her... He, and his older bro were in pictures with there parents until they were five... but the rest, were just of him and his brother... none of the others had his parents in them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mike?\" she whispered timidly. She saw him nod once, telling her to continue. \"How come your parents aren't in any of the pictures with older selves of you and your brother?\" As soon as her question was out in the open, Mike sighed, and looked at his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're... dead,\" he whispered in a low sad voice. Hotaru gasped, and covered her hands over her mouth, not even noticing the mat had now fallen from it's position, making Princess grab it, and pull it away, exposing her naked body all the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I'm so sorry,\" she said in a hushed voice, while still not knowing of the fallen mat. \"What hapenned to... No, you don't have to tell me if you...\" She stopped her sentence as she saw him raise his hand up, telling her to stop, and lift his head up, not realizing he could now see the rest of her naked body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright... I don't mind you asking,\" he whispered, looking directly into her eyes, \"it happened when I was only six, and my brother Chris was sixteen... We were visiting our grandparents in Flordia for the week, and we were just reaching Japan when... when the engine exploded...\" he paused for a moment, to take a deep breath, before continuing while still looking into her eyes, \"everyone on the plane was freaking out... while my parents and brother went to see if there were any parechutes we could all use... unfortunetly... there were only two of them, and our parents made us use them... so we could live... At first we didn't wanna leave them, but they made us.... after we jumped.... the plane... exploded...\" He stopped there as he felt tears come to his now closed eyes. They snapped open when he felt someone wipe the tears from his, seeing it was Hotaru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks...\" he whispered again. Hotaru just smiled a little and nodded her head once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway...\" He stated while he started going towards the staircase, STILL not realizing Hotaru didn't have the welcome mat covering her front, \"Stay right here, and I'll go get you something to wear,\" Hotaru nodded once again, and returned to looking at the pictures. Just as he got to the stair case, he found Princess there as well, chewing on something. Mike picked it up with couriousness in his eyes, before realizing what he was holding...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh.... Hotaru?\" He asked, while looking at her, NOW realizing she was totally exposed. Hotaru averted her eyes away from the pictures, and look towards Mike, only to see he had a hand over his eyes, and the other hand holding out.... the now slobbery welcome mat! Hotaru squeaked, and looked down at herself, before squeaking louder, seeing her naked body not covered at all, and covering herself with her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess... you dropped this....\" He said, with his eyes still covered, \"I'll be right back with something, just cover yourself the best you can,\" With that said, Mike carefully went up the steps, with his eyes covered still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHotaru couldn't believe it... during that coversation... she dropped the mat, and was... totally naked right in front of Mike! Her face reddened, but was thanking the lords that Mike was super nice, and covered his eyes when he finally noticed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This...\" Hotaru whispered, while standing there with her left arm covering her chest, and right hand covering the EMBARASSING part, \"is one night, I know I won't forget...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later....</span></div></div>",

A minute later, she saw him coming down, but he didn't have any clothes with him..... only a phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...\" Mike whispered, while continuing to go towards Hotaru, \"It's alright bro, we'll be fine... good-night,\" After that good-night, Mike hung the ceel phone up, and sighed deeply, while shaking his head sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is everything alright Mike?\" Hotaru asked in worry, but hoping she was wrong about there being something wrong. Her hopes were dwittled when he looked at her and shook his head no.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... that was my big brother... a huge snowstorm just started a few minutes ago while we were talking and thanks to that... all the roads have been closed off, meaning my brother can't get home tonnight...\" Hotaru gasped a little, which made Mike open the curtain a little to show that the snowstorm WAS a huge one, and was coming down fast!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Mike closed the curtain, Hotaru was about to ask why he hadn't brought any clothes down for her, but he continued again, \"And what's worse... my bro did all of his laundry today..... and he used to much detergent...\" to prove his point, he held up, what appeared to be a Ken sized doll's sweater, \"So I'm sorry Hotaru.... but you're stuck here for the night.... with no clothes...\" After he finished his sentence, Hotaru let out a small gasp, while going all red in the face. She was stuck at Mike's house for the night?.... All of the clothes that would've fit her had shrunk?.... SHE HAD TO SPEND THE NIGHT THERE NAKED?!?!?!?!?!!?!?!?!?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-It's alright Mike...\" Hotaru comforted him, trying to make it sound like she didn't mind, \"It's not-,\" She stopped mid sentence, as she sneezed loud.

A few minutes later, they reached a black and blue colored door, and when he opened it, Hotaru gasped in shock, STILL keeping her hand and arm in place. She was looking at the biggest bathroom in the history of bathrooms!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can take a bath in the jacuzzi... it'll warm ya up....\" Mike smiled as he lead her to the huge jacuzzi. She was amazed at the size of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My aunt is super rich, and she always gives us soo much money...\" Mike explained, while turning it it, \"I'll leave ya alone now, so I can call your parents and tell them that you're here tonight... don't worry,\" he assured her, when he saw her worried face, \"They already know me as a friend of yours from school right? So they'll know I'm okay...\" Hotaru nodded, \"okay, have a nice soak!\" Mike called as he left the room, and closed the door behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHotaru sighed for a moment, before removing her arm and hand from what they were covering, and slipping into the hot water of the jacuzzi.

She looked in the panorama mirror and, after a moment's hesitation, borrowed what she hoped was Mike's comb to neaten her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   There was a tap at the door, and Hotaru stepped over to open it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"It's Gem,\" said Mike, passing his phone to Hotaru once he saw she was wrapped in a towel. \"She doesn't believe you're here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Hotaru courteously gave Gem (and Candy, both fighting for the phone) enough info to let them know she <i>wasn't</i> caught in a blizzard; they hadn't inadvertantly doomed a double-dared friend to becoming a popsicle. Hotaru's tone was a little chilly, given they'd ditched her, advancing to icy dismissal once her awestruck friends accepted she was <b>actually at</b> Mike's house (<b><i><span class=\"cpink\"><span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms, cursive\">NAKED</span></span></i></b></span>!!!) and started pressing for every titillating detail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"They probably won't call back,\" Hotaru apologized, giving Mike his phone. \"I'm sorry about dripping all over the place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Hotaru's big, purple towel, wonderfully absorbent, slid free and puddled around her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"I'm going to go fix us something to eat,\" said Mike, spinning so quickly he must have dislocated something. \"Those towels can be kinda slick. Is pizza OK? I'll just fix a little of everything...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Mike was out the door before ending his anxious ramble, Hotaru smacking her forehead over the towel gaffe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   She spent a long time trying to figure out a way to make the big towels work, but they respectfully declined. Hotaru had never dealt with towels that were both fluffy <b>and</b> slippery, but here they were. Wrapping up and tucking under an arm wasn't working, any more than a toga fold or a determined two-towel swaddle. Once Hotaru moved or took a step, her careful effort wound up warming her ankles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"I might as well get back the welcome mat,\" Hotaru groused, finding she could manage if she kept a tight grip with one hand. She wiped up any water she'd dripped using a hand towel and went to find Mike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Hotaru saw Princess just inside the kitchen door, eating some kibble. Mike was busy covering countertops with food. Hotaru stood and gaped, getting a fresh grab on her towel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"I wasn't sure what you'd want, so...\" Mike said, gesturing. Four different pizzas, two bowls of chips (tortilla and potato) with two sides of dip, poppers, chimichangas, egg rolls, and a pair of Dagwoods slugging it out on a plate. Hotaru didn't know if he was inviting her to eat or indicating a prospective wardrobe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Thanks, Mike,\" said Hotaru, not sure how to comment. His industriousness must mean he was still a little uptight about her... clotheslessness. \"Maybe a slice of the spinach and mushroom, and...\" She got moving before Mike could point out the constellation of beverages in his intimidating Gorenje.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   The two took turns loading plates, giving the occasional glance of concern at the snowstorm outside before...</div></div>",

As the two talked, Princess had finished chowing down on her kibble, and was now looking for some to play with. She grunted, seeing nothing good, but than her eyes caught the sight of Hotaru's towel, which was now being held in place by her arms. Thinking of how she had played with others such as that one, made the puppy want to play with the one she saw now. So as the two teens continued there conversation, Princess quietly walked over to where Hotaru was sitting, grabbed onto the slick towel with her mouth, and slowly began tugging at it. Since it was soo slick, Hotaru didn't even feel it slowly unravaling from her, as she and Mike continued with there conversation. After a few good tugs, Princess than gave off a huge tug, making the towel snap off Hotaru's body, and cover the puppy instead. Panting happily at her work, Princess, grabbed the towel in her mouth, and left the room to go somewhere else, to chew it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

Go sit down on the couch, while I start bringing out the food and drink,\" Hotaru knew she was beaten, so she just smiled and nodded, before going out to the living room, holding the slippery towel as tightly as she could. As soon as she got out there, however, the towel slipped out of her hands, and into a puddle around her feet. Blushing, she quickly grabbed the towel, and wrapped herself in it quickly before Mike came in with the pizza's first. She smiled at him as she sat down, which he returned, before going back out to bring out the rest of the delicious junk food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, we;re all set,\" Mike stated five minutes later, the junk food and soda littering the entire coffee table, which was huge. Sitting down beside Hotaru, he asked, \"What do you wanna watch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm.... I dunno,\" she answered quietly, \"You decide, but please don't make it scarry,\" Mike smiled, knowing the perfect movie. Getting up, he went over tot he dvd player, and placed in a disk, before going back to the sofa and sitting down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you pick?\" Hotaru asked quietly, while trying to keep the towel up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess bride,\" he smiled, while turning on the TV, \"It's one of my personal favorites,\" he added while the credits rolled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mine too!\" Hotaru said in shock.

They were like that for a moment, before they turned there attention back to the movie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf way through the movie, Princess came into the room, and noticed Hotaru's towel end. It was swaying a little as Hotaru kicked her legs a little like a small child, making it look fun to tug on. As the two teens continued to watch the movie, Princess went over to the swaying towel end, grabbed it quietly, and tugged. Surprizingly, the towel was soo slick, that Hotaru didn't even feel it being tugged off her slowly. Finally, in a great big tug, Princess managed to pull the towel clean off of Hotaru, and scamper away with it quietly, leaving Hotaru completely naked once again, but this time, she didn't know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the kiss scene, Hotaru and Mike got closer, both snacking on a slice of cheese pizza.

Hotaru ducked behind the couch and looked around for her towel, deciding Princess had sandbagged her, once more. That dog was sneaky!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"So are you up for another Elwes?\" Mike asked, ignoring Hotaru's discomfiture in an attempt to take the sting out of it. \"'The Crush,' maybe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Past blushing, they could still grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Or stick with Reiner?\" Mike asked. \"'The Sure Thing'?

Through the swinging door, she popped out and winked before ducking back for more pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Mike blinked, tugged at his jeans for 'adjustment,' and went to check the thermostat. If Hotaru became a handful, how would this end up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Peeking through the curtains his guest had previously lolled in, Mike saw a foot of snow on the ground. And more coming down!

As he did, a thought entered his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It'd probably be best if all the lights were off... Even though the windows are soon to be completely covered, a little darkness would probably be nice,' nodding once, Mike got up once more, and killed the lights, before going back over to the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, Hotaru came back, holding a pizza pie in one hand, while the other held a large pillow in front of her front.

Mops, sponges, rags, cleaning fluid... feather dusters. And there were two still in plastic! He grabbed both and went back to standing by the kitchen door, losing his nerve the longer he considered how Hotaru might react when she saw what he'd brought back for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mike, do you want anything?\" Hotaru called from inside the kitchen. How best to answer <i>that</i> one?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks, Hotaru, I'm fine,\" Mike responded, biting back the first thing he'd meant to say.

A half step would be worse than the whole enchilada.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike got out of his clothes faster and more quietly than he would have thought possible, the room getting <b>very</b> warm as he stood naked waiting for Hotaru to step back in. He arranged the wrapped dusters in such a way that she wouldn't immediately flip out when she saw him. He hoped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to look like a pot-bellied pig by the time...\" Hotaru muttered through a mouthful of pizza as she stepped back into the living room, coming to a dead stop when she saw Mike. Her eyes widened, and she swallowed hard when the swinging door smacked lightly against her rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why should you have all the fun?\" Mike asked, smirking and trying to look casual. He could feel himself blushing from head to toe, Hotaru joining him in that condition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Begin!\" said Mike, before the moment fizzled. He tossed a feather duster to Hotaru, who unthinkingly caught it, dropping her throw pillows. Mike peeled the plastic off his duster and threw it aside, poking at Hotaru's middle with the blue feathers. This broke her paralysis, as she stopped considering whose nakedness to be more embarrassed by and twitched away with a gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're using Bonetti's defense against me?\" asked Mike, shooing her into the living room.

She parried Mike's lunges, the plastic handles of their feather dusters cracking together, trying to keep up with him... while simultaneously trying to get a better look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naturally, you must expect me to attack with Cape Ferro,\" Mike said, stooping to go after her ankles, Hotaru leaning forward to run a mass of pink feathers along the back of his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naturally! But I find that Thibault cancels Cape Ferro, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHotaru punctuated this by sitting on the back of the couch and tucking her legs, flipping over and landing near the TV. It gave Mike enough of a view to hesitate and gulp. Wow!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hotaru, I've gotta say...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Unless the enemy...'\" Hotaru whispered at him from the other side of the couch, nodding to prompt him along. She was more concerned with him getting the line right than covering herself -- which, actually, she wasn't trying to do <i>at all</i>, now. Mike brushed the back of his 'sword' hand across his mouth, positive he was drooling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... 'Unless the enemy hasn't studied his Agrippa - which I have!'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike somersaulted over the couch, thinking he was going to flub it and smack into the coffee table. Instead, he landed right in front of Hotaru, who expressed her admiration by tucking her duster under an arm and clapping... and patting him on the back!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHotaru yanked her hand away after realizing she'd unconsciously made direct physical contact, but she didn't appear too distressed about it. Biting her lip, she looked more intent on having a closer look at Mike out of the corner of her eye. Spotting his clothes heaped on a nearby chair, she kept cutting her glance between these and Mike himself, trying not to smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you grinning about?\" Mike demanded, smiling as he lightly feathered Hotaru's undefended chest.</span></div></div>",

Why not just take a deep breath and come on out here? It's just us, and how about this? If you do come out here, I'll take off my clothes again so you won't feel so embarassed... but if you still want another towel, I have one here for you,\" he stated cooly while holding up the black towel he got for her, making Hotaru blush like mad! Did Mike just ask her to walk around here like she was still clothed, but wasn't! She didn't want to not cover herself in front of the man she loved... but than again, she WAS use to seeing her without clothes now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does she do? What does she do?!</span></div></div>",

I think I will,\" said boy blinked in surprise at the answer he got. He sure wasn't expecting that answer!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously?\" the only reply he got was a small giggle, before the lovely black haired beauty stepped out from behind the sofa with her arms still covering her private places. After a moment of her standing there, Hotaru than took a deep breath and let her arms fall to her sides, showing her naked self completely to her crush for the first time, who looked as though his nose would start bleeding soon, though after a moment looked like he was gonna be just fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No worries Mike,\" said boy was shook out of his stare when the girl of his dreams started talking again, \"you don't need to undress just to make me feel better,\" the only reply the girl got from the stunned boy was a nod, before said boy began moving towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hotaru....\" he began once he stopped in front of the bare girl, \"there's..... there's something I've been meaning to tell you... for awhile now... I just haven't had the guts to do it, until.... until you trusted me with seeing you like this....\" before she could ask what he ment,  the girl of Saturn let out a shocked squeak when her crush grabbed her around the waist, and had them in the famouse romantic dip position with her on bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ever since I first laid eyes on you... when I first transfered to your school..... I thought you were the most beautiful girl I'd ever laid eyes on,\" hearing this made Hotaru gasp as she wrapped her arms around his neck, forgetting the fact that he was holding her while she was naked but he was still clothed, \"as we continued to pass each other in the hallways.... I wanted to talk to you so bad, but..... I just got shy and didn't know what to say to you....\" Hotaru was sure her whole face was red now. Was Mike saying.... what she thought he was saying?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To be honest,\" he continued, \"I didn't know I could trust you at first, or anyone for that matter..... but after we both let each other in: me with my parents, and you with your.... bareness.... I knew you were the one. So... what I'm trying to say is.... I.... I love you, Hotaru,\" before the startled girl could reply, Mike lifted her up in a bridal style position and kissed her lips oh so softly. Hotaru was sure by now her whole body was a lovely shade of red when Mike picked her up like that and kissed her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'He... he said he loves me!' she thought to herself excitedly, before coming back to her senses. Closing her eyes, she gently tightened her arms around his neck and kissed him back just as softly. It was amazing! His lips were so soft and smooth, and he was holding her like she was a crystal doll. Sadly though, the need for air became great to both teens as they sadly broke apart, but kept there foreheads touching as they panted heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mike... I-I love you too,\" Hotaru gasped out, making said boy look at her with wide, happy eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriosuly?\" he gasped out, his hold on her tightning a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.... ever since I first saw YOU. I just... didn't know you felt the same way about me to be honest,\" hearing this made the boy chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't feel bad. I felt the same way remember?\" hearing this made the girl of Saturn giggle, before she started shivering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay?\" Mike asked in worry, before his eyes widened when he remembered about being snowbound and noticed how it suddenly got a little cold in there, \"Oh man! I totally forgot we were snowbound! And with you being naked.... this is bad!\" Mike held his girl closer to keep her warm as he began to think of options to keep her warm. After a moment, he came up with two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, here's what we can do,\" he whispered to his love, making the shaking girl look up at him, \"we have a heated indoor swimming pool down below with an even warmer jacuzzi. You can get warmed up in either of them,\" before she could say a word, Mike carried Hotaru towards a door on there left, and opened it to reveal a staircase that lead down below. Making sure Hotaru was in a nice hold in his arms, Mike than carried her down the steps which lead to the underground pool and jacuzzi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*two minutes later*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we are,\" Mike stated, snapping the naked girl in his arms out of her sleeping daze as he flicked on the light switch. Once on, Hotaru gaped in shock at the HUGE underground swimming pool in front of them, which was shallow on one end, and got deeper on the other end. Not only that, but it had a beautiful glass bottom, which showed reflections perfectly. Closer to the deep end was a nice looking jacuzzi, which seemed big enough to fit ten people!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.... when you said your aunt gave you too much money, you weren't kidding!\" Hotaru said in astonishment, making Mike blush a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, to be honest, the heated underground pool and jacuzzi was her idea.... I never thought they'd be needed for emergency's like this... but now I'll keep it in mind!\" Hearing this made the girl of Saturn playfully punch him in the shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So.... which one would my lovely girlfreind like to warm up in?\" Mike continued in a teasing voice, \"would my lady like to go skinny dipping in the pool... or in the jacuzzi?\" hearing the skinny dipping part made the naked girl blush, but just giggled after a moment, before getting a thoughtful look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I choose....\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Hmm.... I think I'd like to try the heated pool. After all, I did fall asleep in the jacuzzi in your bathroom a while back,\" Hotaru finally stated, her statement causing both her and Mike to laugh. After the laugh, Mike slowly walked over to the entrance of the pool, his eyes never once leaving Hotaru's face as he carried her there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'She's so beautiful,' </i>he thought to himself, looking at her cute face with love in his eyes, <i>'How I ever got so lucky to meet someone as precious as her, I'll never know,' </i>was all he could think before he realized that he reached the entrance of the pool. Carefully, he kneeled down, and lowered his precious cargo into the warm water slowly. After she was in, he slowly let go of her, neither of them even blushed when his right hand accidently grazed her right breast as he withdrew from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that,\" Mike stated after she was fully in the water, his eyes practically glued to her face. Hotaru couldn't help but smile. Here she was, standing in a heated pool, fully naked in front of her cru-no. Her <b>BOYFRIEND</b>, and all he was looking at was her face. He wasn't even glancing down once at her breasts, which were not submirged in the water as she stood in the shallow end of the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok, it was an accident,\" she finally stated, before pecking his lips quickly. Once she did, Hotaru than winked at Mike, before ducking under the water. All that could be seen now was a shadow figure now swimming to the deeper end of the pool. Mike stood there for a moment, a finger on his tingling lips, before chuckling to himself. After that, however, he realized that he should now put Princess in her 'room for the night if he was planning to stay up with Hotaru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Hotaru! I'm gonna go upstairs quick to put Princess in her room, than I'll be back down, alright?!\" he shouted when Hotaru's head popped up to the surface at the other end of the pool while the rest of her body was sumerged in the relaxing warm water. Hotaru merely nodded, before blinking when her boyfriend suddenly pulled out a small hand towel out of nowhere and placed it near the stairs of the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To wipe off your face when you get out!\" Was all Mike shouted before heading up the stairs to the house above. Hotaru giggled at his action, before suddenly diving back down underneath the water. As she swam in the warm water of the deep end, Hotaru took this time to think herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'At first I was mad at my friends for ditching me here without clothes.... but now, it seems like I have them to <b>THANK </b>for all this. Thanks to this dare.... Mike's now my boyfriend!' </i>She would've giggled if she weren't deep underwater. After the thought, Hotaru suddenly glanced over to the side of the pool. The walls and bottom of the pool were so shiny, they were like mirrors! Speaking of which, Hotaru swam a little closer to look at her reflection. Her hair was swaying around some, even as she swan in place, but that wasn't what she was looking at. She was looking at.... her whole self. From top to bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'I still can't believe this,' </i>She thought after a moment, placing her right hand on the wall of the pool to touch her reflection, <i>'I... I'm <b>NAKED</b>. I'm actually <b>NAKED </b>at Mike's.... and I don't care... because of this dare, I found out he loves me, but NOT because he gets to see me naked..... because of the person I am.... just like I love him for him.....'</i> Hotaru than smiled at her reflection, before going back to swimming around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'He's lucky I trust him with seeing me.... because I <b>NEVER </b>want any other man seeing me like this.... only Mike can see me like this,'</i> Was the last thing she thought, before going up to the surface for new air so she could continue to swim underneath. Unfortunatly for Hotaru though.... both she and Mike were going to get a <b>VERY </b>unexpect visitor very soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! I can finally see Mike's house!\" A young male's voice stated out from the harsh blowing storm of white. It wasn't long before you could see someone walking on top of the heavily covered ground with snow shoes, his body covered in a black snow suit, and face not seen being covered by the googles and huge hat. After a moment more of walking, he came to where the attic window was, which was now where the snow was actually at, before pulling a credit card out of a pocket on his suit. Once he did, he slide it in between the flaps, unlocking the window, before quickly opening it and going inside the warm house. Once inside, the mysterious figure quickly shut the window closed, and locked it tightly with not only the lock on the window, but with a combination lock as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man! I thought I was toast for sure when it started snowing that bad on my drive home! Who knew my grandpa's old snow shoes in my trunk would come in so handy?\" was the first thing that came out of the mysterious man's mouth, before he started to remove his snow gear. First removing the snow shoes and boots from his feet, than his black coat, and bulky snow pants along with his thick gloves. Finally, he removed his googles and hat, revealing a teenaged boy's face. Once he was done, the intruder picked up his wet things and began to leave the attic, while snow started to cover the attic window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Good thing I can always count on Mike and Momo for letting me stay here whenever I need to.... and maybe I can finally help him find a girlfriend!' </i>the stranger thought with a perverted grin on his face when he was suddenly swamped with thoughts of hot girls... but not just any thoughts. As he finally reached the first floor of the house to place his wet things in front of the door, he began thinking with a huge perverted grin on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Man wouldn't that be the ultamite christmas wish come true! The only thing better than seeing a hot girl.... is seeing her <b>NAKED</b>!!!' </i>at this thought while placing his wet things on the ground, his nose began to bleed heavily.... which always seemed to happen when he got thoughts like those. After calming himself a little, the stranger turned around to look for his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"MIKE!! YA HERE?!\"</b> he began shouting, before seeing all the junk food spread on the coffee table in front of a turned on TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'He's here alright.... but where could he-,</i>' \"<b>DUH</b>! He's swimming in the heated pool! Man, that's gotta feel good at this time!!\" he suddenly stated out loud, before heading over to the door that lead to the underground pool, jacuzzi, and much more. Once he opened it, the stranger wasted no time in starting his walk down the steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*short time skip* <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, he reached the final step. The intruder was immedatly warmed by the warm vaporized water in the air, and was greatful because it was much better than being chilled to the bone. Looking over at the pool, the intruder gave a toothy grin at the sight of a shadowy figure swimming around in the pool. Thinking it was his friend, he walked over to the entrance of the pool, where there was a small hand towel on the railing. As he walked over, the shadowy figure swimming in the pool also went to where the ladder.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You see, it started storming when I went out for a drive, and before I knew it, I..... I...... I...... I....... I.......\" during mid sentence, the mysterious intruder opened his eyes to look at who he thought was his friend... only to start studdering mid sentence at the sight before him. Instead of seeing Mike standing at the entrance to the pool..... it was a girl.... but the fact that it was a girl wasn't what was making him stutter. What was making him stutter, as he started at the girl slowly wiping her face off with the small hand towel, was that the girl was.... she was.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'N-N-NAKED!!!!! GIRL!!! NAKED!!!!!.... NAKED!!!!! GIRL!!!!! IN FRONT OF ME!!!!!' His mind kept repeating at the speed of light while his eyes grew larger at what he only dreamed of staring at.... and his nose began to gush blood as if it was a river. As this happened, Hotaru didn't seem to notice that the person if front of her wasn't Mike, due to the towel on her face as she wiped it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were right Mike! The heated pool was nice! I didn't think I'd get out, until..... I..... saw you......\" before she finished her sentence, Hotaru had removed the small hand towel from her face, only to see that who she was talking to WASN'T Mike, but SOMEONE SHE DIDN'T KNOW!!! She blinked when his open mouth began to grow into a LARGE smile, but immediatly blushed at seeing him looking right at her. Rather slowly, she followed the path of his eyes, only to gasp in horror while her blush grew darker. He-He was staring at.....!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*short time jump back*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok! Now that Princess is in her room for the night, I can spend all my time with Hotaru! Hmm... maybe I should bring the junk food down,\" Mike suddenly said to himself when he reached the bottom step. Nodding to himself, he made his way to the kitchen, but just before he entered, he stopped and looked over at the door, where there was a heep of wet snow clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Those aren't mi-\" Mike began to say outloud, before his eyes widened at the sight of a pair of old snow shoes next to the wet clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know whos those are ANYWHERE!\" Mike stated outloud again, before his eyes widened in horror, \"OH MAN!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"HOTARU!\" at the sudden scream, Mike wasted no time in rushing as fast as he could to the entrance, down the steps, and finally into the main area of his home's secret underground heated pool. Once there, he gaped at the sight before him. On the ground, was a teen who looked to be maybe a year older than both him and Hotaru, with a HUGE bump on his head. Despite the bump, the intruder was looking up at the ceiling with huge eyes, smiling widely, and his nose was gushing out lood as if it was a river. In front of the perv stood Hotaru with her right fist out, and was doing her best to cover herself with her left arm sheilding her bare breasts, and her leg crossing over her other part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Out of all the people in the world that could come to my house in this weather, why was it HIM of all people?\" Mike muttered out. Hotaru gasped at the familure voice, finally opening her eyes. Seeing it was Mike, she immediatly ran to him, covering her private parts when she ran past the intruder, than uncovering and rushing into her boyfriend's outstretched arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MIKE! I thought he was you.... and it wasn't you but him.... and..... and.... HE SAW ME NAKED!\" Hotaru cried out against his chest while the two hugged the other as hard as they could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry Hotaru.... it's alright now though, I'm here,\" he whispered in her hair while hugging her close to him, not minding the fact that her breasts were crushing to his chest as she held him tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-who do you think he is?\" Hotaru asked five minutes later after she finally calmed down enough to talk, but still refusing to let go of her boyfriend. Mike sighed at this question, his hold on her tightning a little while he began to massage the smooth skin of her bare back to calm her down some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunatly, this is someone who STILL thinks he's my friend, when I keep telling the dude practially every chance I get that we're NOT friends in anyway, shape or form. The dude even thinks he can stop by whenever HE wants, even though we threaten to call the police on him each time he somehow gets into our place. He's Stuart, from school. Remember all those times the principle was making a big sceen each time he sent Stuart to his office for detention or suspencion?\" at hearing this made a huge bell ring in Hotaru's head, as she glanced over in horror at the unconcious teen by the entrance of the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>(Ok, just wanted to take a moment to describe of not only what Stuart looks like, but what Mike also looks like, since I kinda forgot to mention that when this whole thing started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStuart: Curly light brown hair, copper eyes, thin red glasses, freckles all over face, slightly husky, wearing white t-shirt with pocket on front, plad pants, and clogs. Basically he's like a perverted nerd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike: Smooth black hair that looks soft to the touch and always kept in a somewhat messed up style that makes him look hot, electric blue eyes, slightly muscular, wearing black shirt with a red pattern that looks like a lion scratch, black jeans with some chains on them, and black and white running shoes. Basically, he's the hot guy, as probably been stated before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk! So there ya have it! Not only what Stuart looks like, but what Mike looks like! Ok! Back to the show!)</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait? You mean he's STUART the PERVERT?\" Hotaru questioned after she thought in a moment of silence. How could she not reconize him before? ALL the girls at school knew about him, and his perverted ways! He once tried to spy on the girls swim team as they came back from practice to change and shower off, but was caught by a girl who dropped something. He was caught in the girls locker room from gym grabbing as many bras as he could fit into hid backpack. There are many more stories, but it would take forever to tell them all.There was a rumor going around that Stuart's mom and dad made the most money donations to the school and always threatened to stop IF they ever expelled there boy, but even so, it's a wonder how they STILL LET HIM of all people, stay in school with all his attemps took not only look at girls naked, but steal there clothes as well! Luckily though, all those attempts in the past were huge failures, as he was always caught before he got the chance to get away with the stolen clothes, OR see just one girl naked.... until now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't beleive this! The biggest perv in school just saw me <b>NAKED</b>!\" Hotaru cried into her boyfriend's chest while her face began heating up at the thought of perv finally seeing something he's always wanted to see. Mike spoke gently to his girlfriend, smoothing her hair with one hand as he did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright, he won't see you anymore with me here,\" he whispered gently to her, earning a comforting sigh from his girlfriend. After a few more moments, Mike sigh again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should move him to the lounge so he doesn't start complaining to me when he wakes up why his ack hurts so much,\" even though sh didn't want to let go of him just yet, Hotaru managed to nod. Letting each other go, Mike went over to the knocked out nerd, while Hotaru immediatly crossed her arms over her breasts and her leg over her other part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*short time skip*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There. Now he won't complain,\" Mike stated after plopping the pervert on the soft couch of the underground loung. Once he did, he walked over to where Hotaru was standing in from of a box he and his bro had yet to open that went to her waist, her arms practially glued to her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He'll be out for awhile ya know, there's no reason to hurt yourself,\" Mike chuckled when he was standing next to her. Hearing this made Hotaru blink, before glancing wearily over at the pervert. She DID hit him hard when he wouldn't take his perverted eyes off her chest before hand. Looking back at her boyfriend, Hotaru than sighed in reliefe a little as she finally let her arms have a rest at her sides. Mike smiled at the sight of her trusting him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There ya go,\" he chuckled, his eyes once again glued to her face. She smiled back at him, before suddenly taking a small step forward, kissing him gently on the lips for being so kind. Once she let him go, it was her turn to giggle at his stunned expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that for?\" he asked after a moment of silence.She just giggled again, before answering him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For being the best boyfriend ever,\" at hearing this made Mike chuckle, before he pulled HER into a kiss, which she gladly returned. It felt so right to kiss him.... it was as if the kiss was telling her one day... he'd be the one to propose to her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch later, after the passionate kiss finally broke.....</span></div></div>",

Mike, knowing there was no way he could lie to her, took a deep breath before drooping his feather duster and taking a step forward towards Hotaru so that there was barely any space between them\u2026 as in her naked breasts nearly touching his bare chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGently, he took her face in both his hands and guided her so that they were staring deeply into each other\u2019s eyes.

Gently, she removed his hands from her face(the action slightly confusing the male) so that she may look away from him as her arms, upon reflex, very slowly shielded her bare breasts from his sight, while her left leg crossed over her other part slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA-are you just saying this\u2026. Cause I\u2019m\u2026 naked?\u201d she managed to whisper out softly in pain with a light red hue lighting her cheeks, thinking he was just caught up with seeing a girl with no clothes on\u2026 the thought making her unconsciously tighten her arms around her chest. Mike stared at her for a moment in shock\u2026 though he was not totally surprised that she had thought this\u2026 any other guy would probably be taking out his phone and snapping as many shots of her as possible\u2026 but he was not like the other guys, the ones who thought a woman was only beautiful\u2026 like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo Hotaru\u2026\u201d he finally managed to get out as he gently once again took her delicate face in between his hands to make her look at him again, her eyes widening upon seeing the raw emotions of kindness, longing, and\u2026. Passion?, mixed in those beautiful eyes of his\u2026 those same eyes that made her fall for him in the first place. Before she could ask what he meant, he continued:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not just saying you\u2019re beautiful because you\u2019re\u2026. naked.(the mention of that causing Hotaru to redden more as her arms tightened in their position) I\u2019m saying\u2026 YOU, Tomoe Hotaru, are beautiful because of your amazing personality that can make the coldest heart melt, your laugh that\u2019s so catching EVERYONE just starts to laugh as well, your smile that makes everyone stare at you as if you\u2019re a precious jewel, and your eyes\u2026. The most amazing shade of purple I\u2019ve ever seen that can easily show what you\u2019re thinking about\u2026 THAT\u2019S what makes you beautiful Hotaru...\u201d was what he told her while gently guiding her closer to him, his hands gently sliding from her face to gently wound around her thin, bare waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026\u201d Hotaru was at a loss for words as Mike spoke so\u2026 purely to her while pulling her towards him. He was describing her as if she was\u2026 an angel. Is this how Mike really saw her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his arms gently encircled her waist, her arms uncrossed from her chest, and took a new position around his strong neck\u2026 neither one even blushing the SLIGHTEST as her naked breasts crushed against his bare chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMike\u2026 I-\u201d Hotaru began to say, only to be silenced as he placed a finger on her lips, causing her to redden even more. Once he knew she wouldn\u2019t say anying, he removed his finger from her cute lips\u2026 and placed his own upon them, the action causing Hotaru to blush so deep in her cheeks, she probably looked close to a boiled lobster! Though after a moment\u2026. She slide her eyes closed just as he did, returning his kiss in full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018I-Is this REALLY happening?\u2019 Hotaru questioned in her mind as the kiss grew more passionate, \u2018Is Mike\u2026 REALLY kissing me? If this is a dream\u2026 I never want to wake up\u2026\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m finally doing this\u2026\u2019 Mike thought at the same time while gently sliding his tounge into Hotaru\u2019s moist wet cavern, \u2018I\u2019m kissing her\u2026 I\u2019m REALLY kissing her! She tastes even better than in my dreams\u2026\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kiss lasted for at least three minutes, before the need for air became too great for both teens, causing them to(sadly) separate. Both took a moment to catch their breath, their arms never breaking their hold on the other, before opening their eyes to stare at each other with a loving passion that was so intense, it could put an end to all war as we know it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHotaru\u2026\u201d Mike finally began after what seemed like forever with a huge stab of courage, \u201cI love you for YOU,\u201d hearing this made Hotaru\u2019s heart skip a beat, before a smile began to grow on her face. Getting courage herself, Hotaru raised herself on her tip toes in their hold, her naked breasts slowly going up his bare chest a little as she got her mouth to his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I love YOU for YOU Mike\u2026. I\u2019ve had for a long time,\u201d upon hearing this, Mike couldn\u2019t stop his own huge smile appearing on his face, his grip tightening on her a little and his heart pounding so loud, they both could hear it. They just stood there for a moment, smiling at each other with red hues glowing on both their cheeks, before Mike suddenly gave Hotaru a cheeky grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut ya know\u2026 you ARE pretty cute naked,\u201d he finished with that same cheeky smile as his eyes began to trail down to the familiar twins pressed again his chest, taking a small step back playfully as if he wanted to see them. After he stated this, her eyes grew as large as dinner plates with embarrassment as she watched as his eyes began to look down when he took that step back\u2026. He knew what he just made her realize. The two of them were still standing in their hold\u2026. Neither one of them wearing clothes\u2026. Her bare breasts once crushed again his chest were now-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKYA!\u201d Hotaru squeaked out cutely, her arms immediately unwrapping from around his neck, and once again immediately shielding her naked breasts from his sight once again before he got a good look at them, and her leg crossed over her other part. Her actions made the teen boy laugh, causing her to stare at him in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry Hotaru\u2026 but you\u2019re just soo cute!\u201d as he continued to laugh, he didn\u2019t realize that she was just NOW letting her gaze set on him\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2018I can\u2019t believe I forgot he\u2019s naked now too! Well\u2026 since I think we\u2019re boyfriend and girlfriend now\u2026 and since HE\u2019S seen me naked\u2026 countless times tonight,</i>\u2019 was the last thing she thought as she let her gaze roam him bare chest\u2026. One ALL of the girls have been wanting to see in school, but NEVER got the chance to\u2026 to the part the defined him as a man. As she set her gaze on it, her eyes and blush grew a little, before she found herself giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re pretty cute naked as well, Mike!\u201d she got out in between giggled, causing the laughing teenaged boy to snap outta his laugh and suddenly remember the situation HE put himself in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a, \u2018GAH!\u2019 of his own, he shot both hands to cover himself down there, and send a playful glare to Hotaru, who continued to giggle\u2026. Before he soon joined her, both their blushes starting to fade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment of laughs, the new couple looked up at each other with love in their eyes, before Hotaru suddenly gave a shy smile and shot a pointed look at his clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you should put your clothes back on Mike,\" she whispered softly.... feeling slightly unhappy inside that it would go back to being just HER naked again. Upon hearing this, Mike looked over at his clothes.... before sending her a sly smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, why should YOU get all the fun?\" he questioned his new girlfriend again, causing Hotaru to look up with shock as he closed the space between them again, looking directly in her eyes. Before she could retort, he gave her another playful grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell ya what.... I'll stay outta my clothes with ya.... on one condition.... neither of us shields ourselves anymore. We can see each other as many times as we like.... and this'll all stay between you and I,\" Hotaru felt as if she was about to faint.... not only would he get to see her.... but SHE would get to see HIM?! It was an opportunity of a lifetime! BUT, she didn't wanna make Mike do something he didn't WANT to do... though it DID seem like he really wanted to be naked with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long moment of silence....</span></div></div>",

Before he could retort, the scout of Saturn took a small step back with another deep breath\u2026 before lowering her arms and uncrossing her leg\u2026 letting her new boyfriend drink in the first real good sight of his new naked girlfriend. Even though she was a little embarrassed at the moment as he stared at her breasts with huge eyes and a red hue on his face, Hotaru managed to give off a small giggle, before taking his chin in her hand, and guiding his eyes back to hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell? Aren\u2019t you gonna drop your guard?\u201d she asked him softly, still mentally giggling at how he was probably wanting to stare at her again, before he snapped outta it with a shake of him head, and a grin on his own face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah, my bad,\u201d he retorted cheekily, before taking a step back himself. With the smirk still playing on his lips, Mike easily lowered his hands, letting his girlfriend now drink in the sight of HIM.  As she innocently stared, Mike couldn\u2019t help but let out another chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow Hotaru, I never thought YOU were a perv,\u201d he joked, making his girlfriend look back at his face with another deep red hue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-well this is only fair! Do you have any idea how many times you saw <b>ME </b>naked tonight?\u201d she retorted with embarrassment in her voice, her arms unconsciously going back to hide her chest\u2026. Only to be stopped by Mike who gently pinned them down on her sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNuh-uh, remember our deal? NO more covering up!\u201d Hotaru blushed a little at this reminder\u2026 but nodded all the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2018geez\u2026 if dad knew I was letting a boy see me naked\u2026 I don\u2019t think he\u2019d be too thrilled,\u2019</i> she thought in her mind with a blush, before she blinked as she was lead towards the couch by her boyfriend. Once there, he sat down before playfully pulling her down with him\u2026 making her bare bottom land on his lap, as his arms rewound around her waist. Hotaru wasn\u2019t sure just how much more she could take of this skin on skin contact before he whole BODY would look like a cooked lobster. I mean, sure he SAW her naked plenty times that night\u2026 but he never HELD her like this\u2026 it was more embarrassing now that HE was naked with her\u2026 though he didn\u2019t seem to have a problem with it as he stared into her beautiful face with a thoughtful look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-what are you thinking about?\u201d she managed to croak out, still embarrassed that she was sitting on his lap\u2026 unclothed. It felt soo\u2026 weird neither one being clothed when in this position. Hotaru thought it was such a cute gesture when a guy had his girl sitting on his lap\u2026 but then again, THEY were all wearing clothing\u2026 she and Mike weren\u2019t.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was just remembering when I first transferred to your school\u2026 when I first met  you,\u201d hearing his made the girl of Saturn\u2019s eyes widen in retort\u2026 her mind now going back to that fateful day of when the two crossed paths for the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*Flashback*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHotaru was just walking to school with her eyes shut\u2026 the wind slightly ruffling her school uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope today goes by fast\u2026. The last thing I want is to-ah!\u201d she began to state before a kid from behind ran into her and continued on his way as Hotaru began to fall towards the hard unforgiving ground below. Closing her eyes, she awaited to feel the pain that one would feel once they hit the cold cement ground\u2026 but it never came. Instead, she fell into something that was slightly hard, but soft at the same time, that smelled\u2026. Really good, and something strong snaked around her. Her eyes snapped open upon the contact, seeing her face pressed again a figures chest wearing the same school uniform... only it was for a male. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you alright?\u201d a voice from above her asked gently\u2026 a very hot sounding voice by the sounds of it. Looking up from the sea of faimilar colored fabric, Hotaru turned her face upward towards the face of the person who caught her\u2026 only to inwardly gasp\u2026 It\u2026 it was a guy she never saw  before\u2026 but he was just\u2026 beautiful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>(Ok, just wanted to take a moment to describe what Mike looks like, since I kinda forgot to mention that when this whole thing started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike: Smooth black hair that looks soft to the touch and always kept in a somewhat messed up style that makes him look hot, electric blue eyes, slightly muscular, wearing black shirt with a red pattern that looks like a lion scratch, black jeans with some chains on them, and black and white sneakers. Basically, he's the hot guy, as probably been stated before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk! So there ya have it! What Mike looks like! Ok! Back to the show!)</u></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cWoah. That was a close one. You alright?\u201d the stange, beautiful teenaged boy asked the awestruck girl as he carefully helped her up to her feet. Not able to find her words at the moment, the Scout of Saturn just nodded, a red blush now staining her cheeks. The beautiful guy gave her a gentle smile, his hold still continuing around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026 you got a name?\u201d he asked playfully, making the usual quiet girl snap outta her trance and nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM-My name is\u2026. H-Hotaru. Tomoe, Hotaru\u2026 Thank you\u2026. For saving me,\u201d she whispered out softly, her eyes never once leaving his electric blue eyes. The mysterious boy gave a soft chuckle before responding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThink nothing of it! I couldn\u2019t just let someone fall to the ground like that, so I was happy to help!\u201d after this was stated, both teens just stood in each others hold for a moment, neither one blinking\u2026. Before they both heard the loud bells of their school start to ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh man! I\u2019d better get going! I don\u2019t wanna be late for my first day!\u201d He stated in worry, before gently sliding his arms off the stunned girl as he made to run. Taking a moment, the boy stopped and turned to the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOH! MY NAME IS KATANA, MIKIO! MY FRIENDS CALL ME MIKE! NICE TO MEET YOU!\u201d was all he shouted before continuing his run to school. As soon as he disappeared from sight, Hotaru unconsciously placed her hands where his just were not too long ago with a huger red blush on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Mike\u2026\u2019 was all she had time to think, before she too was reminded of school, making her dash in the same direction he went in hopes of getting there before the next bell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*End Flashback</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026 and after that, we just kept seeing more and more of each other. It was kinda like a dream\u2026\u201d Mike whispered softly, snapping the girl outta her memory to look him in the eyes once again. Smiling gently, she took his face in between her soft little hands and made him stare directly in her eyes once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know\u2026 and everytime I saw you\u2026 I just wanted to say thank you once again for saving me from a nasty impact from the ground\u2026 but I could never find the words to do so\u2026\u201d Mike chuckled softly upon hearing this, before taking one of her hands in his to kiss the back of it softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou never needed to thank me Hotaru\u2026 your beautiful smile was thanks enough,\u201d the girl of Saturn smiled gently at this\u2026 though she still wanted to thank him a special way that she\u2019ll only thank HIM in. She was just about to think of a way\u2026 when an idea brushed her mind\u2026 the very idea making her blush a little harder now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cE-Even so\u2026\u201d she stuttered in a shy voice as her now slightly shaking small hands took both his slightly larger hands in both of them, \u201cI-I really\u2026 want to thank you\u2026 because you were the first guy to really care about me\u2026 who was always\u2026 so nice to me even though you knew very little about me\u2026 and so\u2026\u201d as she continued, she began to shakily lead both his hands toward her chest(turning them so that the palms were facing them as she did so), and before he could state or do anything to stop her\u2026 she closed her eyes, and placed his two hands\u2026 right on top of <b>both </b>her naked breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo say Mike was shocked was a HUGE understatement. Hotaru\u2026 HIS sweet innocent Hotaru\u2026 was letting him\u2026 touch her chest! As his eyes grew to the size of dinner plates and his nose began to leak a little blood\u2026 he was completely paralyzed as he now stared at where she kept his hands in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHotaru\u2026 why are you-?\u201d he began to choke out, only to quiet down when he looked up and saw her eyes open slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I love you Mike\u2026 and even though you said my smile was enough\u2026 I wanted to thank you in a way\u2026 I\u2019ll only let YOU be thanked in\u2026 so please\u2026 just-just enjoy it,\u201d with that said, Hotaru gently pushed his hands even more on her chest, the red on her face turning a shade darker now, matching his own dark red blush. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments, she finally let go of his hands, but didn\u2019t shoe them off\u2026 she wanted to let him know how much she trusted him, so she let him keep them on her twins for as long as he wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a moment to snap out of his paralyzed trance like state, Mike then\u2026.</span></div></div>",

After her giggle fest, Hotaru just smiled gently before wrapping her arms around his neck once more and resting her head on his slightly muscular bare chest, the action causing her boyfriend to stiffen for only a moment, before she saw a sly smirk return on his face as he wound his free arm around her bare waste\u2026 his hand momentarily groping her backside for a moment, making the scout of Saturn squeak in surprise, before sending a playful glare to her boyfriend, who acted like he did nothing wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c-continuing to fall, with no signs of stopping anytime soon,\u201d both teens heard the female weather reported say from the TV, for once tearing their gazes away from each other to hear what the lady had to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes folks, this snowstorm is the worst Japan has seen in centuries, and there appears to be no signs of stopping now OR in the nearby future. What\u2019s more, people are starting to become snowbound in their own homes, as the snow continues to rise. Our top guys here at Action News are telling us that we all might be trapped in our homes for a week or two at most, before the snow finally stops and starts to melt, so we advize everyone to stay indoors, keep their windows and doors locked up tightly, and do NOT go ou-\u201d was all the two bare teens were able to hear before Mike shut the power off in shocked silence. The two were quiet for a moment, before Mike cleared his throat and looked down at the stitchless girl still cuddled up on his lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess\u2026 we\u2019re gonna be stuck together for awhile\u2026\u201d was all he could manage to say\u2026 while Hotaru just continued to stare at the black TV screen. A week or\u2026 two?!\u2026 she was\u2026 she was gonna\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\u2018I\u2019M GONNA BE NAKED FOR TWO WEEKS\u2026 with MIKE?!\u2019 </b></i>Hotaru squeaked in her mind in shock, before blushing once more as she turned to look at her equally bare boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMike, you should-,\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot gonna happen Hotaru,\u201d Mike immediately cut her off with a stern look on his face before she could even begin, \u201cif you have to be naked during this whole thing\u2026 than so will I. We\u2019ll keep each other warm if we have to\u2026 and we have back up power and LOADS of food, so we\u2019re set!\u201d Hotaru gaped at her boyfriend in shock, not beliving that he was gonna be naked with her while they were trapped, before she squealed in shock as Mike suddenly got up from the couch while scooping her up with him bridal style.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow then\u2026 it\u2019s late*as if to prove his point, the clock struck three*, so I think it\u2019s time we went to bed to sleep,\u201d finishing his sentence, Mike than began to make his way upstairs with Hotaru(who was blushing beyond belief) secure in his arms. As he made his way up, he whistled loudly and it wasn\u2019t long before Princess was following the duo up the stairs, Mike\u2019s clothes laid forgotten down on the lounge chair next to the black towel he had gotten before for his lovely girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Three minutes later*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, here we are! My room,\u201d Mike stated as he kicked his door slightly to open his black and blue door with a huge poster of his favorite band Linkin Park. As he entered his sanctuary Hotaru, though still blushing as he continued to carry her bridal style, went agape as she looked around Mike\u2019s bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor starters, unlike most boy rooms, Mike\u2019s was\u2026 clean. Everything was in order, and so organized. The dark blue rub was a nice touch for his personality, and went well with his blue walls that held a few more posters of his fav bands, a picture of his brother , himself, and a few of his friends here and there. On one side of the room, right by the window(which had its blue curtains pulled back to show off the falling snow), stood a tall trophy cabinet with all his MOSTLY gold and silver trophies and medals he\u2019d won for his three favorite spots: Soccer, Running, and Basketball. On the other side of the window stood another chest, this one obviously for clothes\u2026 which were sadly all shrunk now thanks to Mike\u2019s older brother and his experiment with the washer and the new detergent that he used. In the center of the room stood a HUGE king sized bed with three big red pillows(one a body pillow, the other two regular ones) with a matching bed cover over top of it, that looked soo comfy and inviting. To the red of his bed was a brown nightstand that held another picture\u2026 this one of him, his brother, and his\u2026 mom and dad, while to the left held his closet\u2026 which was open, and ALSO out of clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStraight in front of the TV, right next to the door they just entered, was a HUGE 70\u201d plasma screen TV with all the gaming systems old AND new, along with a Blue Ray and DVD player and ANOTHER nice selection of video games AND movies in two separate racks on the OPPOSITE side of the TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow\u2026 you weren\u2019t kidding about your aunt giving you money,\u201d was the first thing Hotaru found coming out of her mouth as Mike strode into the room with his precious cargo still in his arms. Once at the bed, he laid her flat down on the soft plush bed, smiling gently into her wonderful purple eyes as her head gently hit the pillow, before he chuckled at her statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, yeah. She loves the two of us, and just wants to be sure that we\u2019re set financially ever since\u2026\u201d he began to trail off with a sad look in his eyes in memory of his parents, before he was snapped outta it when Hotaru gently began to stroke his cheek gently in hopes of soothing the young male. She succeeded as Mike gently took hold of her hand and smiled once again into her beautiful eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks,\u201d He whispered softly. Hotaru just gave him a small smile back, before she unexpectaly began to giggle uncontrollably. Mike raised an eyebrow in confusion, before looking down to the foot of the bed and found the reason his girlfriend was giggling. Princess, at some point when Hotaru was laid on the bed, had just up on the bed as well, and was now licking the soft instep of the sole of Hotaru\u2019s right foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPrincess, that\u2019s a bad girl!\u201d Mike immediatly stated as he saved his girlfriend by plucking up the small puppy, thus stopping the licking. Hotaru let out a sigh of relief once the dog was taken away from her foot, before giving her boyfriend another smile in thanks. He returned the smile, before starting for the door with Princess still in his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me just go put Princess in her room. I\u2019ll be back in a second,\u201d the stark naked boy stated to the lovely bare girl of Saturn, who took a moment to stare at his butt as he left her on the bed. Before he went out the doorway, however, he turned back to Hotaru and smirked slyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, and before I forget\u2026 there\u2019s something I\u2019ve been wanting to do for a little bit now,\u201d before she could ask what he meant, Mike quickly let his eyes glance down at the same naked breasts he\u2019d seen countless times that night(and even TOUCHED), and gave a playful wolf whistle, before going out of the room, leaving the now stunned girl there laying on the bed. Once he was out of the room, Hotaru took a moment to cover her breasts with her arms in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy father\u2026 is NEVER finding out about this\u2026 If he ever did\u2026 he\u2019ll start putting <b>CHAINS and LOCKS</b> on everything I wear!\u201d she squeaked in embarrassment, her eyes big and wide in shock at what had just happened. It was a minute later when Mike came back into the room, closed the door, and sat next to the still stunned girl, who was still laying down there with her arms crossed over her chest, as he looked upon her once again with a playful grin and stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought we agreeded that neither one of us were gonna cover up anymore?\u201d he stated playfully as his hands gently went to hers to lift them up.

Blushing again, Hotaru could only nod shyly as Mike gently lifted her arms up and placed them down by her sides. Once that was done, both teens took a moment to look each other in the eyes, before they BOTH started to giggle at how silly this whole situation had turned for them. One moment SHE was embarrassed, the next HE was the embarrassed one! Even though both teens were already starting to get use to this\u2026 it was only natural to be embarrassed when one was glancing at the other\u2019s naked body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they finally stopped giggling, the two then\u2026</span></div></div>",

It was still snowing, and there were still no signs of it stopping anytime soon. Man, of all the times the weather reports had to be right <b>WHY </b>was it now?! Even though he was greatly enjoying his time with Hotaru\u2026 apart of him also felt akward with his whole situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2018Man\u2026 if only my idea from earlier worked\u2026\u2019</i> he suddenly thought to himself as he was suddenly reminded of what he tried to do to clothe the naked girl in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*Flashback to earlier that night, right when Mike told Hotaru all the rest of the clothes in the house were now shrunk*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>(Ok, quick heads up. This is something that should\u2019ve gone into the chapter that\u2019s being mentioned, but at THAT moment in time wasn\u2019t thought of until NOW. Just wanted to clear that up.)</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike gave the shocked girl, who was still covering herself with her arm and hand as he stood before her, a sympathetic look\u2026 before an idea struck his mind. An idea that actually came from a movie he watched with his brother once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHotaru\u2026 this might be a longshot, but I have an idea\u2026 you have to trust me, alright?\u201d he suddenly stated to the embarrassed girl when he broke out from his idea to address her. The girl of Saturn just looked at Mike with a look of shock, before she nodded with a little gulp of anticipation. Taking a small step towards the girl, Mike then took both her arms and removed them from where they were<u>(Hotaru Squeaking <b>VERY </b>loudly at the fact that Mike could look at her if he wished\u2026 only to be shocked when she saw his closed eyes)</u> and placed her small hands on his shoulders. Once there, Mike removed his shirt and easily slid it onto her inside out. Once that was accomplished, Mike opened his eyes as Hotaru took a minute to blink as she stared at the slightly large muscle shirt now covering her petite frame from the edges of her shoulders<u>(it has a <b>WIDE </b>collar, well\u2026 wide for her, her being so petite and all that)</u> to mid thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d give ya my pants too\u2026 but you\u2019ve a smaller waist than me\u2026 and I don\u2019t wear belts. My aunt always said those things do nothing, so we were kinda forced to take her advice,\u201d Mike explained easily as he secretly enjoyed the sight of Hotaru in his shirt. With a small laugh of relief, Hotaru than turned her gaze back to Mike with happy eyes and a grateful smile plastered to her small face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you soo much Mike!\u201d she began happily\u2026 neither one noticing the shirt slowly beginning to slide more and more over the edges of her small shoulders, \u201cI\u2019m so glad I\u2019m not na-\u201d she was stopped mid sentence with wide eyes when she suddenly felt the feeling of fabric sliding down her body and into a puddle around her feet. Mike only barley glanced to the top of her bare chest before he once again shielded his eyes from the sight before him with a huge glowing blush on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>\u2018Please tell me what I think happened <b>DIDN\u2019T </b>happen,\u2019</u> Hotaru thought frantically as her eyes slowly glanced down to her body\u2026 only to scream in embarrassment at the sight of her nude form once again not covered by the shirt that was now in a puddle around her feet. Not wasting a moment, Hotaru once again shielded her bare breasts with her left arm, while her right hand went down to cover in between her legs. After a moment, Mike took a small peak out of one eye, only to sigh in relief when he saw she had covered herself again with her arms, before he gave another sad sigh as he reached a hand down to grab his shirt, which Hotaru had stepped out of, where it was now laying on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am so sorry Hotaru\u2026 I thought for sure that would work\u2026 but, you\u2026 you\u2019re just so much smaller\u2026 and my collar\u2026\u201d he began to say as he easily slide the shirt, right side out, back on his slightly muscular form. Hotaru just sighed sadly inwardly, with a huge glowing pink blush still staining her cheeks, <b>MEGA </b>embarrassed by the fact she was <b>NAKED </b>in front of the boy she was in love with\u2026 <b>AGAIN</b>, before giving him a gentle understanding look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-It\u2019s alright Mike,\u201d she began in a quiet whisper, \u201cit\u2019s not your-\u201c Was the last thing she got out before she suddenly sneezed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*End Flashback*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMike? Is everything alright?\u201d the young male snapped out of his train of thought when Hotaru suddenly called out to him. Looking down at the face of the young girl he fell hard for the very first day he caught her made him smile, which Hotaru returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah, everything\u2019s cool Hotaru\u2026 but I think it\u2019s time we went to sleep,\u201d Hotaru nodded in agreement at his statement, before she began to lift herself from her laying position on his bed\u2026 only to be stopped by the strong hands of her boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd just what do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d he asked her playfully with a raised eyebrow. Hotaru blushed a little at the contact of his hands on her bare shoulders\u2026 which was a little strange on account of how she let him touch her\u2026 chest beforehand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I\u2019m moving down to sleep on the floor,\u201d she answered quietly, only to blink in shock when Mike shook his head at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way, <b>YOU\u2019RE </b>taking the bed, while <b>I </b>take the floor,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut Mike, I can\u2019t do that! This is <b>YOUR </b>bed!\u201d Hotaru retorted in shock, only to be silenced once again when Mike shook his head once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt maybe <b>MY </b>bed, but my big brother always said you should let the <b>LADY </b>have the bed. And since you <b>ARE </b>a lady-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen let\u2019s share the bed!\u201d both teens suddenly quieted at the request Hotaru had just shouted out, before the girl of Saturn regained her thoughts while clearing her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I mean-\u201d she began while her hands gently took his off her shoulders, and then moved up a little to reach behind the pillow she was laying her head on(the action causing Mike to once again see her breasts, but this time, he politely turned away, though being so use to this by now, didn\u2019t even blush) and grab at the black body pillow behind that pillow, and placed it on the middle of the bed, making a makeshift divider for the two teens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-your bed is big enough for <b>BOTH </b>of us to use, right? So\u2026 of we just use your body pillow to keep us from\u2026 touching while we sleep\u2026 than we can <b>BOTH </b>sleep here,\u201d Mike blushed at the statement she just made, before sighing once again and nodded at the girl who was now settling back on the pillow on her side of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk. You win. Let me go grab us some blankets, and then we can go to bed,\u201d not waiting for a reply this time, Mike once again got off the bed and headed out of the room to go to the linin closet to get some extra soft and warm blankets for the both of them. As he left, he could feel Hotaru\u2019s eyes glued to his bottom and silently chuckled to himself. Even though it was a little embarrassing, Hotaru was right about one thing: He <b>HAD </b>seen her naked so many times that night he\u2019d lost count\u2026 so in a way this <b>WAS </b>only fair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHotaru, meanwhile, couldn\u2019t help but giggle softly to herself while Mike had gone to get the blankets. Oh, how jealous would ever girl at <b>SCHOOL </b>be if they all knew SHE was getting to see THE, Mike the Hottest Guy in School, <b>STARK NAKED</b>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2018Oh yeah\u2026 this is one experience I won\u2019t be forgetting anytime soon!\u2019</i> was the only thing she was able to think of, before she was brought back to reality when the lights suddenly went out\u2026 and she felt a soft warm midnight blue blanket being thrown overtop her nude form, covering her completely from neck to toes. Looking up, she saw Mike sending her a gentle smile, before he went over to his side of the bed to lay down. Once he did, he immediately pulled his own black blanket overtop <b>HIS </b>nude form, before once again looking over at her, overtop the large body pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNight\u2026 Hotaru,\u201d he stated jokingly, before turning to his side facing away from her and closing his eyes. Hotaru blushed once more that night, the red huge on her face slightly glowing in the dark room, before she smiled gently at the back of body facing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGoodnight\u2026 Mike,\u201d she whispered softly, knowing he barely heard heard because of the soft snores emitting from the boy, before turning herself away from him to face the window. Before sleep claimed her, Hotaru took a moment to gaze at the big heavy flakes of snow still falling outside\u2026 and coming down fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018These next two weeks\u2026 are gonna be interesting to say the least,\u2019 Was the last thing she thought, before she snuggled seep into the comfy mattress she layed on top of, and the warm blanket that covered her entire frame. It took only a minute before sleep finally claimed her as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*Six Hours Later, 9am*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as the bird clock(you know the ones that can help you learn about different kinds of birds) finished striking, the teen to wake up first was\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had to restrain the worst of her struggles to prevent tearing the curtains like tissue paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Princess was still happily licking away on Hotaru's feet, flipped tail wagging, when Mike appeared at the top of the stairs looking a little sheepish. His expression changed when he saw Hotaru tangled up in the drapery, giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Hey, Princess, knock it off!\" he called, moving down the stairs quickly, his eyes anywhere but on Hotaru. Hotaru winced and tried twisting around to provide a less scandalous presentation, which left her lightly mummified in silk organza. These little misadventures were starting to worry Hotaru.

Of course, all of this was far from Hotaru's mind, and before she started to plan how to get out of this, she had to bite her lip from letting out a moan that was both in surprise and strangely in arouse.

No-hahahaaa..Mmmm...No more..!!!\" She begged in near gasps, not even loud enough for her crush to hear.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a beautiful and clear day, as Rini and her friends were out riding there bikes through the park. They were half way through the park, when one of the girls, who was known as Sarah saw a small group of boys there age, playing Super Heros. She remembered them right away, for these boys had ruined her third birthday party, by coming there naked, and grossing out everyone. An idea suddenly struck the raven haired girl, makig her suddenly stop, making Rini and the other two girls follow her lead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong Sarah?\" Rini asked, the she and the other two girls, Janet and Noel, followed her in the bushes, hiding far away from the boys \"Is there something wrong with your bike?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just fine...\" Sarah replied, \"I was just struck by an idea!\" she smiled innocently, before pointing to the boys they were hiding from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See those boys?\" She asked, making the other girls nod, \"well, they did somthing to me on my birthday a while ago that I didn't like, so I wanna have some payback!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...\" Rini blinked \"so what're you gonna do?\" Sarah smirked a little evil smirk, and turned toward her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me? I'M not doing anything to them... YOU are Rini! After all, you said you'd do ANYTHING to pay me back in any way you could when I lhelped you studied for that big test that time. We spent the whole night studying remember?\" Rini was about to protest big time, but found that she couldn't. Sarah was right, she DID promise to do one request for her friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Sarah... what do I have to do?\" Rini wasn't sure what Sarah would ask of her to do, but something told her she wasn't going to like it. Sarah though for a moment, before smiling evily again as the idea she got before re-entered her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rini, for you to pay me... You have to give those boys the scare of there lives, that'll give them nightmares! And in orde for them to be really scarred, you must walk up to them and ask i you can be there damsel in destress,\" Rini and the other two girls blinked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it?\" Rini asked in confusion, \"Cause if it is....\" Sarah held up her hand, telling Rini to be quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't finished... you have to do all those things... BUTT NAKED!\" Rini gasped, and turned bright red at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now hold on just a minute Sarah! Just because I promised to...\" \"That's right Rini...\" Sarah interrupted again, \"You DID promise, and I also made you sign this paper so you wouldn't back out on my one request,\" As she said this, Sarah pulled out the paper with Rini's signature on it. Rini and the other two looked at the paper, and saw that it was true.... Rini HAD to do it, all because of a contract.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Sarah...\" Rini sighed, \"I'll do it... BUT you guys have to watch over my clothes until I get back!\" Sarah smiled, and nodded her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine... Now, start stripping!\" Rini sighed in embarassment, and she first unziped her jacket. After handing the jacket to Sarah, she than slowly took off her pink shirt and handed it to Noel. She hesitated a little when going to the zipper of her skirt, but when she saw her friends faces, shejust closed her eyes and undid the button and zipper before handing it to Janet, removing her shoes and stocking socks along with it. Finally, it came her underwear. She was just about to beg Sarah for her to at least keep her undergarments on, but seeing the look on her face, AND the paper in her hands told her that there was no way she was getting out of this. With a deep blush staining her face, and taking little breaths, Rini removed the last of her garments and gave them to her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? Now that wasn't so hard, now was it?\" Sarah smiled, holding Rini's jacket and undergarments. Rini didn't say anything, only shivered at the cold wind licking at her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dont worry Rini, just get it over with, and the sooner you get this done, the sooner you can put your clothes back on,\" Noel told her calmly, while holding Rini's shirt a very little training bra. (she sorta has a little chest right? cause I know she's not a teen, but we've all seen her in the show... she's still a little girl ya know) Rini looked at her friends and nodded once, before taking a deep breath, looking both ways for any grown-ups, and leaving the bushes towards the boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happeneds next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With her right arm across her chest and her left hand covering the REALLY embarrassing part, she just had to hope that Sarah and the others weren't laughing at her butt. Scout's honor may have required she respect her promise to Sarah, but Rini would be reconsidering their friendship after this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Most of the boys had fallen into an argument over who could beat up whom, discussing powers and motivations and citing specific issues of comic books for proof. Dumb! But one was off by himself, pretending to fly around, using his windbreaker as a cape. Rini walked right up on him, barefoot-sneaky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"HEY!\" she shouted, startling the kid. \"Can I be your damsel in distress?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Rini was ready to turn around and run, and to heck with actually scaring the boys. But the boy she'd snuck up on WAS scared, which was sort of interesting. He certainly hadn't expected to see a naked girl suddenly appear behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Go away,\" he said, pretty weakly. The other boys had turned when Rini shouted, and were just starting to point, screaming with laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Rini, feeling angry at the other guys and a little sadistic toward the stunned kid in front of her, lost all squeamishness. Growling and raising her arms menacingly, she pounced on the surprised boy. He immediately collapsed, but then started digging his heels into the grass as he tried to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Get off!\" he yelled, definitely freaked. \"Get offa me!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   After a brief scuffle, the boy managed to squirm away and run out of the park as fast as he could. Rini was left with his windbreaker. She shrugged and caped up, charging the rest of the guys. Even as she was doing it, she couldn't believe it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   The remaining wannabe-heroes, who'd all flopped to the ground from laughter, now looked a little concerned as Rini rushed them. She was still roaring and waving her arms, which wasn't very damsel-in-distressish, but the boys looked spooked as she... streaked over. Rini literally ran over one of them, her feet slapping down on his back and head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   As an experiment, she lunged at one of the boys and grabbed him. He didn't fall over, but he seemed just as panicky as Rini's first victim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Lemme GO!\" he yelled, finally pushing her away and making a break for it. He acted like her nudity was a disease he might catch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Rini realized she was having fun, not humiliated at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   The three boys left were gathering up their stuff and getting ready to split. Rini took her 'cape' off and pitched it at one of them, figuring he'd bring the jacket back to his friend. The gesture underscored her nakedness, which only further bewildered Rini's remaining audience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"She's crazy!\" said one of the guys, tripping as he ran away. He hopped up and kept going, not looking back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Her hair's pink!\" said another, as validation of Rini's insanity. He fled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Don't mess with me, OK?\" pleaded the last boy, backing away with his hands up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"It's revenge, because you guys ruined my friend's birthday party when you showed up naked that one time,\" said Rini, knowing it was a pretty lame explanation. The guy obviously didn't know what she was talking about, and sprinted off when Rini stomped her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Sarah, Janet, and Noel broke out of the bushes, cheering and running toward Rini. Astonished at her success, Rini considered what to do next.</span></div></div>",

Rini could tell that was a bad sign, since Windbreaker obviously wanted serious payback. She <i>had</i> given him the hardest time. Rini alternated between dancing up on tiptoes and rocking back on her heels to twist her feet around, hoping to throw Stick Kid off. Being on display like this made her feel a <b>lot</b> more ticklish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I</i> am, 'cause I'm already doing villain-stuff,\" said the kid with the stick, continuing on Rini's feet. The question seemed to barely get his attention, as he concentrated on making Rini laugh. \"You guys go fight for a while, and then you can bust through and save her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if there are two villains?\" asked one of the other guys -- the one Rini had stepped on. \"One for each foot, and it takes half the team even longer to fight through! Look, she stepped on me, so I get to be a foot-revenge bad guy, OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom Rini's perspective, it was an ideal disgreement... temporarily. The boy with the stick stopped tickling her to argue with the other guys, who <b>all</b> wanted to be the villain! Windbreaker claimed dibs, but Stick said he rated because he was the last to run away, <i>and</i> he'd been the one who not only first suggested they play Superheroes in the park, but the one to suggest tickling Rini to begin with. The last guy -- the second one Rini had grabbed and who'd freaked as if she had cooties -- got sick of protesting his point and simply stepped behind the pole Rini was tied to, bringing his hands around her and running his fingers over her tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BWAH-haha-HAHA!!\" Rini howled, amazed and embarrassed at how little restraint she was showing, laughing boisterously like some sort of very small pirate. She thrashed around, straining against the jump ropes holding her wrists and ankles, and they were tied just loosely enough so that she could sink to her knees on the grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis turned out to be a <i>terrible</i> position, allowing easier access to her sides and pointing the soles of her feet straight up. Windbreaker got to her underarms, Cooties stayed on her tummy, and Stick grabbed a foot along with Doormat, each using their fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRini went completely wild, the rope around her wrists making a screeching noise against the pole as she jerked up and down. The boys just laughed at how crazy she sounded, laughing even more when she bumped her butt on cold metal and leaned forward to thump her forehead on the grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThirty seconds became feverish forever to Rini. The rope around her ankles came loose, and she felt a moment of relief... but the boys tickling her feet just grabbed her ankles and held on like they were drowning. Then her wrists got loose, too, but it turned into a nightmare struggle as she slipped out of one boy's clutches only to get grabbed by another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they finally let her go, Rini didn't have enough strength to do anything but flop down on her face and gasp, wheezing as tears of ticklishness rolled off the end of her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what you get!\" Stick said, sounding a little nervous as he walked away with the other guys. \"Now we know your weakness! Naked Girl. Hey, that's her superhero name! Mess with us again and see what happens, Naked Girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys wandered off, debating about where she was most ticklish and who'd tickled her the worst. Fortunately for Rini, the argument didn't lead to a repeat performance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRini caught her breath and laid spread-eagled in the cool grass, humiliated but happy to still be alive. Once she was composed enough to realize <i>anyone</i> could be looking at her, she stood shakily and looked for some way to improve her condition.</span></div></div>",

As she got to the end of the alley, which was blocked off by the usual boarded end and stinky trash cans, she saw she was still in the light, and knowing that the Ice Cream Man would probably see her if she didn't do something. Thinking fast, she went to the corner where there was an old cloth, and a small hole in the wall, picked up the cloth, and covered herself with it, but sadly, it wouldn't cover her left foot. Thinking fast again, she quickly stuck that foot into the tiny hole in the wall, than covered her leg, so the ice cream man would just pass by without a glance. She waited until the music died down, before she unclothed herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THAT was close,\" She whispered, before trying to tug her foot out of the wall, only to find...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no... I'm STUCK!\" She whispered, while continuing to try and pull out the hole.... but it wouldn't budge!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This can't POSSIBLY get any WORSE!\" Rini mummble to herself, onlt ro find out that on the other side of the wall...</span></div></div>",

That's what you get for turning your back on them.\" Mars muttered behind her as the Sailor Senshi marched into the changing room of the local hotspring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, now. Don't be that way.\" Haruka, otherwise known as Sailor Uranus said, sauntering up behind Usagi. \"Usagi here took out more of them than any of us. Maybe she got a little careless at the end, but she did a good job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well, you didn't have to pull that thing off her, did you?\" Rei sai idly as she began to remove her clothes. \"God, the smell was....ugh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks you for your help as well.\" Ami said to Michiru as they stripped to a pair of light blue bra and panties, each reminiscient of the water they used as their signature attack. \"I'm sorry we had to interrupt your concert for this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, not at all. We have a duty as Senshi first. I know we tend to keep to ourselves, but the Outer Senshi will always lend a hand when you girls need it. And this really was a situation that needed all of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. The monsters usually appear one at a time. I've never seen them attack as a huge army like that before. Its a good thing dealing with Galaxia toughened us all up, otherwise I don't think we would have made it.\" Makoto, also known as Sailor Jupiter, said grimly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the past our enemies have had to gather large amounts of energy from the populous, or else they were looking for a hidden treasure amongst the population to fuel their plans. The only time I recall something on this scale occuring was Nehelenia's return, calling forth those glass mirror servants to attack us on all fronts.\" Setsuna, Sailor Pluto, noted in her typically cold manner. \"Clearly, these demons had entirely different goals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did they want, anyway?\" Usagi asked, sliding out of her clothes and craning her neck so that Haruka could work out the tension in her bruise. \"Other than being really grabby and gross, they didn't seem to have a plan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a long silence in the changing room as the other senshi glanced as each other and silently stripped out of their clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Usagi....did you notice the tentacles?\" Haruka asked carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, they all had them. Why?\" Usagi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you notice anything funny about them?\" Haruka asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, the ends looked weird. Why is the important?\" Usagi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei groaned. \"How can an 18 year old be that naive? I mean, you and Mamoru have been going out for a least a few years now. Haven't you ever....or at least seen him changing or something? Don't you know what IT looks like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What what looks like?\" Usagi demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruka gave a pained sigh. \"Usagi, those were....those are demons that feed on lust and sex. They came to this world to feed on those things. Those tentacles are....ahem....there to help them do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi paused. \"So.....those tentacles were their....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boy parts.\" Makoto supplied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And when they grabbed me they were trying to....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And this smelly sludge they were covered with was....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi paused, set down her basket full of clothes, picked up her bath supplies, and ran screaming from the changing room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GROSS, GROSS, GROSS, GROSS, GROSS, GROSS GROSS!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group of girls exchanged glances, then began laughing together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. I take it back. If she would have freaked out that badly while we were fighting them, I guess its a good thing she's a little more innocent than the rest of us.\" Rei said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ignorance is bliss.\" Haruka agreed. \"Although someone might tell our beloved prince to get pick up the pace a little with that girl. Taking it slow is all well and good, but it might not hurt to remind him he's not the only one interested. If he doesn't kick things up a notch, someone might steal her before he knows it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" Michiru asked, a playful smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what's with that look? You know there's only one woman for me. Sure, its fun to tease and flirt with that little girl, but that's just playing! You know I don't want anyone but you, Michi-chan.\" The tall blonde girl proclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? That's a shame. I was just thinking to myself that the so-called little girl had grown into a young woman as we've known her, and that there were so many things the two of us could teach her....but if you only have eyes for me, I suppose there's nothing to talk about.\" Michiru said, throwing a towel over her shoulder and walking into the bath with a wiggle of her nude butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruka blinked, and then blushed tremendously. \"Wait....did she just suggest....was she serious? Was she kidding? What was....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other Senshi gave her sympathetic looks. Haruka certainly had the edge when it came to teasing Usagi, but Michiru was clearly the master in their own relationship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Senshi filed out, each intending to wash away the wounds and stink of battle in a relaxing bath. As the last girl filed out, a disembodied smile filled the empty room. Like something out of a Lewis Carroll story, a sleek cheshire cat slowly materialized on limb at a time. It glanced around the room, its smile growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was unwise to attack a world with its own guardians, wasn't it?\" The Cheshire asked to the empty room. \"A little more research would have been worthwhile. I always said the subtle approach was the best one. But then, there are advantages to this situation as well, aren't there? The impatient ones are all dead now. I can't say I'll cry for them- too stupid to do more than rape and devour- no style, no finesse, just a pack of maddened behemoths who met the fate they deserved. Never understanding- there are better ways to get the job done....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Cheshire cat moved from basket to basket, where each Senshi had tucked away their shoes, wallets, clothes...and hidden carefully in their belongings, their transformation wands. Purring, the cat rubbed up against each basket in turn. The clothes seemed to dissolve into smoky tendrils of shadow, which the cat swallowed with a satisfied intake of breath. Lastly, the alien feline rubbed against the wand each scout carried, instilling an aura of darkness into each that vanished a moment later. Usagi's brooch was the last to go, resisting the magic the longest. But even the crystal embedded in its core fell to the curse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The seeds have been sown, Sailor Senshi. You can kill a thousand lust demons without breaking a stride. But what do you do when you are the instruments of lust? That will be my curse- we shall feast on your shame and the lust you inspire, and we shall sup far more heatily than the quick, pathetic meal my brethren sought.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For as long as she could remember, Rei had been drawn to the fire. When she was growing up as a shrine maiden, she had learned early how to read the flames and see the future in the curl of the smoke. Those divinations were second nature to her, as was her fiery temper. While the revelation of who she was, Sailor Mars, had been a shock, the nature of her powers had seemed all too natural. Fire had been her birthright, it was only natural that the fire would be hers to call on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps that was how, as she lay in the steaming water, with the sounds of the girls washing and laughing around her, that Rei found herself lulled into a deep sleep, the heat as great a comfort to her as a lullaby. And perhaps, skilled as she was with coaxing visions of the future from the fire, that was what she dreamed of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe was a reddish-purple haze all around her. The sky was dark, the twilight hue of a sun almost completely set. In the distant, she could hear the crashing of wave against a shore...but the timber was off. She found herself in her sailor fuku, her hair a mess and her body sluggish. The landscape all around her was all black rock, like obsidian. Long, rubbery growths like some unknowable fugus wrapped around the landscape, pulsating. In the distant, she could see strange obelisks spaced at irregular intervals. And above the gurgling crash of the surf...she heard voices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMars rose unsteadily to her feet. Her eyes adjusted to the awful gloom. As she moved towards the sounds of the sea, she gazed up at the sky, and she trembled. The sun wasn't setting...it was a dim ball of dull red. At the corners of the sky, it was dark enough to see the stars. And yet...they were dull, barely visible points of light, seemingly matching the fate of the sun. And there was no moon to be seen. And Mars knew, with the revelations that only come in dreams, that the moon was gone, that all the worlds of Sol were gone, stripped of their orbits and swallowed up. This was all that remained...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as she came to understand this, she reached the cliff face. And she stared down into an awful pearly sea too hideous and thick to be water. And in the waves she saw people....hundreds, thousands, millions, writhing in the ebb and flow of the unnatural tides. And by the way they pressed together, and by the strange writhing of their bodies, and by the chilling moans carried on the wind Rei knew what they were doing. And she wanted to scream, because even crying out in the throes of passion their voices carried the unnatural pitch of hysteria and madness. And there were other voices as well, caught inbetween climaxes, voices that were singing...chanting...speaking words she didn't know. Words she didn't want to hear....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei turned and began to run. She fled through stony barrens and unnatural obelisks, and as she did the dream took on a different tone. New sounds came alive around her, sounds of real people and real civilization...and the sun seemed to swell in the sky and brightened, and somehow she was back in the real modern world. Buses and cars and people were moving all around her, the city was alive and thrumming. And she stood, feeling as if time had slowed for her and her alone. And then, the laughter began. A little kid was pointing and laughing at her. And others were...pointing, laughing, staring...leering at her. Rei looked down, trying to figure out what was going on. And there she stood, now without her fuku or anything else, standing in the center of the street utterly naked, and everyone staring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei's hands went to cover herself. But even as her right hand reached her bare breasts, an awful and overwhelming urge came over her. She began to stroke and tease her nipples. Her left hand, seeking to hide her shaven sex from view, was compelled to go DEEPER, to part her folds and explore. Rei blushed furiously as she started to play with herself, even as the camera phones began to snap away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rei! Rei! Wake up!\" Usagi called, shaking the frightened girl awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! Usagi! Oh my god! I had the worst dream! I think there's a new enemy here! I saw an awful future! And then...oh god, it was so embarrassing! I was standing in the middle of the street, and I didn't have any clothes on, and I just started to masturbate in the middle of the street! It was the most embarrassing....Usagi...what are you doing?\" Rei asked as Usagi frantically shoved a towel into her hands and then hid behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rei...your not going to want to hear this, but...\" Usagi said. Rei realized three things in quick succession. First, Uagi was naked and dripping wet from the bath. Second, she was also naked and dripping wet. Third, she wasn't in the bath anymore. And the way Usagi was crouching behind her and desperately motioning her to pull the towel up....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei looked up from the towel. All around her were the sounds of real people and real civilization. Buses and cars and people were moving all around her, the city was alive and thrumming. And people were laughing at her. And pointing. And staring. And leering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That last part wasn't a dream.\" She said, the dawning sense of dread settling in on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just got up with a glazed look in your eyes and ran out of the bathhouse. And when I caught up to you-\" Usagi stopped abruptly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei looked at the camera phones, and turned pale. She held the towel in front of her, but the crowd was huge and nowhere they could turn would keep them from mooning some portion of the audience. Worse, there was one towel, and two of them. What were they supposed to do?</span></div></div>",

Its not like I had a lot of time to plan for- eek!\" Usagi screamed as a camera phone snapped a photo of her exposed and bouncy behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dummy!\" Rei cried, blushing profusely. The truth was, she was grateful for her friend's timely intervention with the towel. But right now Rei needed any excuse not to think about the fact that she was standing naked in front of a crowd of leering onlookers, a thin shield of a towel that held desperately between her and their eyes, and most especially not to think about how moments before she had stumbled into this same crowd in a sleep induced haze and proceeded to masturbate in front of the assembled throng. In times like these, when stress or embarrassment were bad enough to kill her, Rei found snarky anger a useful outlet. And if there was anything you could say about Usagi, it was her endless capacity to annoy you even as she did something so courageous you could kiss her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to get out of here!\" Rei said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but they cut off exit! And everyone's looking at my butt!\" Usagi wailed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei was about to retort when a familiar honking sound came from the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haruka!\" Both girls said at once. Then they both stared with the rest of the crowd. It was Haruka, all right, perched atop her beloved motorcycle, gesturing at them with obvious agitation. Both girls began blushing intensely. Their friend was also very naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruka was one of the outer scouts, that group of aloof and mysterious senshi that guarded the system from threats outside Sol. Uranus was perhaps the most accessible of those girls, open as she was about her relationship with Michiru and her occasionally aggressive streak. She was also a coy but hopeless flirt, something the inner scouts had all known first hand at one point or another. Her features were much more androgenous than her counterpart in Michiru, a fact she used to her advantage when teasing younger girls who hadn't yet realized that soft spoken young man was in fact a woman. Her feminine features were much harder to miss now, as her small but firm breasts with their large nipples hung on display, her lithe and athletic body and petite sex on clear display. An uncharacteristically deep blush was on her face as she again waved for the two stunned girls to come to her. This time the two girls nodded and tentatively moved to her side, Usagi ineffectually using her hands to hide her naked butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haruka san!\" Rei gasped. \"What's going on??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were trying to find some clothes and come after you...but someone took everything we had! We had to sneak out of the baths and figure out a way to deal with you two and get everyone else home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Where are the others?\" Usagi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Michi-chan is driving them home now...\" Haruka said. \"So let's just-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...she's driving everyone home....in that little blue convertible? How are you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look! She's driving, Pluto and Saturn are sharing the front seat, and the rest of you are crammed in the back! Can we go now?\" Haruka demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...you'd have to go on the free way to get across town like that...and its going to be packed! Your car doesn't even have a top. Everyone will see them. What if they call the police or get stopped??\" Rei protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't have many options, okay?\" Haruka snapped. \"They'll at least have more cover than we do\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi and Rei exchanged looks. They hadn't thought of that. The three of them riding naked on a motorcycle...the pair cringed in simultaneous realization and dread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look...just hurry up and get on already.\" Haruka said, her composure utterly gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"......\" Usagi paused. \"G-go ahead Rei. You can have the middle. I'll try to cover you as much as I can....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei paused, then smiled gratefully. Usagi was clearly not relishing the idea of putting her butt on full display for all of the Tokyo freeway, but as was often the case she was putting her friends before herself. Under other circumstances, Rei might have put up a fight over the sacrifice. Now, though, she could only hug the naked girl gratefully, then climbed on board. She would take any small amount of dignity she could salvage out of this humiliating situation. Not that riding around sandwiched between two wet and naked girls was much better....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You might as well drop the towel now...\" Haruka said. \"I lost mine about two seconds after getting on the road....your not going to have time to hold onto it, the wind will whip it off in no time at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Couldn't we....\" Usagi began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LOOK! While your brainstorming we're standing around on display so these loser can take snapshots of all of us. So either drop the damn towel and hop on board or keep it and walk home.\" Haruka snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi gulped and abandoned their slim protection to join the others on the bike, pressing herself up to Rei in a way that made the embarrassed girl VERY aware of both their nude bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-so...where are we going?\" Rei asked.</span></div></div>",

Traffic zipped past them on all sides, horns honking in excitement and shock as the trio of naked girls gave everyone a good show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Usagi, your screaming right in my ear!\" Rei cried. \"Haruka-san, my temple is much farther away from here than your house. And the closest parking is on the street. We'd have to run up that long stone stairway to get to the temple, and there might be visitors there even at this hour! Not to mention Chad and grandpa....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat thought inspired a renewed sense of dread in the sailor scout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look....\" Haruka said. \"I don't want to be wandering around naked any more than the rest of you. But we have more to worry about than just bare skin....right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw you wander out of the baths. Michiru had gotten those glassy eyed looks enough times for me to know when someone is having a vision. Its some new enemy, right?\" Haruka asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so.\" Rei admitted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we go to your temple, no matter how far out of the way it is.\" Haruka said, her tone brooking no argument. \"We need to make sense of your dream as soon as possible, and the tools you need to do that are there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get that! But shouldn't we be worrying about finding some clothes FIRST?\" Rei asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm hoping you can find us some robes or something when we get there. If not...I guess we'll just have to make do.\" Haruka said solemnly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you being a bit too serious?\" Rei whispered to herself. Behind her, Usagi snorted. \"Not so fun when someone else is bossing you around, is it Rei-chan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not now...\" Rei muttered as another car honked at them. The window rolled down and a camera phone snapped a picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you remember about the dream?\" Uranus persisted. \"It could give us a place to start.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its...jumbled.\" Rei said. That was a lie- the imagines were alien and frightening, but she remember her dream all too well. She just had no idea how to explain it to her friends. Deep down she had to admit, the images had been intensely erotic even as they were horribly twisted. Was that it? Had the dream been so arousing that she couldn't help herself? Is that why in spite of her utter shame she had stood in front of a crowd of onlookers and masturbated?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo...if she was going to be entirely honest, some part of her had been craving the humiliation. Watching those masses of humanity, slave to their pleasure, helpless to do anything but give in to their own passion...a part of Rei had known full well she wandering about naked. Part of her had sought out the largest crowd she could find, had positioned herself just right to maximize the number of people who could see her degradation. Her need to be seen had been at least as intense as the need to orgasm. She wondered...if they all had seen her dreams, would they all have posed for the audience and played with themselves? Or would they have done something to each other, like the people in her dreams...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei's whole body turned a bright red as she mentally slapped herself back to reality. She was acting like a pervert! And this was quite possibly the worst time to be thinking about her two companions and their exposure in those terms, pressed as she was between the two naked girls and on full display for an entire freeway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm....I see your mind is elsewhere.\" Haruka said, her tone changing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei silently prayed for a merciful kami to kill her on the spot. Her body had followed her train of thought, and her hardening nipples were impossible to hide from Haruka, squished as her breasts were against her bare back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't feel bad. I'm flattered.\" Haruka said in a husky voice. Rei groaned as her blush deepened. Haruka, as mentioned, had a certain love for flirtation and seduction, something Michiru seemed to abide by with her characteristic patience. Uranus really did have the whole thing down to a science, to the point where perfectly straight girls who knew full well she was female were reduced to puddles of blushing and stammering jelly. This was doubly bad for Rei, who's sexuality would normally qualify as 'straight' but became somewhat more ambigious in relation to her teammates in general and the hapless, naked and confused girl hanging off her back in particular. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know...the one thing I am glad about in this whole messed up situation...is getting to ride a pair of such beautiful and elegant ladies. As embarrassing as all this is, I can't really complain about the view...\" Haruka said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-thanks.\" Rei stammered as she felt Haruka's left hands snake behind her and playfully rub down her rib cage. Her hips instinctively tightened around Haruka's waste, her sex clenching in an instinctive need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-haruka...\" Rei stammered, the hand on trailing down to squeeze her hip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" Haruka whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch the road!\" Rei cried as a slow moving truck loomed in front of them. The hand on her thigh vanished and the bike switched lane with a heart wreching squeel. Usagi screamed, and Rei silently wondered if she would ever hear in her left ear again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-maybe we should focus on the mission again?\" Rei said, her voice quivering despite the snark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\" Haruka said, dropping the husk in her voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The good news is....if you like the view...I'll have to stay this way for awhile.\" Rei said after a minute of driving and leering from the traffic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" Haruka asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....the best way to call that vision back up is to recreate conditions as exactly as possible to when I had the dream. Which means I have to be naked.\" Rei said, blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Things are looking up.\" Haruka observed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately....so do you.\" Rei said without missing a beat. \"For the same reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"......\" Haruka paused. \"Eh. Small price to pay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei spent the rest of the ride there trying not to think about all her friends sitting naked in a circle around her ritual bonfire, herself in the center, flames dancing off their bodies, as she conjured visions of the dream up to appear in the flame. She tried not to imagine what might happen, given her actions before, and the state of dress they would all be in, in that hot and darkened chamber. She tried not to think about the fact that they would in all likelihood be spending the night in that chamber, and that the number of beds meant that more than half of them would have to double up. She tried to avoid any more dirty thoughts, picture any of the myriad of scenarios that could play out that night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a brave and valient struggle. All the more so since it was doomed from the outset to fail....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Usagi's yawn was long and loud. Contrary to the fears and desires of her teammate, no lesbian hijinks took place the night before. Even Haruka was oddly silent and solemn during the long ritual Rei performed (although Usagi did catch the older girl looking her over once or twice, which earned both a blush and a raspberry from the moon princess). According to Rei, the fire reading had gone nowhere- each time she felt as if she was getting close to unraveling the dream symbols the picture seemed to flicker and die in her grasp. Either the dream had truly been meaningless, or something was actively trying to block the reading. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi was personally willing to forget the entire incident. Although she was far from the naive girl she had been when all of this started, optimism was never hard to come by in her world. Besides, Galaxia had caused enough death and destruction with her invasion....the possibility of losing her friends once again was not something Usagi wanted to dwell on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaru Osaka, a long time friend of Usagi who all the english exchange students insisted on calling Molly (some even convinced she was from Boston for some reason) looked on in awe, then sighed to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one can yawn quite like you, Usagi.\" Naru said. \"But I thought you said you'd get more rest once we got to college.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, leave me alone.\" Usagi muttered. \"I didn't exactly plan to stay up all night. I just....something came up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lemme guess. Something happened with Rei and those other girls, right?\" Naru asked somewhat dejectedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi bit her lip, feeling guilty. Naru was her oldest friend (at least going by her civilian, modern day life), and yet the pair barely spent any time together any more. The reason, of course, was that Usagi had awakened as Sailor Moon. But the blond had never explained her secret to Naru, or why she suddenly and inexplicably began hanging around the same group of girls day after day. She'd meant to spend more time with her friend once they had gotten into the same university. Unfortunately, even in times of peace her time and attention seemed to get sucked up by the senshi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah....ummm....say, how are you and Umino doing these days?\" Usagi asked, desperate to change the subject. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fne...I guess. Ever since he got accepted to Tokyo University he's been so distant. I'm not sure he wants to have a long distance relationship. Sometimes I think he's lost all interest in me.\" Naru sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi grimaced. Umino wasn't exactly her favorite person in the world at the best of times...honestly, he was a bit too nerdy and creepy for her with his giant glasses and nerdy habits. But he did seem to care for Naru a great deal, and Usagi had always been reluctant to interfere in their relationship. Naru had needed all the comfort and support she could get when her old boyfriend had left her. By leaving, Usagi of course meant that he had died....unsurprising, since he had been one of the top generals of the Dark Kingdom before 'defecting' to be with Naru. The fact that Usagi hadn't really trusted him combined with her failure to save him...suffice to say she was the last person who had any right to intervene in her friend's love life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right. A long distance relationship is tough.\" Usagi said softly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaru gave her a sympathetic look. \"How is Mamoru?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's doing well. He says his english is getting better all the time, and the Harvard professors are really impressed with him. He should be done in no time!\" Usagi said, smiling in mock confidence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nProwling behind the pair of college students, a black cat slunk along. The remnants of the incubi had been gathered up. It was almost time for the real fun to begin. The forms of the demons would be far weaker than before...and more refined than the crude monstrosities of rape and death they had been before. No, they would have to be more subtle. But only just....a public stripping should provide more than enough lust and energy for the demon's needs. But who should be the target? The incarnated moon princess, or this human she seemed to have bonded with? Either way, the demon was not the only surprise waiting for this self-proclaimed defender of the earth....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The cheshire trotted forward, its eyes glowing a sinister red. As it passed up Naru, it flicked a strand of thread from her brownish red dress. To all casual appearance, it was just a normal cat swatting at a piece of string. But out of sight and on a slightly different frequency, a black mist rose from the cat's mouth and slithered into the fabric. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strinthas, by your name and your essence I give you a second life. You have failed in your mission- your demonic form is lost. I bind you to this earthly thing, and allow you to take form and power from it. Know that your penance for your first death is that you are forbidden to harm these creatures directly. Aquire the energy of shame and lust we need, and you shall earn your place amongst the Ring again. Fails twice, and you will know only oblivion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt; br /&gt;\r\n<br>\r\nThe morning passed relatively uneventfully. Usagi passed an exhausted looking Ami in the hallway, who gave a half-hearted smile and waved. Usagi smiled to herself. The girls had been lucky to have Mercury on their team, they probably would have never gotten into the same school. Sometimes she wanderer if Ami hadn't 'dumbed down' her own test scores to get in with the other girls, but Ami had always insisted it was Usagi and the others who had excelled on the final exams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi prayed she coul rely on the brilliant girl's skills after last night. There was no chance at all that she was going to absorb the lessons planned for today. As it was, if she could get through her next class without falling asleep, it would be a small miracle. Science wasn't her strong suit, and miss danver's droning voice was positively hypnotic in its ability to cause her to drift off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi paused at the doorway. Was that Naru? The red headed girl was blushing and looking around tentatively. Usagi blinked. At first she thought the girl must have been wearing an entirely different dress from before. Although it had the same black lace on the front, the color had gone from a sedate red tann to a deep scarlet. And she was showing off a lot more skin, from her long legs to the little spagheti straps....and it seemed Naru had changed into a push up bra given the way her small breasts were giving so offering up so much cleavage. But on closer examination, Usagi realized it was the same dress...the sleeves were just folded back on themselves somehow to expose more of her shoulders. The bottom, somehow, seemed to have opened up like an umbrella and folded back in on itself, exposing far more of the legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaru looked at Usagi and her blush deepened. \"Usagi! Something's wrong!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naru, what's going on?\" Usagi asked, trying hard to tear her eyes off her friend's body, the dress clinging incredibly tightly to her curves in a way that was impossible to miss and damn hard not to leer at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its this dress! It keeps....everywhere I go, I feel my breasts being pressed up and out, and everytime someone comes by my skirt lifts up like I'm over an air vent! I can't go to class like this!\" Naru wailed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.....umm....come on! You can borrow my shirt and jeans from my locker. I was going to change into them after gym today, but....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words had barely left her mouth than a terrific ripping sound was heard. The skirt on her dress split down the middle, and thin red threads whipped out at Usagi. With a force and strength that was completely at odds with their small size, the threads slammed her against the locker. Naru barely had time to scream before the whole dress tore itself off her body, leaving her blushing in the middle of her school in a pair of white panties and a matching bra. She froze, hesitating, instinctively covering herself and calling Usagi's name concernedly, her mind caught between embarrassment and fear for her friend's welfare. A loud chortling behind her banished both those thoughts from her mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thing that stood before her looked like a red skinned nightmare from a Tim Burton film....red threads formed a sock puppet face with large black buttons for eyes and whispy tendrils for hair. Red skin crisscrossed her frame in a life sized approximation of a human being, except there were gaps in the lining that were filled with nothing....and long ribbons flowed behind the figure in the outline of wings. An unnaturally wide and demonic grin was slashed across the thing's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaru, stunned and whimpering, had a brief moment to ask god and the kami and whatever else might run the universe why she always had to be the first one attacked by these monsters. A second latter, red threads were whipping out in all directions, encircling her hands and feet. She felt more twine behind her bra and panties. She glanced down at her remaining pieces of clothing, then up at the monster with a miserable look. Biting her lip, she pleading shook her head, and continued to shake it more and more vigiourously as the monster grinningly began to nod in energetic delight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe threads yanked back as Naru made one last wailing 'Noooo', The remains of her bra and panties were flung across the room, where the floated away to some unknown corner of the school. Naru immediately wanted to cover her now entirely nude body, complete with perky breasts topped with pink erect nipples and a mostly shaven sex with a thin strip of red hair. That desire for modesty was immediately squelched by the incubus, whose red threads pulled at her her arms and legs tightly. To Naru's horror, she found her ankles, elbows and joints carefully bound up in a manner almost exactly like a puppet on strings. The threads were as inflexible as iron, and her muscles were unable to resist being yanked in whatever direction the monster desired. She was made to stand on tip toe, hair hands posed strangely above her head, her legs spread wide, and her breasts pushed out in front of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want??\" Naru wailed, beyond embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You.\" The thing chortled in an unholy voice. \"You, like this, on display. You, were everyone can see you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaru found herself 'walking' to....a fire alarm. She begged and pleaded, but the thing just laughed as her hand awkwardly activated the switch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither the monster or the bound girl noticed Usagi's disappearance...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the alarm sounded and students poured out into the hall, Naru began to weep openly. She was 'dancing' now, moving like a cross between a marionette and a stripper, her limbs flailing about mechanically and unnaturally, bumping and grinding to some unseen beat. The whole population was stunned. Naru twirled about, her butt jiggling back and forth as her hands were held above her head, then she spread her legs dropped low, her pussy on complete display. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does anyone have a camera?\" The monster screamed in delight. \"Don't looked so shocked, boys and girls. Enjoy the show! Enjoy it, or I might make her dance so hard she breaks that pretty little limbs of hers...or maybe works that little heart so hard it blows up...SO START TAKING PICTURES BEFORE I GET MAD!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MOON TIARA MAGIC!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA flash of spinning, blinding white light ripped through the strings, causing Naru to fall to the floor. The audience and monster turned to the sound of the noise, as the strange object returned to the gloved hand of Sailor Moon, turning into the small crown she wore on her forehead. She stood a row of lockers, posing dramatically. Her usually cheerful face was smoldering in rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This girl came here to be with friends and learn, not to be naked and humiliated! For making an innocent girl into your perverted playboy fantasy, I CAN'T FORGIVE YOU! In the name of the moon, I WILL PUNISH YOU!\" Usagi announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature paused, then started laughing. The crowd stood by, most of them in stunned silence, but a few also guiltly chuckling. Some even sneaked a few pictures from cell phones when they thought no one was looking. Sailor Moon tried to glare at the monster, but began to look around in consternation. Okay, it wasn't her best 'punishment' speech ever, but surely she deserved a bit more respect than this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's a pervert now?\" The thing asked snidely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere had been a sense of extreme unease in Usagi's mind since she transformed. She had felt...lighter, and somehow colder. As she glanced down at herself, she understood. Normally her transformation replaced her street clothes with white goves, a tiara, red bands over her pony tails, a red collar, and red boots. It had done so here as well. What it had not provided her with this time was any underwear or a sailor fuku. Sailor Moon gulped as, for the second time in as many days, she found herself naked in front of a crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the school, the cheshire smiled as a high pitched scream echoed down the corridors. It seemed the moon princess had discovered the nature of the curse he had imbued into the transformaton wands and her own brooch. He wandered who would recover from the shock first....Sailor Moon or her laughing adversary. Either way, the fun was only beginning.</span></div></div>",

The sailor scout wore her trademark red boots, her white and red gloves, as well as her earrings, tiara, the red bangles wrapped around her famous 'dumpling' hairstyle, and the red and gold collar she wore around her neck. Under other circumstances, this ensemble would be complete with a sailor-like fuku and a stylish albeit short skirt in a navy blue pattern. However, it seemed her transformation had somehow neglected to provide these items of clothing to her today, a fact she had only realized in hindsight after striking a pose that accentuated her large breasts and butt, something that was normally flashy and dramatic but was now just plain lude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Nonononononononono!\" Sailor Moon said, her head moving left and right, her mind overwhelmed with the sheer volume of people staring at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" The monster chortled, as dozens of long threads whipped out at the embarrassed girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You!\" Sailor Moon screamed as she dodged the attack. Fortunately her past battles had honed her instincts well, even as distracting as this was. Unfortunately, those instincts were all based on survival and not modesty, so the crowd was treated to an excellent view of her bouncing boobs and butt as she moved. \"WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO ME??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me?\" The creature said in mock surprise and outrage. \"Not a thing! You showed up to this party naked all by yourself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like hell!\" Sailor Moon screamed. \"You think I'm that stupid? Who else could it have been?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be sure to thank them if I ever find out.\" The monster said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had to be lying, Sailor Moon thought, crouching behind a locker and hiding her body to the portion of the crowd that was still in sight. What else could it be? Except....Ami had said something about her transformations. Most of the information had been lost on Usagi...the discussion had revolved around how she couldn't become Eternal Sailor Moon at will anymore...that the act of bringing the other scouts back to life after the battle with Galaxia had used up too much of her power. But Usagi had been under the distinct impression that this had only meant her transformations would be the 'plain old ordinary' costume and powers she had known since Luna had first given her the brooch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut wait...this wasn't the first time she had ended up naked in front of an enemy, was it? In the last fight with Galaxia, she had assumed some nameless form even stronger than her Eternal transformation...which had pretty much consisted of her being completely naked with a pair of angel wings. She didn't have any wings now....but she WAS mostly naked. So....could it be that she was somehow evolving? Maybe she was somehow regaining the powers of that fight....maybe this meant she was now as strong as Galaxia?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tendril of red thread snuck around the corner and struck the girl across the butt with a nasty whipcrack. Sailor moon let out a loud 'eek!' and started running again, her hands instinctively covering her ass in case of more whippings, meaning more than half of the assembled crowd was treating to a full frontal view of her naked body as her breasts bounced up and down. Okay, maybe not so strong....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, all nudity aside, she agility and her magical attacks seemed to work as well as ever. So maybe...reaching out her hand, she willed a surge of energy into her palm. In bands of reddish pink energy, a long rod topped with a heart shaped head appeared in her hands. With a roar, she came to a dead stop and turned around to face the whip like threads that were chasing her. \"MOON SPIRAL HEART ATTACK!\" Usagi screamed, calling out the strongest attack she could muster without additional transformations. Thousands of small hearts and shining light erupted from the wand, seeming to form a solid wall of magic and energy that ripped through the animated threads, leaving only dust and ash in their wake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It....works!\" Usagi squeeked in excitement, her breath coming faster and heavier. She felt light headed and hot...and there was the most peculiar throbbing coming from between her legs. Usagi's eyes glazed over as sher brought her hands up to cover herself once again, using the hand that held her scepter to block the view of her pussy. She absentmindely began to play with her suddenly hardening nipples. At the same time, she was rubbing her scepter against her sex, teasing the lips, the cold metal making her moan in shock and need....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, what am I doing??\" Usagi said in shock, ripping her hands away from her body. In had happened so fast...an immense surge of need crashed over her the moment she made her attack. It was almost like a backlash to the magic she had poured into the assault....an feeling of arousal so intense it had almost overpowered her. And the intensity wasn't going away...her breasts were aching for attention and her sex was throbbing with need, and havin to neglect them made Usagi whimper softly to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\" The scout wondered helplessly. \"Crap! Its not going away! Ooooohhhh....I can't finish the fight without doing that least one more time! What if it gets worse?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi sucked in a deep breath. She had to focus. This wasn't about her embarrassment...this was about stopping a horrible monster from hurting....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try that again and she dies.\" The creature hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come out here, moonwitch. Slowly.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSailor Moon obeyed. Naru had been recaptured by the monster, her hands tied behind her back. Thick strands of red threads bound her ankles and feet, and most alarmingly a long strand of thread was wound around her neck and up into the ceiling like a noose. The fear in her friend's eyes was too much for Usagi to bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Drop the scepter and the crown, and put your hands behind your head.\" The monster said. Sailor Moon obeyed, putting herself on full display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Turn around slowly.\" The creature purred. The entire crowd was given a very good look of her large breasts, her bouncy butt, and her unshaven sex and budding clit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so tough now, eh?\" The creature chortled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just let her go.\" Sailor Moon demanded. \"You have me now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! Not a chance. She's my insurance policy. But don't worry...I'll leave her alone as long you cooperate. Now....get down on the bench.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA long wooden plank was dragged into the center of the room. Usagi was made to straddle the bench, red threads tying hands and feet together beneath the bench. Threads curling around her shoulders and stomach lifted her upper body off the bench such that her face and chest were thrusting out towards the audience, her breasts jutting out and flopping with the slightest movement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you-OWWW!\" Sailor Moon screamed as her poor butt was once again whipped by the creature's animate strings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naughty little girl! Preaching about love and justice while you prance around like a shameless slut! Throwing around burning nasty magic, killing without a second thought! Didn't you say something about punishing me in the name of the moon? Eh? Well, how about I punish you back a little!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wait! Don't!\" Usagi squeeled as the creature used its threads like a switch, slapping one butt cheek painfully, then the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is for all the poor innocent demons you've killed, you murdering slut. I want you to keep count for each lash, and then tell me your sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Usagi asked, then promptly screamed as her left cheek was struck. \"Uhm...wha..one! I'm so sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Louder!\" The monster snapped, and the whip followed suit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TWO- I'M SO SORRY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi yelped and cried as the lashes fell, her breasts dancing in all directions. The pain was sharp and impossible to brace for. Being naked in front of such a large crowd, uttering apologies and thrusting in all directions was easily the most utterly degrading and humiliating experience of Usagi's life. But the worst part was the growing tingle in her most intimate of places...whether from the jolt of arousal she had felt before or some inner passion Usagi was only now forcibly discovering about herself, Usagi had never been more turned on in her entire life. To her utter humiliation, Usagi found the feeling impossible to ignore. By the 13th lash, she was straddling the bench harder and harder, both to shy away from the pain but also to press her sex against the cold shaft of wood. By the 20th lashing, a soft but audible clink of metal on tile could be heard as Usagi actively humped the bench, grinding her sex down its length in time to the whip. The audience was dumbstruck and yet fascinated by the display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when Usagi thought she could take no more....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Stop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe incubus looked up from handiwork, Usagi's butt burning red. Naru stood in front of the creature, looking small and fragile with her hands tied behind her and her small naked body shaking slightly as the creature towered over her, tendrils of string hovering all around her as the monster stared. Still, her face seemed resolved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're gonna kill her.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would you do if I did?\" The creature asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't fight you.\" Naru admitted. \"But...please. Can't you just take me and leave her alone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She deserves much worse than what I've given her....but you're right. There are certain...limits who's boundaries I don't want to test yet. So are you offering to take her place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that's what it takes.\" Naru said, gulping. \"She's saved my life often enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thing chortled. \"You wouldn't survive, you know. Your body doesn't have her durability. I could flay you where you stand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....but the goal isn't to kill us, right?\" Naru asked. \"Its to...degrade us. Right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Poor little one, don't ever think you can understand my motives.\" The monster warned. \"But you have a point. There are other uses I have for your kind...and it would be a shame to waste the two of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaru nodded. \"So...how about she and I do a few things...with each other? That's enough, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thing laughed. \"Hardly. But it will do for a start. How long her respite lasts depends on just WHAT you do with her. Entertain me, or suffer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaru bit her lip and nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sailor Moon?\" She whispered as she moved towards the bench, the bonds around Usagi's wrists loosening so that she could sit up. The sailor scout moaned in exhaustion and pain...and something else. Naru sat facing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you get us out of this?\" Naru whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi nodded. \"I have one last trick....but I need it distracted. We need to keep all the focus on us....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I can manage that.\"Naru said, blushing. She moved forward and pressed her lips up against the sailor scout. Usagi moaned slightly and returned the kiss. When their lips parted, Usagi pretended to kiss Naru's neck, instead whispering in her ear. \"Okay...t-that can w-work. Just...try to be a little LESS distracting! I'll need to concentrate!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaru pinched her nipples, pressing her smaller body up against the sailor scout. \"We need to be convincing. Once I have its attention, I'll back off a bit. Do what you need to do then.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi nodded and moaned loudly as a hot and wet mouth suckled one of her breasts, then returned to ravishing her mouth, her hands exploring and squeezing. Usagi arched her back and pressed herself against her best friend, closing her eyes and trying to put aside their danger and their audience. They spent the next several minutes locked in this embrace, hands and lips becoming familiar with places neither ever expected to touch. Sailor Moon reveled in the sensations, the jolt of arousal that ran through having not diminished one iota since it first struck her. She had to guilitly remind herself that this pleasure was coming from someone she considered a friend, someone who was trying to save their lives. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naru....\" Usagi moaned, the other girl taking a longer suckle on her nipples. The red head looked up at her in surprise<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you...know me?\" Naru asked softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no! Your just....we've saved you so much...I picked up on your name.\" Usagi said nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaru looked at her suspiciously, then glanced at their captor. \"I think its been long enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll...start kissing down....well....and you pretend I'm doing what it looks like I'm doing....\" Naru said awkardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take Usagi long to understand, as Naru began trailing kisses down her body, moving towards the space between her legs. Sailor Moon began to moan and buck, pantomiming her pleasure as Naru's hot breath began to touch her waiting sex. It wasn't hard, because a very real part of the sailor scout wanted to feel her friend's kiss. Even so, under her breath, she began to whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mooon....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiscarded and forgotten on the ground, the little crown Sailor Moon had been wearing began to stir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tiiiiiiaarrrraaaa.....\" Sailor Moon whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little crown began to wobble into the air, starting to spinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maaaagic....\" Sailor Moon intoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crown began to glow with a white light. The creature didn't seem to notice, too busy relishing in the spectacle before it.Suddenly the glowing disc launched itself, seeming to expand as it did. The monster too late looked behind itself, its eyes widening as the disc seemed to envelope it, tightening around its middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Moon Tiara Magic!\" Sailor Moon said more loudly, as the thing began to struggle. \"N-naru! Can you get to the wand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer friend nodded, her hands free even if her feet were still hobbled. What followed was a desperate if somewhat surreal race, Naru hopping towards the wand as quickly as she could manage, her small breasts leaping all over the place. The creature struggled fiercely, screaming in her direction. Suddenly, the rope around Naru's neck began to tighten, cutting off a cry of alarm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi was feeling the same sensation of desire and need redouble itself. This time, with a cry of alarm and fear, she pushed the urges back down as she screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MOON TIARA MAGIC!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monster and the entrapping disc were both raised into the air and forcefully flung over Naru's head. The strings that bound her neck were cut. However, the disc winked out of existence afterward, the crown falling to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naru! The wand!\" Usagi screamed. Naru leapt for the wand, falling as she did, catching it as her body slid across the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KEEP IT STEADY! ITS...NOT EASY TO DO THIS FROM A DISTANCE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monster towered over Naru. The small girl brandished the scepter in much the same way one might a cross to a vampire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MOON SPIRAL HEART ATTACK!\" Usagi screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe magic that poured out of the wand was unfocused and mad, flying in all directions. Still the thing screamed and stumbled back a step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MOOOOOOOOOON SPIIIIRRRRAAALLLL HEEEEAAAART ATTTTTTTACK!\" Usagi kept screaming, calling forth more and more energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scepter shook violently in Naru's hand, but she held firmly to it and shoved it in front of her. What amounted to a pink supernova ripped from the wand. The scream that came from the monster was shrill and piercing. No even a shadow was left when Naru lowered the wand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sailor Moon!\" Naru asked, blushing as she bounced over to the naked girl. The strings were no longer animate, but they were still tied around her ankles painfully tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSailor Moon's chest was heaving. Her feet were still tied to the bench under her. Her hands were tied above her head. Her body was on full display.As Naru reached her, the moon princess moaned and blushed profusely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naru....I....so much effort. It...its worse than ever! I...I need.\" Her whole body seemed to heave in desire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaru blushed, bewildered, then took a deep breath and slapped Usagi across the face. The Sailor Scout blinked at her in pain and confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I....I'm sorry! Just...focus! I...\" Naru blushed as much intensely as Usagi and covered herself. \"We're naked! In public!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi's face burned and tears ran down her cheeks, but she nodded. Naru began cutting away the left over threads that bound her ankles and Usagi's bonds, using one of the sharp corners of the scepter as a makeshift knife. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you...\" Naru began, just as Usagi jumped off the bench and picked the surprised girl up. The pair stared at each other another moment, then Usagi began to run with the shorter girl in her arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair fled through the school and across the campus, finally taking refuge in a locker room several buildings away. When Usagi let her down, Naru nervously looked around the locker room, checking around corner, cradling the moon scepter in her hands and trying to make herself as small and inconspicious as possible. When she returned to the moon princess, she had claimed a towel much too small for her liking, and another for the naked scout. She was struck speechless another moment, for she found Usagi rubbing a gloved hand up and down her body, fighting a losing battle to touch herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sailor Moon...\" Naru said, feeling embarrassed despite everything else they had been through. \"I...um, here.\" She held out the towel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Usagi said weakly, disoriented and looking a little ashamed. \"I don't know what's wrong with me...I don't know why any of this is...or why I feel so-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hadn't finished the sentence before the small towel she had wrapped about herself began to glow, then seemed to dissolve in ribbons of reddish energy, that in turn seemed to twine around the sailor scout and infuse her body. She stood a moment, dazed, naked once again. Then she took a step backwards and fell to her knees, her eyes fluttering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its....even worse!\" Usagi hissed. \"I feel...Naru...I...please....help.\"</span></div></div>",

Sailor Moon moaned at the touch, surprising Naru with another kiss, this one more desperate than the last. Naru pushed herself away from the sailor scout, who looked at her lustfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wait!\" Naru said, trembling slightly. \"I'm sorry. I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rose to her feet, clutching the little towel to her frame. \"I can't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi stared at her a moment, then hung her head. \"I know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...\" Naru said, biting her lip. \"Please don't think...look, you're...I'm grateful! Really! And if there's anything else I can do to help....but, I...and its not that I think....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi looked up at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've....that wasn't the first time I kissed...a girl.\" Naru said, fidgeting with her towel and looking away from Usagi with an intense blush on her face. \"So you being...that part doesn't matter to me. And...even with everyone staring at us and the thing trying to kill us....I enjoyed...what we did. You kiss really well...especially for your first time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've kissed before!\" Usagi said, hugging her knees to herself. \"Just...not very many girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least not in the last several thousand years, Usagi thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, you're good at it. But...you aren't thinking clearly right now. I'd be taking advantage of that...and...I'm already seeing someone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.\" Usagi said. \"I am too. I shouldn't have asked. I...don't want to come between you two. I hope what we did hasn't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Umino? Don't worry about it! He's a huge pervert! And he's obsessed with geeky stuff like this. If he's heard about what happened at all, he's probably on a computer right now bragging about his girlfriend got stripped naked and made out with Sailor Moon. Hell...you've pretty much guaranteed my active sex life for the next four months....even if I'll have to get used to wearing the fuku again.....er...forget I said that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi blushed and looked down at herself. \"Believe me, right now I'd love to be wearing a fuku...any fuku.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaru nodded. \"The thing is...I love him. I've been with him for years now....and I don't want to cheat on him. And if we...I doubt he'd care at all...it would probably just get him more excited. But...I might care. And I don't want to...do anything to lose him. No matter how...fun it might be...or how cute she might be....or how obviously horny she is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi blanched and hid her face in her knees. \"Its not that obvious...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaru laughed, but said nothing. \"Listen...I'm going to hunt down some better clothes to wear....somehow. Is there anything I can do to help...besides sex?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its okay. I have some other friends who can help. Are you...sure you don't want any help? Your keys are back in that hallway, and you'd be wandering around campus in a towel...a really skimpy towel...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaru blushed at the look Usagi was giving her. \"I'll be fine. I can get a key from the front lobby if I have to...but hopefully Usagi will be back in our dorm room by now. She...should be okay, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh....yeah! She was probably just dazed.\" Usagi said, averting her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....funny how you know who Usagi is, even though I don't know you.\" Naru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....I can explain that.\" Usagi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it.\" Naru said as she rose up. \"I'll see you later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" Usagi said as her best friend rose to her feet and timidly left the bathroom. Once she was out of sight, Usagi immediately leapt to her feet and scampered into the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shower! Long, cold shower!\" Usagi said, as she feverishly began fumbling with her boots and gloves. \"Then call Ami.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_____________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's the whole story.\" Usagi spoke into her communicator, Ami's image staring back at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi opened her mouth, shut it, and opened it again. No sound came out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It has to have something to do with Rei's dream, right? I mean...a monster that strips people? Me without my clothes? My attacks making me horny? And Rei has this weird dream the day before that compels her to wander off naked and play with herself? It got to be connected, right?\" Usagi said, talking fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi was blushing profusely. \"That...sounds plausible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...so....how do I turn back? I've tried twice now...and nothing happened.\" Usagi said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...errr....I'll need a minute.\" Ami said, continuing to blush. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ami...I know this is all a little...but you don't have to look so embarrassed! Its not like it happened to you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Usagi, I can hear you...playing with yourself while we're talking!\" Ami said, covering her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Well...the stupid shower didn't work! I can't help myself! So the sooner you tell me what to do the sooner i can stop!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm analyzing it now!....its just taking a little while...does it...help? The...um.....orgasms...I mean.\" Ami said the last part in a whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell no! No matter how much I do this, I want to do it more! I'm going crazy!\" Usagi whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm....okay....it....the computer says you need to...\" Ami trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Usagi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try this. Put the communicator down and back up.\" Ami blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi did so, a little unsure. Ami could now see all of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay....turn around and bend at the waste....\" Ami said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi did so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now....spank yourself.\" Ami said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?\" Usagi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It says you have to spank yourself ten times in front of an audience. I'm trying to be the audience.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But....this hurts!\" Usagi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It....the transformation's power has formed a completely different pattern...I don't know why. You can't just transform back at will. You'll have to...spank yourself.\" Ami said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi blushed. Awkwardly, she raised her hand and smacked her sensitive rear end. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OW! Ami! This hurts!\" Usagi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nine more times.\" Ami said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its still sensitive!\" Usagi whined as she swatted herself hard. Her lovely cheeks jumped as she did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooh.\" Usagi moaned, her left hand squeezing her breasts and sliding in and out of her slit, which Ami could clearly see due to her position. Each smack inspired a yelp but also a feverish pounding of her sex. Ami blushed profusely as Usagi finished the last smack of her rear end just as her fingers finished their work. She dropped to her knees as she orgasmed. It was a long, lingering spasm of pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...now what?\" Usagi asked as she crawled on hands and knees, breasts dangling in front of her. Ami stared wide eyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just....try to turn back now.\" Ami whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh....okay.\" Usagi said. Her ear-rings and collar vanished a moment later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"......Ami.....why am I still naked?\" Usagi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....I....think....you've turned back into Usagi.\" Ami whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...so the transformation ATE MY CLOTHES?\" Usagi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That....seems to be the case.\" Ami said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ami! I'm naked on a college campus miles from my dorm! And now I don't even have my powers!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can bring you some clothes! Don't panic!\" Ami said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't panic! Naru will be worried about me! I can't wait here!\" Usagi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then use a towel and-\" Ami began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That will just get eaten by the transformation again! And then I'll get horny all over again! I'll just have to hurry!\" Usagi said. \"I'll check back in later!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, Usagi! You don't....\" Ami said as the comm went dead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to worry. The transformation only 'eats' clothes you try to cover yourself with while your sailor moon. You won't lose clothes or get aroused unless you turn back.\" Ami finished her explanation to the blank screen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe really should call her back. But the thought of Usagi having to streak campus one last time to a roommate who may or may not be home....that and her earlier performance had left Ami with her own perfectly natural feeling of arousal. Ami blushed as she decided to tend to her own needs first.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"She was naked?\" Rei asked, wide eyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I thought at first she was just exaggerating...her opponent seemed to have a...fixation on tearing off clothing. But my reading confirm it. Something's completely reconstructed her transformation lattice. She wasn't wearing a fuku when she started the fight.\" Ami said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inner scouts, minus Usagi, sat on the steps of Rei's temple. Luna rested on Rei's lap, her eyes focused attentively on Ami's synopsis. Artemis sat on Minako's shoulder as usual, although he seemed much more distracted by the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So she did manage to kill....whatever it was?\" Makoto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes....but not easily. I told her she didn't have to come to this meeting...I wanted to give her some time to recuperate after being...wounded so badly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHE WAS HURT??\" Minako and Makoto asked at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She got spanked on the ass.\" Rei said with a deadpan. \"A lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" The scouts said. Then a slow blush appeared on several of the girls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So she had to fight it naked and got spanked in front of a crowd?\" MInako said. \"That's a little....poor Usagi!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah...cause she's the only one who's had to deal with that kinda thing recently.\" Rei muttered bitterly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About that...do you think any of this is connected with your dream?\" Luna said, all business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'd be a pretty big coincidence. First, we fight off a wave of demons with....some very obvious intentions. Then I have that dream...and humiliate myself in the process! And now something does the same thing to Usagi?\" Rei asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh. Stripping girls naked and embarrassing them? Seems a step down from the things we fought before. No big deal.\" Artemis said, then cringed as four pairs of human eyes and one set of feline glared daggers at him. \"I mean...uh...what happened to Usagi was....horrible! But...she won! And now she's back to normal. Problem solved.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe not.\" Ami said softly. \"We don't know what caused the problem. This might happen every time she transforms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe looks she received from the other scouts ranged from alarmed to amused to embarrassedly lustful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Poor Usagi.\" Minako repeated, a little bit of laughter in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Poor Usagi.\" Rei repeated, a little longing in hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm....\" Ami began. \"I don't think you understand. There's a danger...this won't just happen to her...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow there was uniform alarm and terror on every face. Except Artemis, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha...what do we know about these transformations?\" Rei asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All I know about it is from the readings I took from Usagi. The transformation enters a sort of....continuous flux towards the end of the process...as usual, Usagi assumed her original incarnation's power and strength...as well as certain esoteric changes....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn increase in breast size and toning of the muscles. Ami didn't need to explain, and no one wanted to think too hard about any 'enhancements' in that arena if the end result was going to be public nudity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it failed to provide the last part of the costume. It was like a program going into a read error....the brooch was constantly trying to find the last bit of 'data' on her appearance, and couldn't...so it went into a kind of loop. That's why when she found the towel, the brooch made it vanish like the rest of her clothes. To the brooch's way of thinking, she wasn't done transforming, so it stripped her of the towel just like it would any other civilian covering.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you think this might happen to any of us??\" Rei asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not finished.\" Ami warned. \"The transformation was able to provide her with her usual magic...but the 'loop' meant there was a small but constant flow of mystical power running through her body from the moment she became Sailor Moon. Using her attacks heightened that flow by a factor of ten...and it only became more intense with each use of her powers. Trying to use the towel to cover herself created another 'surge' of magical energy\" Ami said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that energy lethal?\" Luna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...no. At least...I don't think it could become dangerous unless she spent an absurdly long period of time as Sailor Moon...she would essentially have to build up so much energy it would be draining all the magic from the Imperium Crystal at once. That would take years...or several thousand 'surges' from attacks or clothes being swallowed up.\" Ami said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why is this important?\" Rei asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The magic...does have a noticeable affect on the body.\" Ami said, blushing and gazing intently at her hands. \"The power has an effect like...morning wood. It creates an intense feeling of arousal...and that feeling only became more overpowering the longer Usagi was transformed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a long silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...what your saying is...if any of us transform...we might end up naked in front of our enemies...and any attempt at fighting those enemies means...\" Makoto said. aghast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll get horny.\" Rei said softly. Memories of her little stroll two days ago...not to mention everything else she did, were coming back to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"......there's more.\" Ami said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was staring at her now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Usagi wasn't able to simply turn back to normal. Instead she had to...perform a task. I had to watch her...spanking herself. If my readings are correct....and she underwent a similar transformation...the 'task' would change from transformation to transformation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you have no way of knowing what the task will be...\" Minako began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...until you transform. Yes.\" Ami said softly. \"And....whatever clothes she was wearing or coverings she tried to use...don't seemed to be returned when she reverted back to Usagi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Wonderful.\" Makoto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Given the circumstances, I don't want any of you transforming.\" Luna said at last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" All the girls said at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't know what other effects this altered state might have. From the information provided alone...what if the task to return to normal involved hurting yourselves? Or one another? We can't take the risk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually....\" Ami said. \"Usagi and I are going to do it tomorrow.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna gazed at her in surprise and irritation, not used to her orders being countermanded...especially not by Ami.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to run more tests, and we can establish whether the problem will reoccur, and whether it only applies to Usagi.\" Ami said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely not.\" Luna said sternly. \"Artemis and I will research the matter...if this has ever happened before, we'll learn what the solution was and that will be the end of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Luna...\" Ami began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No arguments.\" Luna said. \"You girls are too...I don't want anything else to happen to any of you. Not after Galaxia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....All right.\" Ami said.</span></div></div>",

I don't like sneaking around behind her back either. But we just fought off a major attack on this planet, and you had a fight with some completely unknown enemy. If there's some new problem with our magic or transformations, we can't afford not to know as much about that problem as possible.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tha-that's easy for you to say! I'm the one who had my butt on full display two days in a row now!\" Usagi whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, hopefully that won't happen this time.\" Ami said, returning to her console.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-is that thing ready yet?\" Usagi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just try to relax. No one uses this locker room except the film students, and they hardly ever need it. The only reason I have a key is because a friend let me burrow hers.\" Ami said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what if someone...wait, friend?\" Usagi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi paused and glanced at her puzzled expression. \"What? I'm not allowed to make friends?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, of course...but since when have you ever had the time?\" Usagi asked, then a mischievous expression came over her face. \"You've been keeping him secret from us, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi reddened substantially an coughed. \"I have not. And its not a 'he' in any case.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi cocked an eyebrow. She smelled blood in the water. \"All right. So who's this 'girl' you haven't told anyone about? And why'd she let you borrow her key?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's a photographer. She has a project she's working on and...and I might help her with it.\" Ami said evasively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh. So, what's this project all about?\" Usagi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...How are things with you and Mamarou going?\" Ami asked, her blush bright and her tone dark. \"Have you talked to him recently?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...\" Usagi said, a hurt look coming over her face. \"Not yet. I tried to call him, but he's not picking up his phone and...I couldn't think of any messages to leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should call him again.\" Ami advised. \"It would be better if he heard the story from you and not some internet site.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"i know. I just...I don't want to upset him. I'm worried....\" Usagi said. \"You don't think he's angry with me, do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi looked up at her. \"He might be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi bit her lip. That wasn't exactly the reassurance she had hoped for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, he can't be too mad...at least not once he hears the whole story. Its not like I had any choice-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You kissed a girl in front of everyone. Passionately. And you tried to have sex with her afterwards.\" Ami said, her eyes focused on the computer screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey! You said yourself something weird was happening to me! I couldn't help it!\" Usagi said in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and you just want him to accept that? That's something I could expect from Minako or Makoto...or even Rei. But I thought you were....\" Ami trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa!\" Usagi said, tears threatening in her eyes. \"And...and I would have expected this from Luna or Rei...or even Haruka! But...I thought you would understand!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Usagi...\" Ami said tensely, packing up her computer. \"You're our leader. You know your future- you've been to NeoTokyo. You've seen the kingdom you and Tuxedo Mask are supposed to build. Your daughter lived with you for two years! She fought as one of us for two years! Your in love with Mammouru, your will is stronger than any of ours, you know everything your supposed to do and everything thats at stake...and none of that was more important to you than the sex?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow there really were tears in Usagi's eyes. Ami couldn't meet her gaze. She was being harsh, probably too harsh with the girl. Sex wasn't something she was used to, and no enemy of had ever used it as a weapon the way this one had. But Ami, sadly, had a vision in her mind of Sailor Moon and Tuxedo Mask living happily ever after...something beautiful and romantic like a bedtime story. Usagi was the girl who had killed Queen Beryl, who had saved their future, who had believed in Sailor Saturn when no one else dared...who had reached that sliver of humanity left in Galaxia's heart and drawn it out. Ami had never been completely sure of herself, whether all her studying would matter or if she was wasting her time. But she had been sure about Usagi, what she was and what she was going to be. And most recently, there had been hints of the maturity and grace Ami had seen in the future Neo-Queen Serenity in Usagi's clumsy actions...hints of the woman Usagi would become. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat if all of that was for nothing? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....let's get this over with.\" Usagi said, hurt still in her eyes. Ami winced, but nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead and take your clothes off. We'll leave them in the lockers so we have something to change back into once we transform. Hopefully that will be simple.\" Ami said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi nodded, still nursing a little pout on her face.Being upset and a little angry seemed to carry her through most of the stripping process, but by the time her tiny white bra and panties had to come off she was slowing down and visibly blushing at the prospect. Ami was even worse, her fingers seeming to move in slow motion. The two glanced at each other, then back to the pile of clothes on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here...\" Ami said at last, tossing a small towel Usagi's way. \"If its just a normal transformation, neither of us will have to be naked when we turn back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi nodded as she stripped off her underwear beneath the towel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" Usagi said, wrapped in her towel and looking at Ami. \"...On three?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One. Two. Three.\" Ami said, raising her wand above her head with one hand and clutching her towel with the other. \"Mercury Crystal Power, Make Up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Moon Cosmic Power, Make Up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo pillars of light, one a light pink and the other azure blue, filled the small locker room. A moment later, the light faded. Ami nodded to herself. The transformation didn't feel any different. That was a goo-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eek!\" She squeeked as she glanced down at herself. Well, that settled that. She was very naked, only wearing her gloves, crown, and boots...accessories that only served to make the rest of her feel all the more exposed. She immediately covered perky breasts and unshaven sex with her hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew this would happen!\" Usagi wailed, mirroring her posture and her nudity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...this is fine! I'll just take the readings we need and we'll figure out how to turn back and that will be the end of it.\" Ami said. \"Just sit down over there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine where I am!\" Usagi said, blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....does it still hurt?\" Ami asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't need to worry about-\" Usagi began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"USAGI!\" Ami snapped. \"I know your upset with me, but please just answer the question. It'll go faster that way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....it still hurts to sit. A little.\" Usagi admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me see.\" Ami said. Usagi sighed and turned around. There was still a red burn across both ass cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think there will be any permanent damage.\" Ami said, coming closer. \"In fact, it will probably heal when we turn back to normal...it tends to accelerate how fast we recover from injury...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi tenderly touched the spot, eliciting a little gasp from Usagi, followed quickly by a sigh of relief as Ami patted the spot gingerly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That does feels nice.\" She sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi smiled a bit, looking at the wound clinically. Maybe she should find some ointment once they were done here....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh...excuse me.\" A voice came from behind the pair. In unison Usagi and Ami froze in place and slowly looked in the direction of the voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on here?\" The voice demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi realized her hand was still on Usagi's butt, and had bent forward to give her friend access, in the process causing her breasts to jut out in front of her. The two blushed uncontrollably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was it?</span></div></div>",

The pair scrambled to put a little distance between each other, Usagi clumsily rising to her feet and standing at attention. Their faces blazing, the pair belatedly began covering their exposed naked bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a girl standing in front of them, a surprised yet bemused look on her face. Usagi glowered when she realized the girl was openly leering at them, unabashedly looking over the pair and was obviously enjoying their embarrassment. Under other circumstances Usagi would have been the one to gawk. This girl was obviously something else- it was like someone had crossbred Hotaru and Rei's facial features, then proceeded to give her the fashion sense of the Sailor Starlights with a little advice from Mistress Nine....dressed all in black, with a low cut teeshirt that exposed her cleavage and her firm stomach and something around her waste that might classify as a miniskirt if you added a few dozen inches to the hemline. She wore a leather jacket over this outfit and long fishnet stockings under her skirt. Her navel and tongue were pierced, and Usagi could make out part of a tattoo on the part of her breast currently visible. A large, expensive looking camera dangled from her neck. Long purple and red streaks ran through her black hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know the crazy thing?\" The girl asked after a moment. \"Between all the weird props and eccentric models and the generally bizarre shit my fellow photographers like to store in here between shoots, I had honestly thought I could never be surprised by what I find in here. But two naked Sailor Scouts feeling each other up? Gotta say...its good to be wrong for a change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi gaped at the girl as she casually lit a cigarette, continuing to check the two of them out even as she sucked on the tip. What the hell was up with this girl? Maybe the two of them should...Usagi paused when she saw Ami's stricken look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no. Don't be silly. We're not-\" Ami stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spare me.\" The girl said, blowing out a puff of smoke. \"Sure, I might buy that one of my brethren wants to do a little shoot with two models dressed as the senshi. Lord knows we have enough perverts in this school who'd love to do that...aw, fuck, who am I kidding? I'd love to do that myself....but two models who look EXACTLY like the scouts, down to the eye color and the height and the exact way the moon girl tries to hide her big titties without realizing her left nipple is popping out? Please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi glanced down at herself, squeeled in alarm and adjusted the hand she had slapped across her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, we don't want any trouble....\" Ami began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hush up. You won't get any from me. I might admire the view, but I have better things to do than hassle two girls who could light me on fire or electrocute me or something. Besides, with any luck you aren't the only cuties I'll be seeing naked tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not the only....\" Ami trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You aren't even a little worried?\" Usagi demanded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should I be?\" The girl asked. \"I figured if something was gonna explode or some monster was gonna tear my clothes off, it would have happened already. Although I do have to ask...why are you two here? And why are you running around naked?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Funny thing is...we're trying to figure that out ourselves.\" Usagi muttered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No shit? Well, best of luck. I know I'd be pretty embarrassed to run around town with everything hanging out like that...not that we don't appreciate your efforts....\" The girl said, walking around the pair and eyeing their naked butts admiringly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...what other 'cutie' are you hoping to see tonight?\" Mercury asked in a small voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Oh, don't worry about her. She's adorable as hell, but she's harmless. Trust me, she'll be more embarrassed to see you two like this than you will be. You won't even know we're here, promise.\" The girl said. \"She's supposed to call me soon. I'm hoping I can sweet talk her into coming by...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said she was going to be naked?\" Mercury persisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah...hopefully. I can talk her into practically anything. I just need to make sure she can't just run off...she's skittish like that....but trust me, if I can get her cornered...off come the clothes, and click goes the camera.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-why would you do that to her?? Is that all she means to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me? What business is it of yours?\" The girl snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None whatsoever.\" Mercury muttered. \"I didn't realize you were that sort of person. That's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, fuck you, Sailor Nude. Don't even think about judging me. I mean...okay, maybe I'm planning to throw her into the deep end of the pool here, but you don't fucking know this girl, okay? She seems like this bookish, repressed, shy as shit girl...but there's way more to her than that. I just want to have some fun with her.  If she wants to go to a movie or get dinner or any of that down to earth crap...that's her call, you know? I just want to get her attention, okay? I just wanna see what she's like when she loosens up...whatever happens after that isn't important.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't believe that. You should be honest with her. You should trust her. She could surprise you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....just fuck off. Do whatever you came here to do and leave, all right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" Ami pulled Usagi away as the goth girl grumbled to herself. Usagi was looking at Ami appraisingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...good thing she doesn't recognize you, huh?\" She said at last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi blanched. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Its...there's a magic that shrouds people's perception of us. They can recognize us as sailor scouts, and they might have a vague notion of the similarity when we transform back, but there's a kind of barrier that prevents most people from making the direct connection. They see you and think 'that hair looks a little like Sailor Moon', not 'hey, that girl is really Sailor Moon!'. Its why it took so long for us to realize who Tuxedo Mask was....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I know its serious. You don't ever get this analytical about stuff you know I already know unless your really upset about something.\" Usagi said grimly. \"She's your photographer friend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daria.\" Ami said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you had no idea....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So....what now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....I'm going to leave the next move up to her.\" Ami said, her eyes watery.</span></div></div>",

Why they had to complicate something as basic as sex was beyond the alien little creature. Breed with who you desire. That was a simple enough creed to follow. Why the human race chose to cram their relationships full of rituals and emotions and questions about commitment was a philosophical question the little cat had struggled with since the moment his race had become aware of humanity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, the little thing mused, why complain about a good thing. If humanity didn't have a propensity for complicating every little aspect of their culture, then something as simple as stripping a couple of attractive females of their clothes would not return such vast amounts of energy to him and his masters. Their shame and their humiliation, and most of all the secret little thrill of pleasure and desire that filled them at just how wrong it all was...these were all key to his plans. And speaking of which....it was time to move yet another pawn into position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat leapt over several lockers, stalking to the back of changing area. The back half of the photographer's locker room had become a kind of defacto storage facility, props and backgrounds strewn about waiting to be used or left abandoned and forgotten by irresponsible film students. The cat glanced from one item to another. Then, purring to itself, it leapt off the lockers and began padding up to a large feathered fan, not unlike the kind one might see being used by a slave to cool a Greek Emperor. The cat breathed a black, demonic vapor from its lips into the item, which began to twist and jerk and take on a wicked form of a feathered woman with wings where her hands might be and a dull red light shining in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Skieleth, by your name and your essence I bind you to this mortal item.

It remembered the battle like a distant dream. Its body then had been larger, more mobile, stronger and dangerous and...with the proper 'appendages' it would need to carry out its conquest and obtain the energies its masters needed. This...this was more than any simple downgrade in status. This body was intended as an outright insult. It was clearly made to mimic one of the pathetic things from this side of the portal...soft and curvy and bouncy...with those curious (albeit enticing) globes up top and the slit below made to receive the pleasures the incubus had to offer...whether asked for or not! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, those self same weak creatures were the ones that had torn the incubus in half in its last life....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe memory of that battle sent a shiver of rage through the monster. With a soft hiss it lightly took to the air, softly landing atop a locker and peering over the side. Ahh, yes...there they were...two of them. The blue one was typing on her computer, while the awful yellow headed bitch in the red and blue looked on anxiously. The incubus raised an eyebrow as it watched the two. For some reason, they had divested themselves of their battle regalia...in a way that left to best parts of this wretched species completely and delightfully exposed. But why...ahhh...there was a wisp of incubus magic about the pair. An act of revenge, then? Except...that was hardly a high enough price...the pair deserved so much more...they all did...but their current predicament clearly had the two distressed. Given their last victory, the incubus reasoned that a little time to gather power...and the creature did have to admit there was some merit in letting the two stew in their own shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich left the third one, the leather clad female The one fiddling with that apparatus...that camera. Skieleth was starting to acclimate to this dimension, and the object that it had merged with. This girl was named Daria....and she had a few *interesting* habits the incubus approved of. However, what the creature decidely did not approve of was that Daria had far more scraps of cloth covering her than the two sailor scouts...perhaps enticing and provocative to the fools of this world, but not at all to the taste of the creature. That, of course, was easily remedied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut how to get her away from the others....?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Daria took a deep breath. All her equipment was in place. She had the lens she wanted hooked up to the camera...and in case things went really well, she had the MUCH BIGGER lens close at hand so she could switch at a moment's notice. The memory card was empty and ready to record a full session, the settings were tweaked just right, the battery was fully charged. Everything was perfect...just like it had been the last five times she'd gone over her inventory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoddamn sexy stuck up naked sailor scouts. For two girls who were running around naked, the blue haired girl was a giant prude. And way more shy about her nudity than she was with her opinions. It wasn't like Daria was going to take advantage of Ami...maybe a few liberties...but nothing she wouldn't do willingly....okay, maybe with a little persuasion...and some gentle manipulation....fucking sailor scouts. What if the nosy naked bitch was right? What if she pushed her too far and really screwed things up? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaria sighed and put her camera down before she threw it across the room. She was feeling a little guilty about her intentions, and that was making her nervous. Daria felt that either emotion was unworthy of her. Yes, she tended to relish the brief striptease she managed to coax out of her models. Yes, she tended to soak in the embarrassment she put her often unsuspecting victims through. But it wasn't as if she did anything with the pictures...at least not until the model was comfortable with other people seeing them. Not like some bitches in this school....no, Daria might push a girl out of her comfort zone, but her models were always safe in her hands. And sometimes, if she thought her model was cute and bold enough, she might take things beyond simple photography...she'd ended more than one photo shoot with a bit of passionate sex. And one day she just might fulfill her ultimate fantasy...to be completely lost in a bought of lovemaking while her camera rolled. She'd never had the guts to do it...she had never found a girl she trusted enough to let herself be photographed naked on the same reel. And she did have an irrational fear that some sadistic pervert might find the camera and blackmail her and her lover into doing all kinds of humiliating things...paranoid, certainly, but one can never be too careful in a world full of reincarnated moon princesses, talking cats, and extra dimensional horrors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaria stamped her foot. One way or another, she wanted to resolve this. Whether she listened to the nagging voice inside her and played straight with Ami or not, she couldn't do anything until she heard back from the girl. It wasn't like Ami to keep a friend waiting, and now Daria was conscious of every passing minute. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, sailor sluts! I need a smoke break. Don't touch anything while I'm gone, okay?\" Daria muttered as she rose to her feet. She ignored the worried look the nice blonde girl gave her and especially the pointed way the blue haired one refused to look at her as she poured over her little space computer. Instead she walked out, letting the door slam behind her with a thud. She quickly pulled out her cell phone and began pacing up and down the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Ames....just pick up...\" Daria pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove her, the incubus smiled.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Hey Ami....this is Daria. I know I probably left a half-dozen messages on your machine by now...sorry. Just really need to talk to you. So please call me back as soon as possible, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaria hung up her phone dejectedly. She knew she had to reign herself in. If she let herself, she was going to keep on calling until she filled up Ami's inbox with messages. And that was just going to make her look desperate...or crazy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of which...why are you agonizing over this girl again? You two have barely had a chance to talk about anything outside of school. Sure, she's cute, and shy girls are always fun to play with, but...\" Daria mumbled to herself as she took out a cigarette and fumbled for her lighter. \"Okay...maybe 'play with' is a bad way to put it, but still...I know there's all kinds of fun we could have if I...why won't she answer, dammit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaria lit her cigarette and slowly took in the smoke. Okay...okay...maybe something came up. Maybe she should just shelve this little photoshoot for some other time and talk to Ami tomorrow. Or at least keep herself occupied while she waits\u2026by doing something other than talking to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove her the incubus watched with a dark glint in its eye. It was time...the creature opened its mouth and lightly bit down on one of the long black feathers that made up its wings. With a light jerk of its chin, the creature plucked the feather from its wing and let it flutter away. Moments later, the feather jerked upright and began to zip towards the leather clad girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaria was finishing up her cigarette when she yelped in shock. Something had brushed right along her belly, sweeping right over her navel. She blushed a little at the outburst. Aside from her penchant for luring girls into a photoshoot and then seducing them out of their clothes and onto her memory card, Daria had a couple other major secrets she had no interest in sharing with the outside world. The first was that the 'tough biker chick' attitude she sported was much more an act than most people realized. Yes, she enjoyed the leather and the tattoos and piercings...but the truth? She liked being in control, and liked how people responded to her look and her attitude. As much as she got a naughty thrill from wandering around with so much skin and without any underwear, she'd never dare do it if people weren't convinced she would break them in half if they tried anything or looked too long. Only her ex-girlfriends knew how much of a front that was (and you had better believe they made her work for their silence on that front).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last big secret she kept...was how ticklish she was, especially over her tattoos and along her piercings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe covered her mouth and quickly stamped out her cigarette. As she did, she heard the click of high heels and the giggling of voices down the hall. She sighed in exasperation. Most of the photographers in the department she could get along with, even the stuffy 'professional artiste' types. But the little group coming towards her was an important exception. Josie was from England, and she had brought a certain high born air of superiority that had drawn in the worst sort of friends...minions, really. That alone was no reason to loathe her the way Daria did...but Josie and her had one thing in common. They loved getting their models out of their clothes. The difference was that Daria always coaxed her girls into getting naked, not badgered and bullied...and she didn't make a habit of publishing the photos if the girls didn\u2018t want them published. Daria had decided to give the stuck up blond bitch a taste of her own medicine and seduced her into modeling for her. Knowing Daria's reputation and never one to pass up free sex, Josie had been enthusiastic about the shoot and confused when the session ended abruptly. The next day she had been horrified to see the pictures circulating all over the school. The girl's reputation had been dead since then, but she had done all she could to be a pain for Daria ever since.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not what I fucking need right-ACK!\" Daria squeeled as something flicked its way along the length of her back. Turning around she found...a feather...floating in the air like a mesquitoe. Daria stared in stunned silence a moment, then gasped as the feather darted directly at her navel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ack! Nonono!\" Daria screamed as the feather ran along the length of her tight stomach. She clapped her hands together, trying to swat the feather like a fly, but it easily avoided her and shot up the sleeve of her jacket. This sent Daria into hysterics as her little tormentor went wild inside the confines of her jacket, swirling up her arm until it found her armpit, then darting from one piece of bare flesh to another as she tried to catch it. Finally, screaming the girl flung her jacket across the hallway, so it landed at the feet of the stunned group of onlookers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaria was breathing hard. As she stood there breathing in, her small tank top showing off her large breasts and her tiny skirt hugging her thighs, she ground her teeth. Josie was smirking at her maliciously, clearly enjoying her loss of composure and how much bare skin she had on display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Daria.\" The curly haired blond girl said. \"Having that psychotic breakdown we all knew was coming?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaria glared at the girl, then returned her malicious smile. \"Could be. That ugly little pinched up face of yours could screw up anyone's head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie gasped and seethed at the girl. Really, there was nothing ugly about Josie...lovely long legs, cut little pouty face, and large and bouncy breasts. But Daria wasn't above pushing her buttons when she got uppity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway...much as I love hanging out with the wonder sluts I have better things to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaria gasped again. Something was brushing her navel again! Not now, dammit! She backed up, but tripped and fell on her butt, causing her breasts to bounce uncontrollably in her top. The girls immediately burst out laughing, much to her rage. And the damned feather was still tormenting her bellybutton! Growling, Daria tried to snatch the feather from the air...and it dodged right into her clevage and down her top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god no!\" Daria squeeled as the feather danced inside her top, seeming to tickle every inch of her sensitive breasts at once. She laughed uncontrollably, her face flushed.  The girls stopped laughing and stared on in fascination as Daria clutched at her boobs and tried to find a way to pluck the monster out of her tight fitting clothes. In only a few seconds she was going absolutely insane! She tore the top off her body, too desperate for relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith dread, she looked at Josie's smile of delight. She and her cronies were already getting their cameras out. Daria blushed intensely and turned on her heel, running down the hall awkwardly in her high heels while hugging her naked breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer legs buckled beneath her as something attacked the back of her knees with ticklish malice. \"No! Fuck! NNOOOOOO!\" Daria screamed as she felt the feather leap up into her skirt. She could feel something running up and down her butt cheeks, racing across the sensitive flesh. One hand pulled on her little skirt, the other shot down into her skirt trying to catch the unwanted invader. This left her breasts on full display and bouncing as she squirmed in all directions. Daria was suddenly blinded by the glare of a half dozen cameras. She blushed in complete shame, realizing she had just been caught on her knees, her tits on full display, her face flushed and with a strained smile, and a hand down her skirt. She looked like she was sitting in the school hall half-naked and playing with herself. And Josie had it on film.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had no time to lament this situation as the feather's antics redoubled, and Daria's sense of her surroundings fled as she tried desperately to stop it. All the while the bitches were circling around her, taking snapshots of her exposed tits and her bouncing butt glimpsed beneath the skirt. And just when things couldn't get any worse...the feather brushed along the sensitive lips of her sex. Screaming, Daria grabbed her skirt in both hands and ripped it down the middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had time to realize she was on her knees, completely naked except for her shoes, and that her worst enemy was getting shots of her that she had zealously avoided giving to even her girlfriends. And then the bell rang.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Ami....just how long do I have to do this?\" Usagi whined, standing one leg and holding the other against her body like a ballerina stretching. Her transformation gave her better reflexes and flexibility in her limbs, but it was still difficult to hold a single pose for an extended period of time, even without her own inborn clumsiness that no amount of magic seemed able to banish. In this case, though, her discomfort came more from the fact that the pose was forcing her to expose even more of her private places to casual view than the transformation already required. Even if the only one who would see was Ami, this felt lewd and embarrassing. The fact that she was feeling more and more turned on by the exposure and the transformation weren't helping either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Usagi, be quiet! I have to concentrate.\" Ami snapped. \"The computer can't get a solid reading on your energy output, and we won't learn how to change back until it does that. So please just stay still and try to let me scan your aura....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I look like a TV antenna to you? How long do I have to stay like this before you pick up a signal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A few minutes at least....no, this one isn't working either. Try doing a hand stand while making a splits with your legs...\" Ami said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi blanched, then grumbled as she did a hand stand, leaving her pussy well exposed and causing her breasts to jut out dramatically. \"Are you sure this isn't just an excuse like your friend is using, to get me into the worst possible poses so you can check me out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi looked up at Usagi sharply, then blinked and blushed profusely and quickly turned back to her monitor. \"You...you seem to get a stronger reading the more...exposed you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi stared at her, then giggle to herself. \"But you still can't help but look just a little, can you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi didn't look up this time. \"Usagi, please! Try to be a little more serious!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi paused, then flipped back up into a standing position. \"You seem to be serious enough for both of us today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Usagi, I wasn't finish- hey!\" Ami snapped as Usagi lightly plucked the blue visor off her face and looked at her squarely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no. I'm not doing any more poses unless you get up and do them with me. Got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to measure...\" Ami began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know for a fact you can get that thingy to measure my energy by itself. Maybe two of us will give off a stronger reading.\" Usagi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But-\" Ami began, until Usagi gently pushed her down on the bench and took up a position opposite her. To Ami's bewilderment, Usagi pushed herself up against Ami so that their legs were intertwined and their sexes were pressing against each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-Usagi! This is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The more embarrassing, the better, right?\" Usagi snapped. Both girls paused, then blushed profusely. With the transformation causing a small but ever increasing feeling of arousal, sex wasn't far from either girl's mind, and the position Usagi had selected made it impossible not to notice the wetness between their legs. It took a massive amount of will power not to push their sexes more tightly together that very moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...are you going to tell me what the problem is?\" Usagi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....what problem?...what are you talking about? This isn't any different from studying. I'm just trying to focus and find an answer to this problem.\" Ami said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you study this hard, it means your upset and you're trying to focus on the work to avoid thinking about it.\" Usagi said in a voice like she was quoting something from memory. Ami sighed softly to herself. While some people counted Usagi as naive or even stupid, she had an almost uncanny ability to read people when it came to emotions, and that sense had only become more finely tuned as she had matured. Most of the time Ami counted it as an asset to the team- if she was the mind and Makoto was the muscle, Usagi was undoubtedly the heart of the sailor scouts. RIght now though, she wished Usagi really was as naive as she used to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose I'm a little upset by Daria....\" Ami began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd believe that, except you've had that same look on your face all morning, and you snapped at me before she even showed up. I've seen you show more patience with people who have done worse thing to you than she did...including our enemies. So what is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi sighed at the absurdity of the situation. Here they were, naked, aroused, and posing on a bench like they were in the middle of having sex, and Usagi picked now to play psychologist? On the other hand, this did make her a captive audience, after a fashion...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Usagi...its just...please don't ask-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you mad at me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair looked up as a scream came from out in the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaria was surrounded on all sides by wide eyed students. At first everyone had been shocked and appalled by the situation. But Josie had taken charge of things remarkably quickly. First there came the click of cameras. She tried to cover herself, and found herself rolling on the floor screaming with laughter as the feather tormented her for a full minute. An attempt to dash away from the crowd resulted in her being herded right back to the exact spot by the feather, her legs unable to get very far without falling over from the tickling. Then came the poses, as directed by Josie and enforced by feather. Daria on all fours like a dog. Daria with her beautiful butt sticking out. Daria playing with her breasts. If she refused, the feather would force her to laugh and squeel and gyrate for the assembled students, which was worse than the poses in her mind. Now she was on her knees, her left hand running up and down her pussy, while hundreds of cameras were recording every moment. Why did she have to major in photography? She was in the one place on campus that guaranteed almost everyone would be carrying something to get her picture with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe incubus sighed. This was fun, sure, but it was also kind of boring....time to make things more interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden breeze blew out of nowhere. Josie and her two lackies found their skirts up around their wastes. Shrieking they made a grab for them, but already the flashes were going off. Embarrassed, the three looked around in confusion...and then another huge gust came out of nowhere and knocked them to their knees. This one kept up the pressure....and suddenly three skirts were flying down the hallway! The blondes squeeled in alarm, but another gust seemed to pick them up and spinn them around. First jackets flew off in a random diection, then the buttons on their shirts popped and sprayed everywhere, then the shirts themselves, and finally an errant bra. The three crashed back to earth, trembling and rising to their feet, stumbled around drunkenly in white and black panties. Hundreds of cameras went off before the dizziness had subsided and the realization of their large naked breasts being on display settled in. Three pairs of hands awkwardly covered their chests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaria glared. Horribly embarrassed or no, the playing field was not yet quite equal. Sneaking up behind the three, Daria grabbed each minions last garment in one hand apiece and yanked down. Twin shrieks of horror echoed throughout the halls. The pair instantly tried to pull their panties back up, but an errant breeze snatched them away. Josie whirled around, still covering herself. Daria's eyes locked with her own, and Josie saw a hunger for blood. Turning around she made a mad dash. Daria was too quick. Grabbing her panties, she yanked upwards, giving her a massive wedgie. Exposing her butt cheeks, Daria held the black panties in one hand and spanked with the other. Finally, she tore the panties away, leaving a red faced and red cheeked Josie completely naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, how about we-\" Daria began but was interrupted by a familiar tickling sensation. Josie smiled in relief, then yelped in surprise. A second feather was tickling her belly! Twin shrieks erupted from her minions as two more feathers began to torment them. The four girls began a gyrating, giggling dance in little circles, trying to catch the remorseless pests and entertaining everyone with their bouncing breasts and jiggling butts. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Enough.\" A voice said above them, shrill and chilling like a razor blade being scraped across ice. All at once the feathers stopped their light be insistent caresses. The four naked girls fell to the ground, out of breath and exhausted. Above them, a figure of a woman slowly flew to the ground. Her skin was pale with jet black hair. She was naked, a fact all too obvious with her large pale (almost ghostly) breasts and exposed slit. Her arms, however, ended on black wings rather than hands, and her feet became large talons like a bird. She was taller than most humans, and her mouth was turned up in a malicious grin with more teeth than she should have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its time for the next step, little girls.\" The thing hissed. \"Get up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaria felt the long tip of the feather press against her back. Whimpering, she rose to her feet. More feathers floated down, pressing menacingly against every sensitive bit of flesh she had, including a half dozen that hovered around each erect nipple and a trio that hovered mere centimeters from each jiggling but cheek. The way she was being ordered about and the press of all the feathers softly guiding her into whatever position the creature desired reminded Daria of one of those old hokey Tarzan movies, where the jungle explorer had been captured by a native tribe and was surrounded by spear points. She blushed at the image, realizing that the threat posed by the feathers was an absurd comparison to the dire threat of being impaled on a spear. And yet, subjected as she had been mere moments before to the onslaught of just one of the monster's feathers, Daria complied quickly and meekly to whatever the creature asked for. Thus she stood on tip toe, her hands over her head like a hostage held at gunppoint, her legs spread wide apart. No one dared make a sound, but she could see the suppressed look of delight on more than one student's face. The legendary Daria...naked and being bossed around by the threat of being tickled! She didn't want to give them the satisfaction, but it was all she could do to hold back her tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What shall it be next, ladies? Perhaps a few more lovely poses? Shall the blonds show themselves off as they made the black haired one do? Shall we make the camera girl give herself pleasure in front of everyone? Perhaps all four should...sample one another? Or allow the lookers to feel the bodies I've put on display?\" The monster mused. \"Or....\" It said with an awful grin. \"...perhaps we should resume the torments? Laugh until you spit out your little lungs, or until you choke on your own blood, or until your heart bursts. So many choices. Which do I like more...? Who gets to be ashamed, and who gets to die?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LEAVE THEM ALONE!\" Someone screamed from behind the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe students, hostages, and monster all looked in the direction the voice came from. There two figures stood, dramatically posed in the shadows. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laughter is the sound of a person's happiness and joy! It should be shared with friends and lovers! How dare you turn laughter into shame and mockey! We cannot forgive you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSailor Moon stepped into the light. She stood there dramatically, shouting her defiant condemnations at the monster as she had a thousand times before. This time one hand was crossed over her chest, the other hand balled into a fist that she shook at the monster. One leg was raised high up, positioned over her waste in such a way that it hid her bare sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Sailor Moon.\" She announced, so caught up in her usual zeal that only the barest hint of a blush betrayed the aura of confidence she projected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I am Sailor Mercury.\" Mercury said, stumbling with her words. She stood with her back almost completely to the crowd, her face turned toward the monster. One white gloved hand was snaking around her bare back to strategically hide the view of her naked butt from the staring eyes of the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the name of the moon...\" Usagi said, her balled fist rising up and pointing at the incubus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will punish you.\" Usagi and Ami said together, the blue haired girl awkwardly mimicking the pointing with the hand that covered her naked chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Where the hell have you two been??\" Daria said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...We...\" Ami said, blushing profusely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't wait so long to appear just so you could figure out the best way to pose dramatically while keeping your bodies covered...right?\" The incubus said in amusement. \"You know once the fight starts everyone will see everything anyway, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls blushed intensely. Then Usagi glared at the monster. \"That's okay, creep! This'll be over before you can blink!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wand appeared in her free hand. Sailor Moon stepped forward, then paused and blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...Ami....I don't have to do the whole cheerleader baton twirl thing to activate this, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".......\" Ami paused, gritting her teeth. \"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, good.\" Usagi said brightly, aiming her wand at the monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We didn't have to do those poses either, you know....\" Ami muttered to herself, her whole body blushing at the sight of so many students witnessing her public exposure.</span></div></div>",

A deafening scream filled the whole building as long black feathers scattered in all directions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! Take that yo...u.\" Sailor Moon said, in the midst of a victory pose with her hands cocked into fists at her hips, but quickly covered herself, reddening. \"Eep!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi crisscrossed her hands over her own body, gingerly using her arm to hide her exposed nipples while covering her face with her hand. \"You have to be more careful, Us...Sailor Moon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I only forgot I was naked for a sec..oh!\" Sailor Moon said, suddenly stumbling on her feet as if she were about to faint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sailor Moon! Are you all right? What's...\" Ami stopped and blushed profusely as she saw Usagi tremble, her hands softly massaging her covered nipples and ever so slightly rubbing the sensitive space between her legs. \"S-sailor moon...don't....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-its okay! I just forgot h-how much it...tingles after I do my attac...\" Usagi stopped in confusion as Ami closed the space between them, practically falling on top of the other girl in gesture that who's original intent might have been to help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AM...MERCURY! Are you okay??\" Usagi said in alarm, as the two girls flailed with each other and the smaller blue haired girl ended up straddling a prone Usagi. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I....\" Ami mumbled, rubbing her sex against Usagi's own a moment before blushing crimson. \"I...think...we're linked to each other...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So....\" Usagi said, as Ami's face hovered inches from her own. \"Even if only one of us uses our powers....we both get...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi stared at Usagi a moment, hovering drunkenly in front of her, then took in a little breath and pulled herself off the blond girl. The gesture was met with groans of disapproval from the crowd and secret pangs of regret from both Sailor Senshi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its...more intense than I realized.\" Ami said softly. \"I knew what the readings were...but seeing the numbers and actually feeling it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? I told you....\" Usagi began, but a soft and harsh laugh began to echo around the girls. Looking up, they noticed at last that the feathers Usagi had scattered earlier had not settled back to earth. No idea, they all seemed to hover in midair, each one pointing at the two naked heroines. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The two girls rose to their feet, pressing their backs together. Sailor moon held her wand to her body defensively, fidgeting under all the stares but still alert. Mercury's blue visor appeared over her eyes, scanning the area for any sign of the enemy (all the while knowing that the crowd was scanning HER!). Both girls had their nubile young bodies on display, avoiding the instinct to cover up. The enemy might lash out at any moment. They had to defend themselves! This also kept their hands out of range of the more intimate areas of their bodies, as the ever growing feeling of arousal had an insidious and subtle way of coaxing them to obey the instinct to touch and tease their exposed breasts and aching clits. Unfortunately, this not only let everyone see them naked, it also made everyone aware of their state of mind. Including the incubus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, my, my....\" The mocking voice swept around them, changing pitch and direction as if it were carried on a wandering breeze. \"Have you gotten cold, little sailors? Or are you just happy to see us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth scouts turned red as their nipples hung high in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those nasty powers of yours don't seem to work on me as well as they should.\" The incubus observed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just wait!\" Usagi snapped. \"We can wear you down! Y-you won't be able to pull this trick forever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe laughter swept all around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Poor little girl. How little you know. I feed off your lusts. I thrive on your hungers. Look around you. Every eye is on you. Your naked bodies. They want you. They need you. And their need, your need...the more you struggle, the more you feed me. What about you? How long can you fight before your hunger overwhelms you?\" The incubus asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi hissed in a breath. It knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't listen.\" Ami whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But the longer we're like this, the more we'll need to...you know...\" Usagi stuttered. \"If we can't weaken it, how do we-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can find a weak point. Its well hidden, but my scanner will find it.\" Ami said confidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi took in a deep breath, debating whether to point out it hadn't had much luck finding a way to turn them back to normal, but suddenly the feathers around them began to accumulate and spin into one spot. The bird woman materialized above Daria and three naked blonds. Daria's eyes widened as the creature swooped down and clamped its taloned feet over her hands in a vice-like grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can feel the lusts within you rising like a tide. Your species is weak, you have no willpower. You'll give in to those urges soon. It will overpower you and make you helpless. This fight or these people won't matter. Where you are or who sees you won't matter. Not even your shame will matter. You will crave only pleasure, wherever, however you can have it. I will witness it. This fight will end on your knees, begging for release, asking for the humiliations I will heap upon you. I will have your obedience, your devotion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSailor moon blushed and glowered at the monster. \"Never!\" She said, brandishing the scepter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Ami screamed, grabbing her hand. The creature was rising into the air, Daria still dangling from her claws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This fight will not end so soon, little sailors. You need to suffer more. Consider it retribution.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Usagi asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let her go!\" Ami screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want her back, come for me! Catch me, if you can! If her life means anything to you, then come for me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn enormous rush of wind blew through the area. In the rush, the monster vanished with Daria. Usagi and Ami were left in the midst of the crowd, the doors out of the building bursting open like a miniature hurricane had erupted from them. Then two girls looked at one another, then began running after.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A bizarre sight was seen in the streets of Tokyo that morning. A flying monster was witnessed flying down the street, carrying in its claws a very attractive and very naked woman with red and purple streets running through jet black hair. As strange as it was, most of the witnesses were able to describe the creature and the girl in great detail when the news vans showed up later. This was due to the creature's periodic habit of stopping in front of large crowds and pausing to give the audience a good and close look at the prone girl. Both her hands were caught in the creature's taloned feet, meaning the only option she had was to try to draw her legs up to cover her nude sex and make awkward and ineffectual attempts to wrap into a little ball and hide her breasts behind her knees. This never worked for long, because the creature would beat its wings and shake the poor girl until she let her legs drop...and then shook her a bit more to provide a delicious jiggle in her pierced breasts. Then there would be an outburst down the street, and two girls would come running. The pair might have been sailor scouts, but they were both missing 80% of their expected garb. Beyond their crowns, gloves, and shoes they wore little else of interest and nothing at all of interest in terms of hiding their naked bodies. Breasts and butt bounced wildly as booted feet pounded the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Moon Tiara M-dammit!\" Sailor Moon screamed as the creature once more fled. \"Ami! Does the scanner say anything yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...no! She's moving too fast to...I don't have enough data to....NO!\" Ami screamed, ripping the blue visor off and slamming it to the ground. Usagi stopped, looking at her wide eyed. \"What's wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think!\" Ami snapped, tears in her eyes. \"I...none of this is working! The numbers make no sense! I..I can't...I'M USELESS!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-That's not-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"IT IS! I'm not stong like Makoto, I can't fight like Venus, I don't have any kind of spiritual sense like Rei-chan...and I can't reach out or reason with my enemies like you. All I do...what I'm supposed to be good for is study and analysis...AND WHERE IS THAT GETTING US?? I can't find any answers to what's happening to us or who these enemies are! I can't solve anything! I can't even help Daria!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi looked at her friend, her eyes wide, then she was nodding slowly. \"That's what was bothering you. You've been burning yourself out all morning trying to solve this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi trembled and stooped to pick up her visor. \"You...don't deserve this! You stopped Galaxia. You saved the world. You brought us all back to life. You...you've earned a happy ending! You and Tuxedo Mask. I thought...with all the books I read and studying...I could figure this out. Stop this before you have to sacrifice any more! If I'm good for anything...but I can't! I didn't work hard enough. I can't help you...I can't even help the one person who's shown any interest in...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi remained crouched on the ground, the visor in her hands, crying. Usagi marched forward and grasped her shoulder, lifting her to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry.\" She whispered. \"I...always come to you with my problems...I'm always distracting you or eating up your time asking for help with tests or...I'm sorry I was being selfish. I'm sorry I didn't see..you always seem so happy with your nose in a book or focusing on your studies..I never even thought..you were lonely...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Usagi...\" Ami stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You deserve happiness too.\" Usagi whispered urgently. \"More than me! Without you I couldn't have made it this far. Your smarter than I'll ever be. Without you...all of you...I'd never have won. Against Beryl or Galaxia. If I didn't know you...\" Usagi took a breath and looked directly at Ami. \"You deserve to be happy. You deserve to find someone too. And your going to get that chance. Ami...I won't let that thing hurt her. I'll protect her no matter what! I'll swear my whole kingdom on it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi fumbled for words, finally mouthing a little 'thank you', coming in close for a quick hug. Except Mercury found herself seeking out Usagi's lips instead. The two kissed, emphatically, passionately, desperately, for a moment. Then as one they opened their eyes and slowly separated, blushing all the while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-maybe we shouldn't mention that last part to Daria....\" Usagi whispered<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMercury nodded. \"Let's....get going. The only way to find a weakness is if I keep looking for one...right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi smiled broadly. \"See? You'll figure out how to win in no time! Your the brains of this team!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....and your its heart and soul.\" Ami said, too softly for Usagi to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n__________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross town, at a little shinto shrine, a low and menacing yowling was coming from the TV room. Rei held Luna in her lap, the black cat seething. The other girls cringed slightly, their eyes locked on the news reel as a monster flew with a naked hostage across the screen, followed by a blond and blue haired girl. The camera blanked out their bodies, but it was clear the pair were quite naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Maybe...\" Rei hesitated. \"Maybe they just saw this thing menacing someone and decided to change?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how exactly did they accomplish this feat without the Moon Crystal Brooch or the transformation wand, which I ordered to be kept HERE?\" Luna asked harshly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They were planning to do this from the beginning. I can't imagine either of them doing this without discussing it with the rest of you. You all knew about this.\" Luna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....maybe we did.\" Rei said, ignoring the looks of alarm the others gave her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Luna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we did. Maybe all of us have been carrying around our wands this whole time. Maybe Usagi and Ami were planning to study this 'glitch' on our powers today, because the more information we have the better off we'll be.\" Rei snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna glowered at her. \"I see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe disappointment in her voice stung, but Rei ignored it. \"And yes! That's dangerous. But so is avoiding gathering information! We have a new, powerful enemy! If we wait until the enemy forces us to fight we'll be in even more danger, especially if there are more unforeseen consequences to these powers than we already know! But even with all those dangers...we're still scouts! And...we can't just stand by and let people be hurt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even if that means running around naked?\" Artemis chimed in, attempting to play good cop and getting an acid glare from Minako and Luna for his trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, even then.\" Rei said, blushing a little, then looking pointedly at Luna. \"Even if it means that, or going against your orders. Which...we're prepared to do right now...if they need our help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....\" Luna paused, then moved up off Rei's lap. \"Very well. Do as you wish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Just like that?\" Rei asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hardly have the power to stop any of you. But if you have no further use for my words, I don't wish to waste them on any of you any further tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luna....\" Minako began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't\" Artemis said softly as the black cat padded out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei sighed. \"That...was harder than I thought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArtemis returned the sigh. \"She knew at some point you girls were going to outgrow her. Her whole purpose was to raise you all to be the new queens of the Solar System, after all. She'll be all right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should probably check on her anyway.\" Minako said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She'll want to be alone.\" Artemis said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Artemis...\" Minako said slowly, grasping the white cat in both hands and raising him up to her glowering face. \"Let me break this down. We might have to transform if our friends need help in this battle. Since Ami is naked, we can assume we ALL be naked. We also know the transformation destroys our street clothes. The only way to avoid that is to remove those clothes before transforming. But we don't want to transform unless we have to. So...because we like our outfits, and we want to be ready to leave at a moment's notice...CHECKING ON LUNA IS ABOUT TO BE INFINITELY HEALTHIER FOR CERTAIN WHITE MALE KITTIES THAN STAYING IN THIS ROOM, OR BEING ANYWHERE CLOSE ENOUGH TO THIS ROOM TO CONVINCE ME YOU'VE CAUGHT EVEN A GLIMPSE OF ANY OF US!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....maybe I should go check on Luna.\" Artemis said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Would you? Such a gentleman cat!\" Minako said, her voice taking on a syrupy sweet tone that almost covered the pure malice radiating from her. Artemis didn't linger in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So....I guess we should....\" Rei whispered, each girl glancing from one to the other. Sighing, they each began to strip of their clothes until the floor was littered with garments and none were left on their skin. The three stared at one another, each finding it difficult to tear her eyes away, and each realizing this fact in turn and slowly covering her private parts from view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...want to play a card game or something?\" Makoto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what? Strip poker?\" Minako responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei snickered, but her amusement didn't last long, as a loud pounding came to the door to her room.</span></div></div>",

We have to go now!\" Came a deep voice from the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuichiro?\" Rei asked, her tone waivering between irritation and confusion. The long haired man who had been working at her grandfather's shrine the last several years was occasionally prone to passionate outbursts to balance out his normally quiet nervousness around her. But the way he was pounding on her door and shouting was extreme even for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuchiro, we're going to need a min-AAH!\" Rei screamed as the door was opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO TIME! WE HAVE T-\" Yuchiro said as he burst into the room and stopped abruptly. Rei stared back, feeling his eyes on her. She froze in place, unsure of what to do. Her first instinct was to scream and shove the intruder back out of the room...that had been the result on the few occasions Yuichiro had stumbled on her in a state of undress until now. And yet, ever since her vision her instincts had felt sluggish and out of place. As such it was Yuichiro who turned away before she could even convince her hands to shield her naked body from him. Makoto and Minako had fled immediately for cover behind their chairs in the little sitting room, while she had simply stood like a deer in headlights while Yuichiro stared. She blushed profusely at that realization. Yuichiro, who had always hidden his crush for her terribly since their first meeting, had just seen her naked...completely...longer than anyone else she knew personally had ever seen her since she was a baby. While that hardly compared to her ordeal mere days before, in its own way it was just as awful and thrilling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rei-san...could you please get dressed?\" Yuichiro said at last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha..right!\" Rei said, realizing once again that she had been standing there in a stupor with only her hands to shield herself. Gathering up her clothes, she finally found the outrage that seemed to have abandoned her thus far. \"YUICHIRO! What have I told you about barging into a room without asking??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its your grandfather!\" Yuichiro said. \"He's collapsed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Rei asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's breathing, but he's feverish. I'm going to take him to the hospital. You should come with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" Rei said softly, drawing in a breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rei-chan, get dressed please.\" Yuichiro said authoritatively. Rei did so, blushing all the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead, Rei.\" Makoto whispered. \"We can handle it if things get bad. I'd go with you, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.\" Rei smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meet me at my car. I'll get your grandfather.\" Yuichiro said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right. Thank you.\" Rei said, bowing slightly. \"And...Yuichiro..about what we were doing....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Rei-san...if you'll forget I barged into the room, I won't ask what you were doing, all right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Okay. Let's just forget it ever happened.\" Rei said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuichiro glanced at her, and they both blushed intensely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHotaru was bored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glanced up from her notebook, her pencil in hand, to note that the clock had progressed roughly one centimeter further along than it had last time she checked. What was the teacher droning on about. Oh, the right of the hypotenuse. What was so hard about this again?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHotaru wasn't trying to be a difficult student. Nor was she trying to antagonize her fellow students. In fact, as far as school life went, she was doing relatively well this time around. Not that that was hard. Her 'first' time taking this course was in the midst of periodic seizures, awful dreams that kept her up at night, dealing with the loss of her mother and the psychotic breakdown of her father...oh yes, and being possessed periodically by an alien force intent on killing everyone. All things considered, this year was going pretty well by comparison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe problem was that she knew all of this forwards and backwards. She had her father's intelligence, and he had insisted on teaching her a variety of subjects at an early age. Professor Tomoe had once been a kind hearted and brilliant physicist, but his research led to the discovery of the alien Pharoah 90. Knowing what she knew now, Hotaru often wondered if the lab accident that killed her mother and caused Tomoe to make his deal with that monster wasn't really her fault in the end. Was it really a coincidence that the girl who would become the Sailor Scout of Silence and Death would also end up being plagued and used by the Death Busters? Did her father bring that misery down on her, or did she draw that misery to him thanks to her birthright?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, Pharaoh 90 was destroyed, and Hotaru should have died along with him. At that point she had been transformed into an older woman called Mistress 9 (both names coming from the chaotic label process of the Death Busters, using a mangled form of Tomoe's research methods). Chibi-Usa saved her mind and helped turn her powers on the Pharaoh. Sailor Moon, somehow, saved her soul...causing her to be reborn as a small child. The idea was for her to live peacefully with her father (who's memories were gone, but who's sanity had returned). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHotaru snickered to herself. A peaceful life for a sailor scout. Wishful thinking. Soon enough a new threat began to reach out through the mirrors of the world, intent on revenge. It threatened the life of Tuxedo Mask, which in turn threatened to erase Chibi-Usa from existence. Her one friend...Hotaru missed that girl. Bright eyed, naive but kind...that must have been why Hotaru started to grow. In a day she was as tall as a five year old, and knew as much as one. In a few more days she had a vision of herself as a Sailor Scout, telling her it was time to 'wake up'. And just like that, she remembered everything...the fire that killed her mother and injured her father, Chibi-Usa's kindness, Usagi's sacrifices for her....and she grew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat threat was dealt with, but it raised awkward questions. Who was she, where had she come from? As a result, she was having to take remedial classes to catch up with her class. That, combined with her quiet demeanor and weird parents (she was currently living with two openly gay women who, at the best of times, came off as overly arrogant and aggressive in their own aloof way) meant she had few friends despite being comparatively friendly towards her classmates. So her days were filled with being shunned and listening to lectures she knew more about than the professors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHotaru looked up at Mr. Williams, her professor. She sighed to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I see that notebook, Miss Tomoe?\" He asked. Hotaru sighed and passed the book to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....quite the little artist, aren't we? What is this?\" Williams asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Pegasus.\" Hotaru said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what is this sticking out of it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A glaive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That explains the red. Rather grim for a young girl, don't you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? I don't like Pegasus.\" Hotaru muttered to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any particular reason?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because one stole my best friend.\" Hotaru muttered, then noticed the teacher's expression. \"I mean...a boy who really liked this kind of horse conned my friend into thinking he cared about her, when all he really was was a giant pedophile, and I miss her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....a girl like you shouldn't know those kind of words. And missing a friend is hardly an excuse to disrupt my class. We need to have a talk with your guardians.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like its my fault you....\" Hotaru stopped. Something...wasn't right. She had a vague sense of unease, not unlike...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I HAVE TO GO!\" She announced as she leapt to her feet. Williams began to speak but was too slow as she began to run out the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! It can't be! Not now!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could feel it burning on her forehead, the purple glow of what looked like a small h with a cross running through the top...the symbol of Saturn. Her symbol. And all too soon, she had fallen to her knees...visions filling her mind of a darkness on the moon and jagged monoliths rises from the street and people enslaved. And when she opened her eyes, the world had gotten smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...\" She moaned softly to herself. Not again. But a glance in the mirror told her the truth. She looked like Mistress Nine...long hair, a curvy body...not again. Her magic had aged her once more, this time easily into her early 20s. How could they explain this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then it dawned on her as she rose unsteadily to her feet and felt the cool air on her body, that her problems were larger and more immediate. Her school clothes were now shreds and tattered strands. She was a gorgeous 21 year old woman with large bouncing breasts and a round butt and a thin landingstrip of red hair over a naked vagina. With no ID, no clothes, and no excuse to be prowling around a middle school naked!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHotaru turned around and stared at the shocked face of Mr. Williams. She covered herself with her hands and screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHidden behind a locker, watching the proceedings with an alien sort of smile, a soft voice chuckled to itself. \"It'll be all right, Hotaru-chan. I promise. We'll make it all right. And...thank you. I missed you too.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Clip, clop. Clip, clop. Two pairs of booted feet made a frantic run down the street. Two naked sailor scouts rounded the corner of a busy street, garnering lots of surprised stares from everyone around them. The pair looked left and right, the blond pointing down a wide boulevard to a strange bird in the distance. Sailor Moon began to run, but Mercury caught her shoulder and brought them both to a dead stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't getting us anywhere.\" Mercury said. Once again summoning up her visor, Mercury knelt down on one leg, staring out in the direction of their quarry. Holding her hands above her head, she whispered the words \"Mercury Aqua Rhapody.\" A spray of water sprung up around her and formed into a harp made of liquid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Usagi! CHase her down that alley. Try to get on top of the roofs. I'll take care of the enemy...just make sure Daria is okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi opened her mouth to protest, then simply nodded and darted down the side street as fast as her feet could carry her. Along the way she began to leap atop dumpsters and then window sills to gain some height, leap frogging from one side of the narrow alley to the other as she moved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three. Two. One.\" Mercury breathed as her visor counted down. \"Mercury Aqua Rhaposdy!\" She screamed again as she plucked at the liquid stream of her harp, causing three sprays of water to leap from her instrument and go flying down the street, jetting towards their target with the sledgehammer force of a fire hose under intense pressure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh?\" The incubus said as it glanced in the direction the attack was coming from. With a frantic flap of its wings it narrowly dodged the first attack, swooping low as first one then another blast of water forced it between to buildings to escape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid bitch. I'm faster than-\" The creature said, shortly before a spinning arc of light ripped through its lower torso. Daria screamed as she fell like a stone, but a figure was already leaping up under her, catching her in mid fall and gently rising back up into the air. Daria gasped as the world under her feet turned end over end like the steep drops of a rollercoaster. Biting her lip so she wouldn't scream and turning her eyes away from the dizzying up and down, Daria found herself focusing on the large bouncing breasts and nipples of her would-be savior, which mostly enveloped her field of vision. Glancing up long enough to register that Sailor Moon was clutching her tightly, Daria held her breath and buried her face between the girls considerable orbs, hiding from the terrors and humiliations her day and turned into like a child quivering underneath a pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe incubus screamed in rage and turned toward the fleeing sailor scout, her quivering butt cheeks rapidly moving away from the monster as she leapt from roof to roof. \"Do you think you can outrun-\" She cut herself off as she dove rapidly to avoid another jet of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your fight is with me!\" Mercury screamed, having closed the distance between herself and the monster, harp still in hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monster laughed and dodged another attack. She glared down at the sailor scout like a hawk stalking a mouse. Mercury's legs quivered ever so slightly. With her visor, she was able to aim her attacks with perfect precision to force it directly into Usagi's trap. Unfortunately, while she could was able to calculate where her jets of water needed to go to limit the creature's options in dodging, the monster was still faster than her and a close range battle would put the monster at a supreme advantage despite her visor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature dove at her face. Mercury fired off yet another blast from her harp, but the creature burst into a flurry of feathers that melted around the water jet. With mocking laughter, a huge blast of wind slammed into Mercury and picked her up off her feet. She found herself flying end over end, the visor straining then flying off her face, and then the ground coming up hard and fast. Mercury rose unsteadily to her feet, her transformation protecting her body from the physical damage. She looked up at the monster, who had reformed and was looking down at her smugly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMercury gulped. With her visor, she stood little chance. Without her visor, she stood almost zero chance. She shivered, the sinking sense of vulnerability and helplessness heightening the awareness of her own naked state. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Daria's morning really had been going well. She had just gotten her grades back for a particularly difficult photoshoot and was excited to see how high she had scored. She had every reason to believe that the gentle coaxing and prodding she had been subjecting Ami to were about to pay off. Imagining getting the blue haired girl out of her clothes and behind the camera, seeing the intense blush on her face as she dangled in the throes of humiliation and arousal, slowly but inevitably giving in to her desires while being painfully aware of her exposure....the whole scheme had been giving Daria tingles all morning. And then, in less than an hour, her whole world had been turned upside down. Stripped of her clothes, tickled and humiliated in front of her enemies, seen by dozens and dozens of strangers all over the city...this was a level of humiliation she was decidedly not excited by! True, occasionally she had had fantasies of her models being trapped in such a situation, but she'd never subjected them to it! And she never, ever wanted to put HERSELF in such a scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaria's frazzled mind slowly made its way back to the present The frantic pace Sailor Moon had been keeping to was slowing considerably, the sailor scouts breathing getting heavier. Her heart skipped a beat as she realized they were on the narrow ledge of a stony building. She quickly turned her attention back to Sailor Moon's erect nipples, which were rising and falling in time with her rapid breathing. The sailor scout came to a complete stop and sat the bewildered goth girl down on the windy ledge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We...need to stop.\" Sailor Moon panted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...\" Daria said. She hadn't realized the sailor scout would get that tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Sailor Moon gasped and doubled over. Daria started to rise to her feet, paused for a moment as vertigo hit her, then carefully crawled towards the naked blond. \"Are you okay?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I....umm....I can't take this!\" Sailor Moon stammered, her gloved hands clutching her naked body tightly. Daria blinked a few times, unable to believe what she was seeing. Sailor Moon was softly stroking her pussy lips, playing with the nub of her clit with increasing urgency. Daria stared, unable to look away as the sailor scout degraded herself in front of the enthralled goth girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Sailor Moon moaned loudly. \"P-please don't look at me!\" She whimpered. Daria automatically turned her head, her own blush quite intense. But she could only resist a few seconds before taking another look. Sailor Moon was continuing to play with herself, her other hand teasing her large and beautiful breasts. Her eyes were closed, her lips parted and sighing to herself. Her posture and blush betrayed her embarrassment and helplessness to her own urges. It was practically the living embodiment of what Daria looked for in a model. Goddamn she wanted her camera right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....umm....I....hate to interrupt....\" Daria began. \"But...can't...that wait?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry!\" Sailor Moon said, the words coming out in an excited rush as she continued to finger herself. \"I can't help it! Mercury is fighting the monster!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....is that your fetish or something?\" Daria asked, a hint of her old wit coming back to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO! She's using her powers! When one of us does that, we both get....\" Sailor Moon let her actions speak for themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So the whole time you were carrying me, you were fighting off the need to do this?\" Daria guessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....umm....how's it going?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid gloves! I can't quite....I'm just teasing myself!\" Sailor Moon moaned in desperation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".......\" Daria paused. \".............do you need help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? NO!\" Sailor Moon practically screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just saying I could lend a hand here.\" Daria winced at her own pun. \"I mean...no offense, but...this is taking forever. I'm not exactly a fan of sitting on a ledge with a crazy bird woman chasing us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine!\" Sailor Moon snapped. \"T-hank you.\" She said in quieter tone. \"But I promised Ami I wouldn't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, could you just...what did you say?\" Daria said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err...I said I promised Sailor Mercury that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not what you said! How do you know about Ami?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....umm....\" Sailor Moon said, grimacing as she willed herself to remove her hand from its appointed task. \"Ami's the girl you want to go out with, right? I'm a soldier of love and justice! I know these things!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....your lying.\" Daria said at once. \"Your lying and you really suck at it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do not! I mean-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HOW DO YOU KNOW ABOUT- oh my god.\" Daria paused. \"That girl....she looks just like Ami. She has the same hair and the same eyes....why didn't I think of that before??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....its....part of the sailor scout magic. It keeps people from recognizing us even when they should be able to....\" Usagi said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" Daria asked, unsteadily getting to her feet. \"Ami is....one of you? I don't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaria's mind reeled from the revelation, as she began to back away from Usagi. Above the babble of her other thoughts, all jumbled in her brain and competing to be heard, one overwhelming realization struck her. Ami looked better naked and embarrassed than Daria could have possibly imagined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the only thing she had time to realize before backing right up and off the lip of the building.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A long time ago, back before the other girls had awakened and while Usagi was still making a solo career out of superheroism, the girl had been unsure of herself to the point of paralysis. Luna had never had much pity on her in those early days, despite the fact that she was at heart a scared little middle schooler confronting monsters and demons. After one particularly close and dangerous encounter, the girl had spent nearly an hour balling her eyes out and wailing at the the cat to take the magic away. After suffering through the cat's repeated and stern refusals, the girl demanded to know why. She never forgot Luna's words- \"Because you are Sailor Moon, and you have it within you to endure. Beyond your fears, beyond your doubts, at your core you are a sailor scout and you will succeed no matter what. I am not capable of taking that away from you. Nothing ever will be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch as Usagi hated to admit it, Luna knew what she was talking about. The point was proven yet again as usagi found herself leaping forward in the very instant Daria started to fall. For that moment, all the apprehensions and embarrassments and humiliations didn't matter. Her ackward, fevered attempts to ease her arousal didn't matter. Not even the panic at having her own slip up that had revealed her teammates identity mattered. There was a girl in need of saving, and she was there to save her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi felt the world fall out from under her as she dove over the side of the building, her eyes locked on the naked girl just below her. Arms locked at her sides, Usagi shot down like a bullet, cutting through the air fast enough to catch up to the wide eyed Daria. Holding her breath, Usagi grabbed the girl by the arm. With a shocked shriek from Daria, Usagi swung the girl around and upwards, temporarily changing the photographer's descent into a sudden climb. Casting about on the ground, Usagi saw a metal balconey coming up fast. bracing herself, she turned her body around in midair and caught the edge of the balconey with her news like a trapeez artist. Her heart pounding, Usagi took half a second to pray this would work, then with a grunt reached up and again caught the flailing body of Daria as she came screaming past. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaria took in several huge swallows of air, her throat feeling raw from her recent bought of panic. Looking up she saw the naked sailor scout firmly holding onto her hands, perched upside down on the edge of a rusty metal balconey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"......thanks.\" Daria whispered. \"Again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem.\" Usagi said. \"i promised I'd keep you safe....err...sorry for the lousy job so far.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh...if...you can get me down on the ground again I won't be hold it against you.\" Daria said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, sure....just need to....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe balconey gave a sudden groaning. Now both girls screamed in unison as the metal frame partially gave way, dropping them both a heart rending half dozen feet as the lip caved in on itself. Usagi found herself dangling from the twisted remains, still clutching the girl Mercury cared so much for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....I'll settle for a nice solid ledge!\" Daria squeeked, looking up at the girl. usagi nodded, lifting her up onto the ledge that ran just beneath the balconey. Daria pressed her back up against the building. Usagi looked at her, more or less level with her but entirely upside down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....that was fun.\" Usagi muttered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Thrill a minute.\" Daria said, then paused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...let's just...umm...let's just...no...come on....\" Usagi muttered, grasping the metal edges and pulling on her booted feet. \"Umm....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Your stuck.\" Daria said, incredulous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just gimme a sec....just gotta pull a little harder here....and....crap.\" usagi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your. Stuck.\" Daria muttered darkly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....I'm stuck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can this be happening?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, look, just calm down. I can get out of this, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't tell me to calm down! You....you just said the hot nerdy girl I like is a freaking superpowered sailor girl who fighting some horrible bird monster so I can be safe...and instead I'm sitting here naked on a rooftop because your too busy trying to get off to do your fucking job!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi bit her lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And...and I just fell off a goddamn building....and I just scared myself to death for the hundreth time today...and now I'm yelling at the girl who saved my life.\" Daria gave an immense sigh and lowered herself onto the ledge. \"I'm sorry. Its been a long, fucked up day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....its okay.\" Usagi said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you...need help?\" Daria asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaria gingerly crawled over to the girl. Usagi watched her approach, her large beautiful boobs hanging low and swaying gently from side to side. Daria paused as she met Usagi's gaze, and both of them blushed as Usagi turned the other way and shut her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry!\" usagi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"yeah yeah.\" Daria muttered, carefully rising to her feet and tip toing over to the girl. To her consternation, she had to position herself practically on top of usagi, her face level with Usagi's gleaming sex. \"Your all helpless because of your curse or whatever. I got it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....yes....but...your also really...good looking.\" Usagi mummbled to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" Daria said, looking up at Usagi's feet. \"Th-thanks....your...not bad, either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot bad was an understatement. Blondes weren't exactly a first choice for Daria, but she had to admit Sailor Moon looked incredible in the nude. Nice large breasts, atheletic body, large pink nipples....but what made the image was the obvious embarrassed arousal usagi had. When Sailor Moon first made her naked debut at the school, Daria had seen the footage and the pictures like everyone else. And like a good percentage of the school, she had used the pictures to good effect in her own fantasy. If it wasn't for Ami, she might be doing more than just admiring-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any luck?\" Usagi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh...\" Daria pushed on Usagi's boot. \"Its stuck good, Moongirl...I think maybe I can get you out if you take it off....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"i guess that's okay.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"By the way....your Usagi, right? I mean...the only girls Ami hangs out with that are blonde are Usagi and that cheerleader girl...Minako? And Usagi has her hair done up in the buns like this.\" Daria said ideally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....please don't tell anyone.\" Usagi said. \"I shouldn't have blurted it out in the first place.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaria smiled to herself. \"Oh yeah? What's it worth to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax. I won't say anything. Promise.\" Daria said, lowering one of her hands to shake the hand of the girl at her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. In return maybe I can help you with Ami.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....come again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....I have someone I care about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The tuxedo guy?\" Daria guessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. He and I....I love him. And he's devoted to me. And....and the other girls have made so many sacrifices for me and each other and....and I was just lucky to find him and keep him and...Ami barely has time to do anything outside school and being a sailor scout. I'm her friend and I try to be there for her but...she's still lonely. She deserves someone who cares about her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you think the goth her who wants to strip her naked and takes pictures of her is the best canidate for this?\" Daria asked, no small amount of self reproach in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ami trusts you. And I can tell you care about her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look....\" Daria said slowly. \"This is a lot to take in, okay? So....maybe I could use some help. But...I don't like sharing, and I don't like baring my soul...and yes I get the irony here...and I don't like feeling like things are out of my control. That's why I like cameras...you can't control time, but you can freeze a moment in a picture, and that moment always belongs to you. I like to be in control in my relationships. And I'm trying to loosen up and let things happen with Ami....but this...this whole fucking Sailor Scout stripping naked thing...this is as far beyond my control as anything has ever been! So...so....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"back off?\" usagi finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaria worked on tip toes, trying to work the boot out of the metal mess the balconey had become. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT THE HELL??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SORRY! SORRY! I've been trying to ignore it! But its right there, and it looks so cute, and the curse, and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop saying AND! Just....keep your mouth closed...and away from my vagina! Otherwise I'll just leave you here and find my own way down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right! Sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaria fumed, her face bright red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If...it makes you feel any better...Ami will probably think the piercings in there are as cute as I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaria closed her eyes and counted to ten and tried very hard not to strangle her future girlfriend's best friend. </span></div></div>",

She had been fighting a running battle, trying to keep some distance between herself and the monster while drawing her away from Usagi and Daria. As far as strategic moves went, this was not one of Mercury's best made plans. The creature seemed to be fighting her more from some twisted sense of amusement than actual fear or malice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph. That was even weaker than your last attack. Don't tell me your already out of steam.\" The incubus said, batting the missile away with a sweeping gust of wind. \"Or are you just trying to buy a little time for your sailor slut to steal the goth away?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi said nothing, glaring at the creature as she landed on the ground. Glancing about, it seemed they had arrived on a playground next to a middle school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your the brains of the operation, right? You came up with that plan to distract me and let the moon bitch get the drop on me. And now your hoping that these weak little attacks will keep my interest so your little girlfriend can get away without getting so aroused you lose all your concentration. I assume you've figured that part out- the more magic you use, the hornier you get, and the stronger your attack the worse it gets. How much of these water works can you throw at me before you just drop to your knees and beg to be screwed? That's really the only part I'm interested in, you know....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi glowered at the monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So yeah. I've seen through your little game. You already know you can't beat me with your little slush balls. And sad for you, your biggest attacks will just discorporate me into a ball of feathers. Nothing you got can kill me. But please don't let that stop you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi glared at the monster, almost as if she hoped staring into it might reveal some weak point. The monster laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not very talkative, are we? Your used to the others making all the banter, right? No, I can read you like a book...your the type to hang back and direct the fighting. You don't like to get into the thick of it. The others are the real warriors, right? Oh, you might come up with a cute new tactic or break a code here or there, but your nothing without them to back you up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up.\" Ami snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing but a shy little naked girl splashing some water around and embarrassing herself on the battle field. Right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi blushed in spite of herself. She could hear voices around them. She knew they were attracting attention. Overhead the whirr of a helicopter could be heard. Their fight was being filmed on the local news. Ami shivered and briefly covered her nudity, her pale skin making the blush all the more apparent. She felt quite tiny and exposed at the moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On the nose, huh? Well, why don't we find out if....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi shrieked loudly as something soft brushed against her leg. One of the creature's feathers was assaulting her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ewwwwww. You have it even worse than the goth girl. Your going to laugh harder than any of the others.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Ami was blushing deeply. To say she was ticklish was to say the pacific ocean was wet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Don't worry about her goth girl. I'll let her go today. Your a much better prize.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi's eyes widened, and she raised her fists again. A small 'eek' escaped her as another feather attacked the back of her knee. Ami began to swat at the feathers as if the were insects. All the time the mocking laughter of the monster echoed in her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ENOUGH!\" Ami screamed, leaping into the air. Coming down on the monster, she screamed \"AQUA SHINE ILLUSION- FREEZE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps if she could freeze the monster completely in ice, it wouldn't be able to dissolve into a shower of feathers when she used her strongest attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi gasped as the creature drew back and gave a mighty flap of its wings. A hurricane wind engulfed Mercury and sent her and her attack spiraling about in all directions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi suddenly found herself standing still, her feet just barely touching the ground. Looking up, she found both her hands encased in a arch of ice. The monster must have redirected and reshaped the attack even as she screamed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? Useless.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi tried to speak, but her words were drowned out in a fit of alarmed laughter a pair of feathers began to attack her now helpless armpits. One by one the monster was plucking feathers from its wings, adding more and more torment to poor ami's ordeal.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>All at once the feathers stopped their wicked work. Ami sucked in a breath of air, relief and anger dancing through her mind. The demon had an inquisitive look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you waiting for?\" Ami stammered, attempting to sound strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a little experiment....\" The creature said, grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi raised an eyebrow, then gave a little shriek as one feather licked her armpits. Cringing from the stroke, Ami shrank away from the feather, then looked on in confusion as the feather withdrew rather than press the advantage. Another shriek as another feather swept against the back of her knee. She jumped a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"mmmm...yes. Like that.\" The demon mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twin feathers began to tickle, no longer in a full on assault but in small bursts. Ami moaned softly to herself. She was being experimented upon, the two feathers testing her boundaries, finding her weak spots. And in its own way this was worse, as her growing arousal and anticipation of the full assault deepened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Wait!\" Ami moaned as the two feathers found her breasts. Her breasts were not large, but they had compartively massive nipples. The two nobs stood out on her chest, almost asking for the attention the feathers provided. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noooooo!\" Ami moaned in agony, the feathers finding whole new levels of ticklish torment as they danced on her exposed chest. But as the two feathers concentrated their attention there, the demon noted that Ami's thrashing had subtly changed. Whereas before she struggled to get away from the feathers, bouncing in any direction that might provide a second of relief (amusing in its own way!) now her responses involved louder (albeit dismayed) moans and telltale involuntary thrust of the hip. This treatment, concentrating on her most erotic parts, was working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing upwards, the demon smiled even more. The news helicopter was circling above, getting live footage of the humiliating ordeal. But it wasn't enough. With a swish of her wings the demon leapt upwards, racing to the helicopter. The alarmed pilot tried to flee, but suddenly found a violent wind turning him about completely in mid air. In a moment the demon slammed into the side and ripped the door off the vehicle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen carefully, mortals!\" The demon barked. \"You keep your film rolling, no matter what! Understand? Try to leave, I'll rip this metal bird out of the sky! If your little news network values your lives, you'll keep filming. No commercial breaks, no black bars to censor anything. If they do, your lives are as good as gone. Also....I'm borrowing this!\" She screamed as she grabbed a tv camera from one of the stunned filmers. \"UNDERSTAND?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe film crew and the red headed tv reporter looked at her dumbly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do. You. Understand? Say yes right now, or I just might decide what your viewing audience needs is to see their star female reporter given the same treatment as your little heroine down there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reporter shuddered and emphatically agreed. The news crew also nodded, a tad more slowly, to the clear anger of the reporter. The demon smiled. This was going to be fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrying the camera in her taloned feet, the bird woman flew down to the ground, looking at the blue haired girl partially encased in ice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, where were we?\" She asked as six more feathers joined the two focusing on her nipples. Taking up strategic positions on either side of her body, Ami found herself being tickled on her upper arms, down her ribcage and across her taut stomach, and all along her exposed legs and knees all at once. The same slow, methodical approach to the tickling was being taken, only now there was no part of her body that could hide. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sailor Mercury shrieked with laughter as her naked humiliation was filmed before a live audience. Along both sides of her body she could feel long black feathers dancing along every curve, two up beneath her armpits, two around her ribcage and tummy, two on either butt cheek, and two along the underside of her knees. With her arms encased in ice she could do nothing but squirm and laugh in terrible fits. Every so often a feather tip would flick past a nipple. All at once Ami's whole body would tense up and thrust forward, her laughter turning into a loud moan. Then back to the screaming laughter as the feathers relentlessly tormented her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my, I think your enjoying this....\" the creature sang, holding the camera. \"Look at this nipples, so round and full and at attention. here, let me zoom in so everyone can see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi continued to scream with laughter, but as the bird woman drew closer, her right foot lashed out sharply. Blue boot connected with the monster's face, causing half the woman's mask to burst apart in a spray of feathers. Ami glared at the woman before the dancing feathers consumed her concentration yet again. The bird thing glared back as the feathers reconstructed her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naughty. We do to do something about that.\" Setting the camera back down, the monster shot out a taloned foot, ensaring Ami's left leg. Flying into the air, Ami blushed through her laughing (which had turned almost hoarse with the torture) as she found herself standing on one leg, the other raised high above her head, exposing her folds to the camera. And the feathers were so quick to rearrange themselves, attacking every joint from her thigh on down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get rid of this nasty thing.\" The bird lady said as she clamped her other taloned foot over the shoe and forced it off, keeping a tight hold of Ami's leg with her other foot. Laughing to herself, she stroked Ami's naked foot. Ami quickly found her fading voice, crying in protest and laughing harder than ever. In desperation her other foot leapt up, trying to smash into the monster once. Tossing away the boot, the bird easily caught the boot moments before connecting. In one swift motion she pulled that boot away and let it join its twin on the ground. \"This needs closer inspection.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonononononononono!\" Ami screamed as the monster flew under the arch formed from ice, dragging Ami's feet with her. The fiend perched atop the ice, Ami dragged along. She found herself dangling off the ground, her body bench in a backwards 'c' with her breasts hanging down for the camera. With a flap of her wings, dozens more feathers were released. Ami's eyes widened as several feathers bunched around her nipples, their tips placing the erect tips under siege. Feathers played up and down her spine. Where once a single feather had accosted every joint, now 5 happily worked together to torment every single spot. They danced on her ribs and fltted across her legs, swirled around under her armpits and along her knees. And above the monster had settled into playing with her feet, devoting the tips of her wings to the task, each filled with dozens upon dozens of probing feathers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh! No! HAHAHA! Stop! You can't! Don't!\" Ami pleaded, her laughter now combining with whimpering moans as her breasts received so much attention. It was time to turn things up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo more feathers sprang into view, these longer and more pointed than the rest, floated down. One positioned itself directly over her bouncing butt cheeks. The other waited, floating in a parallel position on her front. Ami felt the tip of the feather as it moved between her cheeks. She flinched away from the probing instrument, realizing what the fiend intended. She tried to free herself...and felt her hands move within her gloves, encased in ice though they were. Ami's eyes widened, a sudden idea springing to her mind. Then all the feather surrounding her body drew back a quarter inch, and rammed themselves against her with more vigor than ever. Ami screamed a long high pitched note, and the sound only doubled itself as the long feather brushed against the most sensitive and intimate place it could have possibly found. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi thrust forward once more, her aroused laughter causing an involuntary spasm. And waiting for her was the second long feather, copying the motion of its twin as her wide open sex came into view. All it took was a brief touch, a soft swirling pattern around the trembling nub of her clit. In a rush Ami came, her whole body spasming in the most intense, longest orgasm she had ever known. And right beneath her, the tv camera showed it to the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi's eyes shot open as all the feathers ceased to move. Her whole body was shaking and panting, but even above her gasping breath she could hear the laughter of the fiend. Ami's blush deepened to a dark shade of red as realization hit her, and then darker still as rage took the place of shame. Taking a deep breath, she carefully but firmly pulled on her gloved arms. Yes....it would just be possible to work her way out of the gloves....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bird woman was having the time of her life. Perhaps this WAS worth the price of losing that first battle. These humans offered so many subtle ways to torment them that would have been lost in that original assault. How much better was it to use their own sense of morals and their own bodies against them? What a wonderful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mercury....Bubbles....BLAST!\" Came the whispered voice of the blue haired sailor scout. All at once the bird woman found herself blinded by a huge spray of vapor as the naked girl unexpectedly dislodged herself from the alcove and curled herself around into and upside down sitting position, so that her now bare arms pointed directly at the monster. In the confusion Ami's feet were dislodged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monster looked all around in the sudden fog. \"You think this will matter? I can get rid of this in a single gust!\" Disintegrating into a thousand feathers, the monster spun around, creating a small tornado. Then she screamed as she found every feather sucked back in to form her body, which spun around rapidly before landing hard on the ground. Dripping and naked, the creature rose to its feet, shivering slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"453 grams.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMercury emerged from the mists, completely naked except for her blue neck collar and her crown. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are 453 grams in a pound. A single molecule of H2O is 18 grams per mole, meaning 25.2 moles are in one pound.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature raised its wing, but only droplets of water flew off her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The density of water droplets in the air around my attack, adjusting for temperature, roughly means there is one pound of water for every 10 cubic feet. You don't control the wind directly, you have to flap your wings or move your feathers to move the wind. At minimum, your feathers would have to move at a rate of 300 feet per second to cause the gale force winds you've been hitting me with. Given that an individual feather weighs a fraction of a pound, your attack could only last for .075 seconds (rounded up) before each feather absorbed too many pounds of water to stay in the air. In other words....your too soaked to fly. And if you can't fly, you can't transform. Which makes you open to attack.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....Mercy! Please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi paused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your not like this...right? Your one of the sailor scouts....soldier of love and justice? You said so yourselves!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....you think your life means anything to me?\" Ami snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! You show mercy to your enemies. That's the kind of creatures you are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....your right. Your life does mean something to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then just let me-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daria means more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature's eyes widened, and it struggled to get to its feet, turning and fleeing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MERCURY AQUA RHAPSODY!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe incubus found itself engulfed by a tidal wave of blue, and knew no more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMercury stared at the place where her foe once stood, trembling. She dropped to her knees as a wave of lust struck her, tears in her eyes. Her actions played across her mind, feeling remote and far removed. She felt raw and numb all at once. She knew, dimly, that the guilt would catch up to her. Right now, her action seemed just once more sacrifice on the pile of humiliations and sufferings she had gone through today. She wanted it to be over with. She wanted Daria and Usagi to be safe. Then it might all be worth it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ami walked in a haze. Her bare feet touched the cold ground as she moved slowly on trembling legs. Her attacks had left her glistening in droplets of cold water. Her inner folds still quivered from the orgasm that had so recently filled her, yet her attacks and redoubled a wave of desire coursing through her body. Everything felt hazy and sluggish and surreal. The gloves and the boots she had worn previously, as scant as those items of clothing had been, they had helped her focus. Now, as bare feet touched the ground and bare hands hugged her small breasts, Ami felt more naked than ever. The rational part of her wanted to comment on the absurdity of that feeling, wanted to point out that functionally she was only slightly more bared to the world than she had been before. Then again, the notion that she should have been feeling as helplessly naked and shamed throughout her experience as she did at that exact moment was not exactly comforting logic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whirring above her head finally grabbed Ami's attention. For a moment, the heat of her body had threatened to overwhelm her. But the helicopter above her head reminded her that this wasn't over. And the slap back to reality reminded her there was a crowd around her. Latching one arm across her breasts and another over her mound, Ami began to run. Pavement slapped on hard stone as she picked up her pace, her butt cheeks jiggling with every step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can I find them?\" She wondered. The only thing she could do was try to follow the line Usagi would have fled in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA horn honked loudly as she ran through a busy street. Ami saw a bus full of people staring at her. Cameras were going off. Everyone could see her! Ami trembled, staring at all the people. Then she ran harder, flipping over onto the bus' roof in the process. Naked or no, she still had her superpowers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaping again she came down on the other side of the bus and continued running. There was a chorus of catcalls and camera flashes behind her, the noise ringing in her ears. Superpowers or no, she was still naked in the middle of a crowded street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Focus!\" Ami said as she leapt up onto a fireescape, seeking the rooftop of the building. How far could Usagi travel? Well, if she was moving at the fastest they had ever clocked a teammate....Ami sought solace in her mathematics, seeking to bury her mind in something concrete as she always did. But her body had its own needs right now, and the numbers racing through her head melted into images of soft curves and black hair. Daria. The girl who had occupied her thoughts and deeds for the past several weeks, the girl who had the power to control her in ways she had never understood. So...Daria liked her....wanted her. She had thought that maybe that was it, but she'd never dared. Daria...who had set a trap for her, wanting to get her out of her clothes.....humiliate her and photograph her and make love to her. If things had gone as planned, Mercury would probably be posing for Daria at this very moment. Maybe even moaning under her kiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMercury skidded to a hault on a ledge before a large window high above the city. Well...that plan had certainly gone astray! It was Mercury who had gotten to see Daria naked and embarrassed first! And the way she had looked....wow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, she'd been in danger. But Usagi had been there to rescue her. Thank goodness....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi....images of the blonde girl and her bouncing breasts filled her mind. Images of her being spanked and whipped the day before. The way she had pleasured herself before Mercury's eyes....the desperate kiss they had shared a moments before Ami's own humiliation....faded images of another life....a 10 thousand year old love affair neither spoke of but both still recalled.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi's hands stroked her body, teasing herself as thoughts of her friends overwhelmed her. She moaned slightly, cracking her eyes open, and shrieking as she saw someone looking through the window. Leaping away, she forced her hands away from her hungry body. It wasn't over yet....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she heard it. A sharp cry...it sounded like Daria. Ami ran in that direction...the voice sounded alarmed. Hurt. A moment later she heard a similar cry. That was DEFINITELY Usagi. Ami's heart was pounding. Was that momentary distraction enough to....were there more enemies? Ami ran as fast as her superpowered legs would allow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRounding the corner of the building, Ami stopped dead. The sight before her was....unexpected. Usagi hung upside down, her legs caught in the metal frame of a balconey. Daria was looming over her, her arms wrapped around one of the boots Usagi wore. Apparently she was trying to dislodge the sailor scout, but her progress was clearly being slowed by Usagi sticking her tongue into Daria's hovering pussy. And Daria's head was positioned just right to reciprocate if she wanted....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the visions of the lovely naked ladies danced once again before Ami's mind, the conflicting desires for both women vanishing as a new image overwhelmed her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I SAID STOP DOING THAT!\" Daria shouted. Usagi had the good graces to look chagrined, but also pleading. \"I'm sorry, okay? But your...right there....and you keep taking so long....and its getting worse....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I didn't need you to get to the ground I swear I'd just leave you here!\" Daria said. \"Now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaria stopped as a loud moan came from behind her. The color drained from her face as she turned around. There was Ami....how could she have ever failed to see it was her Ami?....naked, staring at her....and fingering herself....looking at them with lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ami....\" Daria whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't stop!\" Ami whimpered. \"Let her do it....do it to her....don't stop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaria's mouth hung open. Was she really asking her to....did Ami really want....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thoughts became muddled by a wriggling mass darting in and out of her inner folds. Daria gasped at the sensation....evidently the sailor scout HAD been holding back before. Daria started to pull back from the other girl, then saw the look in Ami's eyes. Okay....for this girl....okay. Daria wasn't normally the one performing for an audience. The very notion was almost cripplingly embarrassing....but for Ami....and it wasn't as if the blonde underneath her was particularly ugly or anything....a year ago she would have easily been all over the bun haired girl despite her manic personality....and in any event, Daria would die before she was outperformed in front of Ami. Daria grabbed Usagi's butt and began kissing her clit feverishly. Usagi returned the motion with equal vigor. And Ami looked on...the two girls she had suffered for, humiliated herself for, lusted after just moments ago....safe, beautiful, caught up in the overwhelming passion she was gripped in. A more glorious sight she could not have asked for. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three naked girls climaxed as one.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For the second time that day Ami found herself hit by an intense wave of pleasure. She wondered vaguely if the transformations had something to do with it....her orgasms were rarely as good or as big as the one her hands had just administered, and all the ones before now had come about as far more effort than this had been. She clutched the side of the building with her left hand, her right still firmly imbedded in her sex. Her eyes burned with intensity, locked on the two girls in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaria sighed deeply. She had needed release far more than she had realized. And yet, a part of her was disappointed. She had a very different girl in mind to do this with....she gasped as once more she felt usagi probing into her. With a noise that was half in frustration, half alarmed squeeling she pushed Usagi away and knelt beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay! We....that was....we....\" Daria stammered. \"I...I guess you won?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi smiled. As the naked blue haired girl moved towards them, Daria sucked in a breath. This was a picture of Ami she had never seen before. Confident, joyful, in control. Daria had known all along that Ami had that kind of potential. But this was such a departure from the girl she knew....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...\" Daria began as Ami knelt down before them. She gasped again as Ami hugged her tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its gone.\" She whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey held each other in silence a moment, then an easperated hmph came from overhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could I get some help here, please?\" Usagi stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi rose to her feet, her smile turning downright mischievious. \"I don't know....we might just leave you like this....it makes for an amusing picture.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ami....\" Usagi whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And considering how you seem to have already blirted out who I am, I'm not entirely sure I should let you down any time soon.\" Ami said, crossing her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err.....\" Usagi stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then there's the little matter of what you were doing with your tongue before I arrived.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah-heh. That. I can explain....\" Usagi whimpered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already know, Usagi.\" Ami said gently. \"Its overwhelming, this feeling. Its why you kissed me earlier....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhmmm, back up! She did what to you?\" Daria snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get me wrong, Usagi, I'm not mad at you.\" Ami continued. \"Afterall, its not as if I've forgotten how she was planning on tricking me into posing naked for her tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"........crap.\" Daria said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ami, wait! I know she seems really scary and kinda bitchy and like she's in a biker gang or something but she's really really nice and okay maybe a little perverted but I really think she cares about you so please don't be mad at her I think she really likes you and-\" Usagi burst out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.\" Ami said, pressing a hand to Usagi's lips. \"She still should have told me. But nothing has gone the way any of us wanted it to tonight....has it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaria rose to her feet. She couldn't look Ami in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....your both safe. That's all I care about.\" Ami said. \"But....I think, since you've both been....bad....and since I'm the one who killed our enemy....I should get to decide what happens now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....what do you mean?\" Daria asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....I want you to photograph me.\" Ami said, striking a pose vaguely reminiscient of a cover girl....for a very lude magazine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha?\" Daria and Usagi asked at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to model for you. I want you to show me everything you wanted to do to me with your camera. No pretenses. No lies. Its all already out in the open. So don't hold back anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know if I can, Ami.\" Daria said in all honesty. \"Your....before you were Ami the shy nerdy girl in my math class....now your a fucking sailor scout!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....I'm still who I was before.\" Ami said, touching Daria's cheek. \"There's just more to me than you knew. Just like there's more to you than I knew.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaria blushed. \"Yeah, but....aren't you worried...I mean, your supposed to be like purity and light and crap...won't it be like me corrupting mother teresa or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi gave her a look, then planted her lips firmly on the goth girl. Daria gasped and pulled away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can take everything you can throw at me.\" Ami said. \"And I want you to do everything you ever dreamed of to me. I'm asking you to. What's the problem?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I....\" Daria stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its okay.\" Usagi said. \"Just give her a try! You won't regret it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....does she always do this fucking cheerleader routine?\" Daria asked, exasperated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid so. You'll get used to it.\" Mercury said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....okay. I'll do it. Just don't blame me if I freak you out.\" Daria said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't blame me if I'm not so easy to freak out.\" Mercury smiled. \"One other thing....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you to photograph her too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"......WHAT?\" Usagi wailed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....what.\" Daria said, a little uncertainly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"..........\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just for tonight, okay? I still don't know how to reverse this, and a whole 24 hours like this needs an outlet. Besides....you looked hot together.\" Ami said, blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....okay.\" Daria said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't I get a say in this?\" Usagi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. Ami's in charge tonight.\" Daria said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. I'll help get her untangled.\" Ami said, beaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait. You guys should-\" Usagi began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up.\" Daria snapped, kneeling down next to the girl. \"Don't you dare argue!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wah! But-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is for Ami, all right? Don't act like you don't want into her pants! You kissed her...and I saw the way you two were practically all over each other in the locker room!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaria glowered. \"I...I need you there, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you me-wha!\" Usagi screamed as her feet were suddenly dislodged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaria looked up at the naked blue goddess over her head, and trembled slightly. Don't you get it, moon? This girl scares the hell out of me.</span></div></div>",

The diminutive form of her grandfather seemed somehow even more shrunken and frail in the hospital bed, the monitors and equipment keeping a steady track of his vital signs. \"What time is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno. Sometime after midnight...\" Rei said, sniffling a little and wiping the tears out of her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm. I don't approve of you staying up so late.\" Grandpa Hino said, cracking a thin smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, shut you....\" Rei began, then took in a breath and glaring at the old man. \"You scared me to death.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to worry about me, Rei-chan. I'm not going anywhere....not with so many good looking nurses here to look after me!\" the old man grinned broadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You lecherous old fool!\" Rei snapped, entering into the nagging routine that had defined the day to day interaction between her and her grandfather for a number of years. \"Maybe I should warn the nurses about you. Make sure all your attendants are MALE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man's grinned broadened. \"Fine by me, Rei-chan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei flushed, her customary temper joining with a slight bit of embarrassment. For a moment she had forgotten that her grandpa was, as he would put it, an 'equal opportunity lecher'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer grandfather snickered to himself. \"Ahh, you have your grandmother's temper, you know. That's how I ended up marrying her....only girl in Japan who was stubborn enough to get me to an altar....only girl in Japan who would always be there to bop me upside the head when my eyes started to wander. You remind me of her so much, Rei-chan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei blinked. Although her grandfather could be serious if he tried, he rarely lapsed into reminiscing like this. She cleared her throat. \"Grandpa, I've been talking to the doctors here....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh oh.\" Grandpa said, looking a bit like a child caught stealing candy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They said your body shows signs of severe stress. Signs that its been dealing with that stress for years.\" Rei's concern took on a sharp edge. \"You've been working yourself to death.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Rei-chan.\" He said solemly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want an apology! I want you to take better care of yourself!\" Rei said, visibly struggling not to raise her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You misunderstand. I'm sorry this old body couldn't make it.\" Grandpa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....what the hell does that mean?\" Rei demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man sighed. \"Rei-chan....have you given any thoughts to marriage?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?\" Rei actually did raise her voice, but quickly reverted to a whisper. \"Don't you dare change the subject!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not. Please answer my question.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"......no. I mean, sure, I've thought about it, but I like being single.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrandpa grunted. \"Ahhh. I'm afraid you inherited THAT from me. Another curse from my blood, along with the visions and....my other qualities.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My visions have never been a curse! And so what if I'm independent? This is a different Japan from the one you grew up in, Grandpa. We have a Constitution now. Women don't need to be married to succeed in....\" Rei paused. \"Hey, what do you mean I have your 'other qualities'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man gave her a dark look. \"Don't treat me like I'm an igorant fool, granddaughter. I watched the Americans sweep aside the old government and build it back up myself. I know full well what the laws say. I also know that societies don't change that easily. A single woman in this society faces barriers a married woman does not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its going to be my choice, grandpa. If I have to work harder because I want to keep my independence, then I will!\" Rei said. \"And you still haven't answered my question! What other qualities?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrandpa Hino smirked and rested his head back on his pillow. \"Interesting rumor floating around the neighborhood recently...seems a large number of young women were spotted driving around in a car or motorcycle (accounts vary) without any clothes on. I believe there were 7 in total....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe color drained from Rei's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many friends did you have over the other night, again? We were missing quite a few kimonos that night. I was surprised, usually your friends are more curteous than that. Its almost like they had no street clothes to change back into....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gr-grandpa....you can't think-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then the other night I found an interesting story for Tokyolewd.org, it seems that a bathroom was recently accosted by a pervert...a girl with raven black hair calmly walked onto a crowded street still dripping from the bath, without so much as a towel, and proceeded to-\" Grandpa began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OKAY! OKAY!\" Rei wailed, her entire face beat red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think there was a link to a live video feed of the event, if you'd like to see for yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU LECHEROUS OLD MAN!\" Rei screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU LECHEROUS YOUNG WOMAN!\" Grandpa screamed back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"........I swear, when you get over this heart attack I'm going to strangle you.\" Rei snapped, trembling with fury and embarrassment and just a tinge of secret arousal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrandpa Hino smiled smuggly to himself, then turned serious. \"Rei-chan....your life is your life. I'm not trying to control it. Whether you choose to marry...or choose to run through the streets completely-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei looked at him pointedly and made a flexing motion with her hand pantomiming squeezing an invisible neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem....whatever you choose to do, you should know you have my support. There is nothing you could do to shock me or shame me. I will always be proud of you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grandpa....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhh....I only say this because there's another truth I have to accept. I wanted to watch over you, protect you and provide you a safe home at my shrine. I wanted to let you gain the education and the experience you'd need to have all the opportunities you could imagine....so that whatever my stubborn, fiery, independent granddaughter chose to be, she could be. I'm sorry I failed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rei....I can't look after the shrine any longer. Its a full time responsibility, and my body grew too old for the work years ago. It has tried to grant the wishes of my heart and soldier through the years of your adolescence...but here we are, the start of your college life, and already it has reached its limit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grandpa...you did all this for me? You idiotic....wonderful....idiot! You should have said-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That I needed your help? That I wanted you to quite school and come give up your time to look after an old man and his run down shrine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I love that shrine! I want to be the head priestess when you...when the times comes. You know I would have come back in a second!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly. I had no intention of forcing you to make that choice as long as I could avoid it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, now I know! So I'll work with you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not taking care of the shrine any longer, Rei. I'm retiring.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your father and I have been discussing this for some time. He's made all the arrangements. There's a comfortable little house waiting for me near the village your grandma is buried in. I'll be living on my own with someone dropping by to check on me once a day. And I'm just a little way out by bullet train, so you can visit any time you like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grandpa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry to make this so sudden. My body was telling me for some time it couldn't handle the pace I was putting it through. I have to listen to it now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure? What about the shrine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am sure. As for the shrine...that is a question. The simple solution would be to close it, perhaps sell off the land.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you dare! That's part of our family history!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you would say that. But the only other option is to pass it along to you. And Rei-chan, the shrine is a full time responsibility. Can you go to school and be head priestess? Can you live out your other dreams and take care of our legacy? Not to mention, the shrine makes little money, and your paying for school. That's the choice your going to have to make.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's no choice at all! I'll take care of the shrine! I'll manage everything else too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? How is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know yet! Gimme some time to think!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rei-chan....think carefully about this. I'll be out of this hospital in a week. Give me your answer then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"......okay Grandpa. My answer won't change, but I'll think about it. I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The final battle between the incubus and their teammate was being chronicled before their eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you know Ami was that ticklish.\" Minako whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't know anyone COULD BE that ticklish.\" Makoto whispered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair were silent a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should I play it back?\" Minako asked hesitantly. \"Again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh.\" Makoto whispered as if in a trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe events of the battle had occured several hours ago. The news was still playing highlights of the events, including several embarrassingly close shots of Ami's body, but given that the censor bars were back in place and several moments of the fight were being removed (most obviously Ami's impromptu orgasm) the pair of Sailor Scouts quickly agreed that the recording they had made of the original broadcast was the preferable version. Apparently the news agency had taken the incubus at its word, avoiding any attempt to censor poor Ami's ordeal until the creature had been destroyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it okay to be doing this?\" Minako asked, biting her lip as she as the figures on the screen danced backwards in time at the press of a button. \"I feel a little guilty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was your idea to record it to begin with!\" Makoto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah! But I figured there'd be a little more butt kicking and a little less...of that!\" Minako said, pausing the picture on an image of Ami on display, her face frozen in a look of dismay and squeeling laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We underestimated it. We're just lucky it underestimated us as well.\" Makoto said grimly. \"And I'd feel a lot more guilty about watching this if those two idiots would check in and tell us they're okay!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'd know if they were in trouble. If nothing else, Rei would call in if she got a bad feeling.\" Minako said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They could still call!\" Makoto snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not arguing with- could you try to relax a little?\" Minako said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto blushed intensely and got to her feet. \"Right. Sitting around wondering if your friends are okay or not. That's my idea of relaxing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So distract yourself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sitting around naked watching de facto porn videos of my friend's humiliation is supposed to distract me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"......it isn't?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOT IN A GOOD WAY!\" Makoto snapped. \"I want to....get up! Do something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You already nixed cooking. Isn't that how you usually distract yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....yes....but you didn't want to just sit around and watch me cook, and I don't know where the fire extinguisher is in this house...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does....HEY!\" Minako said, getting to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Your a fire hazard in the kitchen. That's not an insult, that's me being pragmatic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, fine! Then go out and do something physical!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'M NOT GOING OUTSIDE NAKED AND DOING EXERCISE!\" Makoto said, fuming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako huffed. \"Then what else do you suggest we do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls stared at each other. And in unison, the same thought seem to occur to them, because they blushed and looked away at the same time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm....anyway.....what about-\" Makoto began, when the communicator began buzzing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls made a mad dash for the instrument, engaging in a brief wrestling contest the boys at their school would have sold their souls to be witness to. Makoto came out on top, pinning the blonde girl beneath her and truimphantly bringing the communicator to her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello? Mercury? Sailor Moon? Are you okay? Do you need help?\" She asked, breathlessly. Minako glared at her, trying in vein to find a way out of the pin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....Hello, Jupiter.\" A deep, masculine voice said over the other end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Mammoru-san.\" Makoto said, stunned. Minako took in a deep breath, and in unison both girls ceased their antics and disentangled themselves from each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I was hoping Usagi would be there. She isn't answering her communicator.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. I'm sorry, she isn't- we don't know where she is. There's....there's some kind of new enemy in the city....she was in some kind of battle earlier and we haven't heard from her or Ami since then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.\" Mammoru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" Makoto said, looking at Minako in dismay. \"I guess news travels fast in America.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If the news involves naked sailor scouts and monsters that strip people? Yes. Yes, it does.\" the voice on the other end of the line said in a deadpan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"......okay...look, Mammoru-san, this is....there's a lot you need to know about-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you give Usagi a message for me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....okay.\" Makoto said, her and Minako sharing a look of silent despair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pause on the other end seemed to take an eternity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell her I love her.\" He said at last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Mamoru-san?\" Makoto asked softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell her I love her. And that I trust her. Tell her she doesn't need to apologize for what's happening. She's my queen, and I have faith in her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"......she loves you too, Mamoru-san! The enemy...its done something to her! To all of us! We-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its using sex and lust as weapons. Its attacking all of you in a way that none of our opponents have ever tried. Its preying on your own naivete and vulnerability. And Usako is more vulnerable to those weapons than any of you.\" Darien said grimly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll keep her safe.\" Jupiter said solemly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that. And don't mistake me...I have faith in her. I was always worrying about her before....always swooping in to protect and guide her. But in the end Galaxia was the one who overcame me with just a flicker of power. Usagi was the one who led all of you through the deadliest fight we had ever faced...she was the one who overcame the Queen of the Cosmos. She innocent, but she isn't foolish or stupid. She can see the good in people with the blackest souls. She's stronger than any of us.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"......she still needs you. Don't give up on her. Please.\" Jupiter pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....I won't. Don't forget, I tried walking away from her once. We all see how successful that was.\" Mamoru said, his voice taking on a note of self-reproach. \"But Jupiter....I'm not going to stake a claim to her either. She is strong. She can make her own choices.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....I don't....\" Jupiter said in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTuxedo Mask sighed. \"Jupiter....our memories of the past are vague...but I know this much. Before she and I became engaged, you were her guardians. And you were more than her guardians. In a way, I took her from all of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you saying you don't care that she's been kissing other girls?\" Jupiter said, stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The enemy's curse on all of you may have brought your feeling to the forefront, but they've always been there. Hanging in the background. I think even Usagi see it now.\" Mamoru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...guess so? I don't....until I met you guys, I never had any interest in girls. I still don't, really....except....\" Makoto glanced at Minako, and blushed. \"I guess I'd make a few exceptions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecifically, nine exceptions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I came to America to learn. But I also wanted Usagi to have the chance to learn as well. Explore who she is. I didn't want to deny her the chance to decide who she wants to be with. What kind of life she really wants to live.\" mamoru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even if it means losing her? For real, this time?\" Jupiter inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....even then. But that's a bridge we'll cross if we come to it. For now, just tell her she never has to apologize to me. I've already forgiven her. And as for all of you....if you want to be with her and she wants to be with you, you have my blessing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't care if she sleeps with other people??\" Minako finally blurted out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Queen beryl was in love with me. Her dark kingdom rose out of her bitterness. Prince Diamond was in love with her. The dark moon clan was born from his jealousy. Now our enemies are forcing you to confront desires you've all avoided for a long time. I don't watch our future die because of poisoned love ever again. And...you are all my family. Usagi will always be dearest to me, but...the bonds we shared in that past life were strong....I feel the bonds we share now are stronger. I trust you all with her life and mine...I can trust you with this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know if....\" makoto began, tearing up. Minako had a look, and quickly snatched the phone from her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So let me get this straight...you don't care if any of us sleep with your girlfriend?\" She snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....right, Minako. I wouldn't put it like that, but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if she sleeps with a girl you don't know? What about that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....I trust her.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And a guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".......of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Good. Because she's been sleeping with that guy from the arcade for the past two weeks now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You accept this situation because your relishing the thought of Usagi having embarrassing lesbian sex with one of us! This isn't about her making choices, this is about you being turned on by her being thrust into these situations!\u201d Minako said accusingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026\u2026you have a point.\u201d Mamoru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto\u2019s eyes widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t mistake me, Venus. Everything I said is true. I want to give Usako the space she needs to understand this part of herself that\u2019s only now coming to the surface. And there\u2019s no one I\u2019d trust more to be her guides than all of you. But yes, I do take comfort from the idea that out of any lover she might choose, I\u2019m still the only man she wants.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cAnnnnnd?\u201d Minako asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd the idea of her being with one of you is more appealing than a stranger.\u201d Mamoru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t be so prudish! Just admit it! You want to see her naked! You want to see all of us that way!\u201d Minako said excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMINAKO!\u201d Mamoru said sharply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201chuh?\u201d Minako said, blinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a game. What the enemy did to Usagi\u2026.and Ami\u2026.that was awful. Yes, there is something tantalizing about what they went through, something erotic and dangerous. This is by design. The enemy is staging these battles to cater to the darkest parts of human desires and lusts. You are the sailor senshi. Your strength comes from love and justice. If you let them, your enemy will twist those virtues around to serve its own ends. It wants to draw strength from this world, and its trying to use you as the instruments to do so. Your waking a tight rope here.\u201d<br>\r\nMinako paused, then nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know. I\u2026I need to go. I\u2019ll be back at the end of this semester. Until then, keep her safe. Keep each other safe. There are likely to be dark days ahead. The enemy will try to divide you, make you feel alone and helpless. Now more than ever you need to rely on each other. What you feel for each other will see you through this- no matter what they try to do to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto and Minako stared at the comm unit silently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGoodbye.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe silence hung in the air a moment longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmph. Never did answer the question. I\u2019ll bet he can\u2019t wait to see us-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako\u2019s rant was interrupted as the sofa cushion Makoto had just thrown found its mark against the back of her head.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hi guys, faith here. Originally I didn\u2019t plan to break the 4th wall like this, but I\u2019m feeling compelled to recently. Since this branch of the story has evolved into what amounts to a 6th season of sailor moon (albeit a very adult and, I hope, sexy season), I\u2019d thought I\u2019d share a few things about the assumptions I\u2019ve been making for this story. Most of these you\u2019ve probably picked up on, but I thought I might as well come out and say it definitively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis story takes place an undefined amount of time after Sailor Moon Stars, but likely four or five years. I say \u2018undefined\u2019 because my research has yet to pin down an exact age for our characters at the climax of that series. To make matters worse, I\u2019m an American trying to depict characters in a Japanese society I only know about via research and anime. So, for instance, I\u2019m not sure how old a normal Japanese student would be when they first enter high school (an important point, given that the Inner Scouts are established as being high school freshmen at the end of the series). In any event, if your inclined to be a continuity hound (and don\u2019t get me wrong, I try to be one myself) just realize I\u2019m playing a little fast and loose with everyone\u2019s age in the following description.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl got through the rest of high school in relative peace. Not to say that it was completely uneventful- all the girls except Usagi have gone on dates and had relationships like any normal student. But until the events of this story, there have been no significant battles or otherworldly threats attacking the earth. The girls have held weekly gatherings to confer with one another (using Rei\u2019s temple or Haruka\u2019s flat as their base of operations) and stage mock battles to keep in shape, but no one has developed any new attacks or transformations since Galaxia. As Usagi mentions, the act of resurrecting the dead Senshi at the end of her fight with Galaxia has caused her to lose her ability to assume her Eternal form at will. In theory, she can still assume that transformation if all the other scouts concentrated their power on her, but so far no such threat has arisen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inner scouts decided after high school to attend the same university. This was easier for some than others. Usagi and Minako especially had a hard time on the entrance exams for everyone\u2019s preferred university (who\u2019s name I\u2019ll make up when it becomes necessary). But after a few years of struggling, all the girls were finally enrolled. Their choice of university was partially dictated by their outer counterparts- all the girls agreed they wanted to attend the same school Haruka and Michiru had gotten into. As circumstances would have it, the two outer scouts are now seniors at this university in the same semester as our inner scouts are attending as freshmen. Overseas, Mamoru has been attending Harvard for many years, earning first a bachelors then a Doctorate in his studies. This will be his final semester in America. Hotaru was attending middle school, but that arrangement has hit some BIG complications recently. Chibiusa hasn\u2019t been seen since she left for the future in Sailor Moon Stars, but Pluto assures everyone that she and their future counterparts are doing well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently, Usagi and the inner scouts are all 21 years old. (I know I had haruka comment early on in the story that Usagi was 18\u2026.feel free to ignore that or assume it was some private joke between her and Michiru- the story will just work better if usagi is a little bit older than that). Haruka and Michiru are 24 years old at this point. Tuxedo Mask is a bit older than that, we\u2019ll say 25 (little ambigious there). Pluto physically is the oldest scout, looking somewhere around 27 years old. This point is somewhat moot in her case, since her actual age is at least several thousand years older than everyone else and could potentially number in the millions. If we can take the appearance of the scouts in Chibiusa\u2019s timeline as any indication, aging pretty much stops for the senshi somewhere in the mid-20s. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHotaru is obviously an interesting case. Physically she\u2019s hopped around the age bracket throughout the series. She\u2019s supposed to be 11 or 12 when we first meet her. Mistress 9 turns her into an adult, which to my eyes was older than any of the scouts. Then when she\u2019s reborn she\u2019s only one year old. In the 5th season her biological age jumps to about 5 years old, then jumps AGAIN to an age comparable to where she was when we first met her. Since we aren\u2019t told exactly how old she is when the 5th season closes, I\u2019m assuming she was 14 when this story opens (same age as Usagi when she became sailor moon for the first time). Kind of a moot point now that her powers bumped her age up once again to roughly 20 years old, but there it is anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChibiusa we\u2019ll cover when (not if) we get to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that\u2019s pretty much everything. Oh, and if your wondering what to call this \u201cseason\u201d, my suggestion would be to follow the usual traditions for Sailor Moon. Since past seasons used letters to differentiate each other (Sailor Moon R, Sailor Moon S, Sailor Moon Super S), just think of this as Sailor Moon ENF. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>On the same day that most of the Sailor Senshi (along with the vast majority of Tokyo) had their thoughts and attention entirely occupied by the showdown between Mercury and the incubus, the youngest of their number found herself occupied by far more immediate concerns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Williams stared dumbfounded as Hotaru screamed and tried to cover herself. A moment ago she had been a seemingly ordinary middle school student, albeit one with a secret magic as her birthright. But that same magic, which at the best of times seemed to have a will and purpose all its own, had once again sprung forth and altered the course of the girl\u2019s life. All at once Hotaru found her mind assaulted with new visions of a grim future, while her body began to grow and change. Stitch and thread strained and tore away as a 14 year old girl grew into a 20 year old woman in the space of a heartbeat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhhh\u2026ex..cuse me\u2026.\u201d Hotaru mumbled, the shock of her visions and the suddenness of her nudity overwhelming her as she took a step back from her teacher. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Williams opened his mouth speak, closed it, and opened it again. Hotaru felt queasy as she realized his eyes were roving over her. Her skin was pale, making the blush all the more obvious on her body. Her newly formed breasts were large and full, a fact she was all too aware of as she tried to hug the enormous orbs with her hands. Elegant hips traced down a flat stomach to give with to a beautiful round bottom and luxuriously long legs. A thin landing strip of black hair ran over her other naked sex. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliams cleared his throat, turning away slightly as rational thought slowly seeped back into his mind. But as he averted his eyes, he made note of something on the ground. Stooping down even as Hotaru gasped and backed away several more steps, he picked up the remains of her school uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is one of ours.\u201d He said, finding his voice at last. \u201cThis belongs to Tomoe Hotaru. Where did you get this? Why has it been torn?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe aging process Hotaru\u2019s magic imposed upon her was a strange thing indeed. Mercifully, the magic could mitigate the trauma of leaping ahead several years by providing a kind of \u2018mental conditioning\u2019 to the subject. When she was younger, Hotaru had been fed a wealth of knowledge and information in the span of a few moments- the intention being to \u2018update\u2019 her mind the way it had \u2018updated\u2019 her body. So even as she had gone from a baby yet to speak her first word to a five year old girl, Hotaru found herself fluent in the Japanese language and familiar with the basic concepts and understandings a five year old could reasonably have been assumed to aquire as she aged. But the knowledge was incomplete, leading to bits of confusion (her knowledge of mothers and father\u2019s leading to the comical way she would refer to her adopted guardians as Michiru-mama and Haruka-papa regardless of the latter\u2019s true gender). So as she stood naked under the cold gaze of her teacher, Hotaru\u2019s head swam in a sea of imposed knowledge. It would take time to acclimate to all of it. But she did understand one thing almost immediately- a woman roaming the hallways of a middle school completely naked and in possession of the tattered remains of a missing student\u2019s uniform was going to have horrible implications.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she ran. Hotaru ignored the surprised exclamation of her teacher, which quickly turned to alarmed calls to stop and heated accusations. She could feel her breasts bouncing in all directions as she made for the stairs. On the first floor she would find her locker, with her shoes (wholefully too small for her now), her text books, and most importantly a certain wand and communicator hidden in the very bottom. Hotaru had been warned about the embarrassing side effects that would come with her transformation, but there didn\u2019t seem to be a choice. At best, she might be able to explain the situation outright and avoid all kinds of trouble (the story of a girl magically aging right out of her clothes would become infinitely more plausible if she could prove that she was a Sailor Scout first). At worst, she would have boots and gloves and super human abilities at her disposal, all of which was more than she had now! And the outer scouts were one frantic communication away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t a fantastic plan, but given the short amount of time Hotaru had been given to formulate it she was quite satisfied. Which was why she had to fight back tears when she arrived at her locker only to find it completely empty. She trembled, her first and last hope dashed all at once. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat had happened to her things? This morning this locker had been full of books and notes, now it didn\u2019t have her shoes! Why would anyone\u2026.wait. There was something. Taped to the back wall was a note. It had only one word- HIDE.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHotaru could hear footsteps coming. Williams had apparently rounded up a small mob of teachers and staff, and was loudly explaining the situation and shouting orders. Someone was saying the police had been called. Hotaru took in a deep, deep breath. One chance\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHotaru had always tended towards the tall and thin. While athletics were the far from her passion, her ability to be flexible and lean enough to fit into any sort of hiding place had appealed to her troubled childhood. So even now, with her new curves and the massive orbs on her chest, Hotaru thought she might have a chance. Kneeling down, she pulled herself into the confines of the locker. Sucking in a breath, pressing her knees up against her body, Hotaru squeezed into the painfully tight space. She quickly closed the door a moment before her pursuers rounded the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a mass of confusion and shouted words. The principal arrived, and there was an anxious exchange between him and Williams. Hotaru was genuinely touched, this was an entirely different picture to the man who often berated her in class. He was clearly shaken and distraught over the disappearance of his student, but he was also visibly trying to stay calm and authoritative in the face of the situation. He was doing everything in his power to find her, Hotaru realized. Inwardly she kicked herself for giving him such a hard time. If she had the chance\u2026.<br>\r\nA siren blaired in the distance. The principal gave quick instructions to everyone- teachers back to class, watch over the remaining students. Staff keep an eye on the exits. He and Williams and several others moved to meet the police at the front entrance of the building. Hotaru held her breath as several shadows passed directly by her locker. Then silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll at once another shadow loomed up right in front of her locker. Hotaru sucked in a breath. This shadow was not moving at all. The naked girl trembled as she realized it was looking directly into the cramped space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA note was pressed between the grill. Hotaru gasped, fumbling with the single piece of paper. It read \u201cGood job hiding. But you need to leave. The police are here now. It will only be a few minutes before someone asks to see your locker. When they do, they better not find you here or the game is over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGame\u2026\u201d Hotaru muttered in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was more writing on the back. \u201cThere\u2019s a girl\u2019s bathroom to your left down the hall. Its closed for maintenance. No one is there. Go there for further instructions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHotaru\u2019s head was spinning. She was naked, stuffed inside her locker. Someone knew she was here\u2026.had her wand and communicator. And\u2026wanted to play a game\u2026?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hotaru moved to open the door and try to confront her mystery writer. But she found her limbs, while willing to obey, found their path obstructed by the tiny space they were in. Hotaru wanted to curse and cry all at once. She was stuck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-ey! W-whoever you are\u2026.I can\u2019t get out!\u201d Hotaru hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was the longest pause. Hotaru was about to speak out again, louder, which may well have drawn attention from one of her other seekers. But then she heard a laugh, a single deep chuckle of disdainful amusement. And the shadows in her small world seemed to cluster around her. Hotaru heard the door to her locker open, but found herself blind by an inky darkness. But her other senses were working\u2026there was the smell in the air of perfume, tantalizing yet somehow alien, the sound of heels clicking on the marble floor, and\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-hey!\u201d Hotaru said as a hand with long nails reached out and touched her. The contact was very gentle, but something about it made Hotaru gasp nonetheless. And what it was doing\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop!\u201d Hotaru whimpered as she as her bottom was given an affectionate squeeze before the hand playfully felt its way up along her ribcage. Hotaru gasped again as her left breast was enveloped by the intruder\u2019s grip, squeezed and played with a few times until the nipple stood at attention. When Hotaru took in a breath to protest more loudly the hand put a finger to her lips. Somewhere a voice whispered \u201cHush.\u201d, so softly Hotaru was unsure if anyone had truly spoken. Then down again, the hand touching her knee, squeezing her calf\u2026.and PULL! Hotaru gasped as her leg was freed from the locker. She could feel it hanging free from the open door, but still no light penetrated her small space. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT-thank-\u201c Hotaru began, then gasped as the hand squeezed her thigh\u2026.and a finger parted her inner folds. \u201cN-no! Please! S-stop\u2026\u201d Hotaru gasped as she felt the sudden jolt of pleasure move through her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe owner of the hand clearly knew what it was doing. The contact could not have lasted more than a handful of moments, but in that space Hotaru found herself worked into a state of gasping need like nothing her own fingers were capable of inducing. It was with a bewildering mix of regret and relief that Hotaru found the fingers withdrawing. Had they stayed a moment longer\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face flushed with embarrassment, Hotaru pushed herself out of the locker. Light flooded back into her vision, momentarily blinding her. A second later, Hotaru glanced left and right but saw no one. She stood in the hallway, her blush deep, her hands hiding her ample breasts and sopping sex from view, unsure what to do or say. But in the distance, a door opened and voices echoed down the hall. Instinct took over, and she fled. <br>\r\nThe world seemed so much smaller than it had before, and yet the distance to the bathroom felt like miles. She ran on tiptoe, hands nervously clutching at her anatomy. She reached the bathroom door and shoved her way past the \u2018out of order\u2019 sign. She had a dead certainty that lingering even a second longer in the hallway would have brought her face to face with a police officer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside the bathroom Hotaru pressed herself up against the door. Heart was pounding as footsteps filled the hallway. Voices passed feet from her hiding place. No one entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrembling, Hotaru made her was to the sink. Delicately and silently turning the faucet, Hotaru coaxed a trickle of water out as she cupped her hands. Her ears primed for the slightest noise, Hotaru stood statue still as the water slowly welled up in her palms. Careful not to make too much noise or splash too loudly, she washed her face with the cold liquid. It felt good against the burning blush on her face. Next she rubbed more water on her shoulders and breasts, washing away the dust on the inside of the locker and giving herself a chance to calm down from the terror of being caught and the unwanted arousal from the stranger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at her face in the mirror. She blanched. The beautiful, pale skinned woman looking back at her was so alien. She sighed to herself, looking at the twin orbs hanging on her chest. Hotaru had been what Michiru had delicately referred to as a \u2018late bloomer\u2019. It seemed her body had decided to make up for this in her latter adolescence by providing two orbs that put her guardian\u2019s to shame. Hotaru smiled briefly at the thought, then her expression turned dour as she contemplated her face in the mirror. She was the spitting image of Mistress 9. Her hair was shorter, of course, but in every other detail she wore the face of her evil counterpart. This was the cruel visage that looked back at itself when she was trapped deep in her own mind, the alien thing inside her directing her like a puppet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI never wanted to see this face again.\u201d Hotaru muttered to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t say that.\u201d Came a voice over the intercom.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Can you hear me?\u201d She asked tentatively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course.\u201d The speaker said. \u201cDon\u2019t worry though. I\u2019m talking directly to you.

Look again.\u201d <br>\r\nHotaru hesitated, then cautiously looked at the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook carefully, Hotaru-chan.\u201d The voice said softly. \u201cLook in your eyes. Do you see it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026..I don\u2019t\u2026.\u201d Hotaru trailed off. Two deep violent eyes gazed back at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThese are eyes full of wonder, Hotaru. Wonder and longing. These are not 9\u2019s eyes. These eyes are lonely, yes, and maybe a little despairing. But there is no malice in those eyes. You have the power to destroy, yet I see no hunger for destruction. Those are your eyes, Hotaru. Your eyes and your body. That isn\u2019t Mistress Nine\u2019s face. It was always your face, and your body. Nine only stole them from you, like she stole everything else. Your beautiful, Hotaru. Don\u2019t ever hate yourself because of what others made you do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d Hotaru paused. \u201cWho are you? How do you know this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026\u2026..I\u2019m sorry, Hotaru.\u201d The words came softly. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you that. Not yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause you haven\u2019t earned the answers.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the third thing I want from you, Hotaru. I want to play a game.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHotaru shivered. The air in the small restroom felt chill on her bare skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo I shouldn\u2019t hate myself for what others make me do?\u201d She said at last. \u201cShould I hate THEM for it, then? Should I hate you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026.That\u2019s your choice.\u201d The voice said. \u201cI won\u2019t blame you either way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you my enemy?\u201d Hotaru asked plainly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s also your choice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026.you\u2019ll keep me \u2018safe\u2019\u2026.but keep me naked. You\u2019ll help me hide, but only if I follow your rules. You won\u2019t tell me who you are, but you know more about me than anyone else. How can I trust you?\u201d Hotaru demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you have a choice?\u201d The voice asked, the melancholy being replaced by a note of glee. \u201cHere\u2019s what I can tell you. You can trust that I won\u2019t hurt you. You can trust I won\u2019t use you to hurt anyone else. And you can trust that I\u2019ll keep you from being hurt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026..but groping is okay?\u201d Hotaru said angrily, a blush on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice laughing a long musical laugh. \u201cOf course. You can\u2019t ask for my help, put me in range of that hot little body, and not expect me to inspect it! That\u2019s not at all fair! Just like it isn\u2019t fair to hide your body from everyone else!\u201d<br>\r\nHotaru squirmed a bit under the words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m embarrassing you. Here\u2019s the deal. I\u2019ll give you a sporting chance here. That\u2019s the game. Its like a scavenger hunt. You find my instructions, go where they tell you, try not to be seen. Make it to the end, I\u2019ll give you back your wand and let you call the others.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat if I get caught? The police-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said I\u2019d keep you safe. I won\u2019t let anyone catch you. The police aren\u2019t going to bother you. I\u2019ll make sure of it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026\u2026I don\u2019t want you to hurt any of them.\u201d Hotaru said at last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026\u2026all right. Since you asked nicely. If you follow my instructions, no one else will be hurt. If you follow my rules, nothing bad will happen.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You can hide all you like, and feel free to cover up with your hands or the odd inanimate object. No clothes, though. If you find anything to completely cover yourself up with, you leave it alone. Remember, even if no one else can see you, I can, and I don\u2019t want you spoiling my view.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHotaru blushed crimson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSecond and last rule is simple. No one hears about me. Not yet. That includes your sailor friends.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d Hotaru paused, her mind turning things over. \u201cYou can\u2019t possibly trust me to do that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe speakers laughed colely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a reason to follow your rules once I have my wand. You know that. You aren\u2019t stupid enough to assume I\u2019ll follow your rules once I get back what you took.\u201d Hotaru said. \u201cWhat aren\u2019t you telling me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..I knew I was right. Your clever, Hotaru. You and I think alike. You\u2019ll find ways around my traps I didn\u2019t think of just as often as you\u2019ll fall into them. That\u2019s why I wanted to play with you.\u201d The voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI knew someone else who liked to play games. Queen Nehelenia. She drew all of us into her mirror world. She took over the mind of our prince. She attacked the sailor scouts, and began capturing them one after another. She wanted to claim everything our princess loved. She tried to manipulate me too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026..I know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen you know my response. I raised the silence glaive. As the scout of destruction, I have control over life and death. If my glaive falls, a world dies. The price is my own life. Nehelenia mocked me. She said I couldn\u2019t bring the glaive down. She knew using my magic would kill me as well. She knew that. But she didn\u2019t know my duty. To save my prince, to protect my princess\u2026.to protect chibiusa? Our future? What other choice could I make? Death was not something I wanted to embrace. But death is nothing I fear.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know that! If chibimoon hadn\u2019t stopped you\u2026hadn\u2019t begged you to stop\u2026..Nehelenia would be dead now. And so would you. Your life is worth more than your duty!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHotaru walked to the door to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d Hotaru fixed her eyes on the bathroom exit. \u201cChibiusa asked me to have faith in her and her mother. She asked me not to die for them. That\u2019s why I stopped. But\u2026.what my life is worth is for me to decide. Not her, not the other senshi, and certainly not you. Tell me, if I can put my duty before my life, what makes you think I can\u2019t put it before my shame?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wonder. Death, in its own way, is easy. You only have to choose to die once. You never have to face the consequences of that choice. But these are consequences you have to LIVE with. Letting the police see your naked body. Latching your wrists so you have no way to hide yourself. Being dragged to prison. Risking your identity on the investigation that will follow. That takes a different sort of courage than a willingness to die. Are you strong enough? Yes, probably. But then again, if your strong enough to do that your strong enough to play my game.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t answered my question.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know. So let me lay my cards on the table. This isn\u2019t a trap. I don\u2019t plan to extort you into silence. I want to put you in some embarrassing situations, oh yes. But I won\u2019t try to blackmail you. As you said, you can\u2019t be manipulated by shame. And Mistress nine stands as a good example of what happens to those who try to control you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you planning, then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet to the end of my game, and I\u2019ll give you something. Simple as that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBribery?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. Just a gift. Something heartfelt from me to you. I\u2019ll give you a gift, and a little insight into your situation. Yours and mine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. That\u2019s all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHotaru drew in a breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know. It seems like an awful lot to gamble on, doesn\u2019t it? I\u2019m going to mock you, humiliate you, force you through all kinds of trials, and at the end your supposed to keep your silence based on one little secret?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHotaru remained still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmmmm. Feeling a little trepidation now? Why am I so sure this will work? Humiliation and death, as we\u2019ve established, cannot keep you in check. What secret could I possibly have that will do what they can\u2019t? I won\u2019t lie, Hotaru. If you play my game, a part of you will wish you\u2019d stormed out of this bathroom and handed yourself over to the police. Because what I have to say\u2026.once you know\u2026.heh. Time to choose, Hotaru. Your first instruction is on the fifth floor. There\u2019s an open air duct in this room that will lead you right to it. You should be thin enough to squeeze through and up. If your gonna play, start climbing. If not\u2026.you know where the exit is.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hotaru regarded the overhead speaker with hollow eyes. Her face was blank, expressionless. She betrayed no hint of trepidation, no sense of fear or doubt. She regarded the source of her mysterious puppet master coolly for one final moment, then turned toward the ventilation system without a word. It was only when she opened the grill and gasped at the cold air blowing across her smooth skin, that her demeanor betrayed any sign of her inner turmoil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaturn, perhaps more than any other scout, was a girl at odds with her own power. On the one hand, she was the sailor of death and silence, the one upon whom rested the sailor's greatest and most terrible weapon. In her action and deed she carried herself with the cold assurance of a soldier at peace with death. In moments of crisis, her ability to pierce the future and see the nature of her enemies could take even the enigmatic Pluto by surprise (a girl who, by her very nature, should rightfully know every secret the past and future kept hidden). And yet at times that power seemed to swallow the woman Hotaru truly was up completely. Through endless transformations, her body aged back and forth at the whims of demons and her own inner essence, Hotaru found herself less in control and more simply carried along by the whims of her magic. She could see recall the last instance her body had changed, warping from a five year old to 11 in a heartbeat. She had been confronted by a ghostly image of herself, older and garbed in as a sailor scout. The image had proclaimed Hotaru to be a 'sleeping soul' under the protection of the ghostly guardian, who identified itself as Sailor Saturn. And then, calling upon the confused girl to 'wake up' the phantom touched her forehead, and memories of the past intermixed with warning of the future as she aged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question that haunted her, when the battle was over and she had time to consider such things, was who she had truly been talking to in that moment. Was she, Tomoe Hotaru, also Sailor Saturn? Or was Sailor Saturn someone that lived in her mind, less a part of her and more an invading entity like Mistress 9? Was her modern life, the memories of Chibusa and her father and all the love and anguish she had gone through....was that life nothing more important than a dream? And especially now, with her mind filled with so much knowledge and understanding, who was she? None of the facts that filled her mind at this moment were truly hers to own- the knowledge did not come from books or experience as it would have had her power allowed her to mature naturally. It came from within her, from some fathomless wellspring that faciliated her sudden growth. So her feelings, her aspirations, her desires- were these things truly what Tomoe Hotaru wanted, or were they the things Sailor Saturn felt she should have? Was there a difference? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing she was absolutely certain of was that the feeling of panic and embarrassment that was even now taking the place of the fatalistic resolve she had demonstrated to her unseen opponent felt very, very real. Playing the game was the best choice, of course. Anyone trying to lay claim to her transformation wand other than her was completely unacceptable. The magic was simply too dangerous. And the chance to gain any new information about their enemies should not be wasted. But that was hardly the only reason. For all her bravado, the thought of walking out into the middle of her school bare to the world, of letting all her former classmates and teachers and total strangers see her like this....the very thought made Hotaru tremble. No! She was willing to do anything, even put her trust in a sadistic pervert's game, not to endure that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could feel her whole body shiver as she bent down to crawl into the vent. The fit was tight, but Hotaru had always been a thin girl and that trait had apparently carried over...in most respects. It took a little fumbling and squeezing to get her large breasts through the cramped space. She used one hand to hug them tightly to her chest, the other pulling herself into the dusty, cold space. Her mind briefly flashed to the taunting words from the loud speaker. The voice had implied it had some means to watch her wherever she went, no doubt some kind of scrying magic. She imagined her other half adjusting the view with a wave of her (those groping hands and long nails felt like the touch of a woman, though the voice had been genderless) hand, getting the best angle to watch Hotaru's butt squeeze into the tight space....and then crawl on all four up the angled vent, breasts heaving as she inched her way along....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough!\" Hotaru berated herself. \"She's playing with you. Psychological warfare. Don't listen to her.\" Hotaru smiled a little to herself. Her voice of her inner monologue sounded remarkably like Haruka-papa's voice. That was fitting, she supposed. Of her three adopted parents and teammates, Haruka was the most blunt and straight-forward. If anyone could deliver a mental slap and issue some simple orders, it would be her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe climb became steeper. Eventually Haruka found herself having to press her arms and legs against the metal. Her ascent had effectively become vertical. Hotaru was somewhat gratified that the ascent was no great feat. Whatever force had guided her aging seemed to assume she would be a very fit, athletic girl in her later years. She was still unsure whether this was a completely accurate vision how she might have aged, but it was certainly convient in this situation. The passage narrowed, and Hotaru gasped as her large nipples rubbed against the cold metal. On the opposite end of the spectrum, other presumptions made about how her anatomy would form in the future were far less helpful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHotaru counted softly as she made her way laboriously up the shaft. Her assumption was that the passages running crosswise to her own had to represent different floors. To her consternation, these passages were far smaller than the one she was in. She should be able to squeeze in....just. Getting back out....Hotaru realized she'd have to find another way back down. There was too little room to manuever in the passage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where is this instruction supposed to-\" Hotaru thought, crawling into the cramped passage, when she suddenly noticed a tiny sticky note taped to the ceiling. \"Oh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Turn over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHotaru stared at the words on the little sticky. She had briefly feared she'd be unable to read the instructions in the dark confines of the airduct. Apparently such concerns had already been addressed, because the letters on the page were inked in a bright pink color that glowed as if set against a blacklight. But seeing the words and following the instructions were two different things. The space was cramped, and sliding over onto her back was no small order. More importantly, how could that help her find the next set of instructions?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she didn't really have a choice, did she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, sucking in a breath Hotaru began to contort her thin body, inch by inch sliding herself laboriously onto her side, then onto her back. Knees and elbows and her new found breasts seemed to constantly be in her way, but her own stubborn nature allowed her to pull and shift and turn in the small space until she was staring up at the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...now what?\" She asked the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now this.\" A familiar voice whispered. Hotaru gasped as she felt dozens of hands reaching out and grasping her body. Pulling. Touching. Groping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop!\" Hotaru squeeled. Beyond the indiginity of being molested in a dark space by things unseen, Hotaru had her own reasons to dread the sensations she was being subjected to. Vicious nightmares had haunted her early life, visions visited upon her by Mistress Nine of crucifixion and pale white hands with long claws mercilessly choked her and slowly tore her apart. Small wonder she yet had a fear of the dark....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please. I'm begging you....\" She mumured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hotaru...\" The voice came again from the darkness. \"We're just playing with shadows and smoke. They won't hurt you. Very much the opposite....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHotaru gasped as unseen lips began kissing her exposed body everywhere, paying special attention to her nipples and stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I don't care! Stop!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph.\" The sensation vanished. \"Its for your own good, you know. You need to get used to this. It won't be long before wandering hands exploring that wondrous body of yours becomes the whole of your existence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another part of your game?\" Hotaru said darkly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Just part of your future.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just leave me alone! I want want to be....I've never even....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah. No, I don't suppose you have. You just inherited that body a few hours ago.\" A laugh with some sardonic edge. \"It needn't trouble you, Hotaru. I'll be very gentle. It won't hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't.....\" Hotaru began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. You have someone specific in mind for that?\" There was a hint of sadness. \"Of course you do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's none of your business!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But its obvious nonetheless....\" The voice said as the hands receded. \"I've never understood the appeal of virginity. Seems like such a trifling, troublesome thing. The sooner it is discarded the better. But I'll respect your desire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"........thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait here. Stay in the shadows. Make no sound. They won't look for you here, and my magic will keep you safe. Start moving when I give you a sign. Kick out the first grate on your right. I'll give you a gift for your efforts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't make that decision until you've seen my gift, little girl. Just realize, this gift comes with a price. It will take...some time and investment. You'll be beyond the range of my awareness for awhile. Beyond the range of my protections.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHotaru didn't say it, but she viewed that as a gift in and of itself. But something must have given away her thoughts anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll have reason to stop relishing that moment soon enough. Just be a good girl and follow my directions. Make sure my 'gift' plays along.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll understand later. For now, hide.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHotaru felt the air lighten slightly. She let out a breath she had not realized she was holding. Okay then. Now she would wait.</span></div></div>",

Night had long since fallen, but between the city lights radiating in from the balconey and the heavy overhead lights shining at regular intervals from above shadows to hide in were few and far between. And alas, Daria's apartment door had to smack in the center of one of those overhead lights. The three were naked and exposed to anyone wandering the hallways, or anyone passing on the street who had the good fortune to glance up at the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on! I'm stronger than I look! All it'll take is one good kick and that door is history!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then the alarms go off, and everyone in my complex wakes up and sees us standing around here, and this day gets even more fucked up.\" Daria said in exasperation. \"Just chill a second.

I, uh, I've...let's just say I've gotten a date out of more than one girlfriend by way of my photoshoots, and....my exs have a habit of trying for a little revenge when they decide to break up with me.\" Daria said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh.\" Ami said. \"Interesting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get any ideas, sister.\" Daria said, though her face looked a little red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I make no promises until that door opens.\" Mercury said in perfect deadpan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah.\" Daria muttered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe recent battles of the sailor scouts had had an apparent impact on media activity in the region. Thus, while it was a simple matter to cover the distance between the battlefield and Daria's apartment, getting there unnoticed had become next to impossible during the daylight hours. The first few attempts had led to several brief but embarrassing encounters with camera crews and amatuer photographers eager to add their own shots to the growing horde of clips and photos springing up on the internet. If the two sailor scouts were alone, that would have been a minor concern. But with Daria in tow, the two resolved to be a bit more circumspect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaria's heart beat a little faster as her hair clip made the last telltale click of the lock on her door. She was still uncertain whether she wanted her hands to move faster to finally end her public nudity, or slower to delay what she was relishing and dreading to come. But before she could examine that thought more completely, her hands gave one last twist in the lock and the door creaked open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ta da,\" She said softly as she rose to her feet and trotted into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaria's apartment was small, but she was proud of what she had done with the space. Fully half of it was devoted to a photography space, complete with backdrops and lightning. A few leather couches were scattered around the room, each doubling as a bed when folded out. Dozens of high quality pictures were occupied the bare brick walls. The whole picture was surprisingly innocent looking for the tough as nails image Daria tried to cultivate. No biker paraphernalia or nude photos were on display. Then again, that was by design. Easier to put a model at ease this way. Besides, this was her home. Here she didn't have to try so hard to be tough and dangerous and badass. Here she could be whatever she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...what do we do first?\" Ami asked behind her. Without waiting for a response, she turned Daria around and kissed her passionately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could be whatever she wanted. Most of the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha!\" Daria said, pulling away. \"Right. Uhhh....Actually, I'll need a minute to think about that! This wasn't really where I wanted to do the shoot, you know? But they close the studios early, so we can't do it there....sooooo I'm gonna get a smoke and think a sec. You...uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi looked slightly disappointed, but then smiled. \"Could I use your phone. I need to check in. The other girls are probably worried and angry its taken so long to hear from us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool. Cool.\" Daria muttered. \"Ummm, so I'll let you do that then. Come on moongirl! Let's hit the balconey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's okay. I don't smo-ack!\" usagi cried as Daria marched up to her and yanked on one of her long ponytails. She was awkwardly dragged from the room like a reluctant dog on a gold leash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Owowowowowow!\" Usagi said as she was half-led and half-shoved onto Daria's little balconey. On the way out Daria aquired a spare black jacket, which she wore about her shoulders. As expected, a pack of cigarettes was waiting for her in the left pocket. Daria took a brief moment of comfort in the familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two rules, hon.\" Daria said, lighting the cigarette as Usagi gingerly massaged the bun the goth girl had been yanking a moment ago. \"One, if your in my house, you do what I say. Sometimes it will sound like an order, and sometimes it might sound like request, but either way you fucking do it. Second, when I say to do it, all I want to hear from you is 'yes, ma'am!'. Got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi looked like she wanted to burst into tears, but all she nodded softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool.\" Daria sank down into her chair. The naked blond watched the mostly naked brunette puff on her cigarette a moment, silent and worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daria....\" She began. \"I don't think I should-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me something.\" Daria interrupted. \"You have all these fancy sailor powers, right? You got that crazy super strength and the jumping and reflexes and those crazy attacks. You even hypnotise people to keep them from recognizing you. So...do you have any mind control?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh....what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mind control! You know....is there....is there a reason I'M the one that suddenly feels compelled to do everything Ami is suggesting without a word?\" Daria asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....No. We don't have any mind control. Probably.\" Usagi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does that mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....our magic changes over time. We get stronger, learn new abilities, that kind of thing. But I don't think Mercury can control people's minds. And even if she could, she wouldn't use it on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why does she do what you want?\" usagi shot back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. I just kinda....know what she wants. You know? You sorta get a feel for that kinda thing when you work with models. You learn what people are capable of without talking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe its the same with you. Ami hardly ever asks for favors, and when she does she tends to apologize for even the tiniest thing. I bet you haven't had much opportunity to see what she's like when she gets assertive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She....gorgeous.\" Daria whispered. \"Fucking hell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wanted a little fling. I wasn't planning on this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her being a sailor scout.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Falling in love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" Usagi whispered. After a moment she sat down beside Daria. \"No. I guess you can't plan for that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaria regarded her silently a moment, then growled in frustration. \"Do you know how fucking annoying you are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha? What did I do??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing! That's the point! I figured if Ami had an ex-girlfriends they probably abused her timidity and trust. I was gonna eviscerate them. Its one of the things I do when I get someone new. But not only do I have to find out that Ami's ex is this hot blonde with an amazing body-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-thanks?\" Usagi said, blushing profusely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not only that, but it turns out she has fucking super powers that could fry me where I stand. And on top of that, on top of every other fucking thing, she has to be this bubbly idiot who saves my life and....and....\" Daria sputtered and took a drag on her cigarette. \"And no matter how hard I try I can't find a fucking way to hate you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't?\" Usagi rubbed the back of her head. \"Could have fooled me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I also said you annoy me. Besides, you have your hair dangling off either end of your head, waving back and forth...its like its whispering to me 'Please boss me around.' So really its your fault.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".........I see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaria smiled, the first hint of genuine emotion she had shown since they arrived. \"But I need to know something....Usagi. What is there between you two. Really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".......that's....complicated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then uncomplicate it for me. Gimme the short version.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's between us?\" Usagi said, her face downcast. \"The tide.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cryptic....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. That's exactly what it is. I'm the moon and she's the ocean, and whether I mean to or not I...I pull her to me. I pull all of them to me. I....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked on the verge of tears. Daria regarded her, then smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So they were right. Its not the size of the boat, its the motion of the ocean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh....what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....also, your naive. That's also really fucking annoying.\"</span></div></div>",

I guess.....do you believe in reincarnation?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Like buddihism? I'm more the agnostic type.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No...I mean, it is similar. Rei says a lot of religions get some of the details right. Its one way people remember the moon kingdom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So your saying you had a past life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....yes. But more than that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See previous comment on the cryptic bullshit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi glowered a moment. \"This isn't easy, okay? Its like trying to remember a dream! And what I can remember is....\" She blushed and took in a deep breath. \"I used to live on the moon. I don't know how long ago that was.....probably something epic like 'at the dawn of time' or 'before recorded history'. It was a few thousand years, at least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. This sounds like your making it up, but its a step above-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hush. I'm trying to think. There were....people. Lots of people, whole cities....and they lived on all the planets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....now I know your making it up. People lived on the moon? Or, to pick an easy one....Mercury? Rocky, irradiated, dead Mercury? Planet closest to the sun? Millions of degrees? That planet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not very good with Astronomy.\" usagi lamented. \"But yes. They were...different back then. Everything worked differently back then. Magic was as common as air. Some of the planets looked the same....but also so different. Mercury was filled with endless seas and big poles full of craggy ice! And Jupiter was big and red and full of gas, but there were huge floating cities made of crystal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its true! Magic was what we used instead of science. It flowed through everything....resonated with all the planets....it made the worlds the way they should be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"War. And death. Someone terrible was going killing....my people. My mother had to stop it, had to save us. Even if it meant ending our golden age. So she enacted the worst magic she had ever called upon....she scoured the worlds clean of their civilizations. All to save Earth. Earth and her daughter. The armies of the Dark kingdom were poised to take over every world, every city. Earth was the one untouched place. So she killed herself and everyone on the moon so that we could be reborn in an age when we would be needed. So we could protect the only planet to survive that onslaught.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi's voice had changed. Her eyes were closed, her head tilted down. Something in her pose and posture spoke of a very different girl than the one Daria had bullied moments before. Something almost...regal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are still remnants of the old kingdoms, of course. Ruins. Legends. They still have enough magic to stay hidden. Pyramids on the moon. A stone face on Mars. Some people can see through the illusions. Most think they're crazy. Someday perhaps we can reclaim those lost places. But for now, we just live our lives.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh....what about Ami?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ami? Oh, yes. Mercury. Of course. Strange the ways things work out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She was a little older than me when we first met. She was my guardian and my mentor. There were few things I hated more than her lessons. Why did it even matter? We understood the natural forces of the world. Our knowledge was more primitive than yours, but we knew the truths Newton and Einstein gave to the world. But we also knew those truths could be bent at the whim of magic. It seemed like a waste of time. And my feelings never sat well with poor Mercury....the things we said to each other in those early years....I was young and spoiled and an awful person. But like all the others....we learned to tolerate each other. And like all the others, we eventually learned to be friends. And more than that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. How exactly did that work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wouldn't understand, I'm afraid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's there to understand? You were fuckbuddies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nusagi laughed, a gently and lyrical sound that sent a shiver through Daria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your putting all of this in your own terms, so you can understand it. i suppose that's all you can do. But that will only take you so far. We were sailor scouts...human incarnations of the planets. That meant something different back then. We were the heirs to whole worlds. We lived on our respective planets....we walked among their people and learned their customs. Every world had as many languages, as many religions, as many borders and ethnicities as Earth has now. We had to know them all. We had to respect them all. We were entrusted to guard all places. Save those peoples. And more than that, we were entrusted to understand them all. Not just the good hearted and the kind. We were the soldiers of love and justice. We had to look on the faces of our world's greatest monsters....to understand their hearts and their black dreams...and we had to forgive them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....how do you do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With time, mostly. It helps to understand that everyone has a little darkness. Inside your own mind, you rarely see yourself as a villain. All of you have a little bit of cruelty inside yourselves. Some people crush insects for their enjoyment. Some people hurt other people for the same reason. And more often than that, people do awful things for reasons they believe are justified. Perhaps even good. Dig deeply enough, people stop being evil and start to simply be sad. The reasons they do what they do, the ways a mind can be broken or twisted so that the terrible becomes the moral....that's how. We worked in equal measure to keep our worlds safe and to forgive those who threatened them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you were some kind of fucking saint?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me? No. My mother, maybe. But I never forgave Beryl for what she did. Not back then. It took a literal lifetime to make peace with all of that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"..........\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that's isn't really an answer to your question. But that is one thing a sailor scout must be. We are born human, but we must be more than that as well. We embody the planets and the stars, and they are by turns embodied by us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have absolutely no idea what your talking about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh heh. I suppose not. So....imagine that you could live forever. You start your life meeting new people as any human does, but then you lose those people to death or violence as any human does. The difference is, you keep on living. Perhaps you shut yourself off from the world. Perhaps you keep your heart open, making new friends and watching them grow old. But in the end, there are only a handful of people in creation you can truly know...people like yourself. Love them, hate them, in the end they are the only constants in your life. They are the only ones who can give you the things you need- companionship, advice, love, support.... all we really had for those things were each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a bad vampire romance story.\" Daria grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take your word for it. My point is, we did not become lovers in the conventional sense. Few of us had an honest...bias for female lovers....Neptune and Uranus notwithstanding. But even the most reclusive of the nine scouts craved contact, and even the most ardantly platonic friendships grow deeper over the centuries.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or you break up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know....divorces. Break ups. People stop being able to stand each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes. And we did, from time to time. Mars and I especially....heh. Our fights used to rock the heavens and boiling the seas. But as I said, we were human and more than human. Our souls were infused with the essence of planets. And we slowly learned this was simply the nature of things....sometimes Mars and the moon were closely aligned, and sometimes their orbits drew far apart. Cruel words would burn for a time, and we would keep our distance....but for better or worse, all we ever had was each other. Eventually we learned to let one another go when we needed to be alone, and welcome each other back when the time came. The planets move in cycles, and so did we. We could no more \"divorce\" ourselves permanently from each other than we could rip the planets from their orbits. When we accepted that, accepted that we had to live with each other, and that we could either do so loving or hating one another....the choice was obvious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh.\" </span></div></div>",

It was complicated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. So. Bottom line is, you had some kinda Twilight-anne rice-lesbian vampire immortal thing going on with your teammates back in the day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi snorted. \"It was....different. By this point we had lived hundreds....thousands?....maybe millions of years. So many people and cultures had come and gone we stopped noticing them. All that mattered to us was one another. We had come so far into our power, we were practically one with our guardian worlds. Close our eyes and we could feel the wind move over the earth and the thrum of the tides and the frantic pace of the people who lived there. We exuded the essence of our worlds, but that made us distant and cold. It was addictive, taking a sailor scout as a lover. Human bodies ceased to matter....they provided their own pleasures and uses, but we could go so much deeper. We could taste the essence of whole worlds, feel the rush of every person, entwine with the lifeforce of a whole planet incarnate in this one person. We all had our suitors. Any of them could our bodies. We were only ones that touch souls together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe your right. Maybe I can't understand.\" Daria whispered, a little awe-struck. \"Except, I guess that answered what I was really asking. Compared to you, I can't matter to Ami. I'm not even a blip in her world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi's eyes shot open. \"What? That's not true at all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just said-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daria!\" Usagi sputtered. \"You don't understand!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I got that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! I mean- I mean-\" Usagi was trembling. \"Forget what I just said. That's not really how things are at all. That's not who I am. Its not who Ami is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just said-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's who we WERE.\" Usagi said, standing up as her breasts jiggled. \"Nothing is the same now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said...what? That people stopped mattering to us? That we stopped noticing our own looks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that you had uber higher plane sex. Or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. All of that? Forget all of it. We did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look. When we died we lost our memories. We had no idea we had a past. Or powers. Or anything. We had to be awakened for all that to come back to us. We spent a decade as normal girl living normal lives. And what we do remember now, its a dream. A big, beautiful, scary, bizarre dream. And everything that stopped mattering to us back then? It matters again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meaning?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Usagi was blushing and squirming. \"I...uh...get embarrassed by all of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".........\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We remember. Bits and pieces and flashes. Sometimes Ami will do something, or say something, or strike a pose....and it'll flash into my head. A really old memory of something Princess Mercury had done that reminded me. Except the context.....\" More blushing. \"Its...funny, huh? Old me was jaded, you know? She....stopped noticing things...stopped paying attention....but she was bajillion years old and I'm 21 and....heh heh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".......okay, what the hell are you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Little things are big again.\" Usagi said in a small voice. \"Things Serenity thought were boring I think are new and strange and...exciting. And terrifying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such as?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi blushed crimson. \"Like going to school. Or.....getting a job. Or...or...ki....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kissing a girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or a boy.\" Usagi said in the smallest voice possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But especially a girl, right? Cause like you said, you didn't start off liking girls. That was something 'old you' took a few hundred years to get into. Right? And now, your more or less a straight girl with her head full of memories of sex and debauchery. So it has this whole other layer of temptation and naughtiness to it. Right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-more or less.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even with your sailor gang?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More them than anyone! I....your from America, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha. Did the name give it away or the accent? Yeah. Dad was from here, mom was from Seattle. Dad gave me the hair and eyes, mom gave me the tits.\" Daria squeezed them for emphasis. Usagi stared, then ducked her head, her whole body crimson. Daria smiled. Apparently boobs were on the list of \"little things that are big again'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So....in Seattle...do they know about your photography? Or how you dress? Or...how you get girlfriends?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. Don't even know about the girlfriends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. So...imagine you ran into someone from Seattle. Someone who knew how you used to act and live. Someone who saw who you are now, but still remembered who you used to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh. Okay. Point taken. Little awkward, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little? I love them all, I really do. But I keep remembering how we used to express that love, and I know from the looks they give me that they remember too. They know every secret I have...what I fantasize about, where I want to be touched, everything! Its like....its like....its like-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like they can see you naked all the time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi blushed enormously. \"Yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....Usagi....Serenity...whoever the hell you are....I think we need to make a new memory for your collection.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daria, wait.\" Usagi said as the goth girl rose to her feet. \"I...don't want to interfere here. Okay? I'm sorry about what I did to Ami.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err. Yeah. And you. But....look. I don't want...I don't want us to live the way we did all over again. I...want us to have our own lives. Away from all this Sailor stuff. O-okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You still kissed her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry! I really am. I'll back off now. You should....be with her. This should be something special. I'm just going to be...in the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"......look. I accept your apology. And I really do believe you didn't mean to, and that you want this to be a special night for us. And believe me, I will be sure as fuck to get plenty of alone time with her. But that doesn't change the fact that you couldn't help yourself before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up. I'm not mad. I just think its more than fair to assume that if it happened once, it'll happen again. And not just you. That crazy arousal shit will affect all of you, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll...make sure Ami doesn't transform. I'll order her not to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And she'll fucking ignore you. Come on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll figure something out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Way ahead of you, moongirl. Here's the deal....you stay here tonight. You and Ami get to 'sort out' your little problem. And then you do what I want you to. For one week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....I...okay? What do you want me to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything. Everything. Your at my mercy and my imagination. Got it? And if you kiss, or fuck, or touch Ami ever again, you get another week of slave duty. And that goes for any of you scouts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daria, I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look.\" Daria said, coming closer. \"I said this before. I like being in control. And...I can't control Ami. I don't even know if I want to. So I need you to help me out here. Okay? Give me back some of that control.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".........\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't make me fucking say it twice. I need your help. Please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay....I...just one thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...uh....you can....do whatever you want to me when I'm a sailor scout. This isn't...really me. Not exactly. When I'm sailor moon, I kind of...have the body of my last life. I don't really get it myself, but....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yessssss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When its just me, Usagi, normal girl without any powers...could you....uh....I've never really....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"......your a virgin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you want to stay that way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But while your like this we can screw you as much as we want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".......right. Technically.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have any idea how fucked up this whole situation is? No, don't answer that. Sure, moongirl. I can do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-thanks. I...are you sure about this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Having a threesome with two superheroes? Fuck no. But....I'll hate myself as much for not doing it as I will for letting it happen. Just remember- your following my lead here. Ami gets most of your attention.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if I get bored, your going to be our entertainment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And in the meantime....get your slave girl butt to the kitchen and bring me the bacardis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha? Uhh...okay. Do...do you have any glass?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell will I need a glass for? Just bring the bottle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaria had a wide range of coping mechanisms ready to help her through the night.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Ah, there you two are! Good! Give me just a moment!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi and Daria gaped in the open doorway at the small corner of the studio apartment Ami had apparently claimed for herself. A small pile of books were stacked at her back, three more laying open to her left. A laptop, presumably borrowed from Daria's desk, lay open on the small nightstand to her right next to Ami's little supercomputer. In front of her was a folded over newspaper, the pages jotted over with thick blue ink where the crossword and other puzzles awaited. The disarray took up no more than a a few square feet however, the overall space could have easily fit inside an office cubicle with room to spare. Mercury sat in the middle of the little nest, her naked body shifting this way and that, diving into a book one moment only to leap onto a computer and type a few words, then to the newspaper to solve another problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She really made herself at home.\" Sailor Moon said, a bit in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaria watched Ami lithe naked form twist and bend as she shifted her focus from one task to another as quick as a humming bird. Her tiny breasts bobbed up and down with every motion, and she offered generous glimpses of her round pink bottom when her attention fell to the corner opposite from the naked blonde and brunette. Daria's mouth went dry when Ami executed a particularly difficult maneuver, apparently needing to crossreference a passage in one of the books with a search result on the computer, inspiring her to do the splits from a kneeling position while craning her upper body so as to provide her the best view of the information she was seeking. Her open, aroused sex seemed to leave quite an impression as it danced before Daria's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's okay.\" Daria said horsely. \"That's okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember to breath.\" Usagi said with a giggle as she trotted off to the kitchen in search of something inebriating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaria walked over to her love interest, still a little stunned. Picking up her camera from the kitchen table, Daria snapped a quick picture as Ami went about her work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ack!\" Ami said in surprise. \"A-are we starting??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soon. Just had to get you in your natural element.\" Daria said with a smile. \"What on earth are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry!\" Ami said, immediately acting contrite. \"I was just...waiting for you and Usagi to finish talking, and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got bored?\" Daria asked, bemused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err, yes. Sorry. Sorry. I just...wanted to keep myself occupied!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep your mind off of other things. I get it.\" Daria said, her eyes giving a meaningful glance between Ami's legs. As she had hoped, the look inspired an intense blush. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I needed to check up on some things anyway! I got in contact with the other girls. It seems they had a bit of an emergency with Rei's grandfather, and then Mammoru-san contacted everyone and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy! Easy! Sorry to make you wait for me.\" Daria said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no! I'm sorry to impose! It was rude of me to demand to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, no. None of that! Don't go all timid on me again, Ami! Where that hot, bold chick who was bossing me around before?\" Daria said with a grin, then looked at Ami sharply. \"And the next words out of your better not be another apology!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S...right.\" Ami stammered, getting to her feet. \"G-gathering information is just how I burn off stress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm kinda that way with photography.\" Daria admitted. \"But this kind of stress has a direct kind of solution. No apologies, no excuses! Just come right out and say it- 'Daria-sama, I want you to fuck me.' I promise I'll deliver every time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaria briefly wondered if something was wrong. The tint of red on Mercury's face couldn't possibly be healthy. But as she rose to her feet, a large text book clutched in both hands to hide the space between her legs, her weight shifting nervously from one foot to the other, her head bowed and turned to the side, Ami stuttered. \"Daria....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you t-to....fuck me\" Ami bluttered out the last two words all at once, her cheeks burning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Since you saved my life and all I'll give ya that one for free. Next time don't forget the 'sama' and we're golden.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe and Ami shared a little smile as Usagi came back into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Found your bottle. Dunno how you can drink this stuff, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, not all of us are fucking moon goddess princesses, ya know. We can't all afford space wine or whatever the fuck you people drank back then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMercury raised an eyebrow. \"I wondered why it was taking you so long out there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...\" Daria began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Ami.\" Usagi said. \"My fault. I started thinking about everything that's going on, and that got me thinking about the past, and before I knew it I was off in full on serenity mode.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. I see.\" Ami said, smiling. \"Well...I have a message for you. Mamoru says he's not angry with you. He actually wants you to explore this new side of yourself. He trusts you to follow your heart in all this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" Usagi said, handing the bottle over to Daria. \"Wow. I mean....I kind of thought he'd say that, but actually hearing it....wow. That's..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi looked a little dismayed as a tear trickled out of Usagi's eye. But the moon princess batted it aside. \"S'why I love him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaria resisted the urge to roll her eyes. If this guy was anything like the folks she knew back home, telling his hot girlfriend it was okay to be stripped naked in public and make out with other hot women was hardly a huge sacrifice. But whatever works, she guessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also, I've been going over the data on our auras.\" Mercury began. \"I think I approached the problem from the wrong angle. I'm actually the one who needs to perform our 'task' so we can turn back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you know what to do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. The data is still tabulating. In the future I should be able to run faster calculations, but for now we'll have to wait until morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have made some interesting discoveries in the meantime, though! As you can see, I was able to reconstitute my computer even when it was damaged by that monster. I think I can do something similar with my boots and gloves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, but I liked the 'bare foot naked' thing you had going on there...\" Usagi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah. That look is hot and all, but I'll get plenty of time to see her that way when she changes back. The gloves and boots kinda help the audience 'get' that she's a sailor scout, which is what this shoot is all about. Besides, I *like* the naked cowgirl thing you two have going there. Implies you put on just enough clothing to prove your deliberately not wearing any more.\" Daria said with authority.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....I wonder if that's what are enemies are trying to tell else.\" Ami said darkly. She glanced up from her computer when she noticed the silence. \"Sorry, did I break the mood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No more apologies. And no. Do your thing. Mind if I get it on camera? I don't think anyone has EVER shot a scout in the middle of one of her light shows.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" Ami said, eagerly. \"Stand back, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi and Daria moved back several paces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mercury Crystal Power- Make Up!\" Ami said, holding her wand aloft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA spiraling weave of blue energy and small bubbles began to emanate from the wand. The magic had the feel and flow of her element. Mercury swept the wand in a small arc over her head, letting the blue light flow over and around her like water. The cool energy carressed her gently, giving the sensation of a cleansing shower with a hint of a summer's rain. Ami welcomed the sensation. Some much of this day she wanted to wash away- sweat and blood from the battle, revelations and deceptions, the volume of humiliations she had suffered...and most of all the way she ignored an enemy's plea for mercy. In place of a real bath to soak in and read a book quietly to herself, this would do just fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere the energy flowed over her hands and feet it formed a pair of white gloves and thick azure boots. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn. i was kinda hoping you'd found a way to get the fuku back.\" Usagi said out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was amazing.\" Daria said, holding her camera close. \"That was beautiful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" Ami said, blushing profusely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what noWWWWWW!!!\" Usagi yelped. It was like a lightning bolt had slammed through her body, an intense curtain of electricity flowing through her and concentrating in the space between her legs. She and Ami fell to the floor, twin moans of need coming from both scouts. The backlash to their magic had struck again, this time even more intensely. Just when they thought they might be getting used to the constant NEED pushing down on them, the sensation multiplied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AMI! WHAT DID YOU DOOOOOO?\" Usagi wailed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I DIDN'T MEAN TO!!!\" Ami wailed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair found each other in the middle of the floor. This time there was no hope for holding back. Lips and bodies locked in a feverish and desperate dance, old dreams and new desires pressing together as tightly as their bodies. Daria stared at the animalistic display a moment, watching as Ami began grinding herself against Usagi. The photographer shivered. This was also beautiful, in a heartbreaking way. The two seemed made for each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to snap her pictures, taking a long pull of the bottle while she was at it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>So was this it? Had she lost Ami before she even had a chance with her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLost? Don't forget, the moon girl gave you every chance to kick her out and have Ami to yourself. She said she wanted you to be with Ami! She even said she'd help you! How exactly did you 'lose' Ami when your opponent isn't competing with you? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou screwed this one up yourself, Daria. Just like always.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaria trembled at her own thoughts. No. This was not going to end like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! Alright! Save some of it for the end.\" She snapped, practically leaping on the pair and lifting them to their feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daria! No! Please!\" Ami whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No ma'am.\" Daria said. \"You asked me to give you my worst. Here it is. The reason might be different, but your not the first girl I've photographed ready to go at it. And I'm treating them the same way I treat you- the sex happens when I want it to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dariaa-\" Usagi whimpered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have something to say?\" Daria said, fixing usagi with a glare that quickly turned to a pleading look. Back me up, moongirl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did ask her to do that.\" usagi said at last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi gaped at her, then huffed and covered herself. \"F-fine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Now stand just like that. At attention, covering yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhite gloves moved over soft pink skin, hiding what they could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Stop trying to play with yourselves! You can do that in a minute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls blushed profusely. This was the kind of scene she relished most in her models. Embarrassement still acute, desire exploding through their bodies. The mind was at war with itself- do you obey the urge to hide your shame and thus let your hormones rage, or do you give in to pleasure and put on an even more lewd display? It doubled the level of humiliation- the shame of being naked and the shame of temptation. And soon to follow, the shame of giving in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaria moved around the two girls, gliding expertly about the small studio space, finding the best angles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, kneel down...\" she said, her words little slured. The drink was having an impact. Fortunately, Daria could take a picture in her sleep and it would be a masterpiece. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls complied. Daria snapped a picture each of their bare butts and exposed vaginas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Let your hands do what you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls sighed with relief as gloved fingers began to tease and torment their inner folds. Relief turned to frustration in short order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These stupid gloves keep getting in the way!\" Usagi moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its hard to keep a rhythm!\" Ami agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That just means you have to try harder. Faster. More desperately.\" Daria said, each sentence dripping from her lips like honey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I take the gloves off?\" Ami asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell no. I like the gloves. And if they make you have to work harder and longer to get off, there's that much more of a show to get on film.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgonizing minutes passed. Daria was sweating. The room was spinning. Her camera work was magic. Every picture seemed better than the last. It was like her favorite part of the entire photoshoot had somehow been spaced out over the whole session! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right.\" Ami said at last, climbing to her feet. Her body was trembling. Her thighs were clenched together in a weird dance of shyness and lust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you thin-\" Daria was cut off as Ami kissed her firmly on the lips, gently prying the bottle from her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have enough pictures.\" Ami said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But-\" Daria began. Behind the camera she was in charge. In control. In Ami's kiss she was helpless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've seen your world. And I want to come back to it. When I'm just Ami again. But right now there's other things to attend to. And I can't wait for you anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DARIA-SAMA, I WANT YOU TO FUCK ME!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaria blushed crimson. \"R-right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaria set her camera to a little tripod, setting it to automatically take pictures. Then Ami was on her, somehow kissing her everywhere at once with the same wild abandon she had shown in her studies earlier. She stumbled her way to the couch, blinded by kisses and the roaming (probing!) hands of a blue haired girl. The thick leather folds of the couch enveloped her, and the girl of her dreams was above her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Usagi!\" Daria whispered. \"Red trunk! Get the big purple one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi's fingers were already inside her, working hard to bring her to the sailor scouts level. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaria sensed Usagi beside her. In her hand was a sleek rubbery dildo, two sided to accomidate more than one passenger. Daria reached out to take the instrument. She'd picked it out especially for Ami. She was eager to see how the blue haired girl reacted to the touch of the device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi snatched the device away from her at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Daria said, before being cut off by a desperate kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me lead now....\" Ami whispered, pushing the instrument deep inside her lover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHHH!\" Daria moaned. The device was big, and thick, and filled her almost completely. Ami straddled her hips, easing her body down onto the enormous phallus. Brilliant blue eyes took a moment to regard Daria's stunned and aroused face. So much was hidden in those eyes- memories of ages long past and worlds long dead and magic deeper than anyone could fathom. Sharp, discerning, piercing eyes. There were so many emotions in those eyes- a hungry lust, of course, but also affection, and a keen intelligence with a playful bent. And love....all this time Daria had thought her magical way to manipulate Ami was due to the bookish girl's relative naivete about the world. But that wasn't it at all. Those blue eyes saw straight into Daria. Read her like one of those books Ami loved so much. And whatever they saw there....they trusted. Trusted beyond all reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that of course was what was so very terrifying. That Ami, consciously or not, had seen under the armor. Seen the real Daria. The naked Daria, as that blonde might put it. Ami had seen her, and she wasn't disgusted or afraid. She would do anything for this strange goth girl. And caught up in the depthless pools of her eyes, Daria realized the most terrifying thing of all. There was something in Ami that Daria also trusted. This girl, so timid and trusting, was the one she could give up all control to. Would give up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded. Ami smiled, and flicked the small switch on the vibrator. The pair let out a simultaneous gasp as the vibrator began moving inside them. Ami began to bounce her small body up and down, the motion causing the other end of the mechanism to moving a little in and out of Daria. It was not long before they discovered a rhythm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaria said something incomprehensible, something smothering her with kisses and messaging her large breasts. She felt it building up within her, and gave voice to the rising tide. Ami adjusted her thrusts, dragging the moment out, letting them both come all at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaria lay still, the vibrator still wriggling inside her. Ami gave her a long kiss, then got up off her lap. A wide eyed Usagi was gently pulled and pushed into the vacated position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think you doing??\" Daria demanded in a whisper. \"I said she gets the attention! Follow my lead! Remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...your following Ami's lead now. And she...wants to watch us. She...likes watching us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaria glanced up at the blue haired girl. There she was, massaging her body and fingering herself. Watching them. Those damn eyes again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You....\" She said, locking eyes on Usagi. \"Tomorrow there's gonna be hell to pay. Got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi gave a small squeeking noise in replay. Then Daria lost track of events, as the blonde began thrusting as Ami had. Positions changed. Daria found her entire body working at once, hands pumping, lips kissing and sucking. For what it was worth, Usagi did try to honor their agreement, devoting as much attention to Ami as possible. Ami, however, would have no of it, basking in the attention only so long before redirecting her teammate back to Daria's direction. Eventually Daria gave up the pretense in favor of simply touching and pleasuring whoever was closest at hand, trying to give as much as she received. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay! Okay!\" She said at last. \"I can't....keep up. D-do you ever get tired? Either of you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're sailor scouts. We...can endure a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".......\" Daria sighed. \"Well, I'll just...leave you to it then. We mere mortals have to sleep at some point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually....\" Usagi said. \"We might be able to....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi touched Daria lightly on the forhead. She felt a jolt run through her body. She felt a sudden second wind coming on. And something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH MY GOD!\" She moaned as she began fingering herself desperately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Usagi!\" Ami snapped. \"That energy is cursed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just transferred a little bit! Now she can keep up with us for a few more hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaria blushed furiously as she played with herself. She locked eyes on Usagi, who mouthed an apology.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tomorrow. Hell. To. Pay.\" She whispered back. That was the last conscious thought she had that night, as her world swirled into a drunken haze of kissing and touching and passionate sighs as a catalyst to endless rounds of pleasure. She surrendered to sleep eventually, and dreamed she was a very small ship caught a vast storm brought on by the tide of the rising moon.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When Ami woke up, the dark blue of an early morning twilight was just starting to leak into the Tokyo skyline. That she was waking up at all was something of a vague surprise. Earlier that night, her whole body had seemed so alive with a thousand deliciously carnal sensations. The whole affair was dizzying rush of moans and tastes and warm bodies pressing tightly against one another in a tangled rhythmic dance. And above all the endless, desperate grinding and thrusting, a race to find that glorious peak of release, a glory so quickly eclipsed by her body's desperate need to achieve it again and again. In a way, the struggle to satisfy that bottomless hunger for pleasure was every bit as prolonged and desperate as the worst enemies Ami had faced in her time as a scout. And while their foes eventually had, Ami found the task of meeting the demands of her own body beyond her. Sometime in the night her stamina, magically agumented though it was, simply ran out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi carefully disentangled herself from the makeshift bed they had made for themselves the night before. The girls had made token efforts to get a bed ready, but had never made it beyond the floor. Eventually they settled on a hasty supply of linens and pillows tossed hapharzardly on the floor, usually aquired while still in the midst of a kiss or more intimate contact. For the best, perhaps. Ami doubted Daria's bed could comfortably house all three of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud grinding sound behind her made Ami sigh. In the few hours she had slept she managed to have a strange dream of being chased naked by a grizzly bear, that roared in her ear mere feet beind her. Now awake, Ami realized her 'roaring' had been coming from Usagi, who had a snore that could shatter glass. Ami sighed to herself. Some things never changed, no matter how many lifetimes went by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blinking blue light attracted her attention. Her heart skipped a beat when she realized her computer's analysis was complete. Finally! Ami quickly picked up her visor and began typing on her computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she saw filled her with horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n..................................................<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sky was brightening as the city began to come alive. Below sounds of traffic and the murmur of pedestrians could be heard. The air was still chill, but already the sun was warming the sky. Soon the heat would become muggy and stifling. But for now it was oddly serene. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi was enjoying none of it. High above the skyline, she stood on a powerline, a pale figure against the rising sun. Her gloved hands hugged her small naked body, hiding her nudity despite the fact no one was there to appreciate it. She had been trying to convince herself to move forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn front of her was a familiar sight. Juuban Junior High. Together with Usagi and Makoto the blue haired girl had spent a good number of her early years attending classes and facing down extradimensional threats in this school. She knew its hallways and especially its libraries all too well. Most of her memories were fond ones. At the time it had seemed only natural to apply for their student teacher program, despite her workload as a college student and the demands on her time as a sailor scout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings had not been so simple. The school was incredibly eager to accept her application. She assumed at the time that was because of her high grades and her dedication to 'reforming' low scoring students like Usagi and Minako (mistaking the time they spent together as something Ami tolerated rather than craved, little understanding the bonds Ami shared with this strange assortment of girls she associated with that quickly became a tight friendship). She realized soon after that the school was in DIRE need of competent teachers. Specifically, classroom E-13. Japense schools kept classes together most of the time. Teachers were the ones that rotated in and out through the course of the week. As sometimes happened in this system, certain classes were segragated from one another- those of the highest academic achievement were encouraged to attend higher level courses away from other students. E-13 was at the opposite end of that spectrum. Hoodlums, troublemakers, and the worst of the worst when it came to scoring. And sadly the students seemed determined to keep it that way- acting rowdy and rude during class and refusing to do assignments. Anyone assigned to teach the class at best had to constantly discipline the students and at worst could be driven from the class by the relentless pranks and shouting of the students. Most teachers found every excuse they could to avoid the class, squandering vacation time and claiming fake illness just to avoid dealing with the students. Many days the class was left entirely to their own devices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then came Ami. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had been taken aback the first day. She could hardly get a word in edgewise. The students had expected her to break quickly given her inexperience. None of them quite grasped Ami's quite but stubborn nature. The second day had been quite different. She came not as a friendly student teacher ready to help. This time she came as a hardened warrior facing a wiley enemy. In that mindset, she succeeded where other teachers had failed. Her years of detecting enemy ploys and traps as the Senshi's chief strategist translated remarkably well to dodging student pranks and finding guilty culprits. She worked out a system of rewards and punishments. Her favorite method for discipling students was for them to stand in the hallway holding two buckets full of water. Failing to do so brought harsher punishments from the principle. Despite E-13's bravado, none of them seemed eager to be expelled. It was a careful balancing act between tormenting a teacher and being caught and punished for something that could force them to leave the school. With a foe as methodical, wily, and intelligent as Ami the students had no defense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt also helped that the class was mostly male 14 year olds, and Ami was easily the youngest and cutest teacher they had ever seen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of this had made much progress in their grades, much to Ami's regret. She spent so much time fighting the students they had little opportunity to improve their understanding. She supposed that was better than the teachers who had just given up, but it was a personal lament for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of that mattered anymore, of course. As of now, she was doomed. Today, her carefully maintained stalemate was going to fall apart, her pieces all swept from the board. Today she was going to hand them all they needed to destroy her and so much more. Today, in order for her and Usagi to return to human form, she was going to power down, enter the school, and attempt to teach this class as she always did. Only today she was going to do so completely naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi could feel her entire body turning a scarlet as the sun rising behind her. The time had come....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ami sucked in a breath. Gathering up the hasty supplies she had been carrying with her, she began to move. With magical agility she quickly leapt from her hiding place and ran along the length of the power line. A small crackling beneath her boot was the only hint of danger of shock. Getting close enough to the school to make the leap, Ami clutched her cargo to her chest and gave a mighty leap over the fence of the multi story building. With a grace only a sailor scout could possess, she landed easily on the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer heart jackhammering in her chest, Ami put down her supplies and stood at attention. Thank god no one was out on the roof at this time of day! Placing her hand on her chest, Ami tried to steady herself as she mentally willed her power away. Before now there had been no response whatsoever to her command. Now, somehow sensing her intention to fulfill the task before her, she felt her magic ebbing out of her. Her gloves and boots followed her crown and jewels began to melt into a soft blue light which swirled around her a moment before spirling into her hand. Her hair blew about in an unseen wind. The energy soldified back into her wand, which she clutched in her hand. She was no longer Sailor Mercury, soldier of love and knowledge. Now she was Mizuno Ami, standing naked on a rooftop without so much as a pair of shoes on her feet. The enforced state of arousal her transform caused was gone. Unfortunately, the mystic power that prevented her from being recognized by the general populous was also gone. If she was caught now, everyone would see her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi looked at her cargo. Tied neatly with string was a thick stack of text books almost as tall as her whole body. Every conceivable subject she could think of was included. On top of the pile, Ami picked up a thick pair of reading glasses and put them on. As silly as it was, it made her feel better that she could wear SOMETHING, even if it didn't matter. With a little sigh, she picked up the large stack of books, carrying in from the bottom with both hands. It provided a crude method of shielding herself from prying eyes, although the curve of her naked body could be made out. But oh my, these books were so much heavier without her sailor powers!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plan was simple. She had waited until after the first bell, so that no one else would be likely to be in the halls. She had the key to her classroom and the door would be locked. With any luck, her students would find the locked door and assume class was canceled for today. After she entered the room she would get to the cover of her desk and hunch down in front of her computer facing the class. She would arrange things so that only her head was visible. Then she could just tell anyone who showed up that it was a free period and they could study silently or leave for the day as they desired. It'd be nerve wracking having to stay like that all day, but it would technically qualify as fulfilling the task. She wished she was allowed to wear something during the task, but that was forbidden. She had no desire to test what violating the 'rules' of the task would do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trip down was agonizing. Her classroom was on the first floor. Lugging the heavy pile of books down the stairs, conscious that at any moment someone might come up or down the stairs and find her bare little body wandering the halls made her cringe. Running into a student would be bad enough! What Ami really dreaded, however, was meeting one of her old professors! She had gotten to know most of the staff during her younger years, and many of those teachers were still here! If they saw her like this....! Death by embarrassment would be the most merciful outcome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made it to the first floor without incident. And no one was waiting outside her door! The plan would work! For the first time that morning Ami gave a little smile. Gathering the key to her classroom (tied on the end of one of the strings that held her stack of books together) Ami quickly inserted it in the lock. The worst part was struggling to turn it while balancing the book pile. Her whole body trembled at the thought of someone coming around the corner. But the door unlocked, and Ami clumsily dashed inside. She was safe! Letting out a massive sigh of relief, Ami struggled with her book pile and quickly closed the door. Now just to make it to her desk....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi froze, her book pile pressed to her chest, her back to the desks that seated her students. With a sickening, butterflies-in-the-stomach feeling Ami turned around. Seated in front of her were rows of students, almost 30 in total. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eep!\" Ami squeeled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi fled in the direction of her desk. Practically diving behind the safety of the large wooden structure, Ami dropped her stack of books and huddled in the corner a moment. Snickers and exclamations could be heard from outside. Licking her lips, Ami slowly raised her head to look at her students. All of them were smiling broadly, though none of them looked very friendly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-good morning, class!\" Ami said, giving her standard greeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, professor.\" The students said, the condescension in their reply obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I guess your wondering why-y I.....\" Ami began. \"Uhhh! Heh! Umm....I think everyone had been working hard and could use a break from all my assignments! Why don't we just dismiss class today and all of you take it easy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe students glanced at one another, then all eyes turned towards Ami. No one moved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said class dismissed! You can...\" Ami paused as one of the students, Jigo, rose to his feet and began walking towards her desk! \"J-jigo! Get back to your seat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJigo paused, a good foot from where he would have an unobstructed view of her prone naked form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prof...what is all this? What happened? Did someone do this to you??\" Jigo asked, he face a hard scowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi blinked. Looking more closely at her students, she could amusement and leers on some faces, but also looks of concern. And even the ones who seemed to be relishing seemed to pause at Jigo's question. That the first thing her students would confront her with was concern for her wellbeing....was unexpected. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh....no, Jigo. Its alright. I...\" Ami paused. \"No one attacked me or forced me to do this. I, umm.....lost a bet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....you lost a bet.\" Jigo said, mystified. \"With who.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"......my girlfriend!\" Ami squeeked, thinking it an easy fit for Daria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GIRLFRIEND?\" Jigo exclaimed, loud enough for the whole class to hear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Ami admitted, realizing too late that sharing her lesbian tryst with her class of horny teenage admirers was perhaps not the best thing to do when trapped naked behind a desk. Or ever, really.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you came into class like this under your own free will.\" Jigo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Now, would you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough.\" Jigo said with a shrug, and walked directly behind the desk. Ignoring Ami's surprised protests, Jigo dragged her out of her hiding place and into the middle of the class with surprising strength. Ami covered herself and shifted nervously in front of the eyes of her students. She was blushing profusely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you please address your class appropriately, professor?\" Jigo asked. \"You should bow to show respect for your students. Arms should be at your side.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi glowered at him, but was given only a smug smile in return. The students rose from their desks and faced her in neat rows, wide smiles on their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi's face was flushed, but she bowed as instructed. \"Good morning class.\" She said in consternation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning professor.\" They replied, returning the bow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now.\" Ami said, burning red. \"I believe I said that class was dis-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we would like a full day of education, professor.\" Jigo said. The entire class laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....I don't have a lesson planned for today.\" Ami said, hiding her nudity once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. So then you have some time to go over last night's lessons?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi was quickly growing frustrated. \"I said go home!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But today we want to learn, professor.\" Jigo said, sly as a fox. He put a hand on her exposed butt, half push and half groping. Ami squeeked again in embarrassment, but allowed herself to be guided to his desk. Ami cringed when a cellphone came out, but Jigo glared and shook his head. No pictures? What was he up to?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you explain why this answer is wrong?\" He asked, holding up a work sheet filled with math problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"......all right.\" Ami said. Forcing her to stand naked in the middle of her class was bad enough. Having a mock interest in the subjects she was teaching was just adding to her humiliation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see? I proved that the divisor was equal to 57. Isn't that the correct answer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi blinked. That...actually sounded genuine. \"No...it...your close, but you didn't factor the X coefficient correctly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmm.\" Jigo said. \"Could you show me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Of course.\" Ami said woodenly, sighing heavily in the process. \"I suppose you want me to demonstrate on the chalk board...in front of everyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

No paper.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you-JIGO!!!\" Ami screamed as Jigo grabbed her arm and guided her towards the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hush. Just hold still a minute.\" Jigo said, forcing her to sit on the desk as sat back down. The view of her naked body was up close and exquisite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you-EEP!\" Ami squeeled in surprise as something brushed up against her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't move!\" Jigo said, grabbing her thigh, holding her still and groping her at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Working the problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJigo had a thick black sharpy in his hand. He was carefully writing the equation down on her left leg. The feel of the marker against her skin reminded her of the touch of the feathers the previous day. She let out a few giggles. Memories of her previous experience made her nipples stiffen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your ticklish, huh?\" Jigo said smuggly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your doing it wro-NG!\" Ami said, her sentence ending in an exclamation as Jigo found a particularly sensitive spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? I didn't think you could see me working.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can feel it. Its easy to picture in my head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Good. Means the class can get advice and still work with the entire canvas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? i figured we would just pass you around and you could tutor us on problems we missed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But-that's...so humiliating!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kind of the point, prof. So, about this X coeffiy thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so it went. Ami found herself posed on each student's desk, her body fondled and groped for long moments as each student looked for a good place to write. At Jigo's suggestion, her breasts and inner thighs were avoided so they could be used 'for the really long equations'. Worse, the strokes from the sharpy caused her to giggle and squirm madly. That alone was humiliating enough, gyrating in front of the students with helpless fits of laughter. But something from her past ordeal seemed to have imprinted itself on her mind. The tickling was turning her on. In its own way, it was almost as bad as her cursed state of arousal. And everyone knew it. And still she was made to explain how to properly work each problem, even as each student groped and foddled her body and tickled her mercilessly. It was almost like a challenge- could she focus enough to answer their questions?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she stood in the middle of the classroom, her naked body covered in math problems. Her face was beat red. Her sex was sopping wet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-anything else?\" She said in a small, subdued voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we should take a few notes.\" Jigo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you said you didn't have any paper.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we do have cameras.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery student proceeded to photograph her. Not only once, but a multitude of times, each student photographing each individual problem on her skin. In the process, Ami's naked body was throughly recorded for posterity, each individual limb photographed hundreds of times. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-ALL RIGHT! THAT'S ENOUGH! CLASS IS ALMOST OVER!!\" Ami said at last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Your right.\" Jigo said. \"Guess we'll see you here tomorrow then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi blushed profusely, but nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool. I'm gonna enjoy watching that naked body teach me the rest of this year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E-excuse me??\" Ami stammered. \"I'm not going to be doing this all year!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? And what if we don't want you to wear clothes anymore?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....your blackmailing me?\" Ami asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thought crossed my mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, forget it!\" Ami said, crossing her arms. \"I may get fired, but I won't be bullied into doing what you want!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She right, Jigo.\" Nikki, one of the few girls in the class, spoke up. \"She's not the type to go along with this shit. Besides, who will they believe? You send those pictures out or call the principal in here, we'll just be blamed for stripping the bitch. Don't you get it? She has us by the balls. She can do her pervert thing dancing around naked in front of us, and we can't do anything about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She let us grope her pretty bad.\" Jigo noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can see how wet she is. That's her thing, idiot. She let you cause she gets off on it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do not!\" Ami protested. \"And I...I wouldn't lie about...what happened today. I'll go to the principal if you try to blackmail me, but I'll admit to what I did as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh.\" Jigo said. \"But N-chan is right over here. Won't matter. They'll find a way to blame us anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a short silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look. Let's make a deal. We do our work and take tests and shit. You teach us naked. That's fair, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! This will just distract you! Your grades are bad enough already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJigo paused, then turned to Nikki. \"Hey Nicks, how do you solve problem 83?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How the fuck would I know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We wrote it on her left thigh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Divide by 40. Duh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi blushed profusely. Jigo began asking question after question. Uniformly, each student had the right answer when the body part was identified. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? We'll ace the next test.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a fluke! You'll forget all this when you leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who here plans to study tonight? Who here's gonna go over all these equations we took and check out all these pictures? Who's gonna study the fucking shit out of every one of these pics, over and over and over, and memorize every detail?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery hand in the class went up. Ami blushed brick red. In its own way this was more mortifying than her public orgasm. Yes, more people watched her humiliation that day, but at least no one knew who she was! Now people she knew and tutored every day were going to study her naked body up close and personally like it was a textbook!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. So...if our grades go up and we do better on your tests, you have to stay naked. If we fuck up, you get to wear clothes again. Deal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what if I get caught?\" Ami said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bring something you can slip back into and keep the doors locked. Easy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't....\" Ami said, blushing profusely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have an idea. Why don't we do a little experiment. You were 20 minutes late to class, right? You know what the penalty for that is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\" Ami said, alarmed. \"I can't stand in the hallway for 20 minutes! Someone will see me for sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then stand in the class. Duh. But you have to hold the buckets of water the way you make us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".......fine.\" Ami said. She wasn't on par with Makoto, but her years of swimming had given her a strong upper body despite her bookish nature. If they thought she was going to drop one of those buckets, they were wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a rush to fill the buckets. Ami was made to stand in the middle of the room, a bucket held to either side of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and spread your legs apart.\" Jigo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do it. I'm the one dictating the punishment here, remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi glared, but obeyed. Her body was now on full display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree minutes passed and Ami was going strong! She smiled in truimph to Jigo. He snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey N-chan. Your right. She real went down there. Maybe you should help her out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Nikki and Amy said at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That big thing you keep in your purse. Go get it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you even-\" Nikki began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just do it, bitch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi watched Nikki descend to her position, her body as still as a statue. Her alarm and blush increased when she saw the large blue vibrator she was holding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't!\" She protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dictating the punishment. 15 minutes to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi's heart was racing and her mind reeling. When the vibrator was applied to her legs, her whole body started shaking like a leaf. A gasping laugh escaped her lips! Oh god, it tickled! It felt good, and it tickled so much all at once! Oh god! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki was teasing her, changing the settings, rubbing it up and down and between her legs. Ami tried to protest, but her mouth could only produce giggling incoherent moans and feeble gasps of dismay. Minutes passed, and the class gleefully watched as Ami's hips began to grind against the mechanism despite herself. Nikki smiled, and flicked the vibrator into the high setting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi's whole body spasmed. Her arms flew up, and water drenched her whole form. Nikki herself was soaked to the skin. She looked annoyed but amused nonetheless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You lost.\" Jigo noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi stood in the middle of class, shivering and wet and horny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Christ bitch. You soaked me to the skin!\" Nikki complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could always take it off, N-chan. Let it dry out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck you, Jigo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...prof. Be here next week. You can come in wearing clothes, but your gonna leave them at the door.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...you know I'm just gonna make the next test even harder, right?\" Ami demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"bring it on, prof. In the meantime, can I just say you got a great body?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-thanks.\" Ami stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed she had stumbled across the secret to motivating her students. Assuming she didn't die from embarrassment first.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>That same morning, in another school on the opposite side of Tokyo, another girl was having her own troubles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHotaru\u2019s heart was pounding as she kicked open the grate her unseen puppeteer had indicated. Sometime during the night she had fallen asleep. She had no way to know how much time had passed in that small cramped space, but she suspected several hours. The decision whether or not to leave her hiding place was an agonizing one- but the thought that morning might be close at hand finally compelled her to action. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHotaru surveyed her surroundings. She was in a small classroom, very much like the one she had sat in just the day before. She could see the pale light of early morning coming in through the windows. Oh no! She had slept through most of the night! She padded softly through the room, her breathing coming out entirely too loud for her tastes. She reached the teacher\u2019s desk, and glanced around at the empty chairs and long shadows all around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHotaru glanced down at herself and hugged her pale white skin. Even in the modest twilight her naked body stood out against the darkness. She realized that soon (perhaps no more than an hour from now!) this whole classroom would be filled with her former classmates. Hotaru\u2019s heart began to beat faster and the hint of a blush bloomed on her face. Making friends was not something that came easily to the black haired girl. As a child she had learned long ago to keep to herself. Suffering from a host of problems, both medical and supernatural, Hotaru tended to keep to herself. Her lungs had been scarred by the same fire that killed her mother, making it impossible to play with her peers. Moreover, between the entity that took up residence with her mind and the preternatural visions that were the consequence of her then untapped sailor powers caused her fellow students to shun her. Thus Hotaru tended towards the indoors, garnering a reputation as recluse and a goth thanks to her taste in dark clothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was from those beginnings that Hotaru grew so shy. Sometimes her loneliness threatened to grow into bitterness towards those who were not burdened as she was. But always those emotions turned inward. Her own body seemed to have betrayed her. Her lungs were too weak to enjoy the games others played, and the thing inside her forced her to keep her distance from everyone else- both because of their misgivings and her own fears that she might do something horrible to them. Even after the monsters had been vanguished and her rebirth healed her body, Hotaru carried that shame and fear of contact into her second life. She was, afterall, a Sailor scout. She still had secrets. <br>\r\nSecrets and enemies. It wouldn\u2019t do to let anyone get too close, or to stand out. That, at least, was how she rationalized her fear of the crowd. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was not to say that Hotaru was immune to contact. In truth, she admired many student in her school. Most of them were seniors, of course. Hotaru admired and envied her upperclassmen. In particular, she had an adoration for the sports team- she had often fantasized about being able to run like them. And all those finely muscled boys in their skimpy shorts! She had had a few other fantasies about them as well. Technically there was nothing stopping her from joining a sports team now, but that nagging voice in her head reminded her not to make an exhibition out of herself. So she avoided clubs, and simply admired the student atheletes from afar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHotaru\u2019s blush grew heavier as she contemplated all this. Her body had betrayed her again. She stood out now more than ever! Now here she was, physically older than any of her many crushes, and proportioned to be nothing short of their adolescent fantasies. What if she couldn\u2019t find a way out of the school? What if someone she knew saw her life this? The idea that they might actually take notice of her, desire her the way she had desired them\u2026..how thrilling! And yet the idea of being noticed\u2026.let alone being looked at stark naked!...was so dreadful it was almost paralyzing! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh god, don\u2019t look at me!\u201d She squeeled, imagining every chair populated with a student sitting in stunned amazement at the tall naked woman who looked so like that unassuming girl who sat in the back rows of the classrooms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHotaru gasped and whirled around. Had she really heard an answer to her plea? It was so faint it could have easily been the wind. And yet, it had sounded so real\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs someone there?\u201d She asked softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was only silence. And yet she felt the acute sensation of being watched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet a grip, Hotaru\u2026\u201d Saturn whispered to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight. Time to find her way out of here. Wasn\u2019t there supposed to be some instructions\u2026yes. On the desk. Another sticky, in the same handwriting as before. Hotaru picked up the note, squinting in the darkness at the bad handwriting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cClaim your gift. Look behind you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hairs on the back of Hotaru\u2019s neck rose sharply as she turned around. Except there was nothing there but a metal filing cabinet\u2026.and another sticky. Plucking this note from the box, Hotaru read the single word on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGlomp? GLOMP? What is that supposed to-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOMI GOD IT IS YOU!\u201d Came the scream from inside the locker. And suddenly the metal doors were bursting open and something was wrapping itself tightly around Hotaru and the world was falling out from under her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHotaru and her assailant landed on the desk. Hotaru gave a surprised scream and tried to rise, but the figure gripped her tightly. In the next instant, Hotaru had time to register many things\u2026.a naked female body pressed tightly against her own with endowments comparable to her own, a hauntingly familiar giggle playing in her ears\u2026.and curly pink hair washing over her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChi\u2026Chibiusa??\u201d Hotaru gasped, her mind reeling.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Chibiusa!\" Hotaru repeated in a gasp. \"I can't breath!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sleek form of the nubile girl disengaged itself from the crushing bear hug she had been subjecting Hotaru to. With a familiar giggle she withdrew a few feet away. Hotaru drew in a large breath, first to recover from her friends vice like grip then to steady her own nerves. She could feel her heart pounding and butterflies dancing crazily in her stomach. Chibiusa, daughter of Sailor Moon and Tuxedo Mask, a girl displaced from a future time by almost a thousand years. She had been a friend and a lifeline to Hotaru at a time when classmates shunned her and her father was the pawn of otherwordly things. Hotaru had been silently wishing to see this girl again for years. And somehow here she was....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl was obviously older than she had been before. A little taller than Usagi, evidently taking after her father in that regard. Still, the long pink hair done up in the two long Odanga pig tails was a clear homage to her predecessor. She was still young, of course, perhaps about 18. But oh my she had a beautiful body. Large breasts topped with light pink nipples, a slim waist, a cute bouncy bottom, and a shaven sex....an observation that led to the realization that her best friend was standing in front of her naked (blatantly obvious, perhaps, but something poor Hotaru was just now seeing the full implications of!).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chib- where did...how....why are you-\" Hotaru mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hotaru! Look at you! Your so much older now! How did you find me?? And...why are you naked?\" Chibiusa exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I-\" Hotaru sputtered, looking down at herself. Belatedly remembering her own predicament Hotaru blushed hard as she glanced down at herself. Covering herself up as best she could she looked at her friend, dying under her scrutiny. First by habit and later by circumstance Hotaru had been a shut in most of her life. While the years had somewhat improved her social skills, she was still terribly shy and awkward around people at the best of times. And while Chibiusa was one of the few people she could open up to, being seen naked by someone who knew her personally was not something Hotaru had allowed to happen since she was a small child. As Chibiusa glanced up and down, taking in Hotaru's nudity with an impish gleam of delight in her eyes, Hotaru found herself honestly hoping this reunion was nothing but a nightmare. A nightmare somehow far more horrific than the demonic visions Mistress Nine had subjected her to. At least then she had her dignity!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It...ummm....its a long story.\" Hotaru whispered. \"How did you get here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...huh.\" Chibiusa narrowed her eyes as if trying to see something far off. \"I don't...know. I remembered getting ready for a visit to the past. I was walking along the time corridor....and I felt this surge go through me like a bolt of lightning. The whole corridor flickered with a red light, and it all became pitched black...and I was here. I ran into the cabinet when I heard someone coming. But that turned out to be be you! Older, naked you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could...could you stop mentioning that?\" Hotaru asked meekly. \"Its embarrassing enough as it is! And besides! You act like I'm the only one naked!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that supposed-\" Chibiusa blinked then glanced down at herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud squeel of alarm erupted from her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later the doors to the classroom opened. The faculty member poked his head inside, glancing left and right. \"Swore I heard something....\" He muttered to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the metal filing cabinet two naked girls huddled together in a tangle of limbs. Chibiusa's face was inches from Hotaru. Her breasts and body were pressed tightly against the dark haired girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hotaru! I don't have any clothes on!!\" Chibiusa whimpered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really only realized that now?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are we going to do?\" Chibiusa moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll find a way out of here. Just try not to scream any more.\" Hotaru whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if someone sees us???\" Chibiusa asked, trembling, her breath hot on Hotaru's neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one will. I promise. I'll make sure of it.\" Hotaru reassured her, clamping down on her own terrors even as Chibiusa gave voice to them. \"We'll make sure you get back to Crystal Tokyo safe, I promise. You won't have any trouble looking Serenity in the eye...or be embarrassed in front of the horse prince.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....The what?\" Chibiusa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....The horse prince? Pegasus? The guy you couldn't stop talking about last time we saw each other? Literally the man...horse...prince of your dreams?\" Hotaru asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Oh, wow. I haven't thought about him in awhile!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? B-but I thought you were going out with him or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh heh. Nothing like that. I mean, yes, I kinda felt that way when we first met, but I was a little kid back then! Besides, Pegasus never really felt that way. He was just a really good friend who visited me in my dreams.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....you made it sound like more than that.\" Hotaru observed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we were kids. I guess I just got the wrong idea. Besides, I haven't seen him in years. He says he can only visit girls who still have pure dreams unclouded by adulthood. Whatever that means.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".......freaking pedophile....\" Hotaru muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing. Let's just figure out.....um....can you move your leg a little to the...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChibiusa and Hotaru spent several mortifying moments trying to get out of the closet, all the while pressing, squeezing, and touching their bodies together in a way two people seldom would outside of a bedroom, porno, or possibly demented fanfiction. Hotaru blushed as contact with Chibiusa's skin (breaking out in goosebumps thanks to the cold metal of the supply closet) was making her sensitive nipples hard. And this in turn, along with all the pent up frustration, fear, excitement and just a secret little dash of delight at a dream come true was causing a very unfortunate build up of moisture between her legs. Hotaru awkwardly snaked a hand down over her sex, shielding her intimate parts from touching her friends bare skin (or, worse yet, making contact with her own nearby slit). Even squishing her rear end up against the cardboard boxes the pair were shoved between, Hotaru had only half an inch standing between her and the most embarrassing illustration possible of just how glad she was to see her friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're stuck!\" Chibiusa whispered in a despairing wail. \"Classes will start soon! What if someone finds us like this?? They'll think we're-we're....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perverts?\" Hotaru whispered matter of factly, trying not to think about how true that seemed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right! They'll think we're getting off on hiding here! And we won't even be able to run away! What if they take pictures???  \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe they won't find us.\" Hotaru offered. Her sex clenched a little at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-so we have to spend all day like this?? Naked and scared and squeezed up against each other for hours??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah. Looks like it....\" Hotaru whispered. There had been nights, long and lonely nights, when Hotaru had fed her libido with scenarios involving her and the girl pressed so tightly to her now. None of those fantasies was as erotic (or humiliating!) as her current predicament. So it was that she found her hand, carefully and silently, extending one small digit into her aroused sex. While it only served to tease her clit rather than satisfy it, it at least gave her a way to mark the time as she waited. It promised to be a very long day indeed....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The park was a dim blue in the predawn twilight of the coming day. The silence was broken only by the steady impact of fist on wood. Makoto stood in a small clearing not far from a forested trail. A small amount of exercise equipment was scattered around her, apparently installed by the park owners with an eye towards university students seeking a bit of a work out. Makoto had come across the spot on just such an excursion. It had become a kind of secret training ground for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"1, 2, 3, 4.\" Makoto counted in her head, matching each number in her head to a strike of a fist or kick of her leg. She had lost all track of time since she had started the combo. Her movements and actions had started to meld into one, conscious thought bleeding into muscle memory as she repeated the combination of punches and kicks again and again. She had gone through her favorite karate combo attacks several times already. Feeling restless, she was determined to simply repeat the motions until her body decided she had done enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused after another series. She felt more than saw the person behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want?\" Makoto asked, breathing hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? I just came out for a run.\" Minako said. \"Don't tell me your still angry about last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not angry about anything.\" Makoto said. \"I just want to concentrate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I was just kidding about Tuxedo Mask, okay? I just thought it was funny!\" Minako said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto growled in frustration and began striding away from the tree that had become her makeshift punching bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, it isn't a big deal, you know? And come on, it isn't like I'm the first one to think that either!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that supposed to mean?\" Makoto grunted, half jogging and half storming down the track.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on. The guy constantly keeps to the shadows, watching girls in tiny skirts leaping and fighting and occasionally transforming naked in front of him. You know he's always watching cause he always happens to leap in at the last minute if things get dicey. That has 'voyeur' written all over it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop talking about Mamour-san that way.\" Makoto snapped, stopping dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako was a little taken aback. \"Look, I'm not say that's all there is, all right? We all know he's a great guy, dedicated, loving, all that stuff. But you can't tell it never crossed your mind-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just drop it, okay!\" Makoto snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....what's up with you?\" Minako demanded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up with me?! I'm not the one trying to tear Usagi's boyfriend down behind her back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tearing- what does that even mean?? What, the idea that he might be a little be less white than the snow you drive on offends you?\" Minako asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....that's 'pure as the driven snow'.\" Makoto said in exasperation. \"And what offends me, Minako-chan, is you claiming that Mamoru is more concerned with getting off on all this than he is worried about this new enemy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never said anything like that!\" Minako said. \"Of course he's worried. But once the fight is over, he probably enjoys what he sees a little too, okay? And that's a GOOD thing! It means he actually likes how Usagi looks under her clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That- of course he does! Why wouldn't-\" Makoto sputtered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, it always kind of bugged me, okay? The whole cookie cutter dream boy romance crap he had going on. It felt like a fairy tale, and not always in a good way. Once he and Usagi started dating it almost felt like he stopped being human. Just became a little too...perfect. Robotic, almost. Eternally supportive, eternally patient, kind, understanding... he was like a walking sterotype for the handsome prince! But now I have a little proof that somewhere underneath all that there's a human being with some down to earth desires!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tch. Are you sure this isn't about you wanting him to check you out? Naked, I mean?\" Makoto said snidely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wah! Hey!\" Minako snapped. \"I don't have to take that from someone dressed like that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto looked down at herself. Minako had on a pair of orange sweat pants and a white tank top. She was showing a fair amount of skin across her tight stomach. Still, that was hardly anything compared to the green sports bra that hugged tightly to Makoto's large breasts and the matching pair of green shorts wrapped around her hips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with how I look??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those shorts look like spray on paint, Makoto. And they ride up so far you can see the bottom of your butt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, why are you looking at my butt in the first place??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, am I not supposed to? I figured I was supposed to, considering that logo plastered all across the back end! Might as well say 'HEY EVERYBODY! LOOK AT MY BUTT! LOOK AT MY BUTT!' \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto felt her face going a little red. \"I'm dressed like this for comfort! Bulky clothes slow me down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'm not criticizing you. Nothing wrong with an exhibitionist streak. Hopefully it'll be a smooth transition when you end up having to fight with everything on display!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your the one looking forward to being naked! Its written all over your face!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I AM NOT!\" Minako squirmed. \"I mean...it WOULD be nice to hear a comment or two about how good Sailor V looks in and around all the talk Usagi's tits and Ami's ass, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto's jaw dropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Don't look at me like that-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you telling me your actually...jealous of them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no. Don't be silly! W-why would I get jealous of girls being stripped and humiliated-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You tell me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what? Even if I was, which I'm not, all that means is that it gives me a reason to be ready to jump into a fight and help them, and that's what Mamo-san said, right? Protect each other? Which officially means I'm better prepared to do that than you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto blanched. \"Shut up...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....that's why you came out here so early, right? Your worried about facing a new enemy, right?\" Minako took in a breath. \"However we feel about it, we have to be prepared to do it. If we hesitate people can get hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Yeah. I know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That means finding a way to break through our embarrassment and fight regardless! And if the way I get there is being a little jealous, so what? If I use that to help protect everyone, I'm doing my job!\" Minako declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay, I'm sorry.\" Makoto muttered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you should too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Find a way to prepare yourself.\" Minako said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"......Minako, what's with that look?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a waterfall further up this path, right? Isn't it traditional to meditate under a waterfall after you do your karate thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess. The water coming in from the mountains is gonna be freezing, though.\" Makoto said wearily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And isn't it also traditional to be naked when you do it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"!!! That's....that's only traditional for men! And even they cover up, err, some parts!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on, Makoto! This is perfect! You can meditate next to the path, knowing that anyone might happen by and see you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is that perfect?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because if your able to focus while doing that you can do it in battle too! You can break past your anxieties and find the heart of the eye of the crouching tiger. Or whatever you karate people do when you meditate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Are you scared?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about you? You think a little jealousy is enough to make you strip in public. Why don't you join me if your so sure its a good idea?\" Makoto shot back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....FINE! I will.\" Minako snapped. The pair power walked to the waterfall and the small pool in front of it, half to exercise and half in frustration. Upon reaching the waterfall, the pair glanced around nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" Minako asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm not going first! You'll probably try to steal my clothes and make me chase after you naked!\" Makoto snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe you'll do that to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....we go at the same time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. 1, 2, 3!\" The pair kicked off their shoes, peeled off their tops, and bent down to remove their bottoms. When they were done the pair eyed each other wearily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....let's go.\" Makoto said, moving into the pool, keeping an eye on Minako as the pair wading into the water. The waterfall was essentially liquid ice on their skin. Shivering and chattering to herself, Makoto closed her eyes and looked for her center, keeping an ear out for splashing in case Minako tried to make off with their clothes.</span></div></div>",

She drew in a breath through clenched teeth, trying to keep it steady under the frigid assault of the water. If the cold had one advantage, it helped to stifle the mental image of herself standing there naked beside a frequently used jogging trail, water cascading off her glistening body in long rivulets as it washed over her enormous breasts and generous curves. The problem was the urge to get out of the little pond was still there, be it for the sake of avoiding frostbite or for saving her modesty. Makoto was digging deep to find her center and stifle those urges, overwhelming as they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSplashing to cut left forced her to crack an eye open. Minako was standing besides her, a wriggling mess of shivering limbs and glistening wet skin. Makoto stifled a giggled. As hard as this was for her to deal with, it was clearly ten times more painful for Venus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-makoto, how long are we doing this??\" Minako asked, her voice cracking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto took a long moment to answer, both to make sure her voice was steady and to keep Minako squirming a moment or two longer. \"Oh? I usually like to mediate for an hour after a workout. Maybe longer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn truth there was no way she could stand more than a ten (maybe 15) minutes under that freezing water, and the rapidly approaching dawn would in any case cut this naked adventure short if they planned to avoid public attention. But no need to share that with the girl that had goaded her into this in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha! But....\" Minako squeeled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there a problem, Mina-chan?\" Makoto asked nonchalantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"......\" Minako drew in a breath. \"Okay! Fine! You win! I'm sorry!

But y-you w-w-went along with it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You made a good point.

I f-f-figured you would y-y-ou know...back down....\" Minako mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In other words, because you tend to be the most daring of us, you figured I'd be the first to chicken out when it comes to nudity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Except now its a test of endurance, and you know you can't beat me, so your giving up.\" Makoto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Makoto, I'm begging h-here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You made a pretty good case for training ourselves.\" Minako said evenly. \"Shouldn't we do this for the sake of the team?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Argh! F-fine. If you want to sit here and freeze to death while everyone gawks at your wet body, go ahead! I'm getting out! And if you don't hurry, I'm taking your clothes with me!\" Minako announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! What a great idea! Why don't we jog home like this?\" Makoto asked, moving towards the shore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Makoto, don't you dare!\" Minako screamed, wide eyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto turned around, smiling at her. \"Got you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako glowered at her, then stomped past her toward the shoreline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, I do accept your apology. And yeah, I'm sorry for being so serious about the whole voyeur thing. It just feels...weird thinking about Tuxedo Mask that way.\" Makoto chatted as she exited the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako said nothing, looking down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto sighed. \"Okay, fine. Maybe it is a *little* exciting...a little...thinking that Mamoru-san might really look at me *in that way*. He is a lot like my old boyfriend. Older, more mature, really cool and kind...but that's kind of the problem, I guess. My sempai broke up with me because he met someone else. And Mamoru and Usagi are just so perfect together! The idea that someone else might get involved and steal Mamoru away....or maybe steal Usagi, in this case....its too awful to think about. And that it might be one of us....that it might even be me...I don't know if I could live with myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"......\" Minako continued to stare at the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Minako. Say something.\" Makoto said at last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Makoto....where are our clothes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?\" Makoto asked, looking around wildly. Sure enough, nothing remained of their belongings except a pair of running shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They aren't....\" Makoto trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT DID YOU DO??\" Both scouts said at the same time. \"ME? I WAS STANDING AT THE WATERFALL THE WHOLE TIME! WHAT DID *YOU* DO? STOP REPEATING ME!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....could someone else have...\" Minako asked, shivering and miserable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...how could they have managed to without us seeing??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....while we were arguing about getting out? I wasn't watching the trail. Were you?\" Minako asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto shook her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-what are we going to do???\" Minako asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....maybe if we hurry we can get back before everyone wakes up?\" Makoto suggested feebly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or maybe we get there just as everyone IS awake and sees us!\" Minako whimpered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't that the risk you wanted to take in the first place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not when everyone in the dorm knows our names! At least if I transformed people wouldn't recognize ME when they see me naked! Right now everyone would see me and know who I am!!!\" Minako wailed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't just stand here arguing about it! We have to try!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....but...how do we get inside our rooms? My key was in my pants pocket.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....mine too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto and Minako stared at each other, wet and naked and shivering as the early morning sunlight began to rise. It promised to be a long day indeed.</span></div></div>",

Hunched over, the pair were hidden from sight to anyone walking along the trail. Of course, anyone behind them would have an amazing view of their athletic rear ends. But what were the odds of that happening?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We just have to go for it.\" Minako said at last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to streak all the way to the campus? They'll see us for sure!\" Makoto said, aghast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, someone will find us here eventually! And the longer we wait the brighter it gets and the more people will be out!\" Minako countered in a nervous voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, then maybe one of us should go and bring something back for the other one!\" Makoto snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah? And who should that be?\" Minako asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Obviously it....\" Makoto trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly! Whoever stays here has to trust the one who goes off streaking to come back for her. So, want me to go?\" Minako asked sweetly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell no! You'll just pull a prank the second you got dressed!\" Makoto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....your right. I probably would.\" Minako said with a nervous giggle. \"And while your not the type to pull pranks, if you had to streak all the way home and someone sees you it would probably really embarrass you, and then you'd want to get back at someone, and in your anger you might fix on the sweet and innocent girl who just made a playful suggestion to you that sort of got completely out of hand through no fault of hers, and then-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get it. I get it.\" Makoto said in exasperation. \"So your suggesting we both streak through campus to our dorms and...then what? We don't have our room keys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll just have to....ask the front desk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's- EEEEEK!\" Makoto and Minako shrieked as two slender hands pinched their well toned butt cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire situation melted into utter chaos as both sailor scouts leapt out of their hiding place and ran a dozen steps toward the road. Realization hit them, and they did a 180 degree turn, looking every which way for spectators. Dancing in embarrassed shock, the pair finally covered their choicest bits and turned to confront their mysterious groper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My my. Your glutes are as firm as ever.\" Came a familiar voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E-elsa-san??\" Both girls said in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElsa Gray was a semi-famous athlete a few years older than the Senshi. They had met her while staking out various high schools a few years back. She had been a target of the Death Busters at the time. With the help of the outer scouts they saved her life and returned her pure heart. At the time they met her the older woman had taken the opportunity of Makoto and Minako's proximity to rather vigourously grope their butts. At the time they had laughed it off as her being a little eccentric. Seeing the tall tanned girl with short pink hair emerging from the shadows, now they weren't so sure. Their suspicions would likely be higher still if either knew Elsa had a history with Haruka and Michiru. Indeed, the athlete had obsessed over Haruka for years as the 'one runner she could never catch'. It was through Elsa that Haruka and Michiru first met. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing here???\" Makoto asked, stunned, mentally standing on tip toe and pressed her legs together nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, didn't you know? I teach at the school. I use this trail every morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. OH. I had no idea!\" Makoto said sheepishly. \"So..I guess your wondering....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Judging by what I saw earlier, you were meditating under the waterfall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah ha! You...heheh...saw that....\" Minako said, plastered a forced grin on her face and wincing at the glare she knew Makoto was giving her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes. Very bold. Standing right beside the road where everyone could see. I was impressed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, you were?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! I admire anyone that dedicated to their craft. And the view allowed me to admire your bodies even more. You've been keeping yourselves fit since we saw each other last.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls blushed intensely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh....yes! Yes we have! Umm...Elsa-san, could you do us a favor....\" Makoto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want me to retrieve some clothes for you?\" Elsa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Exactly!\" Minako said, relief flooding over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid that puts me in a difficult position, Makoto-san.\" Elsa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha? But why??\" Makoto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I'm the one that took them to begin with.\" Elsa smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair of naked girls looked at her in stunned silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElsa smiled. \"How about this? Its been a few years since I saw you last. I assume you've been improving your running speed. Why don't we see how fast you are? Catch me and I'll return your clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...WE CAN'T RACE YOU NAKED!!\" Minako exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were planning to streak a moment ago.\" Elsa said. \"This way all you have to do is catch me. If your fast enough it'll be over very soon. Plus you have a huge advantage over me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, look at you. Here I am weighed down by these clothes, while you have no extra weight to worry about. I'm already acting under a handicap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls stared at her, stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better decide quickly! I know neither of you will hold anything back. Because if you don't catch me fast, we'll hit a street corner and then EVERYONE will get to appreciate your bodies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Elsa turned on her heels and sped down the trail. Makoto and Minako looked at each other in alarm, blushing profusely. With twin squeels of dismay they began to follow in her wake, calling out her name and begging her to stop. They could feel their breasts bounce with every motion and the wind rushing past their overly exposed bodies. Somewhere in the back of their minds, they both hoped this was just a nightmare induced by too much excessive nudity the night before. They would be disappointed on that score.</span></div></div>",

Reaching out her hand the very tips of her fingers touched Elsa's tank top....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" Minako cried, grabbing Makoto's foot and nearly causing the two of them to fall headfirst onto the trail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Makoto squeeled. \"Minako, what did you do??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hush!\" Minako said, pulling the brown haired girls arm behind a tree. The blue eyed blond peeked around the tree, watching Elsa go with narrowed eyes like she was pantomiming a spy from a movie tailing a foreign target. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlbeit, a spy who happened to be naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Minako, have you lost your mind?? She's getting away!\" Makoto hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhhhhhh!\" Minako said, her face so serious it was almost comical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What....what is it?\" Makoto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got a bad feeling about all this!\" Minako said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Being butt naked out in public with our clothes held hostage? YEAH! ME TOO!!\" Makoto screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said be quiet!\" Minako said, looking around as if someone might be listening. \"Not about that. I mean...I'm getting a 'sailor business' bad feeling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....we're dealing with a monster. I'm sure of it!\" Minako declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....what the hell makes you think that?\" Makoto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako's face turned upward into a ridiculous grin, and she let out a brief chortle of laughter. Then she put a hand on her hip and made a V sign with the other, winking at Makoto as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woman's intuition.\" She declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"......your kidding.\" Makoto said, her hands twitching involuntarily as she pictured them around her friend's throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't give me that look! Remember who your dealing with here! I'm not just any woman! I'm Sailor V! Champion of Love, crowned princess of Venus! My patron world is the embodiment of all womanhood! My intuition is the best there is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakoto crossed her arms and continued to glare. \"Minako, no offense, but your the only girl I know who rivals Usagi as biggest ditz on the planet. Your intuition sucks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you still doubt me? Then how about this? I was the first girl to awaken as a sailor scout, way before Usagi and maybe even before the outer scouts. I've got more experience in taking down baddies than anyone on this team except Pluto, and she's spent most of her life standing around guarding the Time Gate. And I did it without Ami's fancy computer or Rei's weird psychic powers! So if anyone around here is gonna know how to root out monsters it will be none other than the Pretty Eyed Sailor Soldier Codenamed Sailor V!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring her spiel, Minako was posing and gesturing with her hands and body with every bit as much gusto as she ever did when fighting an enemy. Makoto sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so what do you think is going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its obvious, isn't it? Something is wrong with Elsa-san!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, she was acting really freakish. But how do you know-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One! Elsa never acted that perverted when we first met her! Yes, she did cop a feel on us, but otherwise she acted very nice and polite! Two! I can totally see Elsa....uh, swinging the same way as Haruka and Michiru, but I can't believe either of them would associate with someone who was that brazen and gross. The way Elsa was acting seemed more like a parody of herself, like everything EXCEPT her perverted side was dialed way down or removed. And three....you almost caught her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh.....yeah, so?\" Makoto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've seen her run before. Even with all the training we've done, she's way too fast for us. This is her lifelong focus, after all. So either she has just let herself fall apart completely, in which case I would expect to see her that thin and well muscled, or something is messing with her in a way that is impeding her abilities.\" Minako said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh....Okay. That's....actually pretty well thought out.\" Makoto said, scratching her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako closed her eyes and smiled, exceedingly pleased with herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do we do about it?\" Makoto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What we always do. We keep an eye on her, try to figure out who and what is screwing with her, figure out its plans, and then get everyone else together and moon dust it!\" Minako said, punching her fist into her hand with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.....so why did you stop me?\" Makoto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before, I almost caught her, then you stopped me to tell me on this. Are we losing the race to keep an eye on her?\" Makoto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh....uhhh....actually I hadn't gotten that far yet. I...uhh...just wanted to let you know about all of that.\" Minako said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....you realize you just cost us both our chance to put some clothes back on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako blinked, looked down at herself, and turned a bright red as her hands danced over her body trying to cover herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Minako?\" Makoto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I..! I forgot I was naked!\" Minako said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"..........\" Makoto walked over to Minako and petted her on the head. \"This is good. You made such a good deduction before I was becoming afraid something evil might be influencing you. But fortunately your as big a ditz as you've always been after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinako muttered something under her breath, hands still curled around her body providing what pathetic cover they could for her large heaving breasts and shaven sex, her tongue sticking out at Makoto as the only rejoinder she could offer.</span></div></div>",

I remember.\" Minako said, following behind. \"I kinda hoped you wouldn't though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey found Elsa pacing back and forth at a side entrance to their school's athletic center. She looked up and smiled when the pair arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good. I was getting worried the police had stopped you or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. Just got a little lost.\" Makoto muttered, glaring at Minako, who gave her another raspberry in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, whatever. I was going to consider giving you back your clothes if held your own....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here it comes.\" Makoto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But this is really disappointing. Disappointing and sad. It makes me think all you've done is waste those years since I saw you last. I think you need some motivation to reach your potential.\" Elsa Gray said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Minako asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean I'm going to start training you both myself. By the time we're done here you two will be faster than anyone else on this campus. Except me, of course.\" Elsa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".......\" Both girls stayed silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then you can have your clothes back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell do you mean. You can't turn someone into a runner in one day, and we sure as hell aren't going to stay naked longer than that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh heh! Aren't you, though?\" Elsa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....If someone finds us like this, all three of us will get in trouble.\" Makoto noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortunately, I've thought ahead here....\" Elsa said, producing two forms from her backpack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....what the hell are these?\" Makoto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Applications to join our track and field program.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay....why are you giving them to us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because your our new pledges, of course! Welcome to your first day of hazing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls looked at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, you don't have to sign. I can just go to the principal and show him this video of you two stripping off all your clothes and posing in front of that waterfall for everyone to see.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you think we're going to get blackmailed into-\" Minako began, but Makot held up her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We want to stay close to her, remember? This is our way in.\" Makoto whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we'll be naked!\" Minako said, biting her lip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe. Maybe not.\" Makoto said, turning back to Elsa. \"Even if we sign those things, you can't make us be naked 24-7. Not even an american sorority could get away with that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone needs to take a closer look at her student handbook!\" Elsa declared. \"Student organizations and extra-curricular events are permitted to have nudity if it furthers the goals of the school and organization and provides an educational outlet to members in a venue appropriate to the activity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I.....that....why would anyone put that in a handbook?\" Makoto said in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm assuming they intended it to apply for organizations like the portrait club and photography guild. But all that matters here is that it is really badly worded and easily taken advantage of by those who are clever enough. I know one girl who has put her subjects through all kinds of humiliating ordeals while they were naked and gotten praised for it from her teachers.\" Elsa said as somewhere not so far away Daria found herself sneezing and did not know why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But even you have to admit athletics is stretching the definition of 'appropriate venue'. There's no way we'd get away with it.\" Makoto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, now. Let your new team captain worry over the details. All you need to do is sign those forms and follow me. Or don't and stay out here butt naked while the principal calls the cops.\" Elsa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrestfallen, both girls signed the forms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful. Now follow me. I want to introduce you to the rest of your team!\" Elsa Gray said, moving inside with a skip in her step. Both girls followed along, walking on their tip toes and covering their bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. Its dark in here.\" Minako whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Had some kind of power outage this morning. No biggie.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair skittered down the halls, sticking close behind the figure of Elsa who showed no sign of urgency in getting to their destination. Finally they entered a big locker room, the pair trembling with anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay team! Get out here! We have some new members to introduce!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe eyes of both girls widened as almost 50 boys began to assemble in the hall, all of them fully dressed in exercise clothes and most of them a few grades above the two girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys.\" Minako whimpered. \"Why did it have to be guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said you were coaching this team!\" Makoto squeeled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And? I am. We don't separate our athletes into boys and girls. We only have one team. It just so happens that the only girl until you two came along was me. Anyone, everyone! This is Makoto and Minako! They'll be joining us as junior runners. Girls, why don't you show your appreciation to our teammates here for letting you join on such short notice. Stop covering yourselves up and put your hands behind your head. Its not like you'll have time to hide any of it when your out there on the field.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men let out a collective 'WOW' as the two most athletic and big breasted girls of the Sailor Senshi puts themselves entirely on display.</span></div></div>",

We're going to have to go to class soon!\" Makoto stammered, beyond embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no worries. I took care of that! You can make up all that tomorrow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, but-\" Minako began as the two were land by the arm out into the bright sunlight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay girls, your with me. Do what I do.\" Elsa sang as she bent down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls paled as they were made to face away from their audience and bend at the knee. Their butts were on full display. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Now let's try some leg stretches.\" Elsa said as she made her legs into a wide V and stretched her arms out to either side. Both girls followed her mechanically, burning with shame to be sitting in front of their male student body naked with their legs wide open and naked sex on complete display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, we'll do a few more stretches and then move onto jumping jacks and aerobics. Makoto and Minako will be my partners today. Every else follow along with their workout routines.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please just let this be a dream.\" Makoto whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your the one who insisted we go through with this!\" Minako hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder how the others are doing. They should be back to normal by now, right?\" Makoto whispered back while assuming another stretch that put her body on display in another degrading pose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Man, that sounds so great right now. I'll bet Usagi-chan and Ami-chan are decked out head to toe in clothes. They're probably so wrapped up in fabric they look like mummies! Not one inch of bare skin in sight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow, that sounds like heaven! They better be enjoying every minute of it, too! At least some of us can walk the halls with our heads held high and not be ashamed of all the skin they have on display!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n____________________________________________________________________________ _______________________<br>\r\nRei's head was swimming. This had to be a dream, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nooooo! I can't do this! This is way too embarrassing!!\" Usagi wailed, blushing in shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you look adorable!\" Daria said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't walk around like this! What if we run into someone we know?? How would we ever even explain this??\" Usagi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"School project, obviously. Or maybe that you took up stripping.\" Daria laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I think most strippers would be telling us to have a little modesty...\" Ami said in a small voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You too Ami? I go to all the trouble to provide you two with something to wear from my own closet, clothes I bought with my own money no less, and all you do is complain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! I'm not trying to be mean, here! I'm grateful for the thought, really, I just....\" Usagi began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What Usagi means is that....umm....I love swimming almost as much as studying. I don't want to be unhealthy even with all my studying, so I try to swim every day. I have a whole range of swim suits. I even have the tiny two piece ones you have to tie on with little strings. And Daria....I've never exposed this much skin in public before!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on, you two! Sure you have! Like yesterday, for instance!\" Daria said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were naked yesterday!\" Usagi wailed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. And today your not. See how I've already improved your situation? Besides, don't you find it nostalgic?\" Daria asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm....excuse me.....\" Rei said, glancing at the three girls who had just walked down the hallway of her college campus. \"I.....what the hell is going on? Usagi? Ami? What are you wearing??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I know you?\" Daria asked, annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Rei.\" Usagi said in a small voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Usagi-chan....why are you wearing a sailor fuku? And what did you do with the rest of it?\" Rei blurted out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi and Usagi were dressed in sailor suits that roughly approximated their old Sailor fukus in color and design. The differences was that the upper portion of the fuku was cut short in the middle and tied in the front, exposing the hips and stomach and putting more cleavage on display than Rei thought possible for a girl of Ami's cup size. The skirt looked normal enough, but Rei was quite positive she had seen a hint of naked cheeks as the girls walked, implying a lack of underwear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've loaned them some of my own clothes.\" Daria said with a shrug, decked out in her typical 'biker girl' look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who....just who the hell are you?\" Rei snapped. \"Look, I realize you have no way of knowing this, but these two girls have just been through a...really bad experience! So I don't know if this is some kind of weird bet or stupid prank or whatever but this isn't-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rei, its okay! We...uh...kind of agreed to do what she told us to.\" Usagi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Why would you do that?\" Rei asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because they owe me one. Or rather, blondie over there owes me one, and Ami's a sweet girl who decided to show some support and take the same abuse. And at first I was against it especially after what happened to her at her teaching job this morning....but damn I can't complain how it turned out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi blushed profusely, squirming under the compliment and her exposure. Usagi also blushed and nodded her agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get me wrong. I'm adoring every minute of Usagi bouncing around in that tiny top and trying not to bounce out completely. But Ami has such a shy little nerd thing going on that gets me every time.\" Daria snaked an arm along Ami's exposed stomach, pulling the blushing girl close. Their lips met after a moment of hesitation on Ami's part, her face blushing from embarrassment and pleasure at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But like I said, Usagi isn't bad. A hot girl squirming around in embarrassment at the state of her own helplessly naked hotness gets me every time, and moon slut is as hot as they come. She just has to remember who the boss is....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi gave a small eep and began backing away from the leather clad girl. Daria cracked her neck and walked with practiced casualty towards the half naked girl now pressed up against the locker. Rei stared wide eyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you don't like your new clothes?\" Daria asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I mean...they're really nice, but they're a little....exposed.\" Usagi mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, okay. You mean you want to like them but they reveal too much skin, right?\" Daria asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Exactly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can help with that!\" Daria said, producing a pair of scissors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wait! D-don't-\" Usagi chirped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't run, little bunny. I don't want to have to hike up your skirt and spank that big ass of yours in front of your friends.\" Daria said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsagi made a noise that wanted very much to be a word from an actual human language, but failed half-way through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, what better way to help you cherish every inch of covering you get than to take a few away? Next time I'll bet you adore your outfit no matter how big a naked moon slut bunny it makes you look like.\" Daria casually cut several inches off the skirt, then undid the top to reveal Usagi's full naked breasts complete with big pink fully erect nipples. Daria snipped several inches off the top as well, tying it back in playing after taking a few minutes to play with Usagi's breasts while blushing girl closed her eyes and tried not to appear so completely turned on. The new additions (or lack thereof) left her breasts bulging out from the top and bottom, the thin strip of fabric holding her shirt together barely leaving them unexposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-daria....\" Usagi whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, princess?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My...skirt....everyone can see my....butt...and....my....my....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax.\" Daria said. Grabbing the waste band on Usagi's skirt, Daria playfully pulled one side then the other down until the bald top of Usagi's crotch with exposed. Half and inch lower and Usagi's currently erect clit would be on display to everyone. Usagi closed her eyes and endured this latest humiliation, trying not to picture the looks she was going to get in class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ami, I know you want me to expose you like I am Usagi, but we'll have to figure something else out. Your way too thin for the same treatment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...do you...DARIA!!\" Ami screamed as Daria casually grabbed her skirt's wasteband and pulled it straight off her hips. Ami's hands dropped between her legs and she stood there blushing a long moment before bending down and grabbing her skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? Usagi's butt is so big and fat its easy to inch her skirt down a little at a time. Yours just slides right off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daria, we can't....\" Usagi began, than shrank back against the lockers as Daria raised her scissors and slowly began opening and closing them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You learn fast.\" Daria said. \"I like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"......I think I liked you better when you were intimidated by us!\" Usagi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Snerk. The way those titties stood up at attention to greet me, Usako, I think you like me just fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei stared at the situation, her mouth trying to form words. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Now I get it.\" Rei said, sliding her backpack off her shoulders and clenching her fist, her eyes growing cold and steely as she subtly adjusted her stance into something entirely devoid of the carefree posture of a 21 year old college freshman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaria muttered something under her breath and turned around. She'd slowly come to terms with the fact that Usagi's complete and utter naivete about relationships (at least about the kinky parts; even Daria had to admit the girl was spookily astute about the emotional end despite her seeming immaturity). But apparently no one in Ami's little circle of friends could take a hint. Was she gonna have to write \"Fuck off\" on this girl's forehead or something. Christ, couldn't she have five minutes to relish the moment? She had no classes with either Ami-cha....with her girlfriend (don't blush, don't blush, this is normal, you aren't twelve, big girls don't blush just cause they have a GF, stop it!) or the pet bunny (basically the same thing; if Ami owned a pet cat Daria would have had to accept its existence, put up with its demands for attention, and eventually get to know it and appreciate how cute it was- not to mention disciplining and training her to show the little one who the master was....Daria really had to dig up that collar and leash number she'd left lying around somewhere) until noon! This would be the one chance she had to watch them squirm! Sure, the stories she would make them tell her to relive the experience would be great, but nothing beats seeing the humiliation in real time....oh right, the black haired chick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you mind? Its almost time for class and we're kinda in the middle of something. Can't you talk to them at lunch?\" Daria snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rei...\" Usagi said, unsteadily. \"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been feeling a strange essence in this place all morning. I should have known it would be something like this.\" Rei said, her voice pure steel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like...what?\" Ami asked, visibly swallowing her embarrassment to offer a serious look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DROP THE CHARADE!\" Rei said, startling all three girls. \"I DON'T KNOW IF YOUR SOME KIND OF MONSTER THAT LOOKS HUMAN OR SOME DEMON POSSESSING THIS GIRL, BUT YOU WON'T GET AWAY WITH IT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaria, Ami, and Usagi stared in dumb shock as pointed an accusing finger at Daria. \"I don't know what kind of hold you have over these two girls, but it ends now! I AM REI HINO, SHRINE PRIESTESS AND FLAME SEER OF THE HIKAWA SHRINE! I will not stand by and let two pure hearted maidens be turned into shameless sluts for the amusement of some loathsome monster!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY!\" Usagi and Ami said at once. Daria laughed. \"Pure hearted? They're shy and all, but given some of the things we did last....hey. The hell do you mean demon? ARE YOU TALKING TO ME?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you dare deny it, monster! You may try to look human, but our minds are completely alien to you! Look at you! Its obvious no human being, let alone a college student on a conservative university campus, would ever walk out in public dressed like...like some rejected pornstar from a rolling stone fetish video that career was just too dignified and prudish for her day to day needs. And on top of that, you want to convince me that my two best friends, either of whom practically go into cardiac arrest just from saying the word 'sex' are going to parade themselves around half-naked as if they had lost any concept of self-respect or dignity? Please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three girls turned pure crimson under the tirade Rei was giving them. Daria glanced down at the tiny tub top that barely contained her massive breasts and the leather miniskirt that hardly hid her bottom (as usual, no underwear graced her form). She blushed brightly and zipped up her jacket. Her choice in attire had always come down to a kind of dare to herself- 'will you let yourself be the mediocre little camera nerd you were back home that never made any friends or dated anyone, or will you throw her shyness (and dignity, to be fair) out the window and embrace the naughty little impulses that had filled up your brain for 20 plus years?'. That being said, she mostly made it through her day by pretending she wasn't half naked and on display to her classmates. Having it pointed out was like a bucket of ice water to the face, and her normal instincts took over. Her mind was forced to consider directly what she was putting herself through, and she reacted precisely as her two 'playmates' did, with a feeling of overwhelming shame and embarrassment as her all but naked body was paraded in front of a sea of phantom faces and mocking leers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm ending this now! AKURYO TAISAN!!\" Rei screamed, producing from her sleeve a simple piece of paper with a series of japanese characters artistically written in thick black ink on either side. This was an ofuda scroll, a simple charm used in Japanese shintoism to ward off demons and restless spirits or to aid in exorcism. As Rei flourished the small paper as if it were a weapon, a small flicker of flame danced on the edge of the charm. The lax paper sprang erect as Rei made a silent prayer to the Kami and willed her own internal energies into the charm. Fearing for the safety of her friends, Rei forced the magical essence of Mars coursing through her soul into the tiny scroll, putting everything she had into the attack. Like lightning she sprang forward, pressing the piece of paper against Daria's forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei took a step back, ready to dodge an attack or confront whatever possessing entity was evicted from Daria's body. Instead Daria stared at her, stunned, blushing, and getting angrier by the second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't try to fight it! That charm is made specifically to force out, paralyze, and agonize inhuman monsters! There's no way you can resist it and remain hidden!\" Rei snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaria opened her mouth, ready to deliver the most vicious telling off of her young life, perhaps also noting that since she was a normal human the stupid charm clearly wasn't having any effect on her....except...something was happening...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaria let out a small moan and backed up against the lockers. Her knees felt wobbly and her skin on fire. She thrust her chest out, her hips swaying suggestively. \"Not again.\" She whimpered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRei raised an eyebrow. Usagi looked on, clearly alarmed. Ami stared, and then groaned softly to herself, pinching her nose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rei....she a normal human.\" She said at last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No! I mean...she's....reacting to them, see!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"......Rei....you use your own lifeforce in your exorcisms, right?\" Ami asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! It adds my psychic talents to the power of the charm! Nothing can stand against it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rei....your lifeforce...your soul...that all connects back to your power as a sailor scout. Even as a normal human, your psychic energy is roiling with the power of Mars.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So? So your charms are channeling that corrupted energy that strips us naked when we transform and makes us aroused! The 'affect' your having on her is to make her horny!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" Rei said. \"I...huh....so....she isn't the demon?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OF COURSE NOT!\" Daria squeeled. \"Get this thing off me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So....it must be one of you!\" Rei screamed, brandishing two more charms and pressing them against the foreheads of her teammates faster than either could react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO ONE'S POSSESSED!\" Usagi squeeled, as she too was overcome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" Rei paused. \"So....your dressing like that on your own?....Are you crazy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LOOK WHO'S TALKING!!\" Daria screamed back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem.\" A soft voice said from behind the assembled girls. Rei turned around to find...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
